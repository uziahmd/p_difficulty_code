    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by performing certain swaps. Let me think through the problem carefully.\n\nThe allowed swaps are between adjacent '0's and '1's, and between adjacent '1's and '2's. But not between '0's and '2's directly. So, what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the implications. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2. So, perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed directly. Wait, but maybe through 1s? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, maybe we can move them around. Let me think.\n\nFor example, suppose I have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s. Let's say \"0 1 2\". Can I swap them? Well, the 0 can be moved to the right by swapping with the 1 (since they are adjacent). Then the 1 can be swapped with the 2. So, the 0 can be moved past the 1 and then the 1 can be moved past the 2. So, in that case, the 0 can end up after the 2? Wait, no. Because if you have 0 and 1, you can swap them. So, in the sequence 0 1 2, you can first swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. But the 0 and 2 are not adjacent. However, the 0 can be swapped with the 1 (if there's a 1 next to it). Wait, but in this case, after getting 1 0 2, the 0 can be moved to the right if there's a 1 next to it. But in this case, the 0 is next to the 2, but since they are not 0 and 1 or 1 and 2, you can't swap. So the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the 0 can be moved to the right as long as there's a 1 in between. But once there's a 2, you can't move past it. So, the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed if there's no 1s between them. Wait, but maybe there's a way to arrange the 1s in between?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s can be moved to the left of 1s, and 1s can be moved to the left of 2s. So, the overall idea is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s cannot be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Wait, that's an important point. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't be swapped. So in the original string, any 0 that comes before a 2 can't be moved past it. So, the final string must have all the 0s that were originally before any 2s still before them. Similarly, any 2 that was originally before a 0 can't be moved past it. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, that seems crucial. Let me think again. Suppose we have a 0 and a 2 that are not adjacent. For example, 0 1 2. We can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But if there's another 1 next to the 0, perhaps we can move the 0 further. But in this case, the 0 is between 1 and 2. If there's a 1 after the 2, maybe not. So, the conclusion is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s cannot be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same. Because if a 0 is before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 will still be before that 2. Similarly, if a 2 is before a 0, then in the final string, that 2 will be before that 0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and then placing the 1s in between in such a way that the entire string is lex smallest.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- The positions of 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed in their relative order. So, the final string will have the same number of 0s and 2s as the original, and their relative order is preserved.\n\n- The 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, consider the original string as a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So, the 1s can be arranged in any order between them, but since we can swap 1s with each other (since they can be swapped via 0s and 2s?), wait, no. Wait, the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or between 1 and 2. So, two 1s can be swapped if they are adjacent. Because for example, two 1s can be swapped by swapping them with each other. Wait, no. The problem says that you can swap adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent 1 and 2. So, two 1s can't be swapped directly. But if there are two 1s adjacent, you can't swap them. Wait, no. Because the problem says you can swap any two adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent 1 and 2. So, if two 1s are adjacent, you can't perform any swap on them. So, the 1s can't be rearranged among themselves. So, the original order of 1s is fixed? Or can they be rearranged?\n\nWait, no. Because suppose you have two 1s next to each other. You can't swap them. But if there's a 0 and a 1 next to each other, you can swap them. But how can that help with moving 1s around?\n\nWait, let's take an example: suppose the string is \"11\". Since they are adjacent, but they are both 1s, you can't swap them. So, their order remains the same. So, the original order of 1s is fixed. But what if there's a 0 and a 1 in between?\n\nWait, let's take a string like \"101\". The 1s are at positions 0 and 2, and the 0 is in between. Now, can we swap the first 1 and the 0? Yes. So, we can turn it into \"011\", which moves the first 1 to the right. But then, the two 1s are adjacent. But since they can't be swapped, their order is fixed. So, the original 1s can be moved around if there are 0s or 2s in between. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the 1s can be moved around, but their relative positions may not be fixed. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's say I have a 1 followed by a 0. Then, I can swap them. So, the 0 moves to the left. Suppose I have a 1 followed by a 0 followed by a 1. Then, I can swap the first 1 and 0, getting 0 1 1. Then, the 0 can't be swapped with the second 1 (since they are 0 and 1, adjacent). So, I can swap them again. So, the 0 can be moved to the left of the first 1, but the two 1s are now adjacent. But in that case, the original 1s can be moved around.\n\nBut in this case, the original order of 1s is not fixed. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s can be rearranged in any order as long as their relative positions with the 0s and 2s are maintained. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of grouping the characters. Since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s can't be moved past 2s. So, the order of 0s and 2s is fixed. But the 1s can be moved freely between 0s and 2s, but also between other 1s?\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be rearranged in any way between the 0s and 2s. For example, suppose we have a 0, followed by some 1s, followed by some 2s. Then, the 1s can be arranged in any order between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2, perhaps the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. For example, imagine that the 1s can be moved anywhere between the 0s and 2s. But their order relative to each other may not be fixed. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say the original string is \"121\". So, the first character is 1, then 2, then 1. How can we rearrange this? Since the 1 and 2 are adjacent, we can swap them to get \"211\". Then, the 2 is followed by two 1s. But the 2 can't be moved past the 1s. So, the 2 can't be moved further left. But the 1s can be moved around. Wait, but in the original string, the two 1s are separated by a 2. So, can we swap them? Well, in the original string, the first 1 and the 2 can be swapped. Then the 2 is followed by a 1. Then, the 2 and 1 can be swapped again. So, the first 1 can be moved to the right of the 2. But then the second 1 is already there. So, the original two 1s can be moved to the right of the 2. So, the order of the two 1s is preserved? Or can they be swapped?\n\nWait, in the original string, the 1s are separated by a 2. So, how can they be swapped? For example, if the string is \"121\", can we make it \"112\"? Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is \"1 2 1\".\n\nWe can swap the 2 and the 1 (since they are adjacent) to get \"1 1 2\". So yes. That's possible. So, the two 1s can be moved to be adjacent. So, in this case, the order of the 1s was originally 1 (position 0) and 1 (position 2). After swapping, they are adjacent. So, the order between them is preserved. Because in the original string, the first 1 is before the second 1. But when you swap the 2 and the 1, you get the first 1 and the second 1 adjacent. But their order is preserved. So, the original order of 1s can be modified? Or not?\n\nWait, in the example above, the original order is 1 (position 0), 2 (position 1), 1 (position 2). The two 1s are in positions 0 and 2. The first 1 is before the second. After swapping the 2 and the 1 (positions 1 and 2), the string becomes \"1 1 2\". So, the two 1s are now adjacent, and the first 1 (original position 0) is still before the second (original position 2). So, their order is preserved. So, even though they are now adjacent, their relative order hasn't changed. So, perhaps the 1s can be moved around between the 0s and 2s, but their relative order is preserved. So, the 1s can be rearranged in any way as long as their original relative order is maintained?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let's think of another example. Suppose the string is \"1 0 1 2\". Let's see if we can swap the two 1s. The original order of 1s is first at position 0, then at position 2. Let's see. The 1 at position 0 can be swapped with the 0 at position 1, resulting in \"0 1 1 2\". Now the two 1s are adjacent. So, their order is preserved. But if the original string was \"1 2 0 1\", can we swap the two 1s?\n\nOriginal string: 1 2 0 1. Let's see. The 1 can be moved to the right by swapping with the 2 (since they are adjacent). So, swapping gives 2 1 0 1. Then, the 1 can be swapped with the 0 (they are adjacent). So, swapping gives 2 0 1 1. Then, the 0 can be swapped with the 1 (but that's 0 and 1 adjacent). So, swapping gives 2 1 0 1 again. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two 1s can't be swapped. So, their relative order is preserved.\n\nIn this case, the original order of the two 1s is 1 (position 0) and 1 (position 3). So, in the final arrangement, the first 1 (originally at 0) is before the second 1 (originally at 3). So, their order is preserved. So, perhaps the 1s can be rearranged in any way as long as their original order is preserved. That is, the 1s can be moved around, but their relative order must stay the same. Because they can be moved through 0s and 2s, but not through each other. Because if two 1s are adjacent, you can't swap them, so their order is fixed. So, the 1s must appear in the same order as in the original string, but can be moved between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, putting this together, the problem can be approached as follows:\n\n- The 0s and 2s are fixed in their original relative order. So, the final string will have the same sequence of 0s and 2s as in the original string, but with 1s inserted in between.\n\n- The 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s, but their order must be the same as in the original string. So, the 1s can be grouped and placed in the available gaps between the 0s and 2s, but their order is preserved.\n\nWait, but how can that be? For example, suppose the original string is \"1012\". The 0s and 2s are in order 0 followed by 2. The 1s are in positions 0 and 2. So, their order is preserved. In the final string, the 0 and 2 are fixed in order. The 1s can be placed before the 0, between 0 and 2, or after the 2. But their order must be preserved. So, the 1s can be arranged in any positions, as long as they are in the same order as in the original string.\n\nBut how to find where to insert them?\n\nThe goal is to make the lex smallest string. Since 0 is the smallest, then 1, then 2. So, to minimize the string, we want as many 0s as possible to come first, then 1s, then 2s. But since the order of 0s and 2s is fixed, we need to arrange the 1s optimally.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Split the original string into three parts: the 0s, 1s, and 2s. But more accurately, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So, we can collect all the 0s and 2s in the original order, and collect the 1s in their original order.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to inserting the 1s into the gaps between the 0s and 2s, but also possibly before the first 0, between 0 and 2, and after the last 2.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s to get the lex smallest string.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a sequence of 0s and 2s. Let's say the original 0s and 2s are in the order [0, 2]. So, the gaps are: before the first 0, between 0 and 2, and after 2.\n\nWe can insert the 1s into these gaps. But since the 1s are in their original order, we need to arrange them in such a way that the lex order is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe optimal way would be to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible gaps. Because inserting a 1 earlier in the string makes the lex order smaller.\n\nBut how to determine the best positions for the 1s?\n\nLet me think of the following example. Suppose the 0s and 2s are arranged as [0, 2], and we have some 1s. Let's say we have two 1s. Where should we insert them?\n\nIf we insert both before the 0, the string is 1102. If we insert one before the 0 and one between 0 and 2, the string is 1012. Which is better? 1012 is better than 1102. So, inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions, but considering that inserting them in earlier positions may allow more 1s to be placed there.\n\nWait, but the 1s are in their original order. So, if the original 1s are [1a, 1b], then inserting them in the order 1a, 1b into the gaps.\n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert them into?\n\nThe idea is that for each gap between the 0s and 2s, we can insert some number of 1s, and the order of the 1s is preserved. To minimize the lex order, we want to insert the 1s in the earliest possible gaps where they can contribute to the lex order.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the 1s as being able to be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s, but their order is preserved. So, the problem is similar to merging two sequences: the sequence of 0s and 2s, and the sequence of 1s, where the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s, but the order of the 1s is fixed.\n\nBut how to merge them optimally.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list called 'fixed', and the 1s as a list called 'ones'.\n\nThe problem is to interleave the 'ones' into the 'fixed' list, such that the merged list is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, the 'fixed' list is [0, 2], and the 'ones' list is [1, 1].\n\nThe merged list would be [1, 1, 0, 2], which is lex smaller than [1, 0, 1, 2], which is lex smaller than [0, 1, 1, 2], etc. Wait, no. Wait, [0, 1, 1, 2] is lex smaller than [1, 0, 1, 2], because the first character is 0 vs 1.\n\nAh, so the best approach is to insert the 1s as early as possible, but considering that the fixed elements (0s and 2s) are in their original order.\n\nBut how to determine where to insert the 1s.\n\nLet me think of the 'fixed' list as a series of blocks. For example, the fixed list could be something like [0, 2, 0, 2]. Then, there are gaps where we can insert the 1s. The gaps are:\n\n- Before the first element.\n\n- Between each pair of elements in the fixed list.\n\n- After the last element.\n\nEach of these gaps can have any number of 1s, as long as the order of the 1s is preserved.\n\nThe problem is to distribute the 1s into these gaps such that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nThe key is to decide for each gap whether inserting the 1s into it is better than inserting them into later gaps.\n\nSince the 1s are all '1's, inserting them into the earliest possible gaps would be better. However, inserting them into a gap that comes before a certain fixed element may be better than inserting them after.\n\nBut since all the 1s are the same, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps. But how to determine which gaps are the earliest possible.\n\nBut wait, the fixed elements are in their original order, which includes 0s and 2s. For example, if the fixed list starts with a 0, inserting the 1s before that 0 would be worse than inserting them after the 0. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So, inserting the 1s before the 0 would result in a higher lex order.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are before the first occurrence of a 2, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe need to insert the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements. For each gap, we can decide whether inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into later gaps.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, the optimal strategy is to insert them into the earliest possible gaps where the insertion does not cause a higher lex order.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLet me think of each gap as a position where inserting the 1s will contribute to the string. For example, consider the fixed list as [A_0, A_1, ..., A_n], where each A_i is either 0 or 2.\n\nThe gaps are:\n\ngap_0: before A_0\n\ngap_1: between A_0 and A_1\n\n...\n\ngap_n: between A_{n-1} and A_n}\n\ngap_{n+1}: after A_n.\n\nNow, inserting the 1s into a gap will put them in the string before the elements in the fixed list that come after that gap.\n\nThe question is: for each gap, how many 1s should we insert here?\n\nThe key is to find the earliest possible gaps where inserting the 1s would not be worse than inserting them later.\n\nLet me think about the first gap. Suppose the first element in the fixed list is a 0. Then, inserting the 1s into gap_0 (before the 0) would result in the 1s coming before the 0, which is worse than having the 0 first. So, inserting the 1s into gap_0 is not optimal. Instead, we want to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap that allows the 1s to be placed after as many 0s as possible and before as many 2s as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap, we can decide whether inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them into a later gap. Since all the 1s are same, the optimal choice is to insert as many as possible into the earliest possible gap that is before a 2. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to think that inserting the 1s into a gap between two elements of the fixed list (which are 0 and 2) depends on the elements that are in that gap. For example, inserting 1s into a gap that is between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting them between 0 and 2 would allow them to be after the 0 (which is good) and before the 2 (which is also good).\n\nBut how to find the optimal positions.\n\nLet me think of the following rule:\n\nFor each gap, decide whether inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into the next gap.\n\nFor example, between two consecutive elements in the fixed list, say X and Y. If X is 0 and Y is 2, inserting the 1s between them would be better than inserting them after Y. Because inserting them between X and Y would have the 1s after the 0 and before the 2. Which is better than inserting them after the 2, where they would be after the 2, which is worse.\n\nBut if X is 2 and Y is 0, then inserting the 1s between them would be worse than inserting them before X. Because inserting before X (which is 2) would have the 1s before the 2, which is better than inserting between 2 and 0 (where the 1s would be after 2, which is worse than inserting them before 2).\n\nBut since the fixed list has the original relative order of 0s and 2s, the X and Y can't be 2 followed by 0. Because in the original string, any 0 that comes after a 2 would have been fixed in that order. So, the fixed list can't have a 2 followed by a 0. Because the original order of 0s and 2s is preserved. Therefore, the fixed list is a sequence of 0s and 2s in the same order as the original string. So, the fixed list can't have a 2 followed by a 0. Because in the original string, any 0 that comes after a 2 would have been in that order, and the fixed list preserves that.\n\nTherefore, the fixed list is a non-decreasing sequence? No, because the original string can have 0s and 2s in any order. For example, the original string could be '20', which would be fixed as '20'. But according to the allowed swaps, you can't swap 0 and 2, so their order is preserved. So, the fixed list is the original sequence of 0s and 2s, in their original order. So, the fixed list can have 0s and 2s in any order, but their relative positions are fixed.\n\nSo, for example, the fixed list could be [2, 0, 2, 0, 2].\n\nBut how to process that.\n\nBack to the problem of inserting 1s into the gaps. The idea is that inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them later.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe 1s can be inserted into any of the gaps. The optimal way to insert them is to place them in the earliest possible gaps where the following condition holds: inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into any later gaps.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAnother way to think is that inserting the 1s into a gap that is before a 2 is better than inserting them into a gap that is after that 2. Also, inserting them into a gap that is after a 0 is better than inserting them into a gap that is before a 0.\n\nWait, but the fixed list may have 0s and 2s in any order. So, for example, if there is a gap that is before a 0, inserting the 1s there would be worse than inserting them after the 0. Because 0 is smaller than 1.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where the next element in the fixed list is as small as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nWe can iterate through the gaps and decide where to insert the 1s. For each gap, we can compare the current gap's position with the next ones. For example, if inserting the 1s into a gap will have them before a 0, then we can insert them here. But if inserting them into a later gap will have them before a 0, then inserting them into the earliest possible gap is better.\n\nAlternatively, think of the gaps as positions where inserting the 1s would contribute to the string. The earlier the gap, the earlier the 1s are inserted. However, inserting them into a gap that comes before a 0 would be worse than inserting them after the 0. So, the best place to insert the 1s is in the earliest possible gaps that are before a 2, or after a 0.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to insert the 1s into the gaps between the fixed elements. For each gap, the insertion of 1s into that gap will have them placed before the elements that follow in the fixed list. So, the decision of where to insert the 1s is to choose the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them into a later gap.\n\nLet me think of the following example. Suppose the fixed list is [0, 2]. The gaps are:\n\ngap_0: before 0\n\ngap_1: between 0 and 2\n\ngap_2: after 2.\n\nWe have some 1s to insert. The optimal way is to insert them into gap_1 (between 0 and 2), because inserting them here would have them after the 0 and before the 2, which is better than inserting them into gap_2 (after the 2) or gap_0 (before the 0). Because inserting into gap_0 would lead to 1s followed by 0s, which is worse than 0s followed by 1s.\n\nSo, the 1s should be inserted into the earliest possible gap that is between a 0 and a 2, or before the first 0 (but that's not helpful), or after the last 2.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: For each gap, we can determine the minimal possible contribution to the lex order by inserting the 1s there. Since all 1s are the same, the optimal is to insert all of them into the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not increase the lex order compared to inserting them into later gaps.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nPerhaps the following rule: insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gap that is before a 2. Because inserting them before a 2 is better than inserting them after the 2. Also, inserting them after a 0 is better than inserting them before the 0.\n\nWait, but how to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be optimal.\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a sequence of elements. For each gap between elements, we can look at the current element and the next element (if any). For example, for gap i (between fixed[i-1] and fixed[i]), the elements before and after the gap are fixed[i-1] and fixed[i]. \n\nBut inserting the 1s into this gap would mean that the 1s are placed between fixed[i-1] and fixed[i].\n\nThe idea is to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would not be worse than inserting them into later gaps. For example, inserting into a gap where the next element is 2 is better than inserting into a gap where the next element is 2 later on.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order into a list called 'fixed'.\n\nCollect all the 1s into a list called 'ones'.\n\nNow, we need to insert the 'ones' into the gaps between the 'fixed' elements.\n\nThe optimal way is to insert all the 'ones' into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them into later gaps.\n\nTo determine where to insert the 'ones', we can iterate through the gaps and decide for each gap whether inserting the 'ones' here is better than inserting them later.\n\nFor example, consider the gaps in order. For each gap, compare the current gap's position with the next gaps. If inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into any of the later gaps, then insert all remaining 1s into this gap.\n\nBut how to compare the gaps.\n\nLet me think of the following: for a given gap, what is the earliest position in the string where the 1s would be inserted. For example, inserting the 1s into a gap that is before a 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0. Inserting them into a gap that is before a 2 is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nSo, for each gap, we can determine the 'value' of inserting the 1s into that gap. The 'value' is determined by the elements that follow in the fixed list.\n\nLet me think of the following: when inserting the 1s into a gap, they will be placed before the elements that come after that gap. So, the first element after the gap is the first element in the fixed list that comes after the gap. For example, inserting into gap_0 (before the first element) would place the 1s before all elements. Inserting into gap_1 (between first and second element) would place them before the second element, etc.\n\nThe goal is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the first element after the gap is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but the 1s are '1's. So, inserting them into a gap where the first element after is 2 would be better than inserting them into a gap where the first element after is 0. Wait, no. Because inserting the 1s before a 0 would make the 1s appear before the 0, which is worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nSo, for example, if the gap is before a 0, inserting the 1s into this gap would make the 1s appear before the 0. Since 1 is larger than 0, this is worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the first element after the gap is not less than 1. Because inserting them into such a gap would not cause them to be before elements that are smaller than 1.\n\nWait, but the first element after the gap could be 0 or 2. If it's 0, inserting the 1s into the gap would be worse than inserting them after the 0. If it's 2, inserting them into the gap would be better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the earliest gap where the first element after the gap is 2, and insert the 1s there. Otherwise, if there are no such gaps, then insert them into the earliest possible gap (like after all 0s and before the 2s, or after the last 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gap where the next element is not a 0. Because inserting them before a 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the fixed list is [0, 2]. The gaps are:\n\ngap_0: before 0.\n\ngap_1: between 0 and 2.\n\ngap_2: after 2.\n\nThe first element after gap_0 is 0. Inserting the 1s here would be bad. The first element after gap_1 is 2. Inserting the 1s here is good. The first element after gap_2 is nothing. So, inserting into gap_1 is better.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFind the earliest gap where the first element after the gap is not 0. Insert all the 1s into that gap.\n\nIf there is no such gap (i.e., all elements in the fixed list are 0s), then insert the 1s after all the 0s (since inserting them before would be worse than after).\n\nSimilarly, if the fixed list contains only 2s, then inserting the 1s before the first 2 would be better than after.\n\nWait, inserting the 1s before the first 2 would be better than inserting them after the 2s. Because 1 is less than 2. So, inserting them before the 2s would be better.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nWe want to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would not be before a 0. Because inserting them before a 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through the gaps in order.\n\n2. For each gap, check what is the first element after the gap. If that element is 0, then inserting the 1s into this gap would be bad (since they would be before the 0, which is worse than after). So, skip this gap and proceed to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.
