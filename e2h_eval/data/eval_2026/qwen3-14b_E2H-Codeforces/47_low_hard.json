During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for x = a +k and y = b +k. But since both x and y are increasing as k increases, maybe there's a way to find the optimal k where their difference is minimized?\n\nWait, because when you add k to both a and b, the difference between them remains the same. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me denote d = |a - b|. So, without loss of generality, let's assume a ≤ b. Then, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x is a +k. Because if a is smaller than b, then a +k is x, and b +k is x + (b -a) = x +d.\n\nSo, the LCM of x and x +d. Which is equal to x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x +d). But since gcd(x, x +d) is the same as gcd(x, d). Because x and x +d differ by d. So, the GCD of x and x +d is the same as GCD(x, d). Therefore, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, our goal is to find x such that this value is minimized, and then find the corresponding k. Since x = a +k, and since we can assume a ≤ b (without loss of generality, because if a > b, we can swap them), then the problem becomes: find x ≥ a (since k ≥0) such that x and x +d have minimal LCM, where d = b -a.\n\nWait, but how do we find x? Let me think. For example, in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d=4. Then x = 6 +k, and x +4. The LCM of x and x+4. For k=2, x=8. So 8 and 12. Their LCM is 24. What's the minimal possible here?\n\nBut how do we find the minimal x such that the LCM is minimized. Let's think about the LCM formula again. Since x and x +d have GCD(x, d). Let me denote g = gcd(x, d). Then, x = g * m, and d = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, since d = g*n, and x = g*m. Then x +d = g*(m +n). The GCD of x and x+d is GCD(gm, g(m +n)) = g * GCD(m, m +n) = g * GCD(m, n) = g*1 = g. Because m and n are coprime. Therefore, the LCM is (gm * g(m +n)) / g = g*m*(m +n) = g*m*(m +n).\n\nBut since d = g *n, then n = d/g. So substituting, the LCM is g*m*(m + (d/g)). Hmm. But since x = g*m, and x must be ≥ a (since k ≥0, x = a +k ≥a). So how can we find m and g to minimize this expression?\n\nAlternatively, since the LCM is x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d). Let's think of it as x*(x +d)/g, where g is the GCD(x, d). But since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that x and d share a large GCD. Because that would make the denominator larger, which reduces the overall LCM.\n\nSo, the idea is that to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD of x and d. Because that would reduce the denominator. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, but that depends on the relationship between x and d.\n\nBut what's the best approach here? Let's think of possible candidates for x.\n\nLet me consider that the optimal x is such that x is a divisor of d, or something like that. Or perhaps, x is chosen so that x divides (x +d) or something else. Wait, but x and x +d differ by d. So, if x divides d, then x divides x +d. So the GCD(x, x +d) is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The key insight here is that the difference between $ a $ and $ b $ remains constant as $ k $ increases, which allows us to simplify the problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The LCM of two numbers $ x $ and $ y $ can be expressed as $ \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} $. Here, $ x = a + k $ and $ y = b + k $, so the difference $ d = |a - b| $ remains constant.\n2. **Simplification**: Let $ d = |a - b| $. Without loss of generality, assume $ a \\leq b $, so $ x = a + k $ and $ y = x + d $. The LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $ can be simplified using their GCD.\n3. **Optimal $ k $**: To minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of $ x $ and $ d $.
