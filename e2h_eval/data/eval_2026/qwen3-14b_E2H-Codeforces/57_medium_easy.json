His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But how do I model this?\n\nFirst, the best possible rank. To get the best rank, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. So, for the best case, we should take the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Wait, but how? Because the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not linked. So for the best case, we can pair the highest a_i with the highest b_j, then the next ones, etc. Wait, but since Vasya's total is at least x, maybe we need to find the maximum possible sum he could have, which would be the sum of the top a_i and top b_j. Wait, but how do we find that?\n\nWait, no. The problem states that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total could be higher. However, when considering the best possible rank, we want to maximize his total so that he can be as high as possible. For example, if there's someone else with a higher total, then Vasya can't be first. But if we can arrange his total to be the maximum possible, then he can be first.\n\nWait, but the way to maximize his total is to take the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. But wait, but those a and b might belong to different people. Because for the best case scenario, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But since the problem says that there exists at least one such pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best possible rank, we need to take the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, count how many people have a sum strictly greater than that. Then the best rank is that count +1.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum possible sum for Vasya? Well, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because if you take the top a and top b, that's the maximum possible sum. But wait, what if there are multiple a's and b's? Like, for example, if a has 5 elements, and b has 5 elements. So for maximum sum, take the max of a and max of b. That gives the maximum possible sum.\n\nSo for the best case, Vasya's sum is max_a + max_b. Then, the best rank is the number of participants whose sum is strictly greater than this value, plus 1. Because if someone has a higher sum, they are ranked above him.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So in reality, Vasya's actual total could be anything >=x. But for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum (so that he can be as high as possible). But how do we ensure that this maximum sum is >=x? Well, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So the maximum sum will be >=x.\n\nSo for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum, which is max_a + max_b. Then, compute how many people have sum > this value. Then the best rank is that number +1.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the number of people with sum greater than that? Because for that, we need to consider all possible pairs of a and b. But that's impossible for n up to 1e5. Wait, but that's not feasible. Wait, but for the best case, we need to find the maximum possible sum for Vasya, which is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. But then, when calculating how many other participants have sum greater than this, we need to find how many pairs (a_k, b_l) have a_k + b_l > (max_a + max_b). But that's impossible unless all a and b are max. Because if max_a is the maximum in a, and max_b is the maximum in b, then any other pair would have a sum less than or equal to max_a + max_b. So the only way someone else can have a sum greater than that is if there's another pair that adds up to more. Which can't happen. So the maximum sum is unique. So the number of people with sum greater than that is zero. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. For example, in the first sample input, all a and b are 1. So the max sum is 2. All others have sum 2. But since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily, the best possible rank is 1. But in that case, the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the output is 1 5. So for best rank, it's 1. But according to this logic, the maximum sum is 2, and the number of people with sum greater than that is zero. So best rank is 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nBut then, how about when there are multiple people with the same max sum? For example, if there are two people with a_i = max_a and two people with b_j = max_b. Then, the maximum sum is max_a + max_b. How many pairs can have this sum? Well, each a_i can be paired with each b_j. So for example, if there are two a's with max_a and two b's with max_b, then there are 2*2=4 possible pairs. But the problem says that the actual participants are in the list. Wait, but the problem says that each participant has a first tour and second tour score. But the teacher has the list of a's and b's, but they are not linked. So the actual participants are the combinations of a_i and b_j, but the problem is that the actual participants are n people, but each has a_i and b_j. But the way the problem is set up, the a's and b's are the first and second tour scores of the same participants. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are given in arbitrary order. So for example, for the first tour, the a's are the first tour scores of all participants, and the b's are the second tour scores of all participants. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. So when trying to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, we can choose any possible pairing of a_i and b_j for the participants. Wait, but that's not correct. Because in reality, each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. So the teacher has a list of a's and a list of b's, but they are not linked. So the actual participants are the n people, each with a_i and b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_j. So for the purpose of finding the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, we can choose any possible pairing of a and b (as long as each a is used once, each b is used once), and then compute the possible ranks for Vasya.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So the problem is that the teacher has two lists: one for first tour (a) and one for second tour (b). Each participant has exactly one a and one b, but the teacher doesn't know which a corresponds to which b. So the actual participants' total points are determined by the pairing between a and b. So for the purposes of the problem, we can choose any possible pairing of a and b (permutation of the b array) to arrange the participants' total points, and then find the best and worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nBut how does that affect the problem? For the best possible rank, we want to choose a pairing that allows Vasya to have the highest possible rank. For the worst possible rank, we want to choose a pairing that allows Vasya to have the lowest possible rank.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think again.\n\nVasya's total is at least x. So, in the best case scenario, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and arrange the others in such a way that as few as possible people have a higher total than him. For the worst case, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and arrange others in a way that as many as possible have a higher total than him.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think for the best case.\n\nTo get the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing that maximizes Vasya's total. Because if his total is as high as possible, then the number of people with higher totals is minimized. So, to find the maximum possible total for Vasya, we can pair the largest a_i with the largest b_j. But since we can arrange the pairing, the maximum total is indeed the sum of the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. So, for example, if we have a's sorted in descending order, and b's sorted in descending order, then pairing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc., would give the maximum possible total for each participant. But for Vasya, we can choose to take the maximum a and maximum b, so that his total is max_a + max_b. Then, for the other participants, their totals would be a_i + b_j, where i and j are not both zero. But in this case, the other participants would have a_i + b_j <= max_a + max_b. So, the number of people with higher total than Vasya is zero. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut what if there are other participants that can have the same total as Vasya's maximum? For example, if there are multiple a_i with max_a and multiple b_j with max_b. Then, in the pairing, we can pair each max a with a max b. Then, each of those participants would have the same total as Vasya. Since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily, Vasya can be placed first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best case, the answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if Vasya's maximum possible total is not enough to be the highest? No, because we can choose the pairing to make his total as high as possible. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut why in the first sample, the output is 1 5. Because in that case, all the participants have the same total (2). So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5.\n\nBut how about for the worst case?\n\nFor the worst case, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants in a way that as many as possible have higher totals than him.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x. Let's call this S.\n\n2. Then, count how many participants can have a total strictly greater than S. Then, the worst rank is that count +1.\n\nBut how to find S?\n\nThe minimal possible total for Vasya is x (if possible). However, it's possible that the minimal S is higher than x. For example, if x is 5, but all possible pairs of a and b sum to at least 6. Then S is 6.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible S for Vasya? Well, the minimal S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and achievable by pairing some a_i and b_j.\n\nBut how can we find that? Well, to minimize S, we need to find the smallest possible sum that is >=x. So for this, we can sort the a and b arrays, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. But how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible sum is the minimal sum that is >=x. So, to find this, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j and find the minimal one that is >=x. However, for n up to 1e5, this would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nBut that's not feasible. So, we need an efficient way to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. The minimal possible sum for Vasya is the minimal value of (a_i + b_j) that is >=x. So, for that, we can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, among all these possibilities, take the minimal sum.\n\nThis can be done with a two-pointer approach. Let me think.\n\nSort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Since the array is sorted, for each a_i, we can use binary search to find the minimal b_j that satisfies this. Then, the minimal sum for that a_i would be a_i + b_j. Then, among all these, the minimal sum is the minimal possible S.\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal possible S >=x, that's the way.\n\nOnce we have that minimal possible S, then the worst rank is determined by how many participants can have a total greater than S.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWait, but for the worst case scenario, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many participants as possible have a total greater than S. Because that would make Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number of participants with sum > S?\n\nSo, given that S is the minimal possible sum for Vasya (which is >=x), we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, given that the pairings are arranged optimally.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange the pairings to maximize the number of participants with sum > S?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to pair a and b in a way that as many as possible pairs have a_i + b_j > S.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nAn efficient way would be to sort a and b, and then for each a_i, find the maximum number of b_j that can be paired with it to get a sum > S.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way to maximize the count is to pair the largest a's with the largest b's. Let me think.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a sorted in ascending order and b sorted in ascending order. Then, for the maximum number of pairs with sum > S, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think: sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. Then, for the maximum number of pairs with sum > S, we can do the following:\n\nInitialize two pointers, i starting at the end of a (the largest a) and j starting at the end of b (the largest b). For each a[i], we check if a[i] + b[j] > S. If yes, then we can pair them, increment the count, and move both pointers. If not, then we move the i pointer left (since a[i] is too small to pair with any b[j] left).\n\nWait, that's a standard approach for two arrays. Let me think again. For example, to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > S, the optimal way is to pair the largest a with the largest b, then next largest, etc.\n\nSo, here's how to compute that:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = n-1 (last element of a), j = n-1 (last element of b). count = 0.\n\nWhile i >=0 and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > S:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i -=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i -=1\n\nThis would give the maximum possible number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nBut why? Because if a[i] + b[j] is not greater than S, then a[i] can't be paired with any b[k] (since b[k] <= b[j]). So we need to try a smaller a[i].\n\nBut this approach gives the maximum number of pairs possible.\n\nSo, once we have that count, then the worst rank is count +1.\n\nBut wait, for the worst case, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many as possible participants have sum > S, where S is the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x). Then, the worst rank is count +1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nBest rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst rank:\n\nFind the minimal possible S that is >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, which is count. Then, worst rank is count +1.\n\nBut how to find S?\n\nAs discussed earlier, S is the minimal possible sum >=x. So to compute that, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimal of all those a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think. Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Since the array is sorted, we can use binary search for that. Then, the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + b_j. We need to find the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut what if there is no such b_j for a particular a_i? Well, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for at least one a_i, there is a b_j.\n\nSo the steps for finding S are:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize min_sum to some large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest b_j >= target using binary search.\n\n   if such a b_j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b_j\n\n       if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n           min_sum = current_sum\n\nSo after checking all a_i, min_sum is the minimal possible S.\n\nBut this is O(n log n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e5.\n\nOnce we have S, then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, using the two-pointer approach.\n\nSo, the worst rank is that count +1.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the case where S is not the minimal sum but some other value?\n\nNo, because S is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x). So, when we arrange the pairings to have Vasya's sum as S, then the other participants can be arranged to have as many as possible sum > S. Which would give the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how do we ensure that Vasya's sum is S? Because in this case, the pairing would have to include one pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = S. But when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S, that would be the maximum possible. However, in this scenario, Vasya's sum is S, and the other participants can have as many as possible sum > S. So the count is the number of participants with sum > S, and Vasya's rank is count +1.\n\nBut how do we ensure that there is a pairing that includes S for Vasya and allows the rest to be arranged to have maximum count?\n\nWell, the process is:\n\nWe find the minimal possible S for Vasya (so that he can have as low as possible sum, allowing others to have higher sums). Then, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S is computed as the maximum possible. Thus, the worst rank is count +1.\n\nSo combining all this:\n\nThe steps for solving the problem are:\n\nFor best rank:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum for Vasya (max_a + max_b). The best rank is 1, since no one can have a higher sum than that.\n\nWait, but what if there are other pairs that also have the same sum? For example, if multiple pairs have the same maximum sum. Then, the jury can assign Vasya to be first. So best rank is 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\n- Find the minimal possible sum S for Vasya that is >=x.\n\n- Compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S. Let's call it 'count'.\n\n- Worst rank is count +1.\n\nBut how to compute 'count'?\n\nAs explained earlier, by sorting a and b in ascending order, and using the two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nBut wait, in the two-pointer approach, we have to pair the elements in a way that gives maximum count. So that's the correct way.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor best rank:\n\nmax_a is 1, max_b is 1. Sum is 2. So best rank is 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\nfind minimal S >=x (which is 2). So S is 2.\n\nNow, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > 2. Since all possible sums are 2, the count is 0. So worst rank is 0+1=1? But the sample output says 5. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no! What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the sample input says that in the first case, the output is 1 5. So for the worst rank, it's 5. According to our approach, the worst rank would be count +1, which is 0 +1=1. Which contradicts the sample.\n\nSo clearly, there is a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my approach is wrong. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have a sum of 2. So, for the worst case, the jury can arrange Vasya to be last. So the worst rank is 5. But according to my approach, the count of participants with sum > S (which is 2) is zero. So worst rank is 0+1=1. Which is wrong.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nBecause in the worst case scenario, S is 2, and all participants have sum 2. So the number of participants with sum > S is zero. So the worst rank is 0+1=1. But the sample says 5.\n\nThis indicates that my approach is incorrect. Where's the mistake?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because when S is the sum of Vasya, the other participants can have sum equal to S, and the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily. So for the worst possible rank, we need to count how many participants have sum strictly greater than S, and then add 1. But in this case, all participants have sum equal to S. So, the number of participants with sum > S is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0+1=1. But according to the sample, it's 5.\n\nThis is a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the problem says that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points. If two or more have same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose.\n\nSo, in the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So Vasya can be placed anywhere from 1st to 5th. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nBut according to my previous reasoning, the worst rank is count (number of people with sum > S) +1. Which would be 0+1=1. Which is wrong. So why is this?\n\nBecause in the case where S is the sum of Vasya, and others have sum equal to S, the number of people with sum > S is zero. But the number of people with sum equal to S is n-1. So in the worst case, Vasya can be placed last among those with same sum. So the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum equal to S) + 1 ?\n\nNo. Because the rank depends on how the jury arranges the ties. For example, if there are k people with sum equal to S, then Vasya can be placed anywhere from 1 to k-th position in that group. So the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum > S) + k.\n\nBut in the first sample, the number of people with sum > S is zero. And the number of people with sum equal to S is 5 (including Vasya). So the worst possible rank is 0 + 5 =5.\n\nAh! So my mistake was that I didn't account for the people who have sum equal to S. So, the worst possible rank is not just the count of people with sum > S plus 1. It's (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum equal to S) + 1? Or is it (number of people with sum > S) + 1, but considering that Vasya can be placed after all those with equal sum?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The rank is determined by how many people have a higher sum than you. If you have sum S, then all people with sum > S are ranked higher than you. The people with sum equal to S can be ranked either before or after you, depending on the jury's choice. So, for the worst possible rank, the jury will place Vasya as low as possible in the group of people with sum S. So the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum S) (including Vasya) ?\n\nNo. For example, if there are m people with sum > S, and k people with sum equal to S (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is m + k.\n\nBecause the m people are ranked higher than all the k people. And in the k people, Vasya can be placed last. So his rank is m +k.\n\nBut in the first sample, m is zero, k is 5. So rank is 0 +5 =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula for the worst rank is:\n\nworst_rank = (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum == S) ?\n\nWait, but how do we compute the number of people with sum == S?\n\nBut in our previous approach, when we compute the maximum number of people with sum > S, we are not considering those with sum equal to S.\n\nSo, the problem is that the worst rank depends on both the number of people with sum > S and the number of people with sum == S.\n\nSo, how can we compute that?\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe worst rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than S plus the number of people with sum equal to S (including Vasya) ?\n\nNo, because in that case, Vasya is part of the equal group, and the worst possible rank would be (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum equal to S) ?\n\nBut that would be the case if all the people with equal sum are placed after Vasya. But that's not possible. Because the jury can arrange the equal sum people in any order. So the worst possible rank for Vasya is when he is placed last among all the people with sum >= S. So, the worst possible rank is (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum equal to S) ?\n\nBut how do we compute the number of people with sum equal to S and sum greater than S?\n\nBut this complicates things. How can we compute this?\n\nLet me think again. For the worst case scenario, we have S as the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x). We need to find the maximum possible number of participants that have sum >= S. Because that would allow Vasya to be placed last in that group.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, the number of people with sum > S is 'count', and the number of people with sum equal to S is 'equal_count'. Then, the worst rank is count + equal_count.\n\nBut how to compute 'count' and 'equal_count'?\n\nBut how to compute 'count' (number of people with sum > S) and 'equal_count' (number of people with sum == S) for the worst scenario.\n\nBut in the worst scenario, the pairing is chosen to maximize the number of people with sum > S, and also possibly include as many people as possible with sum == S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum possible number of people who have sum >= S, given that Vasya's sum is S. Because in that case, Vasya can be placed last among them.\n\nSo, the worst rank is (number of people with sum > S) + (number of people with sum == S) ?\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut how can we compute the number of people with sum > S and the number of people with sum == S?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because for the worst case, we need to choose a pairing that maximizes the number of people with sum > S, and then the number of people with sum == S.\n\nBut perhaps, for the worst case, the maximum number of people with sum > S is computed as before (using the two-pointer approach), and then the number of people with sum == S is computed as the total number of possible pairs with sum == S.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, after computing the maximum number of people with sum > S (call this count_high), the number of people with sum == S can be found as follows:\n\nTotal pairs is n. So, if we have count_high pairs with sum > S, then the remaining pairs can have sum <= S. But how many of them are equal to S?\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the number of pairs with sum > S and the number of pairs with sum >= S. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, the worst rank is determined by the maximum number of people that can have sum >= S, given that Vasya's sum is S. Because that would allow Vasya to be placed last among them.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number.\n\nThis seems like a new problem. How to find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >= S, given that S is fixed.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. The maximum number of pairs with sum >= S is the same as the maximum number of pairs with sum > S plus the number of pairs with sum == S.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S can be found by a similar two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >= S. Then, for each a_i, the number of b_j that can be paired with it to have sum >= S is (n - j). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the two-pointer approach can be modified to count the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). count = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >= S:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis approach counts the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >= S.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause for the maximum number of pairs, we want to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b that allows the sum >= S. This way, we can use the larger b's for smaller a's, allowing more pairs.\n\nFor example, if a is [1, 2, 3], b is [3, 2, 1], and S is 3. Then, the maximum number of pairs is 3: (1+3), (2+2), (3+1). The two-pointer approach would start with i=0, j=2. a[0]+b[2] = 1+1=2 <3. So i increases. Then i=1, j=2: 2+1=3 >=3. count becomes 1. i=2, j=1. 3+2=5 >=3. count becomes 2. i=3, loop ends. Wait, but that gives count=2. But the correct maximum is 3.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the two-pointer approach may not work for this case.\n\nWait, what's the correct way to count the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S?\n\nAnother approach: sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >= S. Once found, all b elements from j to n-1 can be paired with a_i. But since we can't reuse elements, this is tricky.\n\nBut the two-pointer approach for counting the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S is as follows:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). count = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >= S:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis approach tries to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b that can form a sum >=S. If it can't, then we move to the next a.\n\nThis works for the example above:\n\na = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3], S=3.\n\ni=0, j=2. a[0]+b[2] = 1+3=4 >=3 → count=1, i=1, j=1.\n\na[1]+b[1]=2+2=4 >=3 → count=2, i=2, j=0.\n\na[2]+b[0] =3+1=4 >=3 → count=3, i=3, loop ends. So count=3. Which is correct.\n\nIn the previous example, where a=[1,2,3], b=[3,2,1], S=3. Sorted a is [1,2,3], sorted b is [1,2,3]. Same as above.\n\nSo this two-pointer approach seems to work.\n\nSo, returning to the first sample:\n\nn=5, S=2.\n\na is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted.\n\nb is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted.\n\ni starts at 0, j at 4.\n\na[0] + b[4] = 2 >= 2 → count +=1 → i=1, j=3.\n\na[1]+b[3] = 2 → count=2, i=2, j=2.\n\na[2]+b[2] = 2 → count=3, i=3, j=1.\n\na[3]+b[1] = 2 → count=4, i=4, j=0.\n\na[4]+b[0] = 2 → count=5. So the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S is 5.\n\nWhich means that all 5 participants have sum >= S (which is 2). So for the worst rank, the number of people with sum > S is 0, and the number of people with sum == S is 5. So the worst rank is 0 + 5 =5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the correct approach for the worst rank is:\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S (call it total_ge), and then the worst rank is total_ge.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the total_ge is 5, which equals the worst rank. But how?\n\nIf Vasya is one of the participants in this group of total_ge, then the worst possible rank is the total_ge, because the jury can place him last in this group.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, the worst rank is the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S. Because that is the number of participants that are ranked >= Vasya's sum. Since Vasya is part of this group, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nWait, but how do we know that there is a way to arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is S, and that all these participants have sum >= S?\n\nBecause when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S, we are assuming that Vasya's sum is S. But how to ensure that there is at least one pair with sum exactly S.\n\nBut since S is the minimal possible sum >=x, and we have at least one pair that achieves S (because that's how we computed S), then yes. So the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S is the number of participants that can be arranged to have sum >= S, including Vasya. Hence, the worst possible rank is this number.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of pairs with sum >= S?\n\nUsing the two-pointer approach as described earlier.\n\nSo, the steps for worst rank:\n\nOnce we have S (the minimal possible sum for Vasya >=x), compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S using the two-pointer approach. This number is the worst possible rank",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total score from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating the maximum and minimum possible sums for Vasya and then determining the corresponding ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Rank Calculation**:\n   - The best rank is determined by maximizing Vasya's possible score. This is achieved by taking the highest scores from both tours. Since the maximum sum of points from both tours will be the highest possible, Vasya can be ranked first.\n\n2. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - The worst rank is determined by minimizing Vasya's possible score while ensuring it meets the minimum threshold `x`. This involves finding the smallest possible sum that is at least `x` using a combination of binary search and sorting.\n   - Once this minimal sum is found, we calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to this minimal sum. This gives us the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # For worst rank\n    # Sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Find minimal S >= x\n    min_S = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first b_j >= target\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if j < n:\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[j]\n            if current_sum < min_S:\n                min_S = current_sum\n    \n    # Now compute maximum number of pairs with sum >= min_S\n    # Using two-pointer approach\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count_ge = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= min_S:\n            count_ge += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    worst = count_ge\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank**: The best possible rank for Vasya is always 1 because we can pair the highest scores from both tours, ensuring no one has a higher total.\n- **Worst Rank**: \n  - We first determine the minimal possible score `S` that Vasya can have while meeting the threshold `x` using binary search on sorted arrays.\n  - Using a two-pointer technique on sorted arrays, we find the maximum number of participants who can have a score greater than or equal to this minimal score `S`.
