On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what reversing a subarray does. For example, if there's a part of the array that is decreasing, reversing it might make it increasing, which could help the LNDS.\n\nBut since the original array has only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about the original LNDS. Let's say the original array's LNDS is already some value, but by reversing a subarray, maybe we can get a longer one.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after reversing any interval [l, r], what's the maximum possible LNDS. So how can I approach this?\n\nAn initial thought: the optimal reversal would be to fix some part of the array where there are transitions from 2 to 1. Because those transitions break the non-decreasing sequence. Reversing a segment that contains such transitions could turn them into 1 to 2 transitions, which are good.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But by reversing positions 2-3, we get [1,1,2,2], which is all non-decreasing, so LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the idea is to find a segment that, when reversed, connects more 1s and 2s in a way that increases the overall LNDS.\n\nBut how to model this? Since n is up to 2000, trying all possible intervals [l, r] and for each, compute the LNDS after reversal would be O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3) time, which for n=2000 would be 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements, if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s in some way. Wait, no. The LNDS can't be longer than the total number of elements. So the maximum possible is n.\n\nBut how to achieve that? If the array is already non-decreasing, then yes. Otherwise, perhaps by reversing some subarray, we can make the entire array non-decreasing. But that's only possible if the original array has all 1s followed by all 2s. Otherwise, there's some 2 followed by 1. Reversing a segment that includes such a 2 and 1 would fix that.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal solution is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing way by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the original array. Let's find the number of 1s and 2s. Suppose there are c1 1s and c2 2s. Then the maximum possible LNDS is c1 + c2 = n, if the array can be made non-decreasing. But if not, then maybe the maximum is c1 + c2 - something.\n\nWait, but the LNDS can't be longer than the total number of elements. So the maximum possible is n. So the question is, can we reverse a subarray to make the entire array non-decreasing? If yes, then answer is n. Otherwise, what's the best we can do?\n\nBut how to check whether there exists a subarray reversal that makes the array non-decreasing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and some value derived from the number of transitions between 1 and 2.\n\nBut maybe there's another way. Let's think about the original array. Let's consider that the optimal reversal will take some part of the array that has a 2 followed by a 1, and reverse that. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that part would turn it into 1 followed by 2, which is better.\n\nBut the problem is that the array may have multiple such transitions. So, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Because each such transition is a place where the sequence breaks. But when you reverse a subarray that covers exactly one such transition, you can eliminate that transition.\n\nWait, for example, if the array is 1 2 1 2. There are two transitions from 2 to 1 (positions 2-3 and 3-4). If we reverse the subarray [2,3], which is 2 1, turning it into 1 2, then the array becomes 1 1 2 2, which has no transitions. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of transitions that can be eliminated by reversing a single subarray?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of \"bad\" transitions (from 2 to 1) that cannot be fixed by a reversal. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array, but that's only if we can reverse a subarray that covers all these transitions. However, that's probably not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and (number of 1s + number of 2s - k), where k is the minimal number of transitions that can't be fixed. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's say that the original array has some number of transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition contributes to a decrease in the LNDS. For example, if there are m such transitions, then the maximum possible LNDS is n - m + 1. Because each transition reduces the LNDS by 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut in the first example, the original array is 1 2 1 2. There are two 2→1 transitions. The original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). After reversing [2,3], the array becomes 1 1 2 2, which has zero transitions. The LNDS is 4, which is n - m + 1 (since m was 2, 4-2+1=3? No. That doesn't fit.)\n\nHmm, maybe that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence is a drop, and the LNDS can be computed by counting the number of such drops. Wait, no. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has two drops (2→1 and 1→2? No, 2→1 is a drop, 1→2 is not. So in that case, there are two drops (positions 2→3 and 3→4). The LNDS is 3. But the total number of elements minus the number of drops is 4 - 2 = 2. Which is not matching. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother thought: For an array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, plus the number of transitions from 1 to 2. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the problem again. We can reverse any subarray. How can that help us maximize the LNDS?\n\nLet me think about the optimal scenario. The optimal scenario would be to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. So the LNDS is the total number of elements. So the problem reduces to checking if there's a way to reverse a subarray to make the entire array non-decreasing. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nIf not, then the answer is n-1, or something else?\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: For the array to be non-decreasing, it must consist of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. So, the original array may have some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing a subarray that contains such a 2 and 1 can fix that.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array is 1 2 2 1 1. There's a 2 followed by 1. Reversing the subarray from position 3 to 4 (the 2 and 1) gives 1 2 1 2 1. Which still has transitions. But maybe reversing a larger subarray. For example, reversing positions 2-4 (2 2 1) gives 1 1 2 2 1. Now, the array is 1 1 2 2 1. The LNDS is 4 (the first four elements).\n\nBut if we reverse positions 2-5 (2 2 1 1), which becomes 1 1 2 2. Then the array is 1 followed by that reversed part, which is 1 1 2 2. Then the entire array is 1, 1, 2, 2, 1. Wait, no. Wait the original array is [1,2,2,1,1]. Reversing positions 2-5 would give [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. Which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 5.\n\nAh! So the problem is to find if there's a way to reverse a subarray to make the array non-decreasing. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nSo, how to check if such a subarray exists?\n\nThe original array can be transformed into a non-decreasing array by reversing a subarray if and only if there exists a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find all the positions where a 2 is followed by a 1. These are the \"problem\" points.\n\n2. If there are no such points, the original array is already non-decreasing, so answer is n.\n\n3. Else, we need to find a subarray that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing that subarray would eliminate those transitions.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array as consisting of a prefix of 1s, then some 2s, then some 1s, then 2s, etc. But since the array can be made non-decreasing by reversing a subarray, the number of transitions from 2 to 1 must be at most one. Because if there are two such transitions, reversing a single subarray can't fix both.\n\nWait, for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2]. There are two transitions from 2 to 1. Reversing the subarray [2,3] turns it into [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So even though there are two transitions, reversing a single subarray can fix them.\n\nSo that idea is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find the first occurrence of 2 followed by 1, and the last occurrence of 2 followed by 1. Then reverse the subarray from the first 2 to the last 1. That way, all the 2s and 1s in between are reversed, which would turn them into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. Let's find the first index where a 2 is followed by a 1. Let's call that i (so a[i] = 2, a[i+1] = 1). Similarly, find the last index j where a[j] = 2 and a[j+1] = 1. Then, if we reverse the subarray from the first occurrence of 2 (before the first transition) to the last occurrence of 1 (after the last transition), then that would fix all transitions.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, find the first occurrence of 2 followed by 1, and the last occurrence of 2 followed by 1. Then reverse the subarray from the first 2 to the last 1. Let's take the first example: [1,2,1,2]. The first transition is at position 1 (a[1]=2, a[2]=1). The last transition is at position 2 (a[2]=1, a[3]=2? No, wait. Wait the transitions are 2→1. So in the original array, the transitions are between positions 1-2 (2→1) and between 3-4 (2→1? No, a[3] is 1, a[4] is 2. So that's 1→2. So only one transition. Wait original array is 1 2 1 2. Transitions are 1→2 (good), 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (good). So only one bad transition. Then why after reversing [2,3], the array becomes non-decreasing. So that suggests that there was one bad transition, and reversing that part fixes it.\n\nBut in the second example given in the problem statement: the input is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. The original array has transitions from 2 to 1 at positions 5-6 (a[5]=2, a[6]=1), and also at position 9-10 (a[9]=2, a[10]=1). So two transitions. Reversing the subarray from position 3 to 7 (the 2,2,2,1,1) would turn it into 1,1,2,2,2. Then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. Wait, but then there's a transition from 2 to 1 at the end. So the LNDS would be 9 (the first 9 elements are non-decreasing, and the last 1 is a drop). So the answer is 9.\n\nSo in that case, reversing a subarray that covers the first transition but not the second. But how?\n\nSo the problem seems to be that the maximum LNDS can be achieved by eliminating as many transitions as possible. But how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array, but only if we can reverse a subarray that eliminates all those transitions. However, this might not be possible. For example, if there are two transitions, reversing a subarray can eliminate one of them, but not both. So the maximum LNDS would be n - (number of transitions - 1). But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum LNDS after reversal is the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1, plus 1. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the first example. Original transitions: 1. After reversal, transitions are 0. So the LNDS is 4 = 4 - 1 + 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is the original LNDS, or the maximum between the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in some way.\n\nWait, but since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is simply the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Or something along those lines.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s (if all 1s are chosen, ignoring the 2s), or\n\n- The number of 2s (if all 2s are chosen, ignoring the 1s), or\n\n- The number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, the array [1,2,1,2] has 2 ones and 2 twos. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But the maximum number of 1s plus the 2s after the last 1 would be 2 (number of 1s) plus 2 (the two 2s after the last 1, which is the third element). Wait, the last 1 is at position 3. The 2s after that are the fourth element. So 2+1=3. Which matches the LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last occurrence of 1. Or the number of 2s plus the number of 1s that come after the last occurrence of 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut regardless, how can we use this to solve the problem?\n\nThe idea is that reversing a subarray can change the positions of 1s and 2s. For example, if we have a segment that starts with some 2s followed by some 1s, reversing it would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which would contribute more to the LNDS.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS would be the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1 that cannot be fixed by a reversal.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe can precompute the number of 1s and 2s in the array. Let's say there are c1 1s and c2 2s. Then the maximum possible LNDS is min(c1 + c2, ...). Wait, no. The maximum possible is c1 + c2, which is n. But if the array can be made non-decreasing, then that's achievable.\n\nOtherwise, the maximum LNDS is (c1 + c2) - k, where k is the number of transitions from 2 to 1 minus 1. Because by reversing a subarray, we can eliminate one transition.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are m transitions from 2 to 1. Then, by reversing a subarray that covers all these transitions, we can eliminate m transitions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of transitions we can eliminate with one reversal is 1. Because reversing a subarray can fix one transition. For example, in the first example, there was 1 transition. Reversing the subarray that contains it removes it. In the second example, there were two transitions. Reversing a subarray that covers the first transition and some other parts may eliminate one transition, but the other remains.\n\nBut in the second example, the answer is 9, which is n-1. So the maximum possible LNDS is n-1.\n\nSo, if the original array has m transitions from 2 to 1, then the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is n - max(0, m - 1). Because by reversing a subarray, we can eliminate at least one transition.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFirst example: m = 1. So n - max(0, 1-1) = 4 - 0 = 4. Which matches.\n\nSecond example: m is 2. So n - (2-1) = 10 -1 =9. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: original array is [2,1,2,1]. m is 2 (transitions between 1-2 and 3-4). Then the maximum possible would be 4-1=3. Let's see. Reversing the entire array would give [1,2,1,2], same as before. Which has m=2. But if we reverse [1,2], we get [1,2,2,1], which has one transition. So the LNDS is 3 (1,2,2). Alternatively, reverse [2,3], which gives [2,2,1,1]. The LNDS is 2 (the first two 2s, or the last two 1s). Not better. So the maximum is 3. Which is 4-1=3.\n\nAnother example: original array [2,1,1,2]. m is 1 (transition between 1 and 2). Reversing the entire array would give [2,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No, wait original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversing the entire array gives [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No, wait the original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversing it would give [2,1,1,2] → [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No, wait [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No, no. The original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversed is [2,1,1,2] → wait no, the original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversed is [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No, no. Let's take the array as positions 1-4: elements 2, 1, 1, 2. Reversed, it becomes 2, 1, 1, 2 → no, wait the reversed array is [2, 1, 1, 2] reversed is [2, 1, 1, 2]? No, the original array is [2, 1, 1, 2]. Reverse it: [2, 1, 1, 2] becomes [2, 1, 1, 2] → no, wait the reversed array is [2,1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1,2] → no. Wait no. The reversed array would be [2, 1, 1, 2] → reversed is [2, 1, 1, 2] reversed is [2, 1, 1, 2]? No, that's not possible. Wait the original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversing it would give [2,1,1,2] → reversed is [2,1,1,2]? No! Wait the original array is [2,1,1,2]. The reversed array would be [2,1,1,2] → reversed is [2,1,1,2] → no, that's the same as the original array? No! Wait no. The original array is [2,1,1,2]. Reversed would be [2,1,1,2] → no, wait the elements are 2, 1, 1, 2. Reversed would be 2, 1, 1, 2? No, the first element is 2, the second is 1, third is 1, fourth is 2. Reversed is [2, 1, 1, 2] → same as original. Oh right! Because it's symmetric. So reversing it doesn't change it. So the original array is already symmetric. So the LNDS is 3 (like 2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.). But according to our previous formula, m=1. So the maximum would be 4 - (1-1) = 4. But the actual LNDS is 3. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWait that suggests that my previous hypothesis is wrong. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn this example, the original array is [2,1,1,2]. The transitions from 2 to 1 are between position 1 and 2 (2→1). There is also a transition from 1 to 2 between position 3 and 4. So m=1 (only one 2→1 transition). According to the formula, the maximum possible LNDS is 4 - (1-1) = 4. But the actual LNDS is 3. So the formula is wrong.\n\nSo what's the issue here?\n\nWell, in this case, even after reversing the subarray that contains the transition, the array may not become non-decreasing. Because the array is [2,1,1,2]. If we reverse the subarray [1,2], it becomes [1,2,1,2]. Which has two transitions (2→1 and 1→2). The LNDS is 3. If we reverse the entire array, it's the same as before. If we reverse [1,3], the subarray is [2,1,1], reversed to [1,1,2]. The new array is [1,1,2, 2], which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 4. So the maximum is indeed 4. But why didn't I think of that earlier?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because I forgot that there are other subarrays to reverse. So in this case, reversing [1,3] gives a non-decreasing array. So the formula holds.\n\nSo the formula seems to work. So the maximum possible LNDS is n - max(0, m - 1), where m is the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array. Let's call it m.\n\n2. If m == 0, then the array is already non-decreasing. So the answer is n.\n\n3. Else, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray is n - (m - 1) = n - m + 1.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, m=1, so answer is 4-1+1=4. Which is correct. Second example, m=2, answer is 10 -2 +1=9. Correct. For the example [2,1,1,2], m=1, answer is 4-1+1=4, which is correct. Another example with m=2, say [2,1,2,1], then answer is 4-2+1=3. Which matches the earlier example where the maximum is 3.\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array. Let that be m. Then the maximum possible LNDS is min(n, n - m + 1). Wait, but n - m + 1 could be larger than n? No, since m is at least 1, so n - m + 1 ≤ n.\n\nWait for example, if m is 0, then the answer is n. If m is 1, answer is n-1+1 = n. Which is correct. So the formula is:\n\nmax_lnds = n - max(0, m - 1)\n\nWait no. Wait when m is 0, then max_lnds is n. When m ≥1, then it's n - (m-1) ?\n\nYes. So:\n\nif m == 0: answer is n.\n\nelse: answer is n - (m - 1) = n - m + 1.\n\nBut why does this formula work?\n\nBecause by reversing a subarray that covers all the transitions, you can eliminate m transitions. But how?\n\nNo, according to the previous examples, it seems that by reversing a single subarray, you can eliminate at least one transition. And the maximum possible is to eliminate one transition, thus reducing the number of transitions by one, leading to m - 1 transitions. Thus, the LNDS is n - (m - 1) ?\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, the formula says that the maximum possible LNDS is n - (m - 1). Which equals (n - m + 1). For example, if the original array has m transitions from 2→1, then after reversing a subarray, the number of transitions is m - 1. Hence, the LNDS is n - (number of transitions) ?\n\nBut earlier examples suggest that the LNDS is n - (number of transitions). But in the first example, original transitions is 1, after reversal, transitions is 0. So LNDS is 4 = 4 - 0. Which fits. But according to the formula, the answer is n - (m - 1) = 4 - 0 = 4. Which matches.\n\nIn the second example, original m is 2. After reversal, the number of transitions is 1. So the LNDS is 10 - 1 = 9. Which matches the formula.\n\nSo the formula is that the maximum possible LNDS is n - (m - 1) = n - m + 1. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause the number of transitions from 2→1 is m. Each such transition reduces the LNDS by 1. By reversing a subarray, we can eliminate one such transition, thus reducing the number of transitions to m - 1, and the LNDS becomes n - (m - 1).\n\nBut why is the LNDS equal to n minus the number of transitions?\n\nThis seems to be the case for arrays of 1s and 2s. Let me think. For example:\n\nArray [1,2,1,2] has m=1 transition. The LNDS is 3. But according to the formula, n - m = 4-1=3. Which matches. After reversal, the transitions are 0, so the LNDS is 4 = 4 - 0.\n\nAnother example: array [2,1,1,2]. Original m=1. The LNDS is 3 (original array is 2,1,1,2. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,1,2 (length 3). But according to the formula, n - m = 4-1=3. Which matches. After reversing [1,3], the array is [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4 = 4-0.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. So the maximum possible LNDS is max between the original LNDS and (n - m + 1) ?\n\nWait no. Because the original LNDS is n - m_original, where m_original is the number of transitions in the original array. But when we reverse a subarray, we can reduce the number of transitions by 1. So the new number of transitions is m_original - 1. Thus, the LNDS is n - (m_original - 1) = n - m_original + 1.\n\nBut the original LNDS is n - m_original. So the new LNDS is larger than the original.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible LNDS is max(original_LNDS, n - m_original + 1). But since the original_LNDS is n - m_original, and n - m_original + 1 is larger than that, the maximum is n - m_original + 1.\n\nThus, the answer is to compute m, the number of 2→1 transitions, then the answer is n - m + 1 if m ≥ 1, otherwise n.\n\nWait, but what if there are other ways to reverse a subarray that reduces the number of transitions by more than one? For example, if there are two transitions, but reversing a subarray that covers both, thereby reducing the number of transitions by two.\n\nBut according to the previous example, the array [2,1,2,1] has m=2 transitions. If you reverse the entire array, you get [1,2,1,2], which has m=1 transitions. So the number of transitions is reduced by 1. So even though there are two transitions, reversing the entire array only reduces it by 1. So the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: array [2,2,1,1]. The transitions is 1 (from 2→1). Reversing the entire array gives [1,1,2,2], which has 0 transitions. So the number of transitions is reduced by 1. So the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: array [2,1,2,1,2,1]. m=3 transitions. Reversing the entire array would give [1,2,1,2,1,2], which has m=3 transitions (each 2→1 and 1→2 alternates). So the number of transitions is not reduced. But if we reverse a subarray from 1 to 3 (elements 2,1,2) → reversed to 2,1,2. No change. Hmm. What if we reverse the subarray from 1 to 2 (2,1) → becomes 1,2. The array becomes [1,2, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Now, the transitions are 2→1 (between 3-4) and 1→2 (4-5), 2→1 (5-6). So m=2. So the number of transitions is reduced by 1. So the formula holds.\n\nThus, regardless of how we reverse the subarray, we can reduce the number of transitions by at least 1, but not more than that. Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray is n - m + 1.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nCompute the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array. Let that be m. The answer is n - m + 1 if m ≥ 1, else n.\n\nWait, but what if the original array is already non-decreasing (m=0)? Then the answer is n. Which is correct.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 1 2 1 2. Transitions from 2 to 1: between index 1 and 2 (a[1]=2, a[2]=1). So m=1. Answer is 4 - 1 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Let's count the transitions from 2 to 1. The array is:\n\nIndices 0-based:\n\n0:1, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:1, 6:1, 7:2, 8:2, 9:1.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nBetween 0-1: 1-1 → no.\n\nBetween 1-2: 1-2 → no.\n\nBetween 2-3: 2-2 → no.\n\nBetween 3-4: 2-2 → no.\n\nBetween 4-5: 2-1 → yes. So m increases by 1.\n\nBetween 5-6: 1-1 → no.\n\nBetween 6-7: 1-2 → no.\n\nBetween 7-8: 2-2 → no.\n\nBetween 8-9: 2-1 → yes. So m=2.\n\nAnswer is 10 - 2 + 1 = 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,1,2]. m=1. Answer is 4-1+1=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,2,1]. m=2. Answer is 4-2+1=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,2,1,1]. m=1. Answer is 4-1+1=4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,2,1]. m=1. Answer is 4-1+1=4. Reversing the entire array gives [1,2,2,1] reversed → [1,2,2,1] → no. Wait, reversing [1,2,2,1] gives [1,2,2,1] → no. Wait, no. Wait the original array is [1,2,2,1]. The transitions are between 2 and 3 (2→2, no), between 3 and 4 (2→1, yes). So m=1. So answer is 4-1+1=4. How to achieve that? Reversing [2,4] (elements 2,2,1) → reversed to 1,2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of the given sequence. The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s, which simplifies our approach significantly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transitions**: The key insight is to count the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original sequence. These transitions are problematic because they break the non-decreasing order.\n2. **Impact of Reversal**: By reversing a subarray that contains these transitions, we can eliminate at least one such transition. This helps in increasing the length of the LNDS.\n3. **Formula Derivation**: If there are `m` transitions from 2 to 1 in the original sequence, reversing an appropriate subarray can reduce the number of these transitions by at least one. Therefore, the maximum possible length of the LNDS after reversal is given by `n - m + 1`, where `n` is the length of the sequence and `m` is the number of transitions from 2 to 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    m = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            m += 1\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(n)\n    else:\n        print(n - m + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Counting Transitions**: We iterate through the sequence to count the number of transitions from 2 to 1.\n3. **Determine Result**: If there are no transitions (`m == 0`), the sequence is already non-decreasing, so the result is `n`. Otherwise, the result is calculated using the formula `n - m + 1`, which accounts for the reduction in transitions by at least one through an optimal subarray reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 2000 elements.",
