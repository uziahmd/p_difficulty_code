For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again.\n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad has X to Y as 3 semitones and Y to Z as 4. So the total would be 7 as well, but the order of the intervals is different.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let's think about the order of the notes.\n\nThe notes are given in a specific order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the list is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, and after H comes C again.\n\nSo each note can be assigned an index. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11. Then, the distance between two notes when moving forward (from lower to higher) is (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. Wait, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the order, C is 0, then C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). So from C to E is 4 semitones. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (12 - (X - Y))? Or perhaps the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper note. Wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: from E to C, since it's the other way around. So if you have E (index 4) and C (index 0), then the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones? Because going forward from E, you have E to F (5?), but wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8. Let me think.\n\nThe problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. The distance between E and C is 8. So the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upwards. So for two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or perhaps the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? Wait, no. Because if X is E (4), Y is C (0). The distance from X to Y is (0 -4) mod 12? That would be 8. Which matches the example. So the formula for the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Wait, no. Because if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 -4) is -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Which is same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the formula is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to upper note, so for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y)).\n\nBut in code, to compute the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Indexing**: Assign each note an index based on their order in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is computed as the difference modulo 12, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor triad by verifying the required semitone intervals.\n4. **Classification**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4 and Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3 and Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Indexing**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This allows us to use arithmetic operations to calculate distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are checked against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: The function `classify_chord` checks each permutation and returns the appropriate classification based on whether the intervals match those of a major or minor triad. If none match, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the triad are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
