For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. From the description:\n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would then be 7 semitones. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad has X to Y as 3 semitones and Y to Z as 4 semitones. So the total from X to Z would be 7 semitones as well. Wait, but the order matters here. Because the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones when moving upwards. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones (C to C#, D, D#, E: that's four steps). But if the order was reversed, like E to C, the distance would be 8 semitones? Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper note. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of steps moving upwards from X to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be calculated as (Y - X + 12) mod 12? No, wait the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because you have to go up from E to C via the cycle. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two notes is taken from the lowest to the upper. So if you have two notes, say, X and Y, then the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So that's correct. Now, if you have E and C, the distance would be 8 semitones, because if you start at E and go up to C, you have to wrap around. So E to F is 1, F# 2, G 3, G# 4, A 5, A# 6, B 7, C 8. So yes, 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? But only if Y is higher than X. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y - X + 12) semitones. Wait, but that's equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always positive. Wait, no. For example, if X is E and Y is C, the distance is 8 semitones. Which is (C - E) mod 12? Let's see. Let's assign numbers to each note. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's say the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11. Then, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). But that's equivalent to (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but only if the distance is measured as the minimal steps in the upward direction. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. Because you have to wrap around. So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y",
