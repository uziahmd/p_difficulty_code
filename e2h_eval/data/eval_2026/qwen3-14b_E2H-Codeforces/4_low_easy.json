The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of times each player loses in n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequences work. For example, Nikephoros's sequence A is repeated cyclically. So for each round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B.\n\nThe main challenge here is handling the large n, which can be up to 2e9. So iterating through each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. For each round, determine which move each player makes.\n2. Determine who wins the round, if anyone.\n3. Count the number of losses for each player over all n rounds.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, and compute the number of losses in each cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the idea is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the pattern of moves will repeat. Therefore, the number of losses in each LCM-length cycle can be precomputed, and then we can calculate how many full cycles fit into n rounds, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n- For each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1, determine the moves of A and B, and compute the outcome. Then accumulate the total number of losses for each player in one full cycle.\n- The total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n- The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n- Multiply the per-cycle losses by total_cycles, then add the losses from the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut wait, what if the cycle_length is larger than n? Then there's only one partial cycle. But the approach still works.\n\nSo first, I need to compute the LCM of m and k. How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here.\n\nSo, compute GCD of m and k, then LCM is (m*k) // GCD.\n\nOnce I have the cycle_length, I can precompute for each position in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length - 1) what the moves are for A and B, and determine the outcome.\n\nBut how to get the moves for each round in the cycle?\n\nFor any round index i (starting from 0?), the move for A is A[i % m], and for B is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1, compute these moves.\n\nOnce I have that, for each i, determine if A beats B, B beats A, or it's a draw. Then accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce I have the per-cycle counts, then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the per-cycle counts. For example, for each of the cycle_length rounds, we can compute the outcome once, and sum them.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible cycle_length? Since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1000*1000=1e6. So for 1e6 rounds, even with 2e9, it's manageable. Because 1e6 is manageable for precomputing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute m and k as the lengths of the A and B strings.\n- Compute cycle_length = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the moves of A and B, and compute the number of losses for each player in this cycle.\n- Then, total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n- rem = n % cycle_length\n- total_a_loss = total_cycle_a_loss * total_cycles + sum of first rem rounds' a loss\n- same for total_b_loss.\n\nSo the key is to precompute for each round in the cycle, the outcome.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet me think. For each pair (a, b), where a is from A's move, and b is from B's move, determine who wins.\n\nThe",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. The challenge is to handle a very large number of rounds efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Strategy**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Nikephoros's sequence A and Polycarpus's sequence B repeat cyclically.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the pattern of moves repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of sequences A and B. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then use this to determine results for all rounds efficiently.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By precomputing the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of moves, we can then determine the total number of losses by multiplying the number of full cycles by the losses per cycle and adding the losses from any remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle\n    total_a_loss = 0\n    total_b_loss = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            total_b_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            total_a_loss += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    # Compute total from full cycles\n    total_a = total_a_loss * full_cycles\n    total_b = total_b_loss * full_cycles\n    \n    # Compute from the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of one full cycle of moves.\n3. **Precompute Losses**: For each round in one full cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is recorded. This gives the number of losses for each player in one cycle.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these cycles are calculated. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to accumulate the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating cycle pattern, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
