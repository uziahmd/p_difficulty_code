The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then check who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So simulating each round is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key here is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about the sequences. For Nikephoros, his sequence is A of length m. So for round i, his move is A[i % m]. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k].\n\nThe problem is to find, for each round from 0 to n-1, the moves of A and B, then determine who wins.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through all rounds. So we need to find the total number of rounds where A beats B, and vice versa, over all n rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the number of rounds where A's move beats B's move (so Nikephoros gets a pinch here, since he wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot). Wait no: if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. So for each round, we need to check who wins, and increment the count accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations. For each possible pair of (a, b) where a is from A's sequence and b is from B's sequence, we can precompute whether a beats b, or b beats a, or a draw.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the overall pattern of (a_i, b_j) pairs will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the same positions in their sequences will be repeated.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n- For each possible round in the period (from 0 to period_length - 1), determine which player wins, and count how many times each player loses in this period.\n\n- Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length.\n\n- The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\n- So the total number of losses for each player is (total_periods * losses_in_period) + losses_in_remainder.\n\nSo first, compute the number of losses in one full period (of length period_length), then multiply by the number of full periods, and add the losses in the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the losses in the period?\n\nFor each i in 0..period_length-1:\n\n- Find a_i = A[i % m]\n\n- Find b_i = B[i % k]\n\n- Determine if a beats b, or b beats a, or draw.\n\nThen, for each such i, we can accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since period_length could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. So for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. Which is manageable, because even 1e6 iterations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m and k as lengths of A and B.\n\n2. Compute LCM(m, k) as period_length.\n\n3. For each round in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\n   a. Get A's move: A[i % m]\n\n   b. Get B's move: B[i % k]\n\n   c. Determine outcome.\n\n   d. Count for each player how many times they lose in this period.\n\n4. Then, total_periods = n // period_length\n\n   remainder_rounds = n % period_length\n\n5. total_a_loses = total_periods * a_loses_in_period + count_loses_in_remainder\n\nSimilarly for b_loses.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute the number of a_loses and b_loses in the period.\n\n- Compute the number of a_loses and b_loses in the first 'remainder_rounds' rounds of the period.\n\nBut how to compute the count for the remainder?\n\nWe can precompute for each i in 0 to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results without simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. This means that the sequence of moves for both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This LCM represents the period after which the combined sequence of moves from both players repeats.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period (from 0 to LCM-1), determine the outcome of each round and count how many times each player loses.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full periods within the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full periods. Use the precomputed counts from the period to determine the total losses for each player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    a_loses = 0\n    b_loses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            b_loses += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            a_loses += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    total_a = total_periods * a_loses\n    total_b = total_periods * b_loses\n    \n    # Now calculate the remainder part\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B loses\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A loses\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is computed to determine the period after which the combined sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is checked. The number of losses for each player during this period is counted.\n4. **Handling Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods and the remaining rounds are calculated. The losses from full periods are multiplied by the number of periods, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to determine additional losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences and reduces the computational complexity significantly.",
