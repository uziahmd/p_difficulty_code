She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second she can move left or right by one, or close tabs to the left or right of the current position. Closing tabs to the left would close all tabs from a (the current min) up to i-1, and similarly for the right.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get to the desired state.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible scenarios. The desired tabs are [l, r]. So, any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nThe closing operations can be done in steps. For example, if the current cursor is at position x, then closing all tabs to the left would close everything from a to x-1. Similarly for the right. But after closing, the a and b values change. However, since we need to close all tabs outside [l, r], maybe we can think of two steps: closing all tabs to the left of l, and closing all tabs to the right of r. But how to do that optimally.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. For example, if we first close the left side, then the right side, or vice versa. Also, the position of the mouse affects how many steps are needed.\n\nLet me think about the cases where the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For example, if l=2, r=4, and pos is 3. Then, maybe we can just close the left and right parts. But how?\n\nBut first, we need to determine which tabs need to be closed. Let's consider that after all operations, the only open tabs are l to r. So, any tabs left of l must be closed, and any tabs right of r must be closed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to closing all tabs to the left of l and all to the right of r. But how to do that with minimal steps.\n\nBut the way to close them depends on where the mouse is. For instance, to close the tabs to the left of l, the mouse must be at l, and then close left. Or maybe at some position, but perhaps the optimal way is to first move to the correct position and then perform the close operation.\n\nWait, the close operation for left is closing all tabs from a (current min) to i-1. So, if you want to close all tabs to the left of l, you need to have the current position at l, and then close left. Because then the tabs from a (which is 1, assuming no previous closes) to l-1 will be closed. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, you need to be at r and close right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps. Like, if you can close both left and right in one operation. But that's probably not possible unless l and r are adjacent or something.\n\nSo, the plan is: find the steps required to reach the positions where you can close left and right, then add the steps for moving and closing.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, in the third sample input, the pos is 2, and l=1, r=5. So no need to do anything. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 6 3 1 3. So the desired tabs are 1-3. The current position is 3. So, the tabs to the right of 3 (tabs 4,5,6) need to be closed. How? The user can be at 3, and close all tabs to the right. That's one operation. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo, the steps needed are:\n\nFor closing the left part (tabs before l) and the right part (tabs after r). Let's think of each part separately.\n\nFirst, the left part. To close all tabs left of l, we need to have the mouse at l, then close left. Similarly, for the right part, we need to have the mouse at r, then close right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then moving takes zero steps. Then closing takes 1 second. But if the current position is not at l, then we need to move to l, which takes |pos - l| steps, then close left (1 second). Similarly for the right.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1? Then there are no tabs to the left of l, so no need to close anything.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Luba to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second and closing all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Movement Steps**:\n   - If there are tabs to the left of `l`, calculate the steps needed to move the cursor to `l` from the current position `pos`.\n   - If there are tabs to the right of `r`, calculate the steps needed to move the cursor to `r` from the current position `pos` (or from the position after closing the left tabs).\n3. **Close Tabs**: Each close operation (left or right) takes 1 second.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the desired range is already all tabs, no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate the steps needed to close left and right parts\n    steps = 0\n    # Check if there are tabs to the left of l\n    if l > 1:\n        # Need to move to l and close left\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        steps += 1  # close left\n    # Check if there are tabs to the right of r\n    if r < n:\n        # After closing left, the current position is l (if we moved there)\n        # Or pos (if we didn't move for left)\n        # But in the case where we had to move to l, the current position is l\n        # So to move to r from there\n        if l > 1:\n            steps += abs(l - r)\n        else:\n            steps += abs(pos - r)\n        steps += 1  # close right\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Tabs to Close**: We first check if there are tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`. If `l` is 1, there are no tabs to the left, and if `r` is `n`, there are no tabs to the right.\n- **Movement Steps**: For each side (left and right), we calculate the steps required to move the cursor to the appropriate position (`l` for closing left tabs and `r` for closing right tabs). If the cursor needs to be moved to `l` first, we then move from `l` to `r` to close the right tabs.\n- **Closing Operations**: Each close operation (left or right) takes exactly 1 second, so we add 1 second for each necessary close operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering both movement and closing operations in an optimal sequence.",
