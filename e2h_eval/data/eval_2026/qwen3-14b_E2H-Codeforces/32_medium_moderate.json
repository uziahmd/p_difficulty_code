    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I need to find the new max and min of the remaining elements and compute their difference. The goal is to find the minimum such difference possible after removing exactly one element.\n\nLet me think about the brute force approach first. For each element in the array, if I remove it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements. Then take the minimum of all those differences. But for n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the original array. The original max and min are known. If I remove an element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nFor example, if the element being removed is the current max, then the new max would be the second highest element. Similarly for the min. But if the element being removed is not the max or min, then the max and min remain the same. Wait, but maybe there are multiple instances of the max or min. Like if the array has multiple elements equal to the original max, then removing one of them won't change the max.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that when we remove an element, the new max and min depend on whether that element was part of the original max or min.\n\nLet me think: the original array's max is max_val and min is min_val. Now, if I remove an element that is not the max or min, then the new max and min are still the same as before. Therefore, the instability would be max_val - min_val. But if I remove a max element, then the new max is the second max. Similarly for removing a min element.\n\nBut how do I find the second max and second min? Well, perhaps I can precompute the sorted array. Let's think about sorting the array.\n\nSuppose the array is sorted. Then, the original max is the last element, the original min is the first. Now, if I remove the first element (the min), then the new min is the second element. The max remains the same. So the instability becomes (max - a[1]).\n\nSimilarly, if I remove the last element (the max), then the new max is a[-2], and the min remains a[0]. So instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut what if there are duplicates in the min or max?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7]. Original min is 1, max is 7. If I remove one of the 1s, the new min is 1 (since there's another 1 left). So the instability would be 7 - 1 = 6. But if I remove 7, the new max is 3, so instability is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo the problem is that when we remove an element, the new max and min can be determined by looking at the sorted array. However, the key is that when we remove an element, the new min is either the original min (if there are multiple copies) or the next element in the sorted array. Same for max.\n\nSo, here's an idea: the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering two cases:\n\n1. Remove the first occurrence of the min (so the new min is the next element in the sorted array)\n2. Remove the first occurrence of the max (so the new max is the previous element in the sorted array)\n3. Or, if the array has multiple minima or maxima, removing one of them may not affect the min or max.\n\nWait, but for the general case, the best possible instability after removing one element would be either:\n\n- The original instability minus the difference between the max and the next max (if we remove the max), or between the min and the next min (if we remove the min), or the original instability if we remove an element that's not a min or max.\n\nBut how can I find the best option?\n\nLet me think again. Let's sort the array. Then, for each element, if I remove it, what's the new max and min?\n\nBut for the sorted array, the min is a[0], max is a[-1]. If I remove a[0], the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove a[-1], the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. If I remove any element that's not the first or last in the sorted array, then the min and max remain the same. So the instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n\nSo the minimal instability would be the minimum between:\n\n- a[-1] - a[1] (when we remove the first element)\n- a[-2] - a[0] (when we remove the last element)\n- and the original instability (a[-1] - a[0]) if there are elements that are not min or max. But wait, if there are elements that are not min or max, then removing them would leave the min and max as before. So the instability is the same as original. So if the original instability is already the best, then that's the case.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if the array has multiple minima and maxima. Suppose the array is [1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5]. The original instability is 5 - 1 =4. If I remove one of the 1's, the instability is 5 - 1 =4. If I remove one of the 5's, the instability is 5 -1=4. But if I remove the 3, the instability is still 5-1=4. So in this case, the minimal instability is 4, same as original. But what if the array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 7, the instability is 5-1=4. If I remove 1, it's 7-3=4. So the minimal is 4. Which is better than the original.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]) and the original instability (if there are elements that are not min or max). But wait, in the case where the array has more than two elements, the original instability can be achieved by removing any element that is not the min or max. So if the array has n elements, and n >=3, then the original instability can be achieved by removing an element that is not min or max. But if n=2, then removing one element leaves only one element, so instability is zero.\n\nWait, but for the problem statement, n is at least 2. So for n=2, removing one element leaves one element, so the instability is 0. So for that case, the answer is 0.\n\nBut for n>2, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[0]) if there are elements that are not min or max. Wait, no. Because if there are elements that are not min or max, then removing them gives the same instability as the original. But if the original instability is a[-1]-a[0], and the other options (removing min or max) could give a lower value, then the minimal is the minimum of those options.\n\nBut in the case where the array has multiple minima and/or maxima, then removing a min or a max may not change the min or max. For example, array [1,1,3,7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove the first element (1), the new instability is 7-1=6. If we remove the last element (7), the instability is 3-1=2. So the minimal is 2. But according to the previous idea, the a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that for the sorted array, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]). Because when you remove the first element (the min), the instability is a[-1] - a[1], and when you remove the last element (the max), the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. Also, if there are elements that are not min or max, then removing them gives the original instability. So the minimal possible is the minimum between these two options and the original instability? Wait, no. Because the original instability is (a[-1] - a[0]), which is larger than (a[-2] - a[0]) or (a[-1] - a[1])?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 5, 7]. The original instability is 6. If you remove 7, the instability is 5-1=4. If you remove 1, it's 7-3=4. But the original instability is 6. So the minimal is 4, which is the minimum between the two options. So in this case, the answer is min( a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1] )\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Original instability is 3. If you remove 1, the instability is 4-2=2. If you remove 4, it's 3-1=2. But if you remove 2, the instability is 4-1=3. So the minimal is 2. Which is the min of (a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo in all these cases, the minimal instability is min( a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1] ). But why is that?\n\nBecause when you remove one element, the best possible scenario is either removing the min (so that the new min is a[1], but the max remains a[-1], leading to a[-1] - a[1]), or removing the max (so that the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0], leading to a[-2] - a[0]). Any other removal would leave the min and max as before, leading to the original instability. So the minimal possible is the minimum between those two options.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has more than one min or max?\n\nFor example, array [1, 1, 3, 7]. The original instability is 6. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2, which is a[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. The original instability is 6. Removing 7 gives instability 3-1=2. Removing the first 3 gives instability 7-1=6. So the minimal is 2, which is a[-2] - a[0] =3-1=2.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. The original instability is 2. If you remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If you remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is min(3-1=2, 2-1=1) → 1. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the formula is: after sorting the array, the answer is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, in the example where the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1. So 3-1=2. a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. 7-3=4. So the minimum between 2 and 4 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. After sorting, it's [1, 100000]. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem would be:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- If n == 2, the answer is 0.\n- Else, compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if the array has more than two elements, but removing some element in the middle reduces the instability?\n\nLike, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. The original instability is 6. If you remove 3, the instability is 7-1=6. If you remove 4, the instability is 7-1=6. If you remove 5, same thing. But if you remove 7, the instability is 5-1=4. If you remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. So the minimal is 4, which is the min between (a[-2] - a[0])=5-1=4 and (a[-1] - a[1])=7-3=4. So the answer is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If you remove 1, the instability is 6-2=4. If you remove 6, it's 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is min(5-1=4, 6-2=4) → 4.\n\nSo yes, the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, answer is 0.\n\nElse, the answer is min( (a[-2] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]) )\n\nWait, but what about when the array has multiple elements that are min or max?\n\nLike [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then, after removing any element, the instability is 0. Which is min( a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0, a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0 ) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The answer is min(4-1=3, 5-2=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, read list, sort it.\n\nif n == 2: print 0\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nWait, but what about if the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Then, the options are (7-1)=6 and (9-3)=6. So the answer is 6. Which is correct because removing the first element (1) gives instability 9-3=6, removing the last element (9) gives instability 7-1=6. But what if there's a better option? Like, if there's an element in the middle that when removed, the instability is lower. But in this case, the instability is 9-1=8, but removing the first or last element gives 6. So the answer is 6. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original instability is 8. So the answer is min(6, 6) =6. Which is better than the original. So the formula works.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut why isn't the original instability considered? Because in the case where the original instability is less than both options. But that's not possible. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3]. The original instability is 2. The options are (a[-2] - a[0]) = 2-1=1, and (a[-1] - a[1])=3-2=1. So the answer is 1. Which is better than the original. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. The original instability is 2. The options are a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1, and a[-1] - a[1] =3-2=1. So the answer is 1. Which is better than the original.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nBut in the case where the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7], the original instability is 6. The formula gives min(5-1=4, 7-3=4) → 4, which is better than the original. So the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n is 2, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7]. The options are a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2, and a[-1] -a[1] is 7-1=6. So the min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. The options are a[-2] -a[0] is 3-1=2, a[-1]-a[1] is 7-3=4. So min is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1 → 2.\n\noption2: a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3 → 4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. n=2 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. sorted [1,2,3]. option1 is 2-1=1, option2 is 3-2=1. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. sorted [1,1,1]. option1 is 1-1=0, option2 1-1=0. So output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. options are 4-1=3, 5-2=3 → output 3.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead n, then the list. Sort it. Then, if n == 2, print 0. Else, compute the two options and take the min.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nsort a.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 3?\n\nFor example, [1, 3, 5]. Removing 1 gives instability 5-3=2. Removing 5 gives 3-1=2. Removing 3 gives 5-1=4. So the answer is 2. Which is min( a[-2] -a[0] =3-1=2, a[-1]-a[1] =5-3=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for the input, the first line is n, then the second line is the array.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print( min(option1, option2) )\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, array [1,3,3,7]. sorted [1,3,3,7]. option1 is a[-2] =3, a[0]=1 → 2. option2 is 7 - a[1]=3 → 4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, [1, 100000] → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 100]. sorted [1,1,100]. option1 is 1-1=0, option2 is 100 - 1 =99. min is 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the 100, the array becomes [1,1], instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 100, 100]. sorted [1, 100, 100]. option1 is a[-2] (100) - a[0] (1) → 99. option2 is a[-1] (100) - a[1] (100) → 0. So min is 0. Which is correct. Removing the first element (1), the array is [100, 100], instability 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, this approach should work for all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. When we remove an element, the instability of the remaining array can be minimized by considering two scenarios:\n   - Removing the minimum element, which would change the minimum value of the array.\n   - Removing the maximum element, which would change the maximum value of the array.\n\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps efficiently determine the minimum and maximum values after removing one element. Once sorted, the minimum value is at the start and the maximum value is at the end of the array.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: After sorting the array, the minimum instability after removing one element can be found by considering two cases:\n   - Removing the first element (minimum) and calculating the instability between the new minimum (second element) and the original maximum (last element).\n   - Removing the last element (maximum) and calculating the instability between the original minimum (first element) and the new maximum (second last element).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the array.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum values.\n3. **Handling Edge Case for n=2**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing either will result in an array with a single element, thus zero instability.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Instability**: For arrays with more than two elements, the minimum instability is determined by considering the two scenarios mentioned above. The minimum of these two scenarios gives the desired result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
