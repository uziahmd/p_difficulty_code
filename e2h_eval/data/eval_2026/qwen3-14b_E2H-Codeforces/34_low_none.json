And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day window, I need to compute the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. Then output that average with enough decimal places.\n\nHmm, the first thing I think is that for each week (each consecutive k days), I need to calculate the sum. But if I do this naively, for each of the (n - k + 1) weeks, adding up k elements each time, that would be O(n*k) time. But since n can be up to 2e5, that would be 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations, which is way too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right, sliding window technique! Let's think about that. The sum for the first week is a1 + a2 + ... + ak. Then for the next week, it's a2 + a3 + ... + a(k+1). So the difference between consecutive weeks is that we subtract a1 and add a(k+1). So if I can compute the initial sum, then each subsequent sum can be calculated in O(1) time by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the new element entering.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum.\n3. Then, for each next window (from i=1 to i = n -k), subtract a[i-1] and add a[i + k -1], then add to the total.\n4. Finally, divide the total by the number of weeks (which is n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nThis approach would be O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nLet me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The initial sum is 3+4=7. Then the next window is 4+7=11. Total sum is 7+11=18. Number of weeks is 2, so average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: n=1, k=1. The sum is just the single element. Divided by 1, same as the element.\n\nThird example: n=8, k=2. The weeks are [1,2], [2,4], [4,100000], [100000,123], [123,456], [456,789], [789,1]. Wait no, wait n=8, k=2. So there are 8-2+1=7 weeks. The sum of each week is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = Let's calculate that step by step.\n\n3+6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750. Then divide by 7. Let me see what the sample output says. The third example's output is 28964.2857142857. Let me check 202750 /7. Let's compute 202750 divided by 7. 7*28964 = 202748. Then 202750-202748=2. So 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.285714..., which matches the sample. So the approach works.\n\nSo the plan is to compute the initial sum, then slide the window, accumulating the total sum. Then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, read n and k from input. Then read the list of a's.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day weeks from a given list of n days. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each k-day window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive window. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: Accumulate the sum of all window sums and then compute the average by dividing by the number of valid windows (n - k + 1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        # Read n and k\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            a = []\n        else:\n            a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n            idx += 1\n        # Process the case\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        if total_weeks == 0:\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            continue\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total = current_sum\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n            total += current_sum\n        average = total / total_weeks\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the potentially large size. The input is split into lines, and each line is processed sequentially.\n- **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the first k elements is computed once. For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, which is optimal for the given constraints. This ensures that even for the maximum input size, the solution remains efficient and feasible within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements, ensuring that both absolute and relative errors are within acceptable limits.",
