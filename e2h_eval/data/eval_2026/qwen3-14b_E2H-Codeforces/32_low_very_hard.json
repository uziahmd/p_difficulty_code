    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the max minus min of the array. So, I need to figure out which element to remove so that the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining elements is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, then find the minimum instability. But with n up to 1e5, that approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, what's the key here? The instability after removing one element depends on the max and min of the array after removal. But if the original array has a certain max and min, removing one element can only affect the max or min if that element was the original max or min.\n\nWait, but when you remove an element, the new max could be the previous max (if the element removed wasn't the max) or the next highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the maximum element or the minimum element. But wait, maybe not. For example, if there are multiple maxima or minima. Let's think of an example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the instability becomes 3-1=2. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So in this case, removing the max gives a better result. But suppose another array like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. But if we remove 3, the instability is 5-1=4. So in this case, removing either end gives better results. So perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max or the first occurrence of the min. But maybe not. What if the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6]. The original instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, instability is 6-2=4. But if we remove one of the middle 5s, the instability is 6-1=5. So in that case, removing the ends is better.\n\nBut how do we generalize this? The idea is that the minimal instability after removing one element is either:\n\n- The original max minus the min of the array after removing the max (so the new max is the second max, but the min remains the same).\n\nOr:\n\n- The original max minus the min after removing the min (so the new min is the second min, and the max remains the same).\n\nOr:\n\n- If there are multiple max or min elements, removing one of them might not change the overall max or min. For example, if there are two max elements, removing one leaves the other as the max. So in that case, the instability would be (max - min) if we remove one of the max elements. Wait, no. If the original array has multiple max elements, then removing one of them would leave the rest. So the max remains the same. The min remains the same. So the instability is the same as before. But if we have multiple max elements, then maybe removing one of them doesn't help. However, if the array has multiple max and min elements, perhaps removing one of them can help.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to remove exactly one element. So, for example, if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1], then removing any element gives instability 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the key observation here is that the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where we remove the first element, the last element, or some other element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either:\n\n- Removing the first element (so the new array is a[1..n-1], and the instability is max(a[1..n-1]) - min(a[1..n-1])).\n\n- Or removing the last element (similar).\n\nBut that's not sufficient. Because for example, in the first sample input, the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The best is to remove 7. But if we consider only removing the first or last element, then removing the first element (1) gives instability 7-3=4. Removing the last element (7) gives instability 3-1=2. Which is",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. When we remove an element, the new instability depends on the remaining elements.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal element to remove is either the smallest or the largest element, or one of the duplicates of these extremes. This is because removing such elements can potentially reduce the difference between the new maximum and minimum.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the max and min for every possible removal (which would be inefficient), we can consider the following:\n   - If we remove the first element, the new instability is based on the remaining elements.\n   - Similarly, if we remove the last element, we compute the instability again.\n   - Additionally, we need to check the instability when removing the smallest or largest elements, considering their positions in the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute prefix min and max\n    prefix_min = [0] * n\n    prefix_max = [0] * n\n    prefix_min[0] = a[0]\n    prefix_max[0] = a[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n        prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n    \n    # Precompute suffix min and max\n    suffix_min = [0] * n\n    suffix_max = [0] * n\n    suffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\n    suffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n        suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check removing each element\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[1]\n            current_max = prefix_max[1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            current_min = suffix_min[0]\n            current_max = suffix_max[0]\n        else:\n            current_min = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n            current_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n        instability = current_max - current_min\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing one leaves a single element, so the instability is zero.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays store the minimum and maximum values up to each index (prefix) and from each index to the end (suffix). This helps in quickly determining the min and max of the array excluding any specific element.\n4. **Iterate Through Elements**: For each element, compute the instability of the array after removing that element using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays. Track the minimum instability encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
