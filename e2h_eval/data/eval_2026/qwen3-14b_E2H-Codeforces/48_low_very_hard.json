            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. Oh right, and there's some specifics about Roman numerals here. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. My job is to convert this c into base b, which could be a regular base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be Roman numerals.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Let's think. The input c is a string of digits (possibly with letters for bases higher than 10). For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (but the problem says that when converting to Roman, the number is up to 3000 in decimal, but for other cases, it's up to 1e15). So the first step is to parse the input string as a number in base a, converting it to decimal.\n\nWait, but how to handle letters in the input? Like, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, that's 10. So the code needs to process each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal value. For example, for each character in c, we need to map it to its corresponding value. For example, digits 0-9 are 0-9, letters A-Z are 10 and up. But the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros, but that's okay for the conversion.\n\nSo the first part: converting c (base a) to decimal.\n\nOnce that's done, then the second part: converting the decimal number to base b. But if b is 'R', then we need to convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string.\n\nLet me break down each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Let's think about how to do that. For each digit in the string, we need to get its value. For example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, it's 10. So the code should process each character, converting it to its numerical value. For example, for a given character, if it's a digit, then it's int(c), else it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But need to make sure that the digits are valid for base a. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to check for invalid digits.\n\nSo the function to convert a string in base a to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. For example, if a is 2 and c is 1000...0 (with 1000 1's), then the decimal value could be up to 2^1000, which is a very big number. But in Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so that's okay.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow the second part: converting the decimal number to base b, or to Roman numerals.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. So we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z as needed. Also, the output must not have leading zeros.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 0, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, maybe the input could be zero? Wait, the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is guaranteed not to be zero. For other cases, the input may be zero?\n\nWait the input says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero. But when converting to another base, the number could be zero. For example, if the input c is 0 in base a, then converting to base b (non-R) would be 0.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to decimal, and then converting the decimal value to the target base `b` or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is provided in base `a`. We first convert this number into its decimal (base 10) equivalent. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding decimal value, and accumulating the result.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a numerical base or Roman numerals:\n   - If `b` is a numerical base, convert the decimal number to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters (digits and letters for bases greater than 10).\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman numeral symbols, following the rules of Roman numeral construction.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        for part in parts:\n            if not part:\n                continue\n            a_part, c_part = part.split('\\n')\n            a_str, b_str = a_part.split()\n            a = int(a_str)\n            b = b_str\n            c = c_part\n            # Convert c from base a to decimal\n            decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n            # Now convert to target base\n            if b == 'R':\n                roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n                print(roman)\n            else:\n                base = int(b)\n                converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n                print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with each line containing the bases and the number to convert.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input number, converting it to its decimal equivalent by iterating through each digit and accumulating the result.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - For numerical bases, the function `decimal_to_base` repeatedly divides the decimal number by the target base, collecting remainders which are then converted to the appropriate characters.\n   - For Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_roman` uses a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation by subtracting the largest possible values from the decimal number until it reaches zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles both large numbers and special cases like Roman numerals, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
