She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So the goal is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The initial state has all tabs open from 1 to n. The cursor is at pos. She needs to end up with only tabs from l to r open. So any tabs outside this range must be closed. The challenge is to find the minimal time to do this.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe she doesn't need to do anything if l to r is the entire range. But if there are tabs outside that range, she needs to close them.\n\nBut how do the operations work? Closing tabs to the left or right of the current position. But when you close tabs, the a and b values (the min and max of the open tabs) change. So, for example, if she closes all tabs to the left of her current position, then the new a becomes the current position's index. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut since the problem requires that after all operations, the open tabs are exactly [l, r], perhaps we need to find the steps to close all tabs left of l and right of r.\n\nSo the problem reduces to closing the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nLet me think about the order in which she can perform these operations. For example, if she needs to close tabs on both sides, she might need to first move to the correct position to close one side, then move to the other side, etc.\n\nBut perhaps there are different cases based on where the current position is relative to l and r.\n\nLet me consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, she can possibly close the left and right parts. However, the way to do that depends on whether she needs to close tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r.\n\nFor example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current position is 3. Then, she needs to close tabs to the left of 2 (i.e., tab 1) and to the right of 4 (tabs 5 and 6 if n is 6). How can she do that?\n\nShe can first move to tab 2, close all tabs to the left (which would take 1 second: moving to 2 from 3 takes 1 second, then closing left takes another second. Then, she needs to move to tab 4 (or 5?), then close the right. Wait, but after closing the left, the a is 2, and the b is 6. So when she closes the right, she needs to be at a position where she can close the tabs to the right. For example, if she is at 4, then closing the right would close tabs from 5 to 6. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal approach is to first close all tabs to the left of l, then close all tabs to the right of r. Or vice versa. But how to get to the positions needed for those closes.\n\nLet me think about the steps required for closing the left part. Suppose that the current position is pos, and we need to close all tabs to the left of l. To do that, she needs to be at position l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at position r, then close all tabs to the right.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n- Move to l, close left (if needed)\n- Move to r, close right (if needed)\n\nBut what if l is already the leftmost tab? Then no need to close left. Similarly for r.\n\nSo, the problem breaks down into two parts: closing the left side (tabs < l) and closing the right side (tabs > r). Let's consider each part.\n\nFirst, check if l is 1. If so, no need to close left. Similarly, if r is n, no need to close right.\n\nSo, the steps required would be:\n\nIf we need to close the left side:\n\n- Move from current position to l (taking |pos - l| seconds)\n- Then, close left (1 second)\n\nIf we need to close the right side:\n\n- Move from current position (after closing left) to r (taking |current_pos_after_left_close - r| seconds)\n- Then, close right (1 second)\n\nBut wait, after closing the left, the current position is l. Because when you close tabs to the left of the current position, the current position remains. So, for example, if you are at l, and you close all tabs to the left (which is nothing if l is 1), but if you are at l, then closing left would close tabs from a to i-1, where a is the current min. But after closing, the new a is l, and the current position is still l.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you close tabs to the left, you close [a, i-1], and after that, a and b are updated. But perhaps the movement is constrained by the current a and b. But when you perform the close operation, the a and b change, which affects the possible movements.\n\nBut in this problem, since we are trying to close the left and right parts, perhaps the optimal path is to first close the left part (if needed) and then close the right part (if needed). However, the movement steps may vary depending on the order.\n\nBut perhaps there's another scenario where you can close both left and right in a more efficient way. For example, if the current position is to the left of l, but you need to close tabs to the left of l. Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired tabs are 2,3,4. So need to close tabs 1,5,6.\n\nThe optimal steps according to the note:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 sec), then close left (tabs to the left of 2, which is tab 1. That takes 1 sec. Then, move to tab 3 (current position is 2, then move to 3 (1 sec), then move to 4 (another sec), then close right (tabs to the right of 4, which is 5 and 6. That takes 1 sec. Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 seconds. Wait, but the steps are:\n\nMovement steps: moving from 3 to 2 (1s), close left (1s). Then move to 3 (1s), move to 4 (1s), close right (1s). Total 5 steps. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut another approach: What if she closes the right first?\n\nSuppose she moves to 4 (from 3, 1 sec), then close right (tabs 5 and 6). Then, move to 2 (from 4, 2 steps?), then close left. Let's see:\n\nOriginal pos is 3. Move to 4: 1 sec. Close right (1 sec). Now, the tabs are 1,2,3,4. Then, need to close tabs to the left of l=2, which is tab 1. So, move to 2 (current position is 4, so move left to 3 (1 sec), then to 2 (another sec). Then close left (1 sec). That's 1 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) = 5 seconds. Same total.\n\nSo the order of closing left and right may not affect the total time, but depends on the movement steps.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAnother example: if the current position is within the desired range, but needs to close both left and right. So, the minimal steps would be:\n\nTime to move to l (if needed) + 1 (close left) + time to move to r (from l) + 1 (close right). Or alternatively, time to move to r (if needed) + 1 (close right) + time to move to l (from r) + 1 (close left). Which is better?\n\nDepends on the positions. For example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and current position is 3. Then moving to l (distance 1) then moving to r (distance 2 steps) gives 1+2=3 steps for movement. Alternatively, moving to r (distance 1) then moving to l (distance 2 steps) gives same 3 steps. So total steps would be 3+2=5 (since adding the two closes).\n\nBut in this case, the total steps are same regardless of the order.\n\nBut what if l and r are such that moving to l first is better than moving to r first?\n\nFor example, suppose pos is 1, l is 3, r is 5, and n is 6. So need to close left (tabs 1 and 2) and right (tabs 6). So, current position is 1. How to proceed?\n\nOption 1: Close left first? But current position is 1, so closing left would not do anything (since a is 1). So can't close left. So need to move to l=3. Then, close left (tabs 1-2). Then move to r=5, close right (tab 6). So steps:\n\nMove from 1 to 3: 2 steps. Close left (1 step). Then move from 3 to 5 (2 steps). Close right (1 step). Total: 2+1+2+1=6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if you first move to r=5 (from pos 1: 4 steps), close right (tabs 6). Then move to l=3 (from 5: 2 steps), close left (tabs 1-2). Steps: 4+1 + 2 + 1 = 8 steps. Which is worse. So in this case, moving to l first is better.\n\nSo the order matters. So how can we model this?\n\nSo the problem is that when you have to close both left and right parts, the order in which you close them affects the movement steps. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities (close left first then right, or close right first then left) and choose the minimal between the two.\n\nBut how?\n\nSo for the general case, the steps would be:\n\nIf we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and close right (r < n):\n\nWe can calculate two options:\n\nOption A: Close left first, then close right.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then close left.\n\nTake the minimal between them.\n\nBut how to compute each option?\n\nFor option A:\n\nTime to move from initial pos to l (distance |pos - l|) → then close left (1 sec). Then, after closing left, the current position is l. Now, need to move to r (distance |l - r|) → then close right (1 sec). So total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nFor option B:\n\nTime to move from initial pos to r (distance |pos - r|) → then close right (1 sec). Then, after closing right, current position is r. Need to move to l (distance |r - l|) → then close left (1 sec). Total steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo compare option A and B and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, maybe there's a better way. For example, if after closing left, the current position is l, and closing right can be done from there. But in that case, the movement from l to r is |l - r| steps. So the formula above holds.\n\nBut what if the current position after closing left is l, and the r is to the right of l. Then, moving to r takes |l - r| steps. Then closing right.\n\nSo the calculation is correct.\n\nBut what about when l and r are adjacent? Like l=2, r=3. Then |l - r| is 1. So the movement steps are 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the total steps for option A is |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is 3, l=2, r=4. Then, moving to l is 1 step (from 3 to 2), then moving to r is 2 steps (from 2 to 4). So total movement steps is 1 + 2 = 3, plus 2 for the closes. So 5 steps, which matches the first sample.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already l? For example, pos is l. Then moving to l is zero steps. Then moving to r is |l - r| steps. So total steps would be 0 + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut what about if we don't need to close left or right? For example, when l=1 and r=n. Then, no steps are needed. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nWe need to check if we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or close right (r < n). Then, depending on that, compute the required steps.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, then answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the steps needed for closing left and/or right.\n\nSo, the cases are:\n\nCase 1: Need to close left and right.\n\nThen, compute both options (A and B) as above, take the minimum.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left only (r == n). Then steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 3: Need to close right only (l == 1). Then steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what about when we need to close left, but after moving to l, we can close left, but maybe there's a way to do it faster?\n\nWait, no. Because to close the left, you have to be at l, and then close left. So the steps are moving to l (|pos - l| steps) and then 1 second to close. So total |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly for closing right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then, moving steps is zero. So steps is 1.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l and we need to close left? Then, the steps are 1.\n\nBut wait, if l is 1, then there's nothing to close on the left. So that's not the case.\n\nSo, the overall steps can be computed as follows:\n\nIf the desired segment is the entire range (l=1 and r=n): 0 steps.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the steps required to close left and/or right.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about variables:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2\n\n   option2 = (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   total = distance from pos to l + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   total = distance from pos to r + 1\n\nBut wait, why? Because when you need to close left, you move to l and close left. When you need to close right, you move to r and close right. But in the case where you need to close only left, you don't need to move anywhere else. So the steps are moving to l (distance |pos - l|) and then 1 second to close left.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the left part? For example, pos is 1, l is 2, and r is n. Then, need to close left (tabs to the left of l=2, which is tab 1). So to close left, you need to be at l=2. So moving from pos (1) to l (2) is 1 step. Then close left (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nBut if the current position is already at l (say pos is 2, l is 2), then steps are 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of l, but you need to close left. For example, pos is 3, l is 2, and r is n. Then moving to l is 1 step, then close left. So 2 steps.\n\nBut what if there's a way to close left without moving? Like, if the current position is already at l. Then, you can close left immediately.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the case where you have to close left and right, the formula for option1 is |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2. But why is that?\n\nBecause:\n\nMove to l (|pos - l| steps) → close left (1 sec). Then move to r (|l - r| steps) → close right (1 sec). So total steps: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nSame for option2: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut |r - l| is same as |l - r|, so option1 and option2 differ only in the first term.\n\nSo the code would need to compute both options and take the minimum.\n\nBut what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nLike in the first sample input, where pos is 3, l=2, r=4. So |pos - l| is 1, |l - r| is 2. So option1 is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is '6 3 1 3'. So l=1, r=3. So need to close right (since r=3 < 6). So right_needed is true. left_needed is false (since l=1). So steps are |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3, r is 3. So steps are 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input: '5 2 1 5' → l=1, r=5. So no steps needed. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: if l=3, r=5, n=5. So no need to close right. But l is 3, so need to close left (tabs 1 and 2). So steps would be |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo, what about if pos is 1, l=3. Then steps are |1-3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. So move to 3 (two steps), then close left (1 step). Which would close tabs 1 and 2.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the left of l? For example, pos is 1, l=3. So to close left, you need to move to l (3), then close left. Which would close tabs 1, 2. But when you are at 3, closing left would close all tabs to the left of 3 (i.e., 1 and 2). Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of l? Like pos is 4, l=3. Then, moving to l (3) takes 1 step. Close left (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, what about when the current position is already on the left of l? Like, l=3, pos=2. Then, need to move to l (3) which is 1 step, then close left (tabs 1 and 2). So steps are 1 + 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to be correct.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: l = r. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. So need to close all tabs except 3. So need to close left (tabs 1,2) and right (tabs 4,5). So left_needed is true (l=3>1), right_needed is true (r=3 <5). So compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1: |pos - l| (0) + |l - r| (0) + 2 → 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.\n\noption2: |pos - r| (0) + |r - l| (0) + 2 → same 2. So total is 2 steps. How?\n\nMove to l (already there), close left (tabs 1-2). Then move to r (same position) and close right (tabs 4-5). So steps: 1 (close left) + 1 (close right) = 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother Edge Case: l=1, r= n. So answer is 0.\n\nEdge Case: pos is already at l and need to close right. For example, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=3. Need to close right (tabs 4,5). So steps are |pos - r| (distance from 2 to 3 is 1) + 1 → 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step) and close right (1 step).\n\nAnother Edge Case: l=2, r=3, pos=1. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). So left_needed is true (l=2>1), right_needed is true (r=3 <5). Compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1: |1-2| (1) + |2-3| (1) + 2 → 1+1+2=4.\n\noption2: |1-3| (2) + |3-2| (1) + 2 → 2+1+2=5. So min is 4 steps.\n\nHow?\n\nOption1: move to l=2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). Then move to r=3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4,5). Total steps: 1+1+1+1=4 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother Edge Case: l=1, r=3, pos=5. Need to close right (tabs 4,5). So steps are |5 - 3| + 1 = 2 +1 =3 steps. So move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then close right (tabs 4,5). Correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nThe input is four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nWe need to compute the minimal steps.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if left_needed and right_needed.\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nSo:\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n   option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   # this is impossible because we checked l==1 and r==n earlier.\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 but r <n. Then left_needed is false (since l=1), but right_needed is true. So the code will handle that.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r <n. Then, the code would compute the steps for closing right.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is 2, l=1, r=3. Then steps to close right (tabs 4,5, etc) would be |2 - r| + 1. For example, if r=3 and n=5, then steps would be |2 - 3| +1 = 1+1=2 steps.\n\nYes, that's correct. Move to 3 (1 step) and close right (1 step).\n\nBut what if the current position is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3. pos=4. Need to close right. So steps: |4-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Which would be moving from 4 to 3 (1 step), then close right (tabs 4,5, etc). Correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already to the right of r? For example, l=1, r=3, pos=5. Then steps to close right (tabs 4,5) is |5 - 3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Which is correct: move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then close right (tabs 4 and 5). But when you are at 3, closing right would close tabs from 4 to n (which is 5). So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of r, but you need to close right. So you need to move to r, then close right. Which is exactly what the code does.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. So left_needed is true (2>1), right_needed is true (4<6). So:\n\noption1 = |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\noption2 = |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So min is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3 1 3. l=1, r=3. So left_needed is false (l=1). right_needed is true (3<6). So steps are |3 - 3| +1 → 0 +1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 3. So l=1, r=3. Need to close right (r=3 <5). steps is |2 -3| +1 → 1 +1 = 2 steps. Let's see:\n\nCurrent pos is 2. Move to 3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4,5). So total 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 1 3. So need to close right (tabs 4 and 5). steps: |5 - 3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. Which would be moving from 5 to 3 (steps 2), then close right (1 step). Correct.\n\nWhat about when l=2, r=3, pos=1, n=5. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). So left_needed is true (2>1), right_needed is true (3<5). So:\n\noption1: |1-2| + |2-3| + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 =4.\n\noption2: |1-3| + |3-2| + 2 → 2 +1 +2 =5. So min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when l=3, r=5, pos=1. So need to close left (tabs 1 and 2) and right (none, since r=5 = n). So right_needed is false. So steps: |1 -3| +1 → 2 +1=3 steps. Because you need to close left. So move from 1 to 3 (2 steps), then close left (tabs 1 and 2). Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, pos=5. So need to close left (tabs 1,2). steps is |5-3| +1 → 2 +1 =3 steps. So move from 5 to 3 (2 steps), close left (1 step). Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this logic in Python.\n\nThe code should read the input, which is four integers. But the input is given as a list of multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with four integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads a single line of input. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line with four integers. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print the output. So for the code submission, it's likely that the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, the user may have provided multiple test cases in the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers ... \n\nSo the code must read a single line with four integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines, but the sample output has three outputs. So perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, but the code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a line in the input.\n\nBut the original problem's input is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first line of the sample input is '6 3 2 4' and the output is 5. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a line. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases.\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, which may have multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, there are three lines, each representing a test case, and the output is three lines.\n\nTherefore, the code should read multiple lines from input, each line being a test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nBut the problem statement's input says that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut to resolve this, perhaps the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that each line in the input is a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code should read multiple lines, each line containing four integers, and output the answer for each line.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single line. But that's likely a mistake in translation or formatting. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the input is multiple lines, and the problem statement says \"the input consists of T test cases, each given as a line...\".\n\nAssuming that the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a line in the input, with four integers per line.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines from stdin, split each line into four integers, and compute the answer for each.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each line:\n\nsplit into n, pos, l, r.\n\ncompute the answer as per the logic above.\n\nprint the answer.\n\nBut how to read input in Python? Well, in Python, the code can read from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then process each line.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code should read one line, but the sample shows multiple lines. However, given the sample, I'll proceed with the assumption that the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a line in the input.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's sample input is formatted incorrectly. For example, the user may have pasted the sample input as a list of strings, but the actual input is one line per test case.\n\nSo, the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut now, let's write the code.\n\nNow, implementing the logic:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # this is impossible since l ==1 and r ==n is handled earlier\n\n        print(0)\n\nWait, but what about cases where l=1 and r <n? For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then left_needed is false (since l=1), right_needed is true. So code enters the elif right_needed block.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r=n? Then, the first condition is true, and output is 0.\n\nBut what if l=1, r=n, but the code is in the else clause? No, because the first condition checks if l ==1 and r ==n.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. So left_needed and right_needed are true. option1 is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. option2 is 1 + 2 + 2 =5. So min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. So left_needed is false. right_needed is true. So steps: |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when l=1 and r=3, n=5, pos=5. So steps are |5-3| +1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Determine Needs**: Check if there are tabs to close on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Steps**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need closing, compute two possible strategies:\n     - Close left first, then move to the right and close it.\n     - Close right first, then move to the left and close it.\n   - Choose the strategy with the minimum steps.\n   - If only left or right tabs need closing, calculate the steps required to move to the respective end of the segment and close the tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        left_needed = l > 1\n        right_needed = r < n\n        if left_needed and right_needed:\n            option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n            option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n            print(min(option1, option2))\n        elif left_needed:\n            print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n        elif right_needed:\n            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs, no action is needed.\n- **Left and Right Tabs Check**: Depending on whether tabs need to be closed on the left, right, or both sides, different strategies are employed.\n- **Strategy Calculation**: When both sides need closing, two potential paths are evaluated to find the minimum steps required. This ensures optimal movement and closing operations, minimizing the total time spent.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimum number of operations by leveraging direct calculations based on the positions and required segment.",
