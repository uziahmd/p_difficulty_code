Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking digits from the front of A, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And I have to output the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum sum. If there are multiple options, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. The challenge here is figuring out the optimal way for Homer and Marge to choose their moves. Since each choice affects the remaining digits and the future choices, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. But given that n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So the state space might be manageable with memoization.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible states. At any point in time, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of moves made so far. But more importantly, the state depends on how many moves Homer and Marge have already made. For example, if Homer has made h moves and Marge m moves, then the total moves made is h + m. Since each must make exactly n moves, we can track the current state as (h, m), and the current position in the string.\n\nWait, but the digits are taken from the front. So the current state is determined by how many digits have been taken already. Let me think: the original A is a string of 2n digits. Each move takes the first digit. So after k moves, the remaining digits are A[k:]. Therefore, the state can be represented by the current index (i.e., how many digits have been taken so far), and the counts of Homer's and Marge's moves. However, since each move is either Homer or Marge taking a digit, the number of moves made so far is i. Also, the counts of Homer and Marge's moves must satisfy h + m = i, and h ≤ n, m ≤ n. \n\nSo, the state can be represented by (i, h), because m = i - h. Because once we know i (number of digits taken so far) and h (how many Homer has taken), m is determined. Also, since each move is either H or M, the next move depends on who is allowed to take it. Wait, but the players alternate turns? No, the problem says that before each turn, they decide who will make the next move. So the choice is up to them. Wait no, the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So the sequence of moves is a series of H and M, with exactly n Hs and Ms. So during the selection process, at each step, the players choose whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, but ensuring that in the end, both have exactly n moves.\n\nBut the problem is to find the optimal sequence of choices (H or M) that maximizes the sum of S1 and S2. How do we model this?\n\nThe key insight here is that each choice (taking H or M) adds a digit to their respective numbers. The value of S1 and S2 is the numeric value of the digits collected. But since the digits are added to the front of their numbers, the order in which digits are added matters. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that on each turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. So for example, if Homer takes the first digit, then the next digit is the new leftmost. So the digits are taken in order from the original A. So S1 is formed by the digits taken by Homer in the order they were taken. For example, if Homer takes the first digit, then the third, then the fifth, etc., his number is those digits concatenated in the order of taking. So the numeric value of S1 is the digits in the order they were taken. But when considering the sum S1 + S2, the actual value of each digit depends on its position in their respective numbers. For example, the first digit taken by Homer contributes to the highest place value (like 10^k, where k is the number of digits he has left to take). Wait, no. Let's think: suppose Homer takes digits d1, d2, d3. Then his number is d1 followed by d2 followed by d3. The numeric value is d1 * 100 + d2 * 10 + d3. So each digit's contribution depends on the position in which it was taken. For example, the first digit Homer takes is the most significant digit in his number. Similarly for Marge.\n\nTherefore, the problem is not just about selecting which digits go to whom, but also the order in which they take them. However, the order of taking is determined by the sequence of moves. For example, if Homer takes the first digit, then Marge takes the next, then Homer again, etc. So the positions of the digits in the original A are fixed in terms of when they are taken.\n\nBut how can we model the optimal choice at each step? Because the choice of taking H or M now affects the future possibilities, and the contribution of the current digit to the total sum depends on when it's taken. For example, if a digit is taken earlier by Homer, it's more significant in his number than if it's taken later. Similarly for Marge.\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think about the total sum. Suppose we have a certain set of digits assigned to Homer and Marge. The total sum is the sum of the numbers formed by their digits. But the order in which they take their digits affects the value. However, the order of taking is determined by the sequence of moves. For example, Homer's digits are taken in the order they are picked. So if Homer picks digits at positions i and j (i < j), then the digit at i is the first digit of his number, contributing higher value than the digit at j.\n\nBut how can we model this in a dynamic programming approach?\n\nAlternative idea: For each step, when choosing between H and M, the decision affects the current digit's contribution to the sum. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a state where there are k digits left, and Homer has taken h moves and Marge m moves. The current position in A is at index i (so the digits left are A[i:]).\n\nAt each step, the next move can be H or M. But we have to ensure that after making the choice, the counts of H and M do not exceed n.\n\nBut how do we calculate the value of choosing H or M at this step?\n\nLet me think: When a player takes a digit, that digit contributes to their number. The value of that digit depends on the position in their number. For example, if Homer is taking his t-th digit (t ranges from 1 to n), then this digit contributes digit * 10^{n - t} to his total. Because his number has n digits, and the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, second by 10^{n-2}, etc. So the contribution of a digit taken at the t-th move by Homer is digit * 10^{n - t}.\n\nSimilarly for Marge. So for each digit taken by a player, the contribution depends on the order in which they take their digits. Thus, the problem becomes selecting which player takes each digit, such that each takes exactly n digits, and the sum of all contributions is maximized.\n\nBut how do we model this in DP? Because the contribution of a digit depends on the order in which it's taken by the player.\n\nFor example, the first time Homer takes a digit, it's his first move (t=1), contributing digit * 10^{n-1}. The second time he takes a digit, it's t=2, contributing digit * 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nSo, the key is that for each choice of H or M, we can compute the contribution of the current digit based on the number of times the player has already taken digits.\n\nSo, the DP state needs to track how many times Homer and Marge have already taken digits. Because that determines the contribution of the current digit if it's taken by one of them.\n\nSo, the DP state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of moves Homer has made so far, and m is the number of moves Marge has made. Since each move is either H or M, h + m = current number of digits taken (i). Also, since the total number of digits is 2n, the total steps is 2n. So the initial state is (0, 0), and we need to reach (n, n).\n\nAt each state (h, m), the next move can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n). For each possible choice, we take the next digit (which is A[i], where i = h + m), and compute the contribution of that digit to the total sum. Then, we proceed recursively to the next state.\n\nBut how do we compute the contribution of the current digit? Let's say the current state is (h, m). The next digit is A[i], where i = h + m. If we choose H, then this digit is added to Homer's number. Since Homer has already made h moves, this will be his (h+1)-th move. Therefore, the contribution of this digit is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose M, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nWait, but wait. For Marge's digits, the same applies. For example, if she has made m moves, and this is her (m+1)-th move, then the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nYes. Because each player has exactly n digits in their number. So the first digit they take is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc., down to the last digit multiplied by 10^0.\n\nSo, the DP function can be defined as follows:\n\nDefine dp(h, m) as the maximum total sum achievable from the state where Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves. The current digit is at index i = h + m.\n\nAt each step, we can choose to take H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nFor each choice, we calculate the contribution of the current digit (A[i]) to the total sum, and add it to the result of the next state.\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n, which returns 0.\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp(h, m) = max(\n    (digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} ) + dp(h+1, m),\n    (digit * 10^{n - (m+1)} ) + dp(h, m+1)\n)\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, and h and m can range up to 18, the total number of states is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19= 361 for n=18. That's very manageable. Even with memoization, this is feasible.\n\nBut wait, what about the exponent? For each h and m, when choosing H, the exponent is n - (h+1). For example, if n=2, and h=0, then the first digit taken by H contributes 10^(2-1) = 10^1 = 10. Then, the next digit taken by H would contribute 10^(2-2) = 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems feasible.\n\nBut how do we handle the exponents? Precompute them? For each possible h and m, and for each possible choice, we can compute the value.\n\nBut the problem is that the digits are taken in order. So, for the current state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m]. For example, when h=0 and m=0, the first digit is A[0]. Then, when h increases by 1, the next digit is A[1], etc.\n\nSo, the DP approach is feasible. Now, the question is how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, and the digits are 36, the maximum exponent is 10^18. Wait, but 10^18 is a very large number. However, since Python can handle big integers, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut for memoization, we can use memoization with lru_cache. However, since n can be up to 18, and h and m can be up to 18, the number of states is (18+1)^2 = 361, which is very manageable.\n\nBut we also need to track the path (the sequence of choices) that leads to the maximum sum. Because the problem requires us to output the sequence of H and M choices. So, in addition to the DP that returns the maximum sum, we need to track the choices made at each step.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use memoization with recursion, and during the DP steps, record the choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nAlternatively, we can first compute the DP table, and then reconstruct the path by checking for each state which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Let's first implement the DP function with memoization, which returns the maximum sum possible from state (h, m). Then, once we have that, we can reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0) and for each state, check whether choosing H gives a value equal to the maximum sum, or M does. If both are possible, we can choose arbitrarily (as per the problem statement, any correct sequence is acceptable).\n\nBut how to compute the DP function? Let's think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, the input is n and A. Let's parse A as a string.\n\nWe can precompute the digits as a list, maybe as integers.\n\nThen, for the DP, we can use memoization. Let's write a recursive function with memoization.\n\nBut since in Python, recursion depth may be an issue. However, for n=18, the maximum recursion depth would be 36 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut memoization can be done using lru_cache. However, since the parameters h and m are integers, and the function is pure, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the code:\n\nWe can define a function max_sum(h, m) which returns the maximum sum possible from state (h, m). The current digit is at index i = h + m.\n\nBut in the code, the digits are stored as a list. So, for example, for the current state, the digit is A[i], where i = h + m.\n\nBut for memoization, the function can't directly access the digits, since the digits are part of the problem input. Therefore, perhaps we need to pass the digits as a parameter. But that's not feasible with memoization, since the digits are fixed for a particular problem instance. Therefore, the DP function must be inside the code that processes the input.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nRead n and A. Convert A into a list of integers (digits).\n\nImplement a memoized DP function that, given h and m, returns the maximum sum possible from that state.\n\nThen, once the DP is computed, reconstruct the path by choosing at each step whether H or M gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to handle the memoization in Python? Using functools.lru_cache.\n\nBut since the digits are fixed, the DP function can be written inside the code, with access to the digits.\n\nSo, here's a possible code outline:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2*n:\n        return 0\n    i = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[i]\n    # possible choices\n    option_h = 0\n    option_m = 0\n    if h < n:\n        # choosing H\n        contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n        next_sum = dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_h = contribution + next_sum\n    if m < n:\n        contribution = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n        next_sum = dp(h, m + 1)\n        option_m = contribution + next_sum\n    # return the max of the two options\n    return max(option_h, option_m)\n\nWait, but this code is not handling the cases where one of the options is not available. For example, if h == n, then we cannot choose H. So, in that case, we have to choose M. Similarly for m == n.\n\nBut the code above checks if h < n before considering option_h. So, if h is already n, then option_h is zero, but option_m is considered. However, the code returns max(option_h, option_m), which would be option_m. But in reality, when h ==n, the only possible choice is M. So, the code should handle that correctly.\n\nBut in the code, for example, when h is n, then option_h is not computed. Wait, no. The code checks if h <n, and if not, then option_h is 0. But that's incorrect. Because when h is already n, then choosing H is not allowed. So, in that case, the code should not consider option_h. But in the code, option_h is initialized as 0, but if h <n is false, then the code doesn't compute it. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nIn the code:\n\noption_h and option_m are initialized to 0. Then, if h <n, compute option_h. Similarly for option_m. Then, the code returns max(option_h, option_m). But this is wrong. Because, for example, when h is already n, then option_h is 0 (since the code doesn't compute it). But in that case, the only possible choice is M. So the code would compare 0 (option_h) with option_m. But option_m is computed only if m <n. But if m is also n, then the code would return 0, which is correct (base case). However, if m is less than n, then option_m is computed. So the code is correct? Let's think:\n\nIf h <n and m <n, then both options are considered, and the max is chosen.\n\nIf h ==n, then the code can't choose H, so the only option is M. But in this case, the code computes option_h as 0 (since h is not <n), and computes option_m (if m <n). So the max between 0 and option_m would be option_m, which is correct. However, if m is already n, then the code would return 0 (since both options are 0). Which is correct.\n\nBut there's a problem here. For example, when h <n but m is already n. Then, the code would compute option_h (since h <n) and option_m is 0 (since m is not <n). So the code returns option_h, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases. However, there's a mistake here. Because in the code, option_h is initialized to 0, but when h <n, we compute it. Otherwise, it remains 0. However, when h <n, but the code computes option_h. But in the case where h <n and m <n, then both options are considered. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code returns max(option_h, option_m). However, in some cases, one of the options is not available. For example, if h is n, then option_h is 0, but option_m is valid. The code would take the max between 0 and option_m. But option_m is the correct value. So that's okay.\n\nBut what if both options are available? Then the code chooses the maximum of the two.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the next step is to reconstruct the path. How to do that?\n\nWe can write another function that, given h and m, decides whether to choose H or M, based on which option gives the maximum value. For example:\n\ndef get_choice(h, m):\n    i = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[i]\n    if h <n:\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h+1)))\n        next_sum_h = dp(h+1, m)\n        option_h = contribution_h + next_sum_h\n    else:\n        option_h = -infinity\n    if m <n:\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m+1)))\n        next_sum_m = dp(h, m+1)\n        option_m = contribution_m + next_sum_m\n    else:\n        option_m = -infinity\n    if option_h > option_m:\n        return 'H'\n    elif option_m > option_h:\n        return 'M'\n    else:\n        # choose arbitrarily, e.g., prefer H\n        return 'H'\n\nBut this approach would require recomputing the options again, which could be expensive. However, since the DP function is memoized, and we have already computed all the values, perhaps we can use the dp function to compare the options.\n\nBut in practice, during the reconstruction phase, we can call the dp function again, but that would be redundant. Alternatively, during the DP calculation, we can store not only the maximum sum but also the choice made. However, that would complicate the DP function.\n\nAnother approach is to, during the reconstruction, for each state (h, m), check which of the options (H or M) gives the maximum value. Since the DP function is memoized, we can compute the options again here.\n\nBut this would require that the DP function is already computed. So, the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the DP table (using memoization).\n\n- Then, start from (0, 0), and for each step, decide whether to take H or M based on which choice gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each state (h, m), the code can check:\n\ncurrent_i = h + m\n\ncurrent_digit = digits[current_i]\n\nif choosing H is possible (h <n):\n\n   value_h = current_digit * 10^{n - (h+1)} + dp(h+1, m)\n\nelse:\n\n   value_h = -infinity\n\nsimilarly for value_m.\n\nthen compare value_h and value_m.\n\nBut since the DP function is already memoized, we can compute these values again.\n\nBut this would require O(2n) steps, each with O(1) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code for reconstructing the path would be something like:\n\npath = []\nh = 0\nm = 0\nwhile h + m < 2*n:\n    current_i = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[current_i]\n    option_h = -1\n    option_m = -1\n    if h < n:\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n        next_sum_h = dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_h = contribution_h + next_sum_h\n    if m < n:\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n        next_sum_m = dp(h, m + 1)\n        option_m = contribution_m + next_sum_m\n    if option_h >= option_m:\n        path.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        path.append('M')\n        m += 1\nreturn ''.join(path)\n\nBut this code would work, assuming that the dp function is already computed.\n\nBut there's a problem here. For example, when both options are equal, the code chooses H. Which is acceptable as per the problem statement.\n\nNow, the problem is that for large n (up to 18), the exponent 10 ** (n - ...) can be very large. For example, when n is 18, 10^18 is a 1 followed by 18 zeros. However, Python can handle big integers, so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut what about the performance of the DP function? Let's see. For each state (h, m), the DP function is called once. The number of states is (n+1)^2, which for n=18 is 361. Each state requires computing two options (H and M) if possible. So the total number of operations is manageable.\n\nBut the exponents 10 ** (n - ...) can be precomputed. For example, for each possible h and m, the exponents for Homer and Marge can be precomputed. However, since the exponents are calculated as 10 ** (n - t), where t is the number of moves the player has already made plus 1 (for the next move). So for Homer, when he takes his (h+1)th move, the exponent is n - (h+1). For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n - 1. For h=1, exponent is n-2, etc.\n\nBut calculating 10 ** (n - (h+1)) can be done once per h and m. However, since Python's exponentiation is efficient, even for large exponents, this should be manageable.\n\nBut for n=18, the maximum exponent is 18 (when h=0, and the first move is taken by Homer, contributing 10^(18 - 1) = 1e17, etc.)\n\nSo, the code seems feasible.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n2\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM.\n\nLet's compute the sum for this case.\n\nHomer takes first two digits (1 and 2), Marge takes 3 and 4. His number is 12, Marge's is 34. Sum is 46.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is HMHM, Homer takes 1, then Marge takes 2, Homer takes 3, Marge takes 4. Homer's number is 13, Marge's 24. Sum is 37. Which is less than 46. So the maximum is achieved by HHMM.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput:\n2\n9911\n\nOutput: HMHM.\n\nLet's see. The digits are 9,9,1,1.\n\nSequence HMHM:\n\nH takes 9, M takes 9, H takes 1, M takes 1. Homer's number is 91, Marge's is 91. Sum is 182.\n\nAnother possible sequence is HHHM? No, because each must make exactly 2 moves. So for n=2, the sequence must have two H and two M.\n\nAnother possible sequence is HMMH: H takes 9, M takes 9, M takes 1, H takes 1. Homer's number is 91, Marge's is 91. Same sum. But the output is HMHM. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should generate the correct sequence.\n\nBut how does the DP work for this case?\n\nLet me try to simulate the DP for the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2, A=1234. digits = [1,2,3,4].\n\nThe DP starts with h=0, m=0.\n\nAt each step, the code chooses H or M.\n\nLet's compute the maximum sum.\n\nAt state (0,0), current digit is 1. The options are:\n\nH: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 1) = 10. Then, next state is (1, 0).\n\nM: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 1) = 10. Next state is (0,1).\n\nThen, for each of these states, we need to compute the maximum.\n\nBut let's think recursively. For the first choice, if we choose H, then the next state is (1,0). The current digit is 2 (since h + m = 1 + 0 = 1, so digits[1] is 2).\n\nAt (1,0), the options are H or M.\n\nIf we choose H again, then contribution is 2 * 10^(2 - 2) = 2 * 1 = 2. Next state is (2,0). Then, the next digits are 3 and 4. Since h is 2 (max), the rest must be M. So, M takes 3 and 4. Contribution for 3 is 3 * 10^(2 - 1) = 30, and 4 is 4 * 10^(2-2) = 4. Total sum from this path: 10 + 2 + 30 +4 = 46.\n\nAlternatively, at (1,0), if we choose M, then contribution is 2 * 10^(2 - 1) = 20. Next state (1,1). Then, the current digit is 3 (index 2). Now, h=1, m=1. We can choose H or M.\n\nIf we choose H: contribution is 3 * 10^(2 - 2) = 3. Then, next state (2,1). Now, the current digit is 4 (index 3). Only M can take it. Contribution is 4 * 10^(2 - 2) =4. Total sum is 10 (from first H) + 20 (from M) +3 +4 = 37. Which is worse than 46.\n\nAlternatively, at (1,1) choosing M: contribution is 3 * 10^(2 - 2) = 3. Then, next state (1,2). Now, h=1, m=2. The next digit is 4 (index 3). Only H can take it. Contribution is 4 * 10^(2 - 2) =4. Total sum is 10 + 20 + 3 +4 = 37. Same as before.\n\nSo, in this case, choosing H at (1,0) gives higher sum. Thus, the maximum sum for (0,0) is 46, achieved by HHMM.\n\nSo the code would generate the correct sequence.\n\nNow, the code for the DP and path reconstruction.\n\nBut in Python, the memoization with lru_cache can be used. However, the digits list is not hashable. Wait, no. The DP function is inside the code, and the digits are accessible as a global variable. But in the code, the DP function is using the digits list. However, the lru_cache decorator works with the parameters of the function. So, the DP function is called with h and m, and the digits are fixed for the current problem instance. So, this approach is correct.\n\nBut for the code to work, the digits must be accessible within the dp function. So, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n    i = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[i]\n    option_h = -1\n    if h < n:\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n        next_sum = dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_h = contribution_h + next_sum\n    option_m = -1\n    if m < n:\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n        next_sum = dp(h, m + 1)\n        option_m = contribution_m + next_sum\n    # if both are possible, choose max, else choose the available one\n    if option_h == -1:\n        return option_m\n    elif option_m == -1:\n        return option_h\n    else:\n        return max(option_h, option_m)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the initial option_h and option_m are set to -1. However, if h <n, then option_h is computed. But what if both are possible? For example, in the first step, both options are possible. Then, the code returns max(option_h, option_m). However, in cases where one of the options is not possible (e.g., h ==n), then the other is chosen.\n\nBut the code above initializes option_h and option_m to -1, and then computes them if possible. Then, if one of them is -1, it returns the other. Else, returns the max of the two.\n\nBut in the code, for example, when h <n and m <n, both options are computed, and the max is taken.\n\nBut in the code, the initial option_h is -1. Then, if h <n, it is overwritten with the correct value. Similarly for option_m.\n\nBut what if both options are possible, but the code returns the max of option_h and option_m, which are computed correctly?\n\nYes. So this code should be correct.\n\nOnce the dp function is computed, the path can be reconstructed as discussed.\n\nNow, the code for reconstructing the path:\n\nh = 0\nm = 0\nresult = []\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n    i = h + m\n    current_digit = digits[i]\n    option_h = -1\n    if h < n:\n        contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n        next_sum_h = dp(h + 1, m)\n        option_h = contribution_h + next_sum_h\n    option_m = -1\n    if m < n:\n        contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n        next_sum_m = dp(h, m + 1)\n        option_m = contribution_m + next_sum_m\n    if option_h >= option_m:\n        result.append('H')\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        result.append('M')\n        m += 1\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nBut wait, in the code, the option_h and option_m are computed again, which is redundant. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable.\n\nBut what if there are multiple paths that give the same maximum sum? The code chooses the first option (H) when they are equal, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nThe code would generate the path 'HHMM'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, A=9911.\n\nThe digits are [9,9,1,1].\n\nLet's think about the DP steps.\n\nAt (0,0), current digit is 9. The options are:\n\nH: 9 * 10^(2-1) = 90, then proceed to (1,0).\n\nM: 9 * 10^(2-1) = 90, then proceed to (0,1).\n\nWhich one gives higher sum?\n\nLet's look at (1,0):\n\ncurrent digit is 9 (index 1).\n\nOptions:\n\nH: 9 * 10^(2-2) = 9*1 =9, then proceed to (2,0). Then, the remaining digits are 1 and 1. Both must be taken by M. So, for (2,0), current digit is 1 (index 2). M takes it, contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 1) = 10. Then, next state (2,1). Current digit is 1 (index 3). M takes it, contribution is 1 * 10^(2-2) =1. Total sum for this path: 90 (from first H) + 9 (second H) + 10 + 1 = 110.\n\nAlternatively, at (1,0), choosing M:\n\ncontribution is 9 * 10^(2 - 1) = 90. Then proceed to (1,1). Now, current digit is 1 (index 2). Options:\n\nH: 1 * 10^(2 - 2) =1. Then proceed to (2,1). Next digit is 1 (index 3). M takes it, contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 2) =1. Sum for this path: 90 (from first H) + 90 (from M) + 1 + 1 = 182.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal choice at (0,0) is H, leading to (1,0). Then, at (1,0), choosing M gives contribution of 9 * 10^(2 - 1) =90 (since m was 0, and m+1 is 1, so 2 - (0 +1) = 1. So 9 * 10^1 =90. Then, the next state is (1,1). Now, current digit is index 2 (1). At (1,1), the options are H or M.\n\nIf we choose H: contribution is 1 * 10^(2 - 2) = 1. Then, next state (2,1). Now, current digit is index 3 (1). Only M can take it. contribution is 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, with each player taking exactly n turns, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they collect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to explore all possible sequences of moves, ensuring we maximize the total prize. The state of our DP function is defined by the number of moves Homer (h) and Marge (m) have made so far.\n2. **Recursive State Evaluation**: For each state (h, m), we evaluate the maximum total prize by considering both possible next moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit). The contribution of each digit to the total prize depends on its position in the respective player's number.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum possible prize using DP, we reconstruct the sequence of moves by checking which choice (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) leads to the maximum prize at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        i = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[i]\n        option_h = -1\n        if h < n:\n            contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n            next_sum = dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_h = contribution_h + next_sum\n        option_m = -1\n        if m < n:\n            contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n            next_sum = dp(h, m + 1)\n            option_m = contribution_m + next_sum\n        if option_h == -1:\n            return option_m\n        elif option_m == -1:\n            return option_h\n        else:\n            return max(option_h, option_m)\n\n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    result = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        i = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[i]\n        option_h = -1\n        if h < n:\n            contribution_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n            next_sum_h = dp(h + 1, m)\n            option_h = contribution_h + next_sum_h\n        option_m = -1\n        if m < n:\n            contribution_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n            next_sum_m = dp(h, m + 1)\n            option_m = contribution_m + next_sum_m\n        if option_h >= option_m:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` representing the number with `2n` digits.\n2. **DP Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It calculates the maximum prize from the current state (h, m) by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit).\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by comparing the contributions of each possible move at each step, choosing the one that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences while leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations, leading to an optimal solution.",
