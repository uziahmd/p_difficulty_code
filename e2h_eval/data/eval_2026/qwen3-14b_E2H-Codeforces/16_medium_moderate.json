Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows us to compute adjacency efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the number of roads can be up to 300, the number of blocks could be huge. So enumerating all possible blocks isn't feasible. We need another approach.\n\nWait, the key here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. So each step corresponds to crossing a single road. But how to model the regions?\n\nAnother thought: the problem resembles a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges exist between regions that share a common boundary. We need to find the shortest path between the starting region (home) and the target region (university). But how do we represent the regions and their adjacencies without explicitly enumerating them?\n\nAlternative idea: For each region, its position can be determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two half-planes. So for each road, the region is on one side or the other. So, the state of a block can be represented by a vector of signs for each road. However, since there are n roads, this would result in 2^n possible states. But n is up to 300, which makes this impossible as 2^300 is way too big.\n\nThat's not feasible. So what else can we do?\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where nodes are the regions, and edges are the roads. But again, how to find the adjacency between regions?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of BFS. The initial state is the home block, and the target is the university block. Each move corresponds to crossing a road into an adjacent block. So, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the regions as nodes and using BFS to find the shortest path.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to represent the regions and find their neighbors.\n\nLet me think differently. For any point not on any road, it belongs to exactly one block. So, the home and university points are in their respective blocks. The question is to find the minimal steps between these two blocks.\n\nNow, each step involves moving across a road. So, the minimal steps would correspond to the minimal number of roads you have to cross to get from the home to the university.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes (roads) that separate the home and university points. Because each time you cross a road, you're moving into a different region. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home to the university.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nWait, think of it as a graph where each node represents the set of roads crossed so far. But that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each road divides the plane into two parts. The home and university are in certain positions relative to each road. Let's say that for each road, the home is on one side, and the university is on the other. Then, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate them. But that's only if they are separated by those roads. However, the actual minimal steps may depend on the arrangement of roads.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side of the road or not. If they are on opposite sides, then crossing that road would be part of the path. But how does that relate to the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges exist between regions that share a common boundary. The minimal steps is the minimal number of edges to traverse between the home and university regions.\n\nBut how to model this graph?\n\nAnother idea: Since each region is defined by the sign of each road's equation, perhaps the regions can be represented by the sign of each road's equation. For example, for each road i, the region is either + or -, based on the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. However, since there are n roads, this gives 2^n possible regions. Which is way too big for n=300.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem with BFS, but using the parity of the number of roads crossed. Wait, here's a thought: the minimal steps between the home and university is equal to the number of roads that separate them. But no, that's not correct. For example, imagine two roads that cross each other. Suppose home is in one quadrant, university in another. They are separated by two roads, but you can cross them in two steps, which would be the same as the number of separating roads. But maybe there's a case where you can cross through multiple roads in a way that the number of steps is less than the number of separating roads.\n\nWait, no. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. But how to find k?\n\nWait, no. Because the regions are divided by roads, and the minimal steps between two regions is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross. So, for example, if the home and university are in regions separated by two roads, but those roads are arranged such that crossing one road leads to a region that is adjacent to the university's region via another road. Then the minimal steps would be 2. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region. Each region can be connected to others via roads. But again, the problem is how to represent regions.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road's equation. So, the home's region is determined by the sign of each road. Similarly for the university. Then, the minimal number of steps between them is the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (i.e., the number of roads where the home and university have different signs) divided by something? No, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university are on opposite sides of exactly k roads. Then, the minimal steps needed to get from home to university would be k if all those roads can be crossed in sequence. However, this is not always the case. For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, you can cross one road, then cross the other, which would take two steps. Which equals the number of roads separating them.\n\nBut what if there are three roads that all separate the home and university. Then, perhaps you can cross one, then another, then another, taking three steps. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the home and university. But is that always the case?\n\nWait, but what if the roads are arranged such that the home and university are on opposite sides of two roads, but those roads are parallel. Then, crossing one road would take you to a region that is adjacent to the university's region via the second road. So, two steps. Which equals the number of separating roads.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and university. But how?\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Suppose that there are two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both roads. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. But the minimal steps would be two steps: cross one road, then cross the other. Which matches the count.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. The home is in a region that is positive for all three. The university is negative for all three. Then, the minimal steps would be three steps. But perhaps there's a way to cross them in a different order, but still three steps.\n\nBut then, what if there are overlapping roads? For example, suppose two roads cross each other. The home is on one side of the first road, but on the other side of the second. The university is on the opposite side of both. So, the number of separating roads is two. Then, the minimal steps would be two.\n\nBut then, how to compute the number of roads that separate the home and university?\n\nYes! Because for each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, then that road must be crossed at least once in the path. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me think of a counterexample.\n\nSuppose there are two roads that are parallel. Home is on one side of both, university on the other. Then, the minimal steps is 1. Because you can cross one road and reach the university's region. But according to the count, the number of separating roads is two. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nAh! So that's a problem. Because in this case, the home and university are separated by two roads, but the minimal steps is 1. So the previous idea is wrong.\n\nWait, but why? Because the two roads are parallel. So, the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. So, the regions are separated by both roads. However, crossing one road would take you from the home region to a region that is adjacent to the university region. Because the two roads are parallel, the regions on the other side of the first road would be adjacent to the university's region via the same road.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Imagine two parallel roads. The home is on one side of both. The university is on the other side of both. So, the home is in a region that is between the two roads? No, wait, no. If two roads are parallel, they divide the plane into three regions: one on the left of both, between the two roads, and on the right of both. Suppose the home is on the left of both roads, and the university is on the right of both. Then, to get from home to university, you have to cross both roads. Because crossing one road would take you to the region between the roads. Then, you need to cross the second road to get to the other side. So, two steps. But according to the previous idea, the number of separating roads is two. So the minimal steps is two. Which matches.\n\nBut earlier thought was that in this case, the minimal steps is 1. Which is wrong. So why?\n\nAh, because the two roads are parallel, but the home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. So, the home and university are in regions that are separated by both roads. To get from home to university, you have to cross both roads. Hence, two steps. So the minimal steps equals the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nIn this case, the number of roads that separate them is two, and the steps is two. So the hypothesis holds.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. The home and university are on opposite sides of two roads, but on the same side of the third. Then, the minimal steps is two. Which is the number of separating roads.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and university. How can I confirm this?\n\nLet me think of another case. Suppose there are two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on one side of road 1 and the other side of road 2. The university is on the opposite side of road 1, but same side of road 2. Then, the number of separating roads is 1 (road 1). So the minimal steps is 1. Which is correct. Because you can cross road 1 to get to the university's region.\n\nSo this seems to fit. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nIf this is true, then the solution becomes very simple: for each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. Count the number of such roads. That's the answer.\n\nBut how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nThe line is given by ax + by + c = 0. For a point (x, y), the value of ax + by + c determines which side of the line it is on. For two points, if their values have opposite signs (i.e., their product is negative), then they are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that neither the home nor the university lies on any road. So, for each road, the value for home and university will not be zero. So, for each road, compute (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Multiply them. If the product is negative, then the points are on opposite sides of the road. So, count that road.\n\nSo, the answer is the number of roads where the product is negative.\n\nWait, but let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0=0 (y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor the first road (y=0):\n\nHome (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So product is negative. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road x=0:\n\nHome: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0.\n\nUniversity: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Product is negative. Count +=1. Total is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3=0.\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nRoad 1: x=0. Home is 1>0, university is -1 <0: product negative. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0. Same as before. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 =0. For home (1+1-3)= -1 <0. University (-1 + (-1) -3) =-5 <0. Product is positive. So not counted. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo the sample outputs align with this approach.\n\nBut why does this work? Because each time the home and university are separated by a road, you have to cross that road once. And since each step allows you to cross one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them.\n\nBut how can that be? Because the steps involve moving through adjacent regions, but the count is just the number of roads that separate them. How can this be guaranteed?\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose there are three roads arranged such that the home and university are separated by two roads. But the minimal steps is two. Which is the count. But if the roads are arranged in a way that the home and university are separated by three roads, but the minimal steps is three. Which is the count.\n\nSo, how can we be sure that the minimal steps is exactly the number of separating roads?\n\nThis seems to be a key insight. Let me try to think of it in terms of graph theory. Each road that separates the two points adds a step. But how?\n\nImagine that the regions are nodes. The home is in one node, the university in another. Each step is moving across a road. Each road that separates the two points is a \"cut\" between the home and university regions. So, the minimal path must cross each of these roads once. Thus, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them.\n\nBut why can't there be a path that crosses some roads multiple times, leading to a shorter path?\n\nFor example, suppose there are two roads that separate the home and university. If there's a way to cross one road, then cross another road, then cross the first road again, but end up in the university's region. But that would require three steps, which is more than the count of two. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where the number of separating roads is even, and there's a way to cross some roads in a way that reduces the count. But I don't see how.\n\nAnother way to think: the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a region. The home is one node, the university is another. The minimal steps between them is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross. Now, each road that separates the two points must be crossed an odd number of times (since each crossing changes the side of the road). So, the minimal number of crossings is the number of separating roads. Because you can cross each separating road once, and non-separating roads zero times.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nSo, the solution is simply to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nWow! That makes the problem very easy. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates, the university coordinates, read n roads. For each road, compute the value for home and for university. If their product is negative, increment the count. Output the count.\n\nBut why did the problem mention that the roads are infinite and the movement is allowed only if they share a common border of non-zero length? Because in this approach, the count is based on the number of roads that separate the two points. But how does that ensure that the steps are possible?\n\nWell, the problem says that the home and university are in different blocks. So, the count can't be zero. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that the home and university are not on any road. So, the count can be zero only if they are in the same block. But the problem says nothing about that. Wait, the problem says that the university is located in some block. It's possible that the home and university are in the same block. In that case, the answer is zero steps.\n\nBut according to our approach, the code would output the number of roads that separate them. So, if they are in the same block, then for all roads, the home and university are on the same side. Therefore, the count is zero, which is correct.\n\nBut how does that hold? Let me think. If the home and university are in the same block, then there's no road separating them. Therefore, the minimal steps is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach works. Therefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each line, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nWait, but why does this work?\n\nBecause each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And each such road contributes to the count. So the minimal steps is the count.\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nBecause each time you cross a road that separates them, you are moving towards the university. But how can you be sure that the steps are possible?\n\nBut according to the problem's movement rules, moving from one block to another requires that they share a common border of non-zero length. So, each step is crossing a road. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home to the university.\n\nBut how to know that the minimal number is the count of separating roads?\n\nWell, suppose that there are k roads that separate the two points. Then, there exists a path that crosses each of these roads exactly once, and thus takes k steps. Because each road that separates them is a barrier that must be crossed once. So, the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how to prove that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads once?\n\nWell, imagine that you can cross each separating road once. Because the roads divide the plane, and the home and university are in different regions. The minimal path is to cross each of the separating roads once.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the proof, but given that the sample cases work and the logic seems sound, perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nSo, implementing this code.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFor each road:\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y +0 =0 → y=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\n\nval1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst two roads are same as sample 1. Third road is x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor home (1,1): 1+1-3 =-1.\n\nFor university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So not counted. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are in the same block. Then, for all roads, the product is positive. So count is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by one road. So count is 1. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as simple as that.\n\nSo, the Python code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because the problem's movement is allowed to cross roads, and the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed, but they are not separating the two points?\n\nLike, suppose there are two roads that are not separating the two points, but crossing them allows to reach the university's block. But that's impossible because if the two points are on the same side of a road, crossing that road would take you to a region that is on the other side of that road. But the university is on the same side as the home for that road. So, crossing that road would take you away from the university.\n\nBut the minimal path would have to cross roads that separate them. So, the count is correct.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's implement it.\n\nNow, handling input correctly. The input is read from stdin. The first line is x1 y1, second line x2 y2, third line is n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in reality, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is x1 y1.\n\nThe second line is x2 y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, this code should work. Let's check the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nOutput is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where home and university are separated by one road.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut why does the problem mention that the roads are infinite and the movement requires a common border of non-zero length? Because if two regions are separated by a road, but the home and university are on opposite sides of that road, then crossing that road is allowed. So, the code counts that road. But if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then the regions they are in are adjacent across that road, so moving between them is allowed in one step. Hence, the code counts each such road as one step.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed to move between these blocks. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\nTo determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, we evaluate the sign of the linear equation of each road at the coordinates of the home and university. If the signs are different (i.e., their product is negative), the points are on opposite sides of that road, and thus this road must be crossed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation:** For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps:** Each road that separates the home and university contributes one step to the minimum number of steps required. The total count of such roads is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations at given points, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
