Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about Crazy Town, which is a plane divided by infinite roads. Each road is a line equation. The regions formed by these roads are called blocks. The task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nThe key here is to model the blocks and find the shortest path between the home and university blocks. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are potentially an infinite number of blocks, but the number of roads is up to 300, maybe there's a way to model this with graph traversal, where each node represents a region (block), and edges exist between adjacent regions.\n\nBut directly representing all regions isn't feasible. So perhaps there's another approach. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For each road, the blocks are separated by the roads. When you cross a road, you move into a different block. So maybe the problem can be modeled using BFS, where each state is determined by the set of roads that separate the current block from the home block. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of roads that a point is on one side of. Wait, no, because each line divides the plane into two halves. For any given point not on the line, it's either on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine whether the home point is on one side or the other. Similarly for the university point. \n\nBut how does that relate to the blocks? Each block is defined by the intersection of half-planes. Each line divides the plane into two. So each block can be represented by a set of signs for each line. However, with n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations. But since n can be up to 300, that's impossible to handle directly. \n\nBut maybe the movement between blocks is determined by crossing a single line. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one line. So the adjacency between blocks is determined by flipping the sign of exactly one line's equation. \n\nBut how can we model this? Well, perhaps each block can be represented by the set of signs (for each line, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). However, since the number of possible combinations is 2^300, that's not feasible. \n\nWait, but the problem is not to find the actual blocks, but to find the minimal steps between the home and university blocks. So perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node is a state of the signs of the lines relative to the home point. Wait, but that might not capture the entire picture. \n\nAnother thought: For a given point (home or university), the position relative to each line can be determined. Let's say for each line i, we compute s_i = sign(a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i). Since the home and university points are not on any line, their signs are well-defined. \n\nNow, the home is in a block, which is determined by the signs of all lines. Similarly for the university. The question is, what's the minimal number of steps to get from the home's block to the university's block, moving through adjacent blocks. \n\nBut how are the blocks adjacent? Two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border of non-zero length. Which implies that they differ by exactly one line. Because if two blocks differ by more than one line, their boundaries would not be adjacent. So, moving from one block to another requires flipping exactly one sign (crossing that line). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign flips required to transform the home's sign configuration into the university's sign configuration. However, each flip corresponds to crossing a line. But the minimal number of steps would be the minimal number of lines that need to be flipped. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because two blocks that differ by one line are adjacent. So the minimal steps between the home and university is the minimal number of lines that need to be flipped to go from the home's configuration to the university's configuration. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the home's configuration has certain signs for each line, and the university's has others. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of lines where the signs differ between the home and university. Because each step can flip one sign. However, this is only true if the two configurations differ in exactly k lines, then the minimal steps would be k. But is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if two configurations differ in two lines, but those two lines are parallel. Then, maybe you can't go directly from one to the other. But wait, the roads are not necessarily parallel. So, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of differing lines, but only if there's a path that flips each differing line once. \n\nBut how can that be? Because each step can flip exactly one line. So, for example, if the home and university differ in k lines, then you can reach the university in k steps, by flipping each differing line once. But why would that be possible?\n\nWait, suppose you have two configurations that differ in two lines. Let's say line A and line B. Then, starting from the home configuration, you can cross line A to get to a new block, then cross line B to get to another. But that would require two steps. But the university is in a configuration that differs in both lines. So yes, that would take two steps. So the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines between the home and university configurations. \n\nBut wait, what if the home and university configurations differ in two lines, but those two lines are not adjacent? Or maybe there's some dependency. \n\nWait, no. Because each time you cross a line, you flip the sign for that line. So, regardless of the order, the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines. Because each differing line must be crossed once. \n\nBut why is that correct? Let's think of it as a graph. Each node is a possible sign configuration. Two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly one line. Then, the minimal steps between the home and university is the Hamming distance between their sign configurations. \n\nBut that would imply that the answer is the number of lines where the home and university have different signs. \n\nBut that seems too simple. Let me test it against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. So sign is positive. \n\nFor second road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0. So sign is positive. \n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is negative. \n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is negative. \n\nSo the home's signs are (+, +), university's are (-, -). They differ in both lines. So the answer is 2 steps, which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFirst road x=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nSecond road y=0 → 1>0 → +.\n\nThird road: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road x=0: -1 → -.\n\nSecond road y=0: -1 → -.\n\nThird road: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same as home. \n\nSo the home's signs are (+, +, -), university's are (-, -, -). Differ in first two lines. So answer is 2 steps. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the sample outputs are indeed the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of home and university. \n\nSo this suggests that the answer is simply the number of lines where the signs of home and university differ. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each differing line must be crossed once. And since each crossing changes the sign of exactly one line, the minimal steps is the number of differing lines. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where you have to cross a line twice? Like, for example, if you have two differing lines, but crossing one line first and then another leads to a configuration that's not the target. \n\nBut according to the model, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. \n\nWait, let's imagine a scenario where the home and university differ in two lines. Let's say line A and line B. Suppose that crossing line A and then line B will take you from home to the university. But the Hamming distance is 2, so the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if there's some dependency? Like, for example, if the two lines are parallel. But even then, the Hamming distance would still be 2, and the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is indeed the number of differing signs between the home and university. \n\nIf that's the case, then the solution becomes very straightforward. \n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each of the home and university points, compute the sign for each line (ai*x + bi*y + ci). Since the points are not on any line, the value is non-zero. \n\n2. For each line, compare the signs of home and university. Count the number of lines where they differ. That's the answer. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because each step allows crossing exactly one line. Therefore, to reach the target configuration, you need to cross each differing line once. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where you need to cross a line multiple times? For example, suppose there are two lines, and the home and university differ in both. But crossing one line, then crossing the same line again. But that would take two steps, but the Hamming distance would be 2. However, that's not necessary. Because the minimal steps is 2, but the Hamming distance is 2. \n\nBut in reality, the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance. Because each differing line must be crossed once. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of differing signs between the home and university for each line. \n\nThis seems too simple. But the sample cases confirm this. \n\nSo let me think of another test case. \n\nSuppose there's one line. Home is on one side, university on the other. Then the answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: three lines. Home and university differ in two lines. Then answer is 2. \n\nBut what if there are three lines, and the home and university differ in three lines. Then answer is 3. \n\nBut how can that be? Because each step flips one line. So to get from the home configuration to the target, you need to flip three lines. \n\nYes. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because the minimal steps is the number of differing lines. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n lines. For each line, compute the value for home and for university. Check if they have the same sign. If not, increment the count. \n\nBut wait, the sign is determined by the value of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. But since the line equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, the sign of this value determines which side of the line the point is on. \n\nSo for each line, compute val_home = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Similarly for val_uni. \n\nThen, check if val_home and val_uni have the same sign. If not, increment the count. \n\nBut how to check if two numbers have the same sign? Well, the product of the two values is positive. So for each line, if val_home * val_uni < 0, then they are on opposite sides of the line, hence differ in sign. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line in roads:\n\n    val_home = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n\n    val_uni = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\n    if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nreturn count\n\nBut wait, this is the answer? \n\nYes, according to the reasoning above. \n\nBut why does this work? Because each time the signs differ, you need to cross that line once. And each step allows crossing exactly one line. So the minimal steps is the number of differing lines. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nBut why is that the case? Let me think of a scenario where two differing lines are not adjacent. For example, suppose there are two lines that are parallel. Then, the home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the count is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines, which would take two steps. Which is correct. \n\nAnother scenario: two lines that intersect. The home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the minimal steps is 2. \n\nBut how? Because to cross both lines, you need to cross each once. \n\nBut how can you cross both lines in two steps? \n\nYes. Because each step crosses one line. So first step crosses line 1, which takes you to a block that is on the other side of line 1. Then, cross line 2, which takes you to the other side of line 2. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is indeed the count. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nBut why didn't the problem mention anything about this approach? Because perhaps the problem is designed to trick people into thinking about complex graph structures, but the actual solution is simple. \n\nSo, the code can be written as follows. \n\nRead the home coordinates, university coordinates, then n lines. For each line, compute the value for home and for university. Check if their product is negative. Count the number of such lines. Output the count. \n\nLet me test this against the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n0 1 0 → line y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → line x=0.\n\nFor the first line, val_home is 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val_uni is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: val_home is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val_uni is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nval for first line: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1 → val_home =1. val_uni is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: same as first. val_home is 1, val_uni -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird line: val_home is 1 +1 -3 = -1. val_uni is (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo the code works for the samples. \n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where home and university are in the same block. Then, the count is zero. \n\nAnother case where home and university are on the same side of all lines. So answer is zero. \n\nAnother case where some lines have same sign, others not. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is given as follows. The first line is x1, y1. Second line x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the sample. Wait, the sample shows two inputs, but the problem says that the input is given as per the following structure. Wait, the user provided two examples, but the actual input is for one case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1. Second line two integers x2, y2. Third line is n, then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nSo the code should read the input once. But the sample input shows two test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of showing two examples. \n\nIn the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So the code needs to read the input for a single case. \n\nSo the code would read:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen compute for each line, the value for home and university. \n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead from stdin. \n\nBut for handling multiple test cases? No, the problem says that the input is for a single case. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but this is very simple. But why is this the case? Because the problem is equivalent to counting the number of lines that separate the home and university. Each such line must be crossed once. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where the home and university are in the same block, but the code returns zero? Well, because if they are in the same block, then for all lines, the home and university are on the same side. Hence, their product is positive, and the count is zero. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nBut let me think of another case. Suppose there are two lines, and the home and university are on opposite sides of one line, but same side of the other. Then the answer is 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThus, the solution is to count the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis seems surprisingly simple, but the sample cases and reasoning support this approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road divides the plane into two halves. The home and university blocks are defined by their positions relative to these roads. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate the home and university. Specifically, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed once to move between the blocks. Thus, the solution involves counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val_home * val_uni < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Calculation:** For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. This value determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Opposite Sides Check:** If the product of the values calculated for the home and university coordinates is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road. This road must be crossed to move between the blocks.\n4. **Counting Crossings:** The number of such roads (where the home and university are on opposite sides) gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their intersections, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
