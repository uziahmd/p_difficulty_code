    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these percentages are updated. I need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear on both progress bars at the same time.\n\nHmm. So the task is to find all values p where there exists some moment (after copying some byte) where both progress bars show p.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each byte copied, I can compute the current percentage for the current file and the overall percentage. But since the files are processed sequentially, each file's bytes are copied one after another.\n\nBut considering that for each byte x in file i, the current progress is floor(100 * x / a_i) for the first bar, and floor(100 * (sum of previous files + x) / total_sum) for the second bar.\n\nThe challenge is to check for all possible p in 0-100 whether there exists a moment where both bars show p.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check this?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to simulate each byte copied and track the two percentages, then collect all p's that are seen in both bars at the same time.\n\nBut given that each a_i can be up to 1000, and n up to 100, the total number of bytes is up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. For each of these, we can compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. Then collect all such p's.\n\nBut wait, even for 1e5 steps, that's manageable. Because 1e5 is acceptable for Python in terms of processing time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the total_sum of all a_i's.\n\n2. For each file i, iterate through each byte x (from 1 to a_i). For each x:\n\n   a. Compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   b. Compute total_bytes_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x\n\n   c. total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n   d. Check if current_percent == total_percent. If so, add that value to a set of possible p's.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state where both bars are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are 0. But according to the note, the initial state is included. However, the problem says \"after copying each byte\", but the initial state is before any bytes are copied. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\n\"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\"\n\nSo the initial moment (before any bytes are copied) is considered. However, according to the problem statement, the values are updated after each byte. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. But when does that count? Let's check the example.\n\nIn the first example input, the output includes 0 and 100. Since there's only one file. For example, when the first byte is copied, the current percent is floor(100 * 1 /6 )= 16, and the total percent is same. But the initial 0 is also counted. So the output includes 0.\n\nSo in our simulation, we need to include the initial state (0,0) as a possible moment. But according to the problem description, the initial state is when no bytes have been copied yet. However, according to the formal description, the first bar shows floor(100x/a_i) after copying x bytes. So for x=0, that would be 0. But the problem says that the values are updated after each byte. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. However, the problem says that the initial state is considered as 0% for both.\n\nSo perhaps we should include the initial 0% as a possible value. However, when simulating, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. How do we capture that?\n\nWell, in the simulation, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) would be considered as both bars showing 0. So we need to check that.\n\nBut according to the formal description, the first bar is computed after copying x bytes. So for x=0, it's 0. But perhaps the problem counts that as a valid moment. However, the problem says that the values are updated after copying each byte. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is a moment when both bars are zero. However, the problem says that after copying each byte, the bars are updated. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. But how do we model that?\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state is considered. So we need to check if 0 is present. For example, in the first test case, the output includes 0 and 100. The 100 is achieved when all bytes are copied. But how?\n\nAt the moment when the last byte is copied, the first bar would be 100% (since x = a_i, so 100 * x /a_i = 100.0, floor is 100. The total percent would be 100% as well. So that's included.\n\nBut the initial moment (before any bytes) is 0% for both. So we need to check that.\n\nSo in our code, we need to include that initial 0% as a possible value. But how?\n\nWell, the initial state is not covered by the simulation steps. Because the simulation steps are for each byte copied. So for example, for the initial state, we can add 0 to the set of possible p's. But how do we know that there is a moment when both bars are zero?\n\nBecause the initial state is a moment. So we need to check if 0 is present. But in the simulation steps, when x is 0, but that's not part of the steps. Because for each file, x runs from 1 to a_i.\n\nSo the initial state (0%) is a separate case. So perhaps we should check if 0 is possible. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state shows 0% for both. So that's a valid moment. Therefore, 0 is always present in the answer. But looking at the examples, the first example's output includes 0. The second example's output includes 0 as well.\n\nBut in the second example, the output is 0,95,...100. So 0 is present. So the initial state is considered.\n\nSo how to handle this? Well, in our code, we can start by adding 0 to the set. Then, process all the bytes. But wait, what if during the simulation, the 0% is achieved again? Like, for example, if the first byte is copied and the first bar is 0% (if a_i is larger than 100?), but the total percent is also 0. Then 0 would be added again. However, the initial 0 is already in the set.\n\nBut the problem says to collect all numbers that exist in any moment. So even if 0 is present in multiple moments, we just need to include it once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nThen, for each byte copied (as per the simulation steps), compute the two percentages. If they are equal, add that value to the set.\n\nBut wait, what about when the entire copy is done? For example, when all bytes are copied. At that moment, the first bar is 100% (for the current file), and the total bar is 100% as well. So this is a valid moment. So in the simulation steps, for the last byte of the last file, we will compute 100% for both. So that's included.\n\nBut in the initial state, the 0% is added. However, during the simulation steps, when the first byte is copied, the first bar may be 0% (if a_i is large enough). So the code needs to account for that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute total_sum = sum(a).\n\n- Initialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\n- For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   - For each x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      - current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      - total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of a[0] ... a[i-1]\n\n      - total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n      - if current_percent == total_percent, add that value to the result set.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev? Well, we can precompute the prefix sums.\n\nFor example, compute prefix_sums where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for the i-th file (0-based?), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and then adding x gives the total bytes so far.\n\nWait, for example, for the first file, the sum_prev is 0. Then, for each x in 1..a[0], the total bytes so far is 0 + x.\n\nSo the code can compute the prefix sums first.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums: a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute prefix_sums as follows:\n\nprefix_sums[0] = 0\n\nprefix_sums[1] = a[0]\n\nprefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1]\n\n...\n\nprefix_sums[i] = sum of first i files (for i from 0 to n)\n\nSo for the i-th file (0-based in the original list), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and when processing x in that file, the total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sums[i] + x.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is prefix_sums[0] = 0. Then, for each x in 1 to a[0], the total bytes is 0 + x.\n\nOnce that is set up, then for each x in each file, compute the current percent and total percent.\n\nNow, for each x, the code can compute those values and check if they are equal.\n\nOnce all these are processed, collect all the p's in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut also, we need to check if 100 is present. Because when the last byte is copied, the total is 100% (since total_bytes_so_far is total_sum, so (100 * total_sum) // total_sum is 100. Similarly, for the current file, x is a[i], so (100 * x) // a[i] is 100. So in that case, 100 is added to the set.\n\nBut in the initial code, when we add 0 to the set, but the 100 is added during the simulation steps. So that's covered.\n\nBut what about the moment when all bytes are copied? That is, after the last byte is copied. So during the simulation steps, that is captured when x is the last byte of the last file.\n\nSo the code seems to capture that.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nTotal sum is 6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6].\n\nFor the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0.\n\nFor x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 0 + x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) // 6.\n\nSo for each x, current and total are same. So for x=1, 100*1/6 is 16.666..., floor 16. So 16 is added. Similarly, for x=6, 100*6/6=100, which is added.\n\nBut the initial 0 is added. So the set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput is 2 files, 100 and 500. Total sum is 600.\n\nThe output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nLet me think about that. How does that happen?\n\nThe initial 0 is present. Then during the simulation steps, for the first file (size 100), each x from 1 to 100.\n\nFor each x, current_percent = (100x)/100 = x. So current_percent is x.\n\nThe total_bytes_so_far is 0 + x. So total_percent is (100 * x) / 600 = x/6. For example, when x=1, total is 0.166... floored to 0. So current is 1, total is 0. Not equal. So no addition here.\n\nBut when x=6, total is (6*100)/600 = 1% (since 6*100=600? No, wait 100*x is 100*6=600, divided by 600 is 1. So floor is 1. So current is 6. So 6 != 1. Not added.\n\nSo during the first file, the current percent is x, and the total is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So for these to be equal, x must equal floor(x/6). Which is only possible when x=0 (but that's handled in initial step) or maybe other cases?\n\nWait, for example, when x=600, but that's beyond the first file's size of 100. So during the first file, the current percent is x (since 100x/100 = x). The total percent is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So when x=6, current is 6, total is 1. Not equal. When x= 6*100 = 600? But the first file is only 100 bytes. So during the first file, the current percent is x (from 1 to 100), and the total percent is x/6 (from 0.166 to 16.666). So during the first file, the current percent is higher than the total percent. So the only time when they are equal is when x=0 (initial) and when x=600 (but that's not possible here).\n\nBut during the first file, there's no matching except the initial 0. Then, after the first file is copied (x=100), the total bytes so far is 100. The total percent is (100 * 100) / 600 = 16.666... floored to 16. The current percent for the first file is 100% (since x=100, a_i=100). So 100 vs 16: not equal.\n\nThen, moving to the second file (size 500). For each x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 500.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 + x.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find when (100x//500) equals (100*(100 + x) // 600).\n\nLet me take some examples.\n\nFor example, when x= 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100*500)/500 = 100. total is (100*(100+500))/600 = (600*100)/600 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nSo that's why 100 is in the output.\n\nWhat about other values?\n\nLet me think for x= 495.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * 495)/500 = 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + 495 = 595.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * 595)/600 = 99.166... floored to 99. So yes, 99 equals 99. So this is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 494:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100*494)/500 = 98.8 → 98.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + 494 = 594 → (594 * 100)/600 = 99.0 → 99. So 98 != 99. Not added.\n\nSo for x=495, 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly, when x= 595 - 100 = 495? Not sure.\n\nBut in the sample output, the numbers 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 are present. So how do they come about?\n\nLet me take for example 95. We need to find x in the second file where current_percent = 95 and total_percent =95.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/500 = 0.2x. So 0.2x >=95 and <96 → x >= 95*5 = 475, and x < 480. So x ranges 475-479 (since 475*0.2=95, 479*0.2=95.8 → floor is 95).\n\nFor each of these x, the total_bytes_so_far is 100 +x. The total_percent is (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nWe need this to be 95.\n\nSo 95 ≤ (100*(100+x))/600 < 96 → multiply all parts by 600:\n\n95 * 600 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 96 * 600 → divide by 100:\n\n570 ≤ 100 +x < 576 → subtract 100:\n\n470 ≤ x < 476.\n\nSo x must be between 470 and 475 inclusive (since x is integer). But earlier, current_percent is 95 when x is between 475 and 479. So the overlapping x's are 475. So for x=475:\n\ncurrent_percent is 95 (since 475 * 100 /500 = 95).\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 + 475 = 575. total_percent is (575 * 100) /600 = 57500/600 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes, 95 equals 95. So this x=475 is a valid case. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly for other values. So that's how 95 is in the output.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nThus, the approach of checking every byte's progress seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, then the list of a's.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nInitialize a set called result, starting with 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the elements of the result, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nBut how to compute prefix_sums?\n\nIn Python, for example, for the list a, prefix_sums can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize result = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of elements in the result.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. What about the 100%? For example, when the last byte is copied, the code would add 100 to the set.\n\nYes, because during the loop, for x being the last byte of the last file, current_p would be 100, and total_p would be 100.\n\nSo the code should capture that.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6. prefix_sums is [0,6].\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev=0, current_file_size=6. x runs 1-6.\n\nEach x, current_p is (100x)//6, total_p is (100x)//6. So they are equal. So all those values are added. So the set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother example: when n=2, a=[100, 500], total_sum=600. The code adds 0, and then during processing the second file, for x=475, adds 95, etc.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when all files are 1 byte. For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum=2.\n\nprefix_sums is [0,1, 2].\n\nFor first file (i=0, sum_prev=0):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *1)/1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 +1 =1 → total_p = (100 *1)/2 = 50. So 100 !=50. Not added.\n\nFor second file (i=1, sum_prev=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 *1)/1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 1+1=2 → total_p = (200)/2 = 100. So added. So 100 is in the set.\n\nInitial 0 is added. Also, during the simulation, when x=0 (initial) and when x=2 (the end), but the code adds 0 and 100. Are there any other p's?\n\nLet me check for other x's.\n\nFor example, during the first file, when x=0 (initial) is 0. But during the simulation steps, for x=1, the current is 100, total is 50. Not equal. So the set has 0 and 100. So the output would be 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when n=1 and a=[1]. So total_sum is 1. Then, during simulation steps:\n\nx runs from 1 to 1. current_p is 100 *1//1=100. total_p is (1*100)/1 = 100. So added. So the set has 0 and 100. So output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when a file is 0? No, the input constraints say that a_i >=1.\n\nSo code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n.\n\nSecond line, n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the actual problem, the input comes from stdin. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nWhich is read as n=1, then a list [6].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly n numbers.\n\nOnce that is done, compute prefix_sums.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize result = {0}\n\nThen loop over each file and x.\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    result = set()\n    result.add(0)\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_p == total_p:\n                result.add(current_p)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nBut wait, the sample outputs have the numbers separated by newlines. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is each number on its own line.\n\nSo the code above would print each number in sorted order, each on its own line.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input would produce the correct output.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich would generate the output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: during the processing of the second file, there are several x's where current_p equals total_p.\n\nFor example, when x=475, current_p is 95, total_p is 95.\n\nSimilarly, for x=480:\n\ncurrent_p is (100 *480)/500 = 96.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 +480 = 580. total_p is (580 *100)/600 = 58000/600 = 96.666... floored to 96. So yes, added.\n\nSimilarly for x=485:\n\ncurrent_p is (100*485)/500 = 97.\n\ntotal_bytes is 585 → 585 *100 /600 = 97.5 → 97. So added.\n\nSame for x=490: current_p is 98, total_bytes is 590 → 590*100/600 = 98.333 → 98. So added.\n\nx=495: current_p is 99, total is 595 *100 /600 = 99.166 → 99. So added.\n\nx=500: current_p is 100, total is 600*100/600 = 100. So added.\n\nAlso, what about x= 599? No, because the second file is 500 bytes. So x ranges up to 500.\n\nBut what about other x's?\n\nLike, for example, during the second file, x= 595? No, because the second file is 500 bytes. So x can't be 595.\n\nSo the code would collect 95,96,97,98,99,100. Plus the initial 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nWhich outputs 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet me think. The total_sum is 1000 +2+2+998 = 2002.\n\nLet me think about when the total_p and current_p are equal.\n\nFor example, during the first file (size 1000). For x= 1000, the current_p is 100. total_bytes is 1000, total_p is (1000 *100)/2002 = 100000 /2002 ≈ 49.95 → floored to 49. So 100 != 49. So not added. But during the first file, perhaps some x gives current_p and total_p equal.\n\nBut during the first file, for x= 1000, the total is 1000, which is 49.95% → 49. So current_p is 100% (since x=1000). So no match.\n\nBut during the processing of the fourth file (size 998). Let's imagine when x is 998. The sum_prev is 1000 +2 +2 = 1004. total_bytes_so_far is 1004 + 998 = 2002. So total_p is 100. current_p is (100 * 998)/998 = 100. So added.\n\nAlso, during the processing of the fourth file, perhaps when x is 998 - 1 = 997?\n\ncurrent_p is (100 * 997)/998 = 99.7 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 1004 + 997 = 2001. total_p is (2001 *100)/2002 → 200100 /2002 ≈ 99.95 → 99. So yes, 99 is added.\n\nSo 99 is in the result.\n\nWhat about 50? Let's think. Maybe during the first file, when x= 1000 * 50 /100 = 500. So x=500. current_p is 50. total_bytes_so_far is 500. total_p is (500 *100)/2002 = 50000/2002 ≈ 24.97 → 24. Not equal. So not added.\n\nBut maybe during the processing of the third file (size 2). Let's see:\n\nsum_prev is 1000 + 2 = 1002. For the third file, which is size 2. So x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1: current_p is (100 *1)/2 = 50. total_bytes_so_far is 1002 +1 = 1003. total_p is (100 * 1003)/2002 → 100300 / 2002 ≈ 50.1 → 50. So current_p (50) equals total_p (50). So added. So 50 is in the result.\n\nAh! That's why 50 is in the output. So during the third file, x=1, the current_p is 50, and the total_p is 50. So added.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that correctly.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code is as written above. Now, let me check for possible errors.\n\nWait, in the code, the prefix_sums is computed as [0]*(n+1). Then, for i in range(n), prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]. That's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: when the total_sum is zero? No, because a_i are >=1. So total_sum is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when the total_sum is 1. For example, n=1, a=[1]. Then during processing, x=1: total_p is (100 * 1)/1 = 100. current_p is 100. So added. So the result set is {0,100}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation:** Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process:** For each byte copied in each file, calculate both the current file progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Initial State Consideration:** Ensure the initial state (0% for both progress bars) is considered.\n5. **Result Collection:** Collect all valid percentages, sort them, and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_p == total_p:\n                result.add(current_p)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from standard input, where the first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides their sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation:** This helps in quickly determining the cumulative bytes copied up to each file, which is essential for computing the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process:** For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress. If they match, add this value to the set of results.\n4. **Initial State:** The initial state (0%) is added to the result set at the start.\n5. **Result Collection:** After processing all bytes, the collected results are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check every possible moment during the file copy process, leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations and ensuring correctness by considering all edge cases.",
