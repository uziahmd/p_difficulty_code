Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during their traversal based on the given movement rules. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the traversal works for both the rook and the queen. Let's recap the rules:\n\nThe figure starts at cell 1. Each move, it chooses the smallest-numbered unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This process continues until all cells are visited.\n\nSo, the key difference between the rook and the queen is their movement patterns. The rook moves in straight lines (same row or column), while the queen can move any direction (like a bishop and rook combined). Therefore, the queen has more possible moves each time, which might lead her to have more opportunities to reach the next cell without teleporting, thus paying fewer vuns. But we need the opposite: the rook's vuns must be strictly less than the queen's.\n\nHmm, so how can we construct a board where the rook's path requires fewer teleports than the queen's?\n\nLet me think about the example given. For N=4, the output shows that the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the note's explanation, the queen had to teleport twice. So maybe the queen's path requires more teleports because her movement options sometimes lead her to get stuck earlier, requiring more teleports. But how to design such a scenario?\n\nThe idea is to arrange the numbers such that during the traversal, the rook's movement options allow it to reach the next minimal cell without teleporting more times than the queen. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific pattern or structure that can be used. For example, if the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook's path can follow a certain order that allows it to collect cells in a way that minimizes teleports, while the queen's path would have more teleports.\n\nWait, but how to construct such a board? Maybe for even N, there's a way to arrange the numbers so that the rook can traverse in a snake-like pattern, while the queen's movement might get stuck earlier.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's think about when the problem is impossible. For N=1, the answer is -1 because both pay zero. For N=2, perhaps it's impossible as well? Let's see.\n\nWait, the sample input for N=4 works. So maybe for N ≥ 4, there exists a solution, but for N=2, maybe not. But how to find out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is solvable for all N ≥ 4, and for N=2, it's impossible. Let's check for N=2.\n\nFor N=2, the total cells are 4. Let's try to imagine a board where the rook and queen have different numbers of teleports.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the board is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook starts at 1. From there, possible moves are cells in same row or column. The unvisited cells are 3 (same row) and 4 (same column). The minimal is 3. So rook moves to 3. Now, from 3, the rook can move to 2 (same column?), but wait, the rook can move along rows and columns. So from (1,1) (assuming 1-based?), the rook is at position (1,1). Then after moving to 3, which is (1,2). Now, the unvisited cells are 2 and 4. The rook can move to 2 (same column as (1,2) is column 2. 2 is at (2,2). So yes, same column. So the rook can go to 2. Then from 2, the rook can move to 4 (same row). So the path is 1 → 3 → 2 → 4. No teleports. So rook pays 0.\n\nQueen's movement: starting at 1. Possible moves: same row, same column, diagonals. From 1, unvisited cells are 3, 4, 2. The minimal is 2 (number 2 is in cell (2,2)). Wait, no. The numbers are 1,3,4,2. The unvisited cells are 3,4,2. The minimal is 2. So queen can move directly to 2? Because queen can move diagonally from (1,1) to (2,2). So she goes to 2. Then from 2, the",
