He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then output how many such n's there are and list them.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count of 5s.\n\nSo for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for each m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if m is 5, then the sample input shows that n can be 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nFor n=5: 5/5 = 1, so 1 zero. Wait, but the sample says that for m=1, the answer is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait no, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. Wait, the sample input given is ['1', '5']? Wait, maybe the example input is two test cases? Wait the original problem's example says input is 1 and output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Then another input 5 gives output 0. Wait, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the actual problem is for a single m as input. So for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers. Let me check that.\n\nWait for n=5, 5! is 120, which has one trailing zero. Then 6! is 720, also one zero. Similarly 7! is 5040, one zero. Wait, wait no, 7! is 5040, which ends with one zero. Wait, but 25! would have more zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because when n is 10, the count of zeros is 2 (from 10/5=2, plus 10/25=0). So for m=1, the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nSo how to find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nThe approach here is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, there's a minimal n where f(n) = m, and then some consecutive numbers after that until f(n) increases to m+1.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Then find the largest n such that f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the valid ones. But how to find these?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's are in a range. However, there's a possibility that there are no n's for a given m. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n such that f(n)=5. Wait, but let's check:\n\nLet me compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. f(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 =6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n)=5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero. Which matches the sample input where m=5 gives output 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then find the range of n's.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Let's call it high.\n\nIf there's no such n (like for m=5), then the answer is zero.\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nFirst, we need a way to compute f(n) quickly. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nWe can use binary search. Because for a given m, the minimal n where f(n) >= m can be found via binary search. But since f(n) is non-decreasing, once we find that, we can check if f(n) is exactly m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the idea is that for a given m, the possible n's must be in a certain range. For example, the minimal n where f(n) = m is the first occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence. The maximum n is the last occurrence.\n\nBut how to find these?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can find the lower bound of n where f(n) = m. Let's say, find the first n where f(n) = m. Then find the upper bound where f(n) = m. The numbers between them are all valid.\n\nBut how to find these?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor a given m, find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low. Then check if f(n_low) is equal to m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_low, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_high, then all numbers from n_low to n_high-1 will have exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nSo, for example, for m=1:\n\nFind the smallest n where f(n) >= 1. That is 5. Then check if f(5) is 1. Yes. Then find the smallest n where f(n) >= 2. Which is 10. Then the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1) are the valid ones. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the count is 10-5=5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see:\n\nFind the smallest n where f(n) >=5. Let's compute f(24)=4, f(25)=6. So the smallest n where f(n)>=5 is 25. Then check if f(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So there's no solution. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the lower bound (the first n where f(n) >=m). Then check if f(n) is equal to m. If not, return 0. Else, compute the upper bound (the first n where f(n)>=m+1). Then the numbers between lower and upper-1 are the valid ones.\n\nThus, the number of valid n's is upper - lower.\n\nSo the key is to implement a function that for a given target, finds the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nHow to implement that?\n\nWe can use binary search. The function f(n) is non-decreasing. So for the binary search, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nBut what is the possible range of n for binary search?\n\nWell, for the target m, the minimal n can be 0, but since n is positive integer. But for binary search, we can set the low to 0 and high to 5*m. Because for example, the number of trailing zeros in (5*m)! is at least m. Because 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms. So for any m, the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But maybe even a higher value. But for binary search purposes, we can set the high to something like 5*m, but perhaps 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, m=1, 5*1=5. Which is the correct n. For m=5, 5*5=25. Which is the n where f(n) is 6. So the binary search for target m=5 would find 25 as the minimal n where f(n)>=5. But since f(25)=6>5, then there's no solution.\n\nSo the binary search function needs to find the minimal n where f(n) >= target. Let's code that.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where f(n) >= m.\n\n   a. If f(n_low) != m, then there are no solutions. Output 0.\n\n   b. Else, find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n2. The numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the valid n's. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nImplementing the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nFunction count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros.\n\nNow, the binary search function for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*target (or some higher number). Let's think about the upper bound.\n\nBut for example, for target m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because 5*m has at least m zeros. Because 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms may add more. So for example, 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nBut perhaps 5*m is not enough. Let's take m=5. 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is >=5. So the minimal n is 25. But for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25. So for the binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m. However, perhaps for some cases, 5*m is not enough. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, target=1. 5*1=5. Which is the correct n. For target=2, 5*2=10. Which is the correct n. For target=3, 5*3=15. count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So yes. So 5*m seems to be a safe upper bound.\n\nBut what if the target is very large, like 1e5? Well, 5*1e5 is 500,000. Which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target can be done between low=0 and high=5*target.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n).\n\nImplement a binary search function that returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we have that, for the given m:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m, then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nThe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, what if m is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nso the count is n_high -n_low.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m is such that there are multiple n's.\n\nBut for example, for m=1, n_low is 5, n_high is 10. So the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate those numbers.\n\nNow, the code for the binary search function.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nYes, this is a standard binary search for the minimal n where the condition is met.\n\nBut let's test it for target=1:\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5*1=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nlow=0, high=5. mid=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 < 1. So set low=3.\n\nNow, low=3, high=5. mid=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1. set low=5.\n\nNow low=5, high=5. exit loop. return 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: target=5.\n\nlow=0, high=25.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's see, for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. For n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25? Or is there a lower n?\n\nWait, for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. So no. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. So the function returns 25. Then, check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code for find_min_n is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the count is n_high -n_low.\n\nBut what if n_high is infinity? Well, for m+1, the find_min_n will return some value.\n\nBut for example, when m is very large, but there is no n for m+1. But since m can be up to 1e5, but for any m, there exists some n where count_zeros(n) = m. Well, no. For example, m=5, there is no n. But for m+1=6, there are n's. So the code for find_min_n(m+1) will return some value.\n\nBut in any case, the code will proceed.\n\nSo, now, the code in Python.\n\nBut first, what about the edge cases?\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nCase 2: m=5. As discussed, returns 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nfind_min_n(6) → ?\n\nLet's see:\n\nLooking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So n_low=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 → yes.\n\nThen find_min_n(7). Let's see:\n\nWhat's the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nn=25: count_zeros is 6. n=26: same. n=29: same. n=30: count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1=7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read m from input. Then perform the steps.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen the binary search function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for very large target, 5*target could be very big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But for Python, that's manageable.\n\nNow, the main code.\n\nRead m from input. Let's say m is given as an integer.\n\nBut the input is a single line, which is m. So in the sample input, the first case is m=1, the second is m=5.\n\nBut the code should process one m per run. So the code would read m from stdin.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        k = n_high - n_low\n\n        print(k)\n\n        if k >0:\n\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\n        else:\n\n            print()\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. The code would generate range(n_low, n_high) → n_low is 5, n_high is 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(n_low, n_high) is [n_low, n_high-1], so that's correct.\n\nBut when k is zero? Well, in the else clause, k is n_high -n_low. But in the case where n_high is equal to n_low, then k is zero. But that can't happen because if count_zeros(n_low) = m, then for n_high = find_min_n(m+1), which is the first n where count_zeros is >=m+1. So for example, if m=5, and n_low is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6 !=5, so the code would output 0. So in the else clause, the code is only entered when count_zeros(n_low) ==m. So in that case, n_high is the first n where count_zeros >= m+1. So n_high must be >=n_low +1? Not necessarily. For example, if m=6, and n_low is 25. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So n_high is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's exactly one n? Like m=2. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So for m=2, n_low is 10, n_high is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. That's 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about m=3?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). Then find_min_n(3) returns 15. Then find_min_n(4) would be 20. Because count_zeros(20) is 4. So the numbers are 15-19. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut let's think about when m is such that there's only one n. For example, m=24. Suppose that for n=100, count_zeros(100) is 24. Then for m=24, n_low is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be 100? Or maybe 100?\n\nWait, count_zeros(100) is 100//5 + 100//25 + 100//125 = 20 +4 +0 =24. So for m=24, the n_low is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be 100? No. Because count_zeros(100) is 24, which is less than 25. So the code would search for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's compute for 100: 24. 105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → total 25. So find_min_n(25) returns 105. So the numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So again, 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo the code for the main function would be:\n\nBut in the code above, when k is zero, but how can that happen? Because if count_zeros(n_low) == m, then n_high is the first n where count_zeros is >=m+1. So n_high must be >=n_low. But for example, if m is such that there is exactly one n. For example, if m is 24, but for some reason, the next number (n_low+1) has count_zeros(n_low+1) = m+1. Then n_high would be n_low+1. So the numbers would be from n_low to n_high-1 = n_low. So k is 1.\n\nSo the code would output 1 and the number n_low.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the code, when k is n_high -n_low. So for example, if n_high is n_low +1, then k=1.\n\nSo the code for the main function:\n\nOnce we have k = n_high -n_low, then print k, and then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nSo in the code, the line:\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nBut when k is 0, that would be impossible, because in the else clause, we have count_zeros(n_low) ==m, and n_high is the first n where count_zeros >=m+1. So n_high must be >=n_low +1? Or not?\n\nNo. Suppose m=5, but for some reason, the code is in the else clause. Which is not possible, because for m=5, the code would have count_zeros(n_low) !=m. So in the else clause, the code is entered only when count_zeros(n_low) ==m. So for example, suppose m=24, and n_low is 100, and n_high is 100. Which would mean that count_zeros(100) >= m+1 (25). But count_zeros(100) is 24, which is less than 25. So that can't happen. So the code for find_min_n(m+1) would return a value >=n_low. So the code for n_high is >=n_low.\n\nBut in the case where m is such that the next number (n_low) is the first to reach m+1. For example, if m=24, and for n_low=100, count_zeros(100) =24. Then find_min_n(25) would return 105. So the code is okay.\n\nSo in the code, the 'range(n_low, n_high)' will generate the numbers from n_low to n_high-1. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the 'range' is from n_low to n_high. Wait, no. In Python, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,...,b-1. So for example, range(5,10) gives 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct for the sample input.\n\nSo the code for the main function is:\n\nBut in the code above, when k is zero? Well, when n_high is n_low, then k is zero. But that can't happen. Because in that case, find_min_n(m+1) returns n_low. Which implies that count_zeros(n_low) >=m+1. But since count_zeros(n_low) is m, that's impossible. So the code for the else clause will have k >=1.\n\nSo the code can safely print the range.\n\nSo in the code, the main function:\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        k = n_high - n_low\n\n        print(k)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is m=1, which outputs 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. The code would generate range(5,10), which is 5,6,7,8,9. So the code would output 5 followed by that line. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when k is zero? Well, that's not possible here. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the code for m=5.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the code prints 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. n_low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So k=5, and numbers from 25 to 29. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about m=24?\n\nn_low is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then find_min_n(25) is 105. So the numbers are 100,101,102,103,104. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the input constraints say m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the find_min_n function returns a value that is too high? Let's think of a case where the target is 1, but the high is 5*target=5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: m=3. Let's find n_low.\n\nfind_min_n(3) → looking for first n where count_zeros(n) >=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=15: count_zeros is 3. So the function returns 15. Then find_min_n(4) is 20. So the range is 15-19. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother case: m=4. count_zeros(20) is 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0). So n_low=20. find_min_n(5) is 25. So the range is 20-24. Which is 5 numbers. So correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for the code, when the output is k=0, it prints 0. Else, prints k and the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the sample input for m=5 outputs 0. For m=1, outputs 5 and the numbers.\n\nAnother thing: for cases where the numbers are more than 1e5? Well, the code is supposed to handle m up to 1e5. For example, for m=1e5, the code would compute n_low and n_high.\n\nBut what about the upper bound for the binary search? For example, for target=1e5, the high is 5*1e5=500,000. But the actual n_low could be higher than that? Let's see.\n\nWait, for target=1e5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1e5.\n\nBut count_zeros(5*1e5) = count_zeros(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124, 000 + ...? Well, it's definitely larger than 1e5. So 5*target is a safe upper bound.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut the code must read input from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first case is m=1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second case is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut the code reads m from stdin once. So the code is written for a single test case. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided ['1', '5'] as input. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one m per run.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code reads one line, which is m.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the 'main()' function is called.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. However, the code would print '5' followed by the line with the numbers. So the code's output would be:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nBut the sample output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the first print(k) is followed by print('...'), which would print the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when k is zero? Well, in that case, the code prints 0 and nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nTesting the code for m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. find_min_n(7) is 30. So k=5. Print 5 and 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when there's no numbers? For example, m=5, code returns 0.\n\nNow, what about when m=0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle.\n\nBut what about m=0? Let's see. The code would read m=0. Then find_min_n(0). Let's see:\n\ntarget=0. The code for find_min_n(0) would have high=5*0=0. So low=0, high=0. returns 0. count_zeros(0) is 0. So code would proceed to find n_high = find_min_n(1). Which is 5. So k=5-0=5. Then print 5 followed by 0 1 2 3 4. But that's not correct. But since m is given as 0, which is invalid according to the problem statement, but the code would process it. However, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5, so the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nBut what about when the range is empty? For example, when m is such that there is exactly one n. Like, if for some m, the count_zeros(n) is m for exactly one n. But according to our previous analysis, this is not possible. Because for any n, the count_zeros(n) is same as count_zeros(n-1) or one more. So for example, when n is a multiple of 5, but not of 25. For example, n=5. count_zeros(5) is 1. count_zeros(4) is 0. So between 5 and 9, the count_zeros is 1. So there are 5 numbers. So the code always returns 5 numbers, or 0. But is that true?\n\nWait, what about when n is 25?\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(24) is 4. So between 24 and 25, the count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no n. But for m=4, the numbers would be from 20 to 24 (count_zeros(20)=4, count_zeros(24)=4, count_zeros(25)=6). So for m=4, the code would return 5 numbers (20-24). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $ using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $, we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible values of $ n $.\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (denoted as $ n_{\\text{low}} $) where $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ (denoted as $ n_{\\text{high}} $) where $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ are those between $ n_{\\text{low}} $ and $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently determining the lower bound of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input $ m $, determines the lower bound $ n_{\\text{low}} $ for $ m $, checks if it's valid, and then finds the upper bound $ n_{\\text{high}} $ for $ m+1 $. The valid range of $ n $ values is from $ n_{\\text{low}} $ to $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
