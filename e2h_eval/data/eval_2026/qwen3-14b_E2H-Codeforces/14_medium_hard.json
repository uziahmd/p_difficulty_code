    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, the key point here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes multiple n's can give the same count. For example, when m is 5, the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 all have 6 trailing zeros? Wait no, maybe I should check that again. Wait, let me think. For n=25, the count is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Then for n=26, same as 25, since 26//5 is 5, 26//25 is 1. So adding those gives 6. Similarly for 27, 28, 29. Then for 30, it's 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → total 7. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25-29) that have exactly 6 trailing zeros. Oh right, which is the example given in the problem statement. Wait the first sample input was m=1, and the output was 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let me check that. For n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1. So yes, all numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, but wait 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1?), no, wait 7! is 5040, which ends with one zero. So yeah, that's why the sample input m=1 gives 5 numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find those n's efficiently.\n\nBut how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's that correspond to m. Let me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how to find those n's?\n\nThe idea is that for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other number?) that satisfy the condition. Wait, but in the example, for m=1, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think. For m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because for n=5, f(n)=1, and for n=9, it's still 1. Then when n=10, f(n) becomes 2. So the range is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. So the count is 5. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, like 5, then adding numbers up to 9 doesn't add any more 5s. So the count remains the same. But when you reach 10, which adds another 5 (since 10 is 2*5), so the count increases by 1.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nThe approach I can take is:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the maximum n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this high.\n\nIf such n exists, then the numbers from low to high inclusive are all the possible n's. The count would be high - low + 1. But how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, but why 5? Because when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, but not of 25, then adding 4 numbers after that (like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) will have the same count. But if the number is a multiple of 25, then adding more numbers would require checking.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible numbers?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the possible n's that satisfy f(n) = m. How can I find those?\n\nFirst, I need to find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Then find the largest n such that f(n) = m. If there is no such n (i.e., there's no n where f(n) equals m), then output 0. Otherwise, the numbers between low and high are the answer.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence of m.\n\nBut first, how to find if there exists any n such that f(n) = m?\n\nFor example, if m is 5, what's the possible n's?\n\nLet me compute for m=5. Let's see:\n\nn=24: f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4.\n\nn=25: 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0. So the output would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is that for some m, there's no n that gives exactly m trailing zeros. So the first thing is to check whether such n exists.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. If the minimal n does not exist (i.e., there's no n with f(n)=m), then output 0. Otherwise, the numbers from min_n to max_n are the answers.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nTo find min_n, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Similarly, for max_n, find the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to perform that binary search?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach for finding the first occurrence of m.\n\nFirst, we need to find the lower bound of m. Let me think about the possible range for n. For example, the number of trailing zeros for n is at least n/5 (but actually more). So for m, the possible n is between 5*m and 5*m + 4? Not sure. Wait, for example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=6, the minimal n is 25. So perhaps the lower bound for n is 5*m, but that may not be accurate. Alternatively, the minimal n is around m * 5, but perhaps higher.\n\nBut for binary search, we can set the low and high boundaries. Let's think: the maximum possible n for which f(n) can be m is 5*m. Wait, no. For example, m=1, the maximum n is 9. Which is 5*1 + 4. But for m=6, the maximum n is 29, which is 5*6 + (-1). Hmm, perhaps not. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. Wait, but for m=6, 5*6=30. And the maximum n for m=6 is 29. So 5*m is a safe upper bound. Because f(5m) is at least m. Because for n=5m, the count is floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... which is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is definitely more than m. So perhaps for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m. But maybe even 5*m is not sufficient. Wait, for m=1, 5*m is 5, which is the minimal n. But for m=6, the upper bound is 29. So 5*m is 30, which is higher than 29. So using 5*m as upper bound is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better upper bound is 5*m. Because for any m, the number of trailing zeros in (5*m)! is at least m. So if there exists an n with f(n)=m, then it must be less than or equal to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is larger than m. Therefore, the first occurrence of m must be before 5*m. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nWait, but what if m is such that there's no n with f(n)=m? For example, m=5. Then, the upper bound would be 25. Let's check what is f(25) = 6. So the upper bound is 25. So binary search would find that there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Also perform another binary search to find the maximal n where f(n) = m. If the minimal n is not found (i.e., there's no n with f(n)=m), then output 0. Else, output all numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nLet me think about the binary search for min_n.\n\nThe idea is to find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. But how?\n\nWe can first check if there exists any n with f(n) = m. To do that, we can find the lower and upper bounds where f(n) could be m.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the first occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach for finding the first occurrence of m.\n\nThe binary search can be done on the possible n values. Let's say we want to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then, check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution.\n\nWait, but that approach may not work directly. Let me think.\n\nLet me first find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this value 'low'. Then, check if f(low) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Similarly, find the maximum n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find the maximum n where f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum n is the largest n such that f(n) = m, which is the same as the first n where f(n) > m minus 1. So if we find the first occurrence of m+1, then subtract 1, that would be the maximum n where f(n) = m. But only if there exists such a value.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this 'left'.\n\n2. Check if f(left) is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions. So output 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this 'right'.\n\n4. Then, the maximum n with f(n) = m is right - 1.\n\n5. So the numbers from left to right-1 are the valid n's. So the count is right - left.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample where m=1:\n\nFind left as the minimal n where f(n) >=1. That is 5. Then check if f(5) is 1. Yes. Then find the minimal n where f(n) >=2. That is 10. So right is 10. So the maximum n is 9. So the numbers are from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nFind left as the minimal n where f(n) >=6. Let's compute:\n\nFor n=25, f(n)=6. So left is 25. Check if f(25)=6. Yes. Then find the minimal n where f(n) >=7. That would be 25 + 1? Let's see:\n\nf(25)=6, f(26)=6, f(29)=6, f(30)=7. So the minimal n for m+1=7 is 30. So right is 30. So the maximum n is 29. So the numbers from 25 to 29: 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nBut in this case, the count is 29-25 +1 =5, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For a given m, find left (the first n where f(n) >= m). If f(left) != m, then return 0.\n\n- Else, find right (the first n where f(n) >= m+1). Then the numbers from left to right-1 are the valid n's. So the count is right - left.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to implementing the function f(n) and performing two binary searches.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the function f(n) which calculates the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplementing f(n) is straightforward:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the left and right boundaries via binary search.\n\nFor the binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m (or some higher value, but 5*m is sufficient).\n\nBut for large m, say m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the minimal n could be up to 5*1e5=500,000. But how do we know that this is sufficient? Well, for example, for m=1e5, the number of trailing zeros in 5*m is 5*1e5 /5 + 5*1e5 /25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than m. So the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is definitely <=5*m.\n\nSo the binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo for the binary search to find the first n where f(n) >= m:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, for finding the first n where f(n) >= m+1, we can call find_min_n(m+1).\n\nOnce we get left and right, then check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. Else, the answer is the numbers from left to right-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nThe count is right - left.\n\nThen output the count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut wait, let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nleft is find_min_n(1). Let's see:\n\nbinary search between 0 and 5*1=5.\n\nInitially low=0, high=5.\n\nmid is (0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2)=0 <1. So low becomes 3.\n\nmid is (3+5)/2=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1. low becomes 5.\n\nloop ends. return 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nright is find_min_n(2). Let's compute that.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 5*2=10.\n\nLooking for the first n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1, count_zeros(10) is 2. So the binary search would find 10 as the first n where count_zeros is >=2.\n\nso right is 10. So the numbers are from 5 to 9. So 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nleft is find_min_n(5). Let's see.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 25.\n\nWhat's the count_zeros for 24? 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 →4. 25//5=5 + 25//25=1 →6. So the first n where count_zeros is >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So when we check, count_zeros(left)=6 !=5. So output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a list, like in the example, the first input is ['1', '5'] — but wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the example shows input as ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut the example input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is a list of multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is showing two test cases, like the first input is m=1 and the second is m=5. But in the actual problem, the input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nBut perhaps this is a mistake. Looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut according to the problem description, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. However, the original problem may have been presented in a way that the user is to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input is a single m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. But the actual code should read a single integer m from the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem statement here says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, perhaps indicating that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample output, for the input ['1', '5'], the output is two lines. But the problem's note says that the first sample input is m=1 and output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5 and output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of inputs, but the actual code should read one m per input.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps because the user is to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the code should read one integer m from stdin.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the code is to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input is described as a single integer. So I think that the sample input is perhaps a mistake, and the code should read a single integer m.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nThis suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the first input is m=1, and the second input is m=5. But the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a source where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's note says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. But the sample input shows that perhaps the code is to read multiple lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '1' and the second is '5', and the output is two lines. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output again:\n\nThe first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So the code should read a single integer m. However, the sample input shows two lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. This is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is a mistake. For example, perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases. But given the problem statement, I need to proceed with the code that reads a single integer m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '1', which gives output '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and the second line is '5', which gives output '0'.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a value of m. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m. The sample input may be a mistake. So the code should read a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines. However, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, and the code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '1', the second line is '5', and the code should process each of them. But the problem says that the input is a single integer. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. For example, the first sample input has two test cases, m=1 and m=5. The output is two lines, the first being the output for m=1, the second for m=5.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show that, perhaps the problem requires handling multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is a single integer. So I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the input is given as a list of strings, but the actual code should read from stdin as a single integer. However, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, which may be a mistake.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['1', '5'], which may be a way to represent two test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement says that the input is a single integer. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two outputs, I think that the problem may have been intended to handle multiple test cases, even though the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. Perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. But how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake. For example, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is as given. The second sample input is m=5, and output is 0.\n\nBut the problem's sample input may be written as two separate test cases. However, the code should read a single integer m.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps the code should read a single integer m. For example, in the first sample input, the code reads m=1 and outputs the corresponding answer. The second sample input is m=5, which outputs 0. But the problem's sample input shows both in one line, but perhaps that's just formatting.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, I think that the code should read a single integer m from the input. So the code will read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo proceeding under that assumption.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nright = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nThe count is right - left.\n\nThen, output the count followed by the numbers in increasing order.\n\nBut for large m, like 1e5, the numbers from left to right-1 could be up to 5 numbers. Because for m=1e5, the possible numbers could be 5 numbers. Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nFor example, if m is such that there exists n where f(n) = m, then the numbers that generate that m would be in a range of 5 numbers. Because each time you hit a multiple of 5, but not 25, etc. But for numbers that are multiples of higher powers of 5, like 25, 125, etc., the range may be longer? Or shorter?\n\nWait, no. For example, when n=25, the count is 6. Then, for n=25, 26, 27, 28, 29, the count is 6. So 5 numbers. Similarly for n=125, the count increases by 3 (from 124, which would be 24 + 4 + 0 = 28? Let me compute:\n\nFor n=124:\n\ncount_zeros(124) = 124//5 = 24, 124//25 = 4, 124//125=0 → total 24+4=28.\n\nFor n=125: 125//5=25, 125//25=5, 125//125=1 → 25+5+1=31. So the count increases from 28 to 31. So between 124 and 125, there is a jump of 3. So for m=28, 29, 30, there are no n's. For m=31, the numbers would be from 125 to 129, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo for any m, there are either 0 or 5 possible numbers. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5 but not of 25, increases by 2 when n is a multiple of 25 but not of 125, etc. So the difference between the count_zeros(n) and count_zeros(n-1) is the number of times 5 divides into n. So for example, if n is divisible by 5 but not by 25, then count_zeros(n) = count_zeros(n-1) +1. So for such n, the previous numbers (n-1, n-2, etc.) would have the same count as count_zeros(n-1). So when you hit a new multiple of 5, the count increases by 1, and the previous numbers (n-4 to n) would have the same count as count_zeros(n-1) +1?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose n is a multiple of 5. For example, n=5. Then count_zeros(5) = 1. For n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, the count is also 1. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. When you reach 10, which is another multiple of 5, count_zeros(10) is 2. So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) with count 1. Similarly, for n=25, the count increases by 2 (from 24 to 25). So for n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. For n=24, it's 4 + 0 = 4? Wait no, earlier calculation said for n=24, count_zeros is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no n's. So the numbers for m=6 would be from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So regardless of how much the count increases, the numbers that generate the same count are 5 consecutive numbers. Because when you have a jump of k, then between the previous n and current n, there are some numbers that have counts less than the current.\n\nBut in cases where the count increases by more than 1, like from 4 to 6, then there are no n's for m=5. But for m=6, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, for any m that exists, the number of n's is 5. Unless the jump is 1, but in that case, the numbers are 5. So the code's logic of returning right-left numbers is correct, but the count could be 5, or 0.\n\nBut how can it be more than 5? For example, suppose there's a jump of 1. Then the numbers between the previous n and current n-1 would be 5 numbers. Like for m=1, the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the jump is 1, but the previous count was m-1, and the current count is m. So the numbers that have count m is from the current n to n+4? No, because for example, n=5, count is 1. For n=5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. Then for n=10, count is 2. So the numbers for m=1 are 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, the count is 5, except for cases where there is no solution. Hence, the code's logic of returning right-left numbers is correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function via binary search.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list. However, in practice, the code should read from stdin. For example, in the first sample input, the code reads m=1.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is given as a list of strings. So perhaps the code should read from stdin as per normal.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    left = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        right = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = right - left\n        print(k)\n        if k >0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, when m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. However, the code would generate range(left, right) which is from 5 to 10 (since right is 10). But range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(left, right) includes left, but stops at right-1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut for the case where k=0, the code would print 0. But in the else clause, when k is right-left, which is 0? No, because if left is valid, then right is the first n where count_zeros is >=m+1. So if m is such that there are numbers, then right-left would be >=1?\n\nWait, for example, when m=1, left=5, right=10. So right-left=5. So the code would print 5 and the numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's exactly one n?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, m=24.\n\nLet me find what numbers have exactly 24 trailing zeros.\n\nLet me compute for n=99:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 + 99//25 + 99//125 = 19 + 3 + 0 = 22.\n\nn=100: 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → 24. So count is 24. Then n=100, 101, 102, 103, 104. For these numbers, count_zeros is 24. Then for n=105, count_zeros is 105//5=21 + 105//25=4 + 105//125=0 → 25. So the numbers for m=24 are 100-104 (5 numbers). So again 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros increases by 1, but there's only one number?\n\nNo, because for example, when you have n=5, count is 1. Then for n=5,6,7,8,9, it's 1. So 5 numbers. So in all cases where there is at least one n, there are 5 numbers. But wait, what about when the jump is 1, but the next jump is also 1?\n\nFor example, consider n=25, which has count_zeros 6. Then for n=25,26,27,28,29, count is 6. Then n=30: count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are counted and efficiently finding the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. We first find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `left`) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $. Then, we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `right`) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m + 1 $. The valid range of $ n $ values will be from `left` to `right - 1`.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no such $ n $ exists for a given $ m $, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    left = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(left) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = right - left\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(left, right))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing up the integer divisions of $ n $ by powers of 5 until the quotient is zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least the given target value. This helps in determining the lower bound of the valid range.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input value $ m $, determines the valid range of $ n $ values using the `find_min_n` function, and checks if there are any valid $ n $ values. If valid values exist, it prints the count and the range of values; otherwise, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
