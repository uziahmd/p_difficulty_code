Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern can light up points within distance d. So, I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if there's a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is that the middle of that gap is the farthest point from any lantern. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, we need to calculate the maximum distance from the nearest lantern in that gap, and then take the maximum of all those values. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is something to consider. Similarly for the end at l.\n\nWait, right. So the steps might be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be considered properly. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 5, 3, then the gap between them is 2 units. But if they are sorted as 3,5, then the gap is 2 units. So sorting is essential.\n\n2. After sorting, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap, the maximum distance needed is (gap / 2). Because if you have two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from this point to either lantern is (b - a)/2. So that's the required d for that gap. But if the gap is larger than that, then that's the maximum required d for that gap.\n\nBut wait, also need to check the beginning and end. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. But the required d for that part would be a1, because the light needs to reach from 0 to a1. Wait no. Because the lantern at a1 can cover from a1 -d to a1 +d. So for the beginning, the left end is 0. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 must be covered. So the leftmost part is 0. So the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. So the distance from a1 to 0 is a1. So d must be at least a1. Because if the lantern is at a1, then the leftmost point it can cover is a1 -d. To cover 0, a1 -d <=0 → d >= a1. Similarly, for the end. If the last lantern is at a_n, then the right end is l. So the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Check the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. The required d here is the first lantern's position (since the lantern's coverage has to reach 0).\n- Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each, compute (current - previous)/2. Take the maximum of these.\n- Check the gap between the last lantern and l. The required d here is l - last lantern's position.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but let's think again. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, and the street is length 15. Then the initial part is from 0 to 3. The lantern's coverage must reach 0, so d must be at least 3. Similarly, if the last lantern is at 14, then l is 15, so the distance is 1. So d must be at least 1. Then between lanterns, say between 3 and 5, the gap is 2. The maximum distance in that gap is 1 (the middle point is 4, which is 1 away from 3 and 5). So the required d for that gap is 1. But if the gap is between 3 and 7, then the middle is 5. The distance from 3 is 2, so d must be at least 2. So for each consecutive pair, the required d is (current - previous)/2. So the maximum of all these values.\n\nSo the overall algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute initial max_d as the first lantern's position (a[0]).\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_max = current_gap / 2\n\nif current_max > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nThen after that, check the end: l - a[-1]. Compare with max_d.\n\nThe answer is the maximum between max_d and (l - a[-1]).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at 0. Then the initial part is 0, which is okay. But the end is l - a[0] = 5 -0 =5. So d must be 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Then the initial part is 2 (distance from 0 to first lantern). The end part is 0 (since last lantern is at 5, l is 5). The gap between 2 and 5 is 3. So the middle is 3.5. The distance from 2 is 1.5. So the max_d would be max(2, 1.5, 0) → 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers 0 to 2 +d. For d=2, the first lantern covers from 0 to 4. The second lantern covers from 5 -d to 5. So for d=2, 5-2=3. So the coverage is from 3 to 5. So between 3 and 4, both lanterns cover. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes. So the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the lanterns are not sorted? Like in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nCheck initial part: 0. So the first lantern is at 0, so initial d is 0. Then between 0 and 3: gap is 3, so 3/2=1.5. Between 3 and 5: 2/2=1. Between 5 and7: 2/2=1. Between 7 and9: 2/2=1. Between9 and14: 5/2=2.5. Between14 and15: 1/2=0.5. Then the end part is 15 -15 =0. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nYes. So the algorithm works for that case.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. Initial part is 2 (distance from 0 to 2). Then between 2 and5: gap is 3, so 1.5. End part is 5-5=0. So maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, lanterns at 0,0,0. Then initial part is 0. The gaps between them are 0. The end part is 5-0=5. So the answer is 5.\n\nCase 2: One lantern in the middle. For example, n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then the initial part is 5 (distance from 0 to 5). The end part is 10-5=5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the initial part is 0, end part is 0. The gap between them is l. So the required d is l/2. For example, l=10, n=2, lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the maximum d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, coding steps.\n\nFirst, read n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nThen compute the maximum d.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The initial part is a[0], so max_d is a[0].\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the gap and divide by 2. Compare to max_d.\n\nThen check the end part: l - a[-1]. Compare to max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Because the input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as a[0].\n\nThen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_max = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_max > max_d, then update.\n\nThen check the end part: end_gap = l - a[-1]\n\nif end_gap > max_d, then update.\n\nThe answer is the max_d.\n\nBut wait, what about when the first lantern is not at 0? For example, if the first lantern is at 3, then the initial part requires d to be at least 3. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the initial max_d is a[0], which is 3. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the last lantern is at a[-1], then the end part requires l - a[-1], since the lantern's coverage must reach l.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to handle floating points. So for example, when we compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns, we need to divide by 2.0, and compare.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Second line is list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a string like '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', but in the code, perhaps the input is read via input().split().\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l. The next line has n integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nBut need to make sure that the list is sorted.\n\nOnce sorted, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n ==0: ... but n is at least 1.\n\nSo:\n\na_sorted = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = a_sorted[0]  # initial part\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nend_gap = l - a_sorted[-1]\n\nif end_gap > max_d:\n\n    max_d = end_gap\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what about the first part? For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the initial part is 0. But the code sets max_d to a_sorted[0], which is 0. Then, if the end part is l - a_sorted[-1], which could be larger. So that's correct.\n\nBut let's test the second sample input.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5\n\nlanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5].\n\nmax_d is 2.\n\nThen between 2 and 5, gap is 3. current is 1.5. So max_d remains 2.\n\nend_gap is 5 -5 =0. So max_d is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: first sample input.\n\nAfter sorted, the list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nmax_d starts as 0.\n\nThen check between 0 and 3: gap is 3 → 1.5. max_d is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: gap 2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nBetween 5 and7: 2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nBetween 7 and9: 2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nBetween 9 and14: 5 → 2.5 → now max_d is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and15: 1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nThen end_gap is 15-15=0. So the answer is 2.5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then sorted is [5]. max_d is 5. Then end_gap is 10-5=5. So max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but l is at least 1 according to input constraints. Because input says 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the initial part is 0. The gap between 0 and 10 is 10. So current is 5.0. Then end_gap is 10-10=0. So max_d is 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0, but the end is covered by the lanterns. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[2, 8]. Then the initial part is 2. The gap between 2 and8 is 6 → 3.0. The end part is 10-8=2. So max_d is 3.0. Which is correct. Because the middle of the gap between 2 and 8 is 5, which is 3 units away from 2. So d must be 3. The end part is 2, which is less than 3. So answer is 3.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Python, when printing, we need to output with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string as in the sample outputs.\n\nBut what about cases where the maximum is, say, 2.5, which is exactly 2.5, but printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code uses print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d)).\n\nBut in Python, when formatting, if the number is an integer, like 2, it will show as 2.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 2, the output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lanterns are not sorted. For example, in the first sample input, the original list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which after sorting becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute max_d as the first element.\n\nThen loop through consecutive elements.\n\nThen check the end.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nend_gap = l - a[-1]\n\nif end_gap > max_d:\n\n    max_d = end_gap\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what about the case where the first lantern is at 0. Then the initial max_d is 0. But the end_gap may be larger. For example, if l is 5 and the lantern is at 0. Then the end_gap is 5-0=5. So the code would set max_d to 5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 5, l=5. Then the code computes max_d as 0. Then between 0 and5, the gap is 5, so current is 2.5. So max_d becomes 2.5. Then end_gap is 5-5=0. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 3, and l is 5. Then the initial max_d is 0. Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3/2=1.5. Then the end_gap is 5-3=2. So the max_d is 2. Which is correct. Because the end part requires d to be 2. So the code would return 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as 0.\n\nThen between 0 and3: 3/2=1.5. max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen between 3 and5: 2/2=1.0. No change.\n\nBetween 5 and7: 2/2=1.0. No change.\n\nBetween 7 and9: same. 1.0.\n\nBetween 9 and14: 5/2=2.5. Now max_d is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and15: 1/2=0.5. No change.\n\nend_gap is 15-15=0. So max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5\n\n2 5\n\nsorted as [2,5].\n\nmax_d is 2. Then between 2 and5: 3/2=1.5. No change. end_gap is 5-5=0. So answer is 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the code sets max_d as 5. end_gap is 10-5=5. So max_d is 5.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the code's initial max_d is 0. Then between 0 and10: gap is 10 → 5.0. So max_d is 5.0. end_gap is 10-10=0. So answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The initial max_d is 0. Between 0 and5: 2.5. Between 5 and10: 2.5. end_gap is 0. So answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then initial max_d is 0. Between 0 and3: 1.5. Between 3 and10: 7/2=3.5. So max_d is 3.5. end_gap is 0. So answer is 3.5. Which is correct. Because the middle between 3 and10 is at 6.5. The distance from 3 is 3.5. So d must be 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given that each lantern can light up points within a distance `d` from it. The goal is to find the smallest possible `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Initial and Final Gaps**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, determine the maximum distance from the midpoint of the gap to either lantern. This midpoint distance is half the gap between two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius `d` is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the initial gap, the final gap, and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nend_gap = l - a[-1]\nif end_gap > max_d:\n    max_d = end_gap\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns efficiently.\n2. **Initial Gap Check**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern is considered as the initial candidate for the radius `d`.\n3. **Consecutive Gaps Check**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the maximum distance required to cover the gap is half the distance between them. This is because the farthest point in the gap from any lantern is the midpoint of the gap.\n4. **Final Gap Check**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l) is also considered as a candidate for the radius `d`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all the calculated distances is the minimum radius required to ensure the entire street is illuminated.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius by considering all critical points where the coverage might be insufficient, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.",
