Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street of length l is illuminated. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, the key idea is probably to look for the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d to cover it.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate. Similarly for the end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1, but the required d would need to cover that. But wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius. So for the first lantern, the leftmost point it can cover is ai -d. So if the first lantern is at position a1, then to cover the start of the street (0), we need that ai -d ≤ 0. Which implies d ≥ ai. Wait, no: if the lantern is at a1, then the left end of the coverage is a1 -d. So for 0 to be covered, a1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But that's only if the first lantern is not at 0. Similarly, if the last lantern is at position a_n, then the right end of the coverage is a_n +d. To cover l, we need a_n +d ≥ l → d ≥ l -a_n.\n\nSo the initial steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the order of the lanterns matters when checking the gaps between them.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from the last lantern to l. These are possible candidates for d.\n3. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns (prev, curr), the maximum distance between them is curr - prev. The middle of this gap would require a d of (curr - prev)/2. Because if the gap is G, then the minimal d needed to cover that gap is G/2. Because the lanterns can each cover up to their radius. So for example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then the middle point is 2 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 2.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum of:\n\n- the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern)\n- the last part (distance from last lantern to l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, compute the differences between consecutive elements, take half of each, and find the maximum among those. Then compare that with the initial max_d, and the overall maximum is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like, n=1. Then the max_d would be max( a[0], l -a[0] ), which is correct. Because the lantern has to cover from 0 to l, so the radius must be the maximum between a[0] (distance from 0 to lantern) and (l - a[0]) (distance from lantern to end). So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCheck the first and last positions.\n\nThen check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input is 7 15, and the lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. Then the first part is 0, so the distance from 0 to first lantern is 0. The last part is l - a[-1] = 15 -15=0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum gap is 5. So half of that is 2.5, which is the answer. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as 2,5. First part is 2 (distance from 0 to 2), last part is 5-5=0. The gaps between 2 and 5 is 3, half is 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that logic works.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif this is larger than the current max_d, update.\n\nAt the end, the max_d is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, if two lanterns are at the same position, then the gap between them is zero. So their contribution is zero, which doesn't affect the max. So that's handled correctly.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, l= something.\n\nFor example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max_d is max(5, 10-5)=5. So d=5.\n\nWhich is correct because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (radius 5).\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are already covering the entire street. For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the first part is 0, last part is 0. The gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 5. l=5. So the maximum gap is 5, so d is 2.5. Which would cover from 0-2.5 to 5+2.5. But since the street is up to 5, that's okay.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, read the input. But note that the input is given as two lines per test case? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases? Or is that a mistake?\n\nWait, looking back, the original problem says that the input is given as follows: first line has n and l, then the next line has the a_i. So the sample input shows two test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back: the input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l, the next line contains n integers. So for the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nOutput: 2.5...\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput: 2.0...\n\nSo the code should read one test case per run. Wait, but the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases for the code to process? But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But maybe that's a mistake in the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process one test case. But in the sample input, the input is given as two lines for each test case. So perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input. But perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read two lines of input. So the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps the code is supposed to process only one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's code must read from stdin. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nBut looking at the sample input provided, the first sample input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich seems to be two separate test cases. But perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description says that the input is for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's incorrect. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as two test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input description, the code is supposed to process one test case. So the sample input may have been formatted incorrectly, but the actual code should process one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read two lines: the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of ai.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the list of ai.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare with the current max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when n is 0? No, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of ai.\n\nSort ai.\n\nCompute initial max_d.\n\nThen loop from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_required > max_d:\n\n   max_d = current_required\n\nAt the end, print max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input? For example, the input may be read via input().split().\n\nBut for the first line, split into n and l.\n\nThen the second line is split into n integers.\n\nBut for the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo after reading, the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which when sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo the code would process that correctly.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Then the for loop is not entered. So the max_d is max(ai[0], l - ai[0]). Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, ai is [2,5]. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nThen for i=1, gap is 5-2=3 → current is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the max remains 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, ai=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, ai=[0,5]. Then max_d is max(0, 5-5=0) → 0. Then the gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the precision? The problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is <= 1e-9. So using floating point division in Python, which is double-precision, should be sufficient. The output format is to print 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But the code should process one test case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nThe first line is the input for the first test case, then the second line is the input for the second test case. But the problem says that the code should process a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is shown as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So if the code is written to process one test case, then in the sample input, the code would process the first test case, and the second test case would be another input. However, the problem's sample input seems to have two test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So the code should read two lines, and process one test case. Therefore, the code as written is correct.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead n and l, then the list of ai, sort, compute the max_d as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when you read input, sometimes there are leading/trailing spaces, but the code handles that via split().\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of ai.\n\nSort ai.\n\nCompute initial max_d.\n\nLoop over consecutive elements.\n\nThen print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first lantern is at 0, and the last is at 15. So the initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 3-0=3, then 5-3=2, etc. The maximum gap is 14-9=5. So 5/2=2.5, which is the answer. So the code returns 2.5, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when the first lantern is not at 0. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are not covering the ends. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[2, 8]. Then the initial max_d is max(2, 10-8=2). Then the gap between 2 and 8 is 6 → 3. So the max_d is 3. So the answer is 3. Which would cover from 2-3= -1 (so 0 is covered) and 8+3=11 (so 10 is covered). So yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`. The key idea is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns and ensure that the radius is sufficient to cover these gaps, as well as the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Initialization**: Read the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: Sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Check for Ends**: Calculate the initial radius required to cover the start (0) and end (`l`) of the street based on the positions of the first and last lanterns.\n4. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: Iterate through the sorted positions of the lanterns to determine the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover each gap is half the size of the gap.\n5. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The result is the maximum value between the initial radius check and the maximum gap check.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`. The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in easily determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Radius Check**: The initial radius is determined by the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we calculate the gap between each pair of consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover each gap is half the size of the gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value obtained from the initial radius check and the maximum gap check, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the minimum radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius required by considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street, ensuring optimal coverage with minimal computational complexity.",
