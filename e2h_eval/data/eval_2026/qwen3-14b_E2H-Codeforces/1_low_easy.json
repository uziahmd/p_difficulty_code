The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring. The problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm. Oh right, the perimeter of a rectangle. But wait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each corner is counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). Wait, no. Let me think. For a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter would be 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n + m - 2). Alternatively, 2*(m + n) - 4. Yeah, same thing.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are (current_w, current_h) where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). But wait, wait. Wait, the perimeter formula for the rectangle. Let me check with example.\n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the outermost. The rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter would be 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first sample output. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring, compute that perimeter. Then sum all perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each subsequent ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. But wait, for the next ring, it's 2 cells away from the edge. So the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells in, which would be a rectangle of (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), where i starts at 1. So for i=1, it's original dimensions. For i=2, subtract 4 from each dimension. But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, the second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension than the original. So for the second ring, the dimensions are (w-4) × (h-4), but then the perimeter is calculated based on that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (current_w, current_h) where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, the constraints on k ensure that this doesn't happen. Because the input k is given such that it's floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. So for each i up to k, the dimensions will be at least 3 - 4*(i-1). Wait, for i=1, it's 3, which is okay. For i=2, 3-4*(1) = -1? Wait, but that's not possible. But the input constraints prevent that. Because for k to be allowed, the min(w, h) must be such that after subtracting 4*(k-1), the dimensions are still at least 3? Or maybe the constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3?\n\nWait, the problem says that k is given as up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let's see. Let me think for example. Suppose min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the dimensions are 5-4*(0) = 5, which is okay. If min(w, h) is 7, then (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be 2. For",
