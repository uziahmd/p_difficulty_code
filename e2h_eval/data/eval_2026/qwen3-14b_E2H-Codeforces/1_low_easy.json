The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle. For example, the first ring is the border of the original w x h rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), but wait, for i-th ring. Wait, the description says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that work? Let me think for i=1: it's the original rectangle. So the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then for i=2, it's the perimeter of a rectangle that's 4 units smaller in each dimension. Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Like, if you have a ring around the edge, then the next ring would be inside, so for each direction, you subtract 2 cells (one from each side). So for the first ring, the perimeter is calculated as 2*(w + h - 2) - 4? Wait, no. Wait the perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each side has length, but the corners are counted twice. Alternatively, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n - 2). Or maybe 2*(w + h) - 4? Because for example, if you have a 3x3 rectangle, the perimeter is 8 cells. Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Yes. So for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_width + current_height - 2). \n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle is valid. Wait, but the problem says that k is given such that it's possible. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Well, the constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for the first ring, the rectangle is 3x3. Then the next ring would require min(w, h) - 4*(i-1) >= 3? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle to exist, both dimensions must be at least 1. But since the input ensures that k is valid, perhaps we don't have to check that. So for each i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me take the first example. Input is 3 3 1. The output is 8. Which is correct. For the first ring, the perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 7 9 2. The output is 40. Let's see. For the first ring, the perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*14 = 28. Then for the second ring, the dimensions are (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and (9 -4*(2-1))=9-4=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Sum 28+12=40. Which matches the third example. So yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\n",
