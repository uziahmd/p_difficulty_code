For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would be 7 semitones. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate distances properly considering the circular arrangement of the 12 notes.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y to be 3 semitones and Y to Z to be 4. So the total would be 7 as well, but the order of the intervals is different.\n\nThe challenge here is to compute the distances between all possible permutations of the three notes and check if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nFirst step: map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's list the order:\n\nThe notes are given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in some notations, B is followed by C. But according to the problem statement, after H comes C again. Oh right, so the order is as listed, and then it cycles. So the order is:\n\nLet me create a list of the notes in order. Let me think:\n\nThe list is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, after H (index 11), comes C again (index 0). So for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but multiplied by 1 semitone per step. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of steps from X to Y moving forward in the sequence. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if you go the other way, like E to C, the distance is 8 semitones (since you have to go E->F (1), F->F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8)). So the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but if you're going forward. Wait, but how do we compute the distance between two notes?\n\nThe problem says that the distance is taken from the lower note to the upper one. So when considering two notes, the distance is the number of semitones you move upwards from the lower note to reach the upper note. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, since E is higher than C, the distance is 8 semitones (because you have to go up 8 steps from E to reach C again? Or wait, no. Wait, the distance is measured as the number of semitones between them along the scale, but in the direction from the lower to the upper. So if you have two notes, X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is higher than X. Wait, no. Let's think of the notes as arranged in a circle. The distance between X and Y is the minimal steps when moving forward. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale, from the lower to upper. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Wait, no. Because for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let me check:\n\nIf the notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Let's say X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0). Since we need to measure the distance from X to",
