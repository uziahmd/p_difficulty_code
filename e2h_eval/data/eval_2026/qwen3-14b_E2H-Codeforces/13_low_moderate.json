For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given triad (three notes) is a major chord, minor chord, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to output one of those three options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how major and minor chords are defined here.\n\nSo, for a major triad: there must be an ordering of the three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would then be 7 semitones. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nFor a minor triad: similar but the distances are 3 and 4 semitones between X-Y and Y-Z respectively.\n\nThe key is to check all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, first step: represent the notes in a way that allows me to calculate the distances between them. Let's think about the order of the notes. The problem says that the notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait, the note after B is H? Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, right. So H is the 12th note. But in some countries, like in German notation, B is B natural, and H is B flat? Or maybe it's a different notation. But according to the problem statement, the list is as given, and after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic.\n\nSo the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, the next note after H (index 11) is C again (index 0). So the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. Wait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check: C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, D to D#, then D# to E. So that's four steps. So yes, 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is taken from lower to upper. Wait, but if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (12 - (X - Y))? Or perhaps the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but when considering the direction. Wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Because the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if you have E and C, then the lower note is C, and upper is E. Wait no, if you have E and C, then the distance from E to C is measured as going up from E to C? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let me think. Let's take the example given: the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So when you go from C up to E, that's 4 semitones. But the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So that's because the distance is measured as the number of semitones you need to go up from the lower note to reach the upper note. So if you have two notes, X and Y, then the distance between them is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X. Otherwise, it's (12 - (X - Y))? Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the distance as (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Wait, but how do we compute the distance between two notes in terms of semitones when considering the cyclic nature?\n\nAlternatively, the distance between X and Y is the minimal number of semitones you need to move upwards from X to reach Y. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then it's ",
