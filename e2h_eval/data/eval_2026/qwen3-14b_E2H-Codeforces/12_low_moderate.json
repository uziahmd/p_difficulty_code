The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering that she must do the tasks in order. Also, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she is currently at position current_pos. The next task is at a_i. How do I compute the time needed to get there?\n\nFor example, if current_pos is 3 and the next task is at 2, then since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she would have to go from 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Alternatively, if current_pos is 1 and next is 3, then moving clockwise is 2 steps (1→2→3).\n\nSo the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n? Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring. For example, current is 3, next is 2. The distance is (n - current + next) ?\n\nWait, let's think of the general case. The number of steps needed to move clockwise from current to next is (next - current) if next >= current. Otherwise, it's (next + n - current). But that's equivalent to (next - current + n) % n, but since we are dealing with positive steps, maybe that's the way.\n\nBut wait, for example, when current is 3 and next is 2, n is 4. Then (2-3 +4) = 3. Which is correct. So the formula would be (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But since next and current are between 1 and n, perhaps we can compute the difference as (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But how to compute that in code.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is (next - current) % n if that's positive, but if not, then add n. Wait, but (next - current) mod n would give the correct value. For example, next=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 which is 3. Which is correct. So the distance is (next - current) mod n, but since we can't have negative numbers, perhaps that's the way. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3. So yes, the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, if current is 1 and next is 3, then (3-1) mod 4 is 2. Which is correct. If current is 3 and next is 2, (2-3) mod4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance is (next - current) %n. But wait, what if current is 1 and next is 1? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the idea is, for each task, we need to calculate the distance from the current position to the next task's position, add that to the total time, and then update the current position.\n\nBut the tasks are given in order. So Xenia must do them in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So for each i from 1 to m, we need to compute the distance from the previous position (which starts at 1) to a_i, then accumulate that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. Like, if a_i is same as a_{i+1}, then she doesn't need to move. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute distance between current_pos and a_i, add to total_time.\n\n    set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current_pos and a_i?\n\nYes, using the formula (a_i - current_pos) % n if that's positive, else adding n. Wait, but in Python, (a",
