The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we have to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in the list a_1 to a_m, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i, and then update current_pos to a_i. But since the ringroad is circular, moving clockwise, the time between two positions depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next target is 2, in a 4-house setup. How much time does that take? Well, moving clockwise from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. Alternatively, if the next target is 3, then no steps. If the target is 4, then one step.\n\nSo the time between current and next is (next - current) mod n? No, wait. Because moving clockwise, the distance from current to next is (next - current) if next >= current, but if next < current, then it's (n - current + next). Wait, but that's not exactly right. Let's think:\n\nSuppose current is 3, next is 2. The number of steps is (2 - 3 + n) % n? Let's compute that. For n=4, (2-3+4)=3, which is correct. For current 1 and next 3, steps are 2 (1→2→3). Which is (3-1) = 2. So yes, the formula would be (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n if the modulo is handled properly. Wait, but if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. For example, next=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the time between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be calculated as (next - current) % n, but since in Python the modulo operator can return negative values, maybe we need to adjust it. Wait, no. Let's think: for example, (2 - 3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4, which is 3. So yes, (next - current) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, if next is equal to current, then it's zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (next - current) % n would give the correct steps. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we can calculate the steps needed as (current_target - previous_position) % n, and sum all those steps.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if the tasks are [3,3], then the first task is at 3, then the second is also at 3. So moving from 3 to 3 takes zero steps. So the total time would be the steps from initial position (1) to 3, then 0 steps for the next. So the total is (3-1) mod n, which is 2 steps for the first task, then zero for the second. So total of 2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Calculate the steps from current position to a_i, add to total.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each task in order, accumulating the steps between consecutive positions.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3.
