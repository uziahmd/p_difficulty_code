The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between current_pos and a_i depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, if current_pos is 1 and next is 3, then moving clockwise is 2 steps (1→2→3). So the distance between two points is (target - current) % n? Wait, no. Because if target is larger than current, then it's target - current. If target is smaller, then (n - current + target). But since the movement is clockwise, that's correct.\n\nWait, for example, current is 3, target is 2. The distance is (2 -3 +n) mod n? Let's see. n is 4. So 2-3 is -1. Adding 4 gives 3. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). But that's equivalent to (target - current) % n if we take modulo n. Wait, no. Because (target - current) could be negative. Let me think: for example, if current is 3, target is 2. (target - current) is -1. Modulo 4 would be 3, which is correct. So the distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, if target is current, the distance is zero. So yes, that formula works.\n\nBut wait, when moving from current to target, the time is the number of steps needed to reach target by moving clockwise. So the formula is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which is the same as (target - current) % n, but since in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results, that's correct.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the distance from the current position to the target a_i, add that to the total time, and then update the current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia must do them in order. So for each task i (from 1 to m), we need to calculate the time to get from the previous position (which is the position of the previous task, or 1 initially) to a_i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if a_i is 3, then a_{i+1} is also 3. Then the time between them is zero. So that's handled automatically by the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a_1 to a_m:\n\n    calculate distance between current_pos and a_i.\n\n    add that distance to total_time.\n\n    set current_pos to a_i.\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Add 2 to total_time. Now current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as given.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task.\n3. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another involves calculating the shortest path in a clockwise direction. This can be efficiently done using modulo arithmetic.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Maintain a cumulative total of the time taken to move between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, which is given.\n- **Task Iteration**: For each task, we calculate the distance from the current position to the target house using `(target - current) % n`. This formula effectively computes the number of steps needed to move clockwise from the current house to the target house on a circular road.\n- **Time Accumulation**: Each calculated distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the target house after each task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity O(m).",
