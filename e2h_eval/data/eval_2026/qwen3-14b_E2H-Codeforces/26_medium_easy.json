    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Wait, the constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, so x can be from A to B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ y. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, so y ≤ z. Therefore, the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So x can be less than or equal to y. For example, if x is B and y is B, then x = y. But if x is less than B, then y is at least B, so x ≤ y. So overall, x ≤ y. And since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then y ≤ z. So the three sides satisfy x ≤ y ≤ z. \n\nSo for a triangle with sides x, y, z (ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z), the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because in this case, the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold since z is the largest. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\n- A ≤ x ≤ B\n- B ≤ y ≤ C\n- C ≤ z ≤ D\n- x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already ensured by the ranges)\n- x + y > z\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the approach. The brute force way would be to iterate through all possible x, y, z and check if x + y > z. However, given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, this would be O(B * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)), which is way too big for the constraints. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about fixing x and y, then finding the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1), but also z ≥ y (since z >= C and y <= C). Wait, because z has to be at least C, and y is at most C. So z is >= C and >= y. Since y can be up to C, and z is at least C, then z >= max(y, C). But since y is between B and C, and C is fixed, then z >= C. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] such that z < x + y. Because z must be less than x + y. So the number of z's for given x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nWait, but z must be at least C and at most D. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. So the lower bound is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). If this upper bound is less than C, then there are no z's. Otherwise, the count is upper - C + 1.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute for each x and y, the count of z's as described, and sum all these counts.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nThe constraints for x and y are:\n\nx ranges from A to B (inclusive), and y ranges from B to C (inclusive). Let's note that B can be up to 5e5, so the total number of x and y pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, then it's 5e5 * 1 = 5e5 pairs. Which is manageable, but for larger cases, like when B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then it's 5e5 * 1 = 5e5 pairs. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the total pairs would be (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) = (something) * 1. So perhaps the maximum number of pairs is (5e5)^2, which is 2.5e11. That's way too big for a nested loop. So this approach would not work for large inputs.\n\nWait, but the constraints for A, B, C, D are up to 5e5. So if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the y range is only one value. So the total number of pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) = (say) 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. Which is acceptable. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the y range is 1. However, if B is 1 and C is 5e5, then the y range is 5e5, and x ranges from A to B (say 1 to 1). Then the total pairs is 1 * 5e5 = 5e5, which is manageable. However, if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the y range is 1, but if A is 1 and B is 5e5, then the x range is 5e5 elements, and the total pairs would be 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. Which is acceptable. So perhaps the total number of pairs is up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then the x ranges from 1 to 5e5, and y is fixed to 5e5. So the total pairs are 5e5 * 1 = 5e5, which is okay. But if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then for each x and y, we have to compute the number of z's. But in that case, the number of pairs is 5e5. So for each pair, the calculation is O(1), so total time is O(5e5) which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, and A is 1. Then the x range is 5e5 elements, and y is fixed to 5e5. So total pairs is 5e5. But if C is 5e5 and B is 1, then the y range is from B=1 to C=5e5. So that's 5e5 elements. And x ranges from A to B (say A=1, B=1). Then the total pairs is 1 * 5e5 = 5e5. So the worst case is when B is large and C is large. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5. Then the y range is 1 element, and x is 5e5 elements. So total pairs is 5e5. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then the y range is 1 element. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5 + something? No, the input constraints say that B ≤ C. So the maximum possible number of pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). For example, when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=... then (B - A + 1) is 5e5, and (C - B + 1) is 1. So 5e5 * 1 = 5e5 pairs. But if A=1, B=2, C=5e5, then the number of pairs is (2 - 1 + 1) * (5e5 - 2 + 1) = 2 * 499,999 ≈ 1e6. Which is manageable. So perhaps the maximum number of pairs is 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. Wait, but how can that happen? Let's see: for example, if B is 5e5, C is 5e5, then the (C - B + 1) is 1. But if B is 1 and C is 5e5, then (C - B + 1) is 5e5. So if A is 1, B is 1, then (B - A + 1) is 1. So the total pairs is 1 * 5e5 = 5e5. But if A is 1, B is 5e5, and C is 5e5, then the total pairs is 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. So the maximum possible number of pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). But given that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D, and B and C can be up to 5e5, but in practice, the product could be up to (5e5) * (5e5) = 2.5e11. Which is way too big for a Python solution. So this approach would not work for such cases. Therefore, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can find a way to compute the sum without iterating over all x and y.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to compute the sum over x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C else 0.\n\nLet me denote that for each x and y, the count is:\n\ncount = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C else 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → 0.\n\nElse, the number of z is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nmax(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - 1 - C + 1)) ?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nThe number of integers between C and U inclusive is U - C + 1, where U is the upper bound. So if U is min(D, x + y - 1), then the count is U - C + 1 if U >= C, else 0.\n\nSo for each x and y, the count is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the upper limit is min(D, x + y -1). So the count is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C → which is equivalent to x + y > C.\n\nWait, because x + y -1 >= C → x + y > C.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C)) ?\n\nBecause min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 = (x + y - 1 - C + 1) if x + y -1 ≤ D → x + y - C. Or if x + y -1 is larger than D, then D - C + 1.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nif x + y > C → then the count is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) ?\n\nYes. Because:\n\nIf x + y -1 >= C → x + y > C.\n\nThen, the upper bound for z is min(D, x + y -1). The number of z's is upper - C + 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nIf x + y -1 <= D → upper = x + y -1 → count is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nIf x + y -1 > D → upper = D → count is D - C + 1.\n\nSo combining both cases, the count is min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) if x + y > C, else 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing over x and y, the value of min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) if x + y > C, else 0.\n\nSo how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that D - C + 1 is a constant, let's call it K. So K = D - C + 1.\n\nIf K is zero, then D < C, but since C ≤ D, K is always ≥ 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, if x + y > C, then the contribution is min(K, x + y - C). Otherwise 0.\n\nSo the total sum is sum_{x, y} [ min(K, x + y - C) if x + y > C else 0 ].\n\nNow, how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me think of variables x and y. x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C.\n\nLet me define s = x + y.\n\nWe need s > C → s ≥ C + 1.\n\nFor each s ≥ C + 1, the contribution is min(K, s - C).\n\nBut how can we compute this sum over all x and y such that x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can split into two parts:\n\nFor s where s - C ≤ K → s ≤ C + K → s ≤ C + (D - C + 1) → s ≤ D + 1. Which is always true since s = x + y, and x ≤ B ≤ C, y ≤ C → x + y ≤ B + C ≤ C + C ≤ 2C. But D can be larger than that. However, K is D - C + 1. So for s in [C+1, C + K], the contribution is s - C. For s in [C + K + 1, ...], the contribution is K.\n\nBut since s can be up to B + C. Let me think.\n\nSo for each x and y, the contribution is:\n\nif s = x + y ≤ C → 0.\n\nif C < s ≤ C + K → s - C.\n\nif s > C + K → K.\n\nBut since K = D - C + 1 → C + K = D + 1. So for s > D + 1 → s - C would be larger than D + 1 - C = K + 1 - 1? Wait, K = D - C + 1 → C + K = C + D - C + 1 = D + 1. So for s > D + 1 → s - C > D + 1 - C = D - C + 1 = K. So in that case, the contribution is K. But s can't be larger than x + y, which is up to B + C. But since D can be larger than B + C, then for s up to B + C, which may be less than D + 1, so for s in [C+1, D + 1], the contribution is s - C, and for s in [D + 2, ...], the contribution is K. But since x and y are up to B and C respectively, the maximum possible s is B + C. So if B + C ≤ D + 1 → then for all s ≥ C + 1, the contribution is s - C. Otherwise, for s in [C+1, D+1], it's s - C, and for s in [D+2, B + C], it's K.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the total contribution can be split into two parts:\n\nTotal = sum_{s = C + 1}^{s_max} [ (number of (x,y) pairs with x + y = s) * min(K, s - C) ]\n\nwhere s_max = B + C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nFirst, compute for all possible s, the number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\nThen, for each s, multiply that count by min(K, s - C) if s > C, else 0.\n\nSo the problem becomes:\n\nCompute for each s in [C+1, B + C], the number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s. Then multiply by min(K, s - C) and sum all.\n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs for each s?\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can find a way to compute the sum over all s in a certain range.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of x and y. x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C.\n\nLet me denote that for each x in [A, B], y must be in [B, C], and x + y = s. So y = s - x. So for a given x, y must be in [B, C], so s - x must be in [B, C]. Which implies that s must be in [x + B, x + C]. Also, since x is in [A, B], then for each x, the possible s ranges from x + B to x + C.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number of pairs (x, y) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y ≥ C + 1. Then split into two parts: those where x + y ≤ D + 1 (so min(K, ...) is s - C) and those where x + y > D + 1 (so min(K, ...) is K).\n\nBut how to compute these?\n\nAlternatively, for each x in [A, B], we can compute the number of y's in [B, C] such that y ≥ (C + 1 - x) and y ≤ (D + 1 - x) (for the first part) and y ≥ (C + 1 -x) (for the second part). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider for a fixed x, and varying y.\n\nFor each x, the possible y's are in [B, C].\n\nWe need to find the number of y's such that:\n\ny ≥ max(B, (C + 1 - x)) → since x + y > C → y > C - x → y ≥ C - x + 1.\n\nBut since y must be ≥ B, then the lower bound is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nAnd upper bound for the first part (s ≤ D + 1) is min(C, D + 1 - x).\n\nBut for the second part, s > D + 1 → x + y > D + 1 → y > D + 1 - x → y ≥ D + 2 - x. But since y can be at most C, the upper bound is C. So for the second part, the number of y's is max(0, C - max( D + 2 -x, B ) + 1).\n\nBut perhaps this approach can be used. Let me think:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], the contribution to the total sum is:\n\nsum over y in [B, C] of min(K, x + y - C) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum over y in [B, C] of:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\n   if x + y <= D + 1 → (x + y - C)\n\n   else → K\n\nelse:\n\n   0\n\nSo for each x, we can compute this sum by splitting into two parts:\n\n1. y's where x + y is in [C + 1, D + 1]\n\n2. y's where x + y is in [D + 2, ...] (i.e., x + y > D + 1)\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\ncontribution = (sum for part 1) + (sum for part 2)\n\nLet me compute these parts for each x.\n\nPart 1: x + y ranges from C + 1 to D + 1 → y ranges from max(B, C + 1 - x) to min(C, D + 1 - x).\n\nFor each such y, the value is (x + y - C) = (x - C) + y. So the sum over these y is sum_{y = y_low_1}^{y_high_1} (x - C + y).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (x - C) * (number of terms) + sum_{y} y.\n\nSimilarly, part 2: x + y > D + 1 → y ≥ D + 2 - x. But since y can't exceed C, the lower bound is max(B, D + 2 - x), upper bound is C. The number of such y is max(0, C - max(B, D + 2 -x) + 1). And for each such y, the contribution is K.\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\ncontribution = [ (x - C) * cnt1 + sum_y1 ] + [ K * cnt2 ]\n\nWhere cnt1 is the number of y's in part 1, sum_y1 is sum of y's in part 1, and cnt2 is the number of y's in part 2.\n\nSo how to compute these for each x?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFor part 1:\n\ny_low_1 = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\ny_high_1 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\nif y_low_1 > y_high_1 → cnt1 = 0, sum_y1 = 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncnt1 = y_high_1 - y_low_1 + 1\n\nsum_y1 = (y_low_1 + y_high_1) * cnt1 // 2\n\nSimilarly, part 2:\n\ny_low_2 = max(B, D + 2 - x)\n\ny_high_2 = C\n\nif y_low_2 > y_high_2 → cnt2 = 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncnt2 = y_high_2 - y_low_2 + 1\n\nSo the contribution for part 2 is K * cnt2.\n\nThus, for each x, we can compute the contribution in O(1) time. Then, summing over all x from A to B gives the total answer.\n\nThis approach would be O(B - A + 1) time, which is acceptable even for B up to 5e5.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute K = D - C + 1.\n\n- For each x in [A, B], compute:\n\n   compute y_low_1 = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\n   compute y_high_1 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\n   if y_low_1 <= y_high_1:\n\n      cnt1 = y_high_1 - y_low_1 + 1\n\n      sum_y1 = (y_low_1 + y_high_1) * cnt1 // 2\n\n      part1 = (x - C) * cnt1 + sum_y1\n\n   else:\n\n      part1 = 0\n\n   compute y_low_2 = max(B, D + 2 - x)\n\n   y_high_2 = C\n\n   if y_low_2 <= y_high_2:\n\n      cnt2 = y_high_2 - y_low_2 + 1\n\n      part2 = K * cnt2\n\n   else:\n\n      part2 = 0\n\n   total_contribution += part1 + part2\n\nThus, the total answer is the sum of all these contributions.\n\nBut wait, there's a mistake here. Because part1 is for x + y in [C+1, D+1], which corresponds to x + y - C being between 1 and D + 1 - C = K. Because D + 1 - C = (D - C + 1) + 0 = K. So x + y - C ranges from 1 to K. So the min(K, x + y - C) is exactly x + y - C. So part1 is correct.\n\nFor part2, x + y - C is larger than K, so min(K, ...) is K. So part2 is correct.\n\nBut what about when x + y is less than or equal to C? Those are excluded, because y_low_1 is max(B, C+1 -x). So for x + y to be >= C+1, we need y >= C + 1 -x. So the code correctly captures that.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's compute K = D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nFor x in [1, 2], B is 2, C is 3.\n\nLet's process each x:\n\nx = 1:\n\npart1: y_low_1 = max(2, 3 + 1 - 1) → max(2, 3) = 3. y_high_1 = min(3, 4 + 1 -1) → min(3, 4) = 3. So y_low_1 = 3, y_high_1 = 3. cnt1 = 1.\n\nsum_y1 = (3 + 3) * 1 / 2 = 3.\n\npart1 = (1 - 3) * 1 + 3 → (-2) + 3 = 1.\n\npart2: y_low_2 = max(2, 4 + 2 - 1) → max(2, 5) = 5. y_high_2 = 3. Since 5 > 3 → cnt2 = 0. part2 = 0. Total contribution for x=1 is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nx = 2:\n\npart1: y_low_1 = max(2, 3 + 1 - 2) → max(2, 2) = 2. y_high_1 = min(3, 4 + 1 - 2) → min(3, 3) = 3. So y ranges from 2 to 3. cnt1 = 2.\n\nsum_y1 = (2 + 3) * 2 / 2 = 5.\n\npart1 = (2 - 3)*2 + 5 → (-1)*2 +5 = 3.\n\npart2: y_low_2 = max(2, 4 + 2 - 2) → max(2, 4) =4. y_high_2 is 3. So 4 >3 → cnt2=0. part2=0. contribution is 3. Total contribution for x=2 is 3.\n\nTotal sum is 1 + 3 = 4 → which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet's compute. A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nK = D - C +1 = 5 -2 +1=4.\n\nFor x in [1, 2].\n\nx=1:\n\npart1: y_low_1 = max(B=2, C +1 -x = 2 +1 -1=2) → max(2,2)=2. y_high_1 = min(2, D+1 -x =5+1 -1=5) → min(2,5)=2. So y ranges from 2 to 2. cnt1=1. sum_y1 = 2.\n\npart1 = (1 -2)*1 +2 → (-1) +2=1.\n\npart2: y_low_2 = max(2, D+2 -x =5+2-1=6) → max(2,6)=6. y_high_2=2. So cnt2=0. part2=0. contribution 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low_1 = max(2, 2+1-2=1) → max(2,1)=2. y_high_1 = min(2, 5+1 -2=4) → 2. cnt1=1. sum_y1=2. part1 = (2-2)*1 +2 = 0+2=2.\n\npart2: y_low_2 = max(2, 5+2-2=5) → 5. y_high_2=2. cnt2=0. contribution 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1+2=3 → matches sample.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nK = D - C +1 = 500000 -500000 +1=1.\n\nx ranges from 500000 to 500000 (only x=500000).\n\nFor x=500000:\n\npart1: y_low_1 = max(B=500000, C +1 -x = 500000 +1 -500000 =1) → 500000. y_high_1 = min(500000, D+1 -x =500000 +1 -500000=1) → min(500000,1)=1. But since y_low_1 is 500000, which is larger than y_high_1=1 → cnt1=0. part1=0.\n\npart2: y_low_2 = max(500000, D+2 -x =500000 +2 -500000=2) → 500000. y_high_2 = 500000. cnt2 = 1. part2 = 1 * 1 =1. So total contribution is 0 +1=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute for part1 and part2.\n\nBut since A and B can be up to 5e5, and the loop is O(B - A + 1), which is acceptable.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for large ranges, looping from A to B is okay as long as B - A + 1 is up to 5e5, which it is.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n\n    # part1: y_low_1 = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\n    y_low_1 = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\n    y_high_1 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\n    if y_low_1 <= y_high_1:\n\n        cnt1 = y_high_1 - y_low_1 + 1\n\n        sum_y1 = (y_low_1 + y_high_1) * cnt1 // 2\n\n        part1 = (x - C) * cnt1 + sum_y1\n\n    else:\n\n        part1 = 0\n\n    # part2:\n\n    y_low_2 = max(B, D + 2 - x)\n\n    y_high_2 = C\n\n    if y_low_2 <= y_high_2:\n\n        cnt2 = y_high_2 - y_low_2 + 1\n\n        part2 = K * cnt2\n\n    else:\n\n        part2 = 0\n\n    total += part1 + part2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if C + 1 -x is less than B? For example, if x is large enough that C + 1 -x is less than B. Then y_low_1 is B. Which is correct.\n\nTesting this code on the samples.\n\nNow, for the first sample input:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input: 1 2 2 5 → returns 3.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → returns 1.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: A=B=C=D=1 → x can be 1, y can be 1, z can be 1. Check if x + y > z → 1 + 1 > 1 → yes. So count 1. The code:\n\nK = 1 - 1 +1 =1.\n\nx runs from 1 to 1.\n\ny_low_1 = max(1, 1 + 1 -1) = max(1,1) =1. y_high_1 = min(1, 1 +1 -1) = min(1,1) =1. cnt1=1. sum_y1=1. part1 = (1-1)*1 + 1 = 0 +1=1. part2: y_low_2 = max(1, 1 +2 -1) = max(1, 2) =2. y_high_2=1. cnt2=0. So total is 1 → correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y is exactly D + 1. For example, D=5, C=3, K=5-3+1=3. x=2, y=3 → x+y=5. D+1 is 5+1=6. So part1 is for s up to 6. So 5 is in part1. So the contribution is 5-3 =2.\n\nAnother case: x=3, y=3, C=3, D=3. Then x+y=6. D+1=4. So y_high_1 = min(3, 4 -3) = min(3, 1) =1. But y_low_1 is max(B, C+1 -x). Assuming B=3, C=3. So C+1 -x = 3+1-3=1. So y_low_1 is max(3, 1) =3. y_high_1 is 1. So y_low_1 > y_high_1 → part1 is 0. part2: y_low_2 is max(3, D+2 -x) = max(3, 3+2 -3=2) → 3. y_high_2 =3. cnt2=1. K=3-3+1=1. part2=1*1=1. So total contribution is 1. Which would correspond to z being in [C, D] (3 to 3) and x + y =6>3. So z must be <6 → since D is 3, so z can be 3. So count is 1 → correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for large ranges, loops can be slow. However, given that B can be up to 5e5, and each iteration is O(1), it's manageable. Let's see for 5e5 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, handling multiple test cases. Wait, the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. But looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints on $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can simplify the problem by focusing on the triangle inequality $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we note that $x \\leq y \\leq z$. Therefore, the critical condition to check is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$, which would be computationally expensive, we use mathematical insights to compute valid ranges for $z$ based on given $x$ and $y$.\n3. **Range Splitting**: For each $x$, we determine valid ranges of $y$ such that $x + y > C$ (since $z \\geq C$) and calculate the corresponding valid $z$ values efficiently using arithmetic progression formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        A = int(input[idx])\n        B = int(input[idx+1])\n        C = int(input[idx+2])\n        D = int(input[idx+3])\n        idx += 4\n        \n        K = D - C + 1\n        total = 0\n        \n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            # Part 1: y_low_1 to y_high_1\n            y_low_1 = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n            y_high_1 = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n            if y_low_1 <= y_high_1:\n                cnt1 = y_high_1 - y_low_1 + 1\n                sum_y1 = (y_low_1 + y_high_1) * cnt1 // 2\n                part1 = (x - C) * cnt1 + sum_y1\n            else:\n                part1 = 0\n            \n            # Part 2: y_low_2 to y_high_2\n            y_low_2 = max(B, D + 2 - x)\n            y_high_2 = C\n            if y_low_2 <= y_high_2:\n                cnt2 = y_high_2 - y_low_2 + 1\n                part2 = K * cnt2\n            else:\n                part2 = 0\n            \n            total += part1 + part2\n        \n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single block and split into individual integers for processing.\n2. **Loop Through Possible Values of $x$**: For each value of $x$ within the range $[A, B]$, we determine valid ranges of $y$ values.\n3. **Calculate Valid $z$ Values**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, compute the number of valid $z$ values such that $x + y > z$ and $C \\leq z \\leq D$. This is done by splitting the calculation into two parts based on whether $x + y$ is within the range that affects $z$ directly or not.\n4. **Sum Contributions**: The contributions from valid $z$ values for each pair $(x, y)$ are summed up to get the total count of valid triangles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values without iterating through all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
