Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where a left boot and a right boot are compatible. Compatibility is when either both are same letters, or one is a question mark (which can match any). Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum k and then the pairs. And if there are multiple answers, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find the maximum number of pairs possible. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nI think the key is to match as many specific colors as possible first, then use the question marks for the remaining ones.\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose we have some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'a'. Those can be matched directly. Then, the remaining left and right boots with question marks can be matched between themselves, or with any remaining specific colors. Wait, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut how do we maximize the total pairs?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is:\n\n1. Match all left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c, count the number of left boots with c and right boots with c. The minimum of these two counts is the number of pairs we can make for that color. But wait, since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut perhaps, we can first process all the specific colors, then handle the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be matched with any color. So maybe the optimal strategy is:\n\n- First, for each color (excluding '?'), match as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take the min of left_a and right_a, and pair them. Then subtract those from the counts.\n\n- Then, handle the question marks. For the remaining left and right boots, which are either '?' or other colors that couldn't be matched yet. Now, the question marks can be matched with any of the remaining boots. But how to maximize that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph, where each left boot is connected to the right boots that are compatible. Then finding the maximum matching. However, given that n can be up to 150,000, a standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be O(E√V), which might not be feasible for such large n. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nTherefore, we need a greedy approach that can find the maximum pairs efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. Let's think about the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Match all left and right boots with specific colors. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count the number of left boots with c and right boots with c. The number of pairs for that color is the minimum of these two counts. However, since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe for each color c, we can collect all left boots with c and all right boots with c. Then, pair them up. But since the order may affect the remaining matches (for example, if there are leftover question marks), perhaps we need to process the colors in a certain order.\n\nBut perhaps the order doesn't matter here. Let's say we first process all specific colors, and pair as much as possible. Then, for the question marks, we can pair them with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nAnother idea: create two dictionaries for left and right boots. For each color (excluding '?'), we can count the number of left and right boots. Then, for each color, we can pair min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. However, this is only possible if we can assign the specific boots. But the actual indices matter for the output.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that we output the actual indices of the boots in the pairs. So we need to track which boots are used. So perhaps, for each color c, we can collect all left boots (indices) with that color, and same for right. Then, for each color c, pair the left and right boots in some way, and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots are those with '?', or those that couldn't be paired in the first step. Then, for the second step, we can pair the remaining '?'s with any remaining boots (either '?' or other colors that are not matched yet).\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nFor example, suppose after step 1, there are some left '?' and some right '?'. We can pair them. But also, if there are left '?' and right non-? (but not matched yet), they can be paired. Similarly for right '?' and left non-?.\n\nSo the second step is to match the remaining '?'s. But how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nFirst, process all specific colors. For each color c (not '?'):\n\n- Collect all left boots with color c (not yet used).\n- Collect all right boots with color c (not yet used).\n- Pair as many as possible (the minimum of the two counts). For example, take the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs. For each pair, mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nThen, after this, we have some left and right boots with '?', and possibly some left and right boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (if their counts were unequal). For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then after pairing 2, there's 1 left 'a' left.\n\nNow, the remaining boots are those that are not used yet. For these, we can pair them in a way that uses the '?'s. Since '?' can match any.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left '?'s with the remaining right boots (including '?' and specific colors), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAn idea is to collect all the remaining left boots (those not used yet) and the same for the right. Then, for each left '?' and right '?', pair them. Then, for the remaining left '?'s, pair them with any remaining right boots (non-? or ?), and similarly for the right '?'s.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can collect all the left '?' and right '?' and pair them first. Then, for the remaining left '?' and right non-? (or vice versa), pair them.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nWe have:\n\n- left_remaining: list of left boots not yet used.\n- right_remaining: list of right boots not yet used.\n\nBut perhaps, we can separate the left_remaining into those with color '?' and others. Same for right_remaining.\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet left_q be the list of left boots with '?' that are not yet used.\n\nleft_others be the list of left boots with non-? colors not yet used.\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_others.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs can be formed by:\n\nPairing left_q and right_q as much as possible. Then, pair left_q with right_others, and right_q with left_others.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nBut since '?' can match any, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of the minimum between the number of left_q and right_others + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to pair all left_q with right_others and vice versa. But since each boot can be used once, we need to find a way to pair them.\n\nBut perhaps, for the second step, we can:\n\nTake all left_q and right_q, and pair them. Then, for the remaining left_q and right_others, pair them. Also, for the remaining right_q and left_others, pair them.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs that can be made from the remaining boots is the minimum between the total number of left_remaining and right_remaining. Because each pair requires one left and one right. However, since all of them can be matched (since '?' can match anything), the maximum possible is the minimum of the number of left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nBut how to actually form those pairs?\n\nBut how to track which ones are available. For example, if there are 5 left '?' and 3 right '?', and 2 left 'a' and 4 right 'b', etc.\n\nBut perhaps, the way to proceed is:\n\nCollect all left_remaining and right_remaining. For each left in left_remaining, we can pair it with any right in right_remaining, as long as they are not yet used. But how to choose which ones to pair?\n\nBut since we need to output any valid answer, perhaps we can greedily pair them in any order.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nFirst, process all specific colors. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right boots as possible. For example, collect all left boots with color c, and all right boots with color c. Pair them in some order (like first left with first right, etc.), and mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect all the remaining left and right boots. These are the ones not used yet. Now, for these, we can pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left boot in the remaining list, we can try to find a right boot that is not yet used. Since all of them can be matched (because either they are '?', or the other is '?', or the other is same color, etc. Wait, no. Because if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'b', then they cannot be paired. But in this case, after step 1, those left and right boots would have been processed only if their color was 'a' and 'b' respectively. But since they couldn't be matched in step 1 (since they are different colors), they are now in the remaining list. So in this case, they can't be matched. So this approach would not work.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in the remaining steps, after step 1, there may be left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'b', which cannot be matched. Therefore, the second step can't just pair all left and right remaining boots, because some of them are incompatible.\n\nSo this complicates things. So the initial idea of processing specific colors first and then using the question marks is not sufficient, because after that, there may be some left and right boots with specific colors that can't be matched. So how to handle that?\n\nAh, so the problem is that the second step (using the question marks) can't pair all remaining left and right boots. Only those that are compatible. So, the problem reduces to, after step 1, how to pair the remaining left and right boots, which include:\n\n- Some left boots with specific colors (not matched yet)\n- Some right boots with specific colors (not matched yet)\n- Some left and right boots with '?'.\n\nSo the question is, how to pair them optimally.\n\nBut since '?' can be matched with anything, perhaps we can first pair the '?'s with the specific colors, then pair the remaining '?'s with each other.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the remaining left boots and right boots. Let's collect:\n\nleft_q: list of left boots with '?'\n\nleft_other: list of left boots with specific colors (not matched yet)\n\nright_q: list of right boots with '?'\n\nright_other: list of right boots with specific colors (not matched yet)\n\nNow, the possible pairs are:\n\n- left_q with right_other (since '?' can match any)\n- left_other with right_q (since '?' can match any)\n- left_q with right_q (since both are '?')\n- left_other with right_other only if they have same color (but this would have been handled in step 1, since those pairs would have been matched in step 1 if possible. So in this case, they are not matched in step 1, meaning that for their color, there were not enough pairs. For example, if there are left_other with color 'a' and right_other with color 'a' but not enough to pair them all.)\n\nSo, in the remaining step, the only possible pairs are the ones involving '?', or pairs of same color between left_other and right_other.\n\nBut since in step 1, we have already matched as many as possible for the same colors, the left_other and right_other would have different colors. So, for example, if there is a left_other with color 'a' and a right_other with color 'a', they would have been matched in step 1. So after step 1, left_other and right_other have colors that are not the same. So, in the remaining step, the only possible pairs are those involving '?'.\n\nThus, the problem becomes:\n\nWe can pair:\n\n- All left_q with right_other (each left_q can be paired with any right_other)\n- All right_q with left_other (each right_q can be paired with any left_other)\n- All left_q with right_q (each pair is compatible)\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nThe optimal way would be to first pair left_q with right_other, then right_q with left_other, then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the remaining left_q and right_other:\n\nWe can pair each left_q with a right_other. The number of such pairs is the minimum between len(left_q) and len(right_other). Once paired, those boots are used.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining right_q and left_other: pair them. The number of pairs is min(len(remaining right_q), len(remaining left_other)).\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(len(remaining left_q), len(remaining right_q)).\n\nThis would give the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps for the second part are:\n\n1. Pair left_q with right_other as much as possible.\n\n   For example, take the first x = min(len(left_q), len(right_other)) pairs. For each i in 0 to x-1, pair left_q[i] with right_other[i].\n\n   Then, remove these from left_q and right_other.\n\n2. Then, pair right_q with left_other as much as possible.\n\n   Take y = min(len(right_q), len(left_other)) pairs. Pair right_q[i] with left_other[i].\n\n   Remove these from right_q and left_other.\n\n3. Finally, pair the remaining left_q and right_q as much as possible.\n\n   z = min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\n   So total pairs added here is x + y + z.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q, right_other, etc.\n\nSo, during the first step (specific color matching), we can track which boots are used. Then, in the second step, collect all unused boots.\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can have two arrays, used_left and used_right, which are boolean arrays indicating whether the boot is already used.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, that's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for the first step:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z' (excluding '?'):\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   pair as many as possible: take the min of the two lists.\n\n   for each pair, mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nBut how to collect these lists? For example, for each color, we can have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for each color, we can process them.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can pre-process for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, that's manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, the second step is to collect all the unused left and right boots.\n\nThen, separate them into left_q, left_other, right_q, right_other.\n\nThen, proceed with the three steps as above.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nLet me think:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all left boots not used:\n\nleft_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut for each of these, we can split into q and others.\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] == '?']\nleft_other = [i for i in left_remaining if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_other.\n\nThen, proceed with the steps:\n\nPair left_q with right_other.\n\nHow to do that? For example, take the first min(len(left_q), len(right_other)) pairs.\n\nFor each pair (l_idx, r_idx), add to the result, mark them as used.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can iterate through the left_q and right_other lists, and pair them.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, creating these lists could be expensive. But given that n is 150,000, and per test case, it's manageable.\n\nOnce we pair them, then the remaining left_q and right_other are those that couldn't be paired. Then, proceed to pair right_q with left_other.\n\nThen, finally pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nThen, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   collect left list (indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i])\n\n   collect right list (indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i])\n\n   pair them: for i in 0 to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) - 1:\n\n       add pair (left_list[i], right_list[i]) to the answer.\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut wait, how to collect the left_list and right_list for each color. For example, for each color c, we can have a list of indices where l[i] is c and not used yet. But during this step, the used arrays are being updated. So, perhaps for each color, we need to collect the current available indices.\n\nBut this approach would be O(26 * n) time. Because for each color, we scan all the left and right boots. For n=150,000, 26*150,000 is 3.9 million, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, for each color, we can pre-process the positions, but during the first step, we can check if they are used.\n\nBut for the first step, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce that's done, we proceed to the second step.\n\nNow, collect all the unused left and right boots.\n\nThen, split into left_q, left_other, right_q, right_other.\n\nThen, proceed to pair left_q with right_other.\n\nFor example, take the first min(len(left_q), len(right_other)) pairs. For each pair, add to the answer and mark as used.\n\nThen, pair right_q with left_other.\n\nAgain, take min(len(right_q), len(left_other)) pairs.\n\nThen, pair remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nBut in code, after collecting left_q, right_other, etc., we can loop through them.\n\nBut for example, for the first pairing:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_other))):\n\n    add pair (left_q[i], right_other[i])\n\n    mark used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n    mark used_right[right_other[i]] = True\n\nSimilarly for the other steps.\n\nBut note that after this, the left_q and right_other lists are modified. But since we are taking the first elements, perhaps we can just take the first elements and pair them.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can generate the list of left_q and right_other, then pair them as per the indices.\n\nBut for the code, the steps would be:\n\nOnce we have left_q, left_other, right_q, right_other:\n\n# Pair left_q with right_other\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_other))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n\n    add (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) to the answer list (since the problem uses 1-based indices)\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the new left_q and right_other (but since we have already marked them as used, perhaps we can filter them again. But perhaps it's easier to take the remaining elements after pairing.\n\nBut in code, perhaps after this step, we can re-collect the left_q and right_other again (but that's not efficient). However, since after this step, we can take the remaining elements as left_q[ num_pairs : ] and right_other[ num_pairs : ].\n\nBut perhaps, for code simplicity, after pairing, we can just proceed with the remaining elements.\n\nBut since in the code, after pairing, the used arrays are marked, we can collect the remaining left_q and right_other again. But this may be redundant.\n\nAlternatively, for the code, during the second step, we can collect the left_q and right_other as lists, then pair them as per the first min(len(...)) elements, and then proceed with the rest.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to process the lists as follows:\n\nAfter the first step, collect all left and right boots not used.\n\nleft_q = list of left indices with '?'\n\nleft_other = list of left indices with non-? \n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_q with right_other\n\npair_count = min(len(left_q), len(right_other))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    pair left_q[i] with right_other[i]\n\n    mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q (after pair_count) and the remaining right_other (after pair_count).\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair right_q with left_other.\n\npair_count = min(len(right_q), len(left_other))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    pair right_q[i] with left_other[i]\n\n    mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect remaining right_q and left_other.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\npair_count = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(pair_count):\n\n    pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\n    mark as used.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q after each step.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the way to do this is to generate the lists for left_q, right_other, etc., and then process them as per the steps, keeping track of which indices are used.\n\nBut in practice, when you pair left_q[i] with right_other[i], you have to mark them as used, which will prevent them from being considered in the next steps.\n\nBut since in code, after the first step, the used arrays are already marked, perhaps during the second step, the left_q and right_other are generated again, but only including those not used. However, that would be redundant, but for code clarity, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut given that the code is for a programming competition, and efficiency is important, perhaps it's better to generate the lists once and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nOnce the first step is done, the used arrays are set. Then, for the second step:\n\nCollect left_q as [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?'] \n\nSimilarly for left_other, right_q, right_other.\n\nThen, proceed to pair left_q with right_other as follows:\n\nTake the first min(len(left_q), len(right_other)) pairs, and mark them as used.\n\nBut in code, once you pair them, you can't reuse them again. So, perhaps, during the pairing steps, we can iterate through the lists and pair them.\n\nBut in code, for example:\n\nleft_q = [indices...]\n\nright_other = [indices...]\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_other))):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n\n    add to answer\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nBut after that, the remaining left_q elements are those not paired. However, since we are processing them in order, the remaining elements would be from index i onwards. But since the code is not modifying the lists, but the used arrays, perhaps the next steps can process the same lists again. However, that would be incorrect, because those elements are already used.\n\nSo, in code, after pairing, the left_q and right_other lists should be filtered to exclude those that are already used. However, since we have already marked them as used, the next steps would not include them again.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach is better:\n\nOnce we have the left_q and right_other lists, for the first pairing, we can loop through them, and for each pair, add them to the answer and mark them as used. Then, for the next steps, when we collect the lists again, they will not contain those elements.\n\nBut that would require re-collecting the lists again for each step, which may be time-consuming. However, for the code, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the second step, we can process the lists as follows:\n\nWe can create four lists: left_q, left_other, right_q, right_other. Then, for each of the three steps, we can pair the first x elements of left_q with first x elements of right_other, etc.\n\nBut how to track which elements have been used. Well, during the pairing steps, we can mark them as used, and then in the next steps, the lists are not re-collected. But that would be error-prone. For example, if we have left_q = [a, b, c], and pair a with d, then in the next steps, the left_q is still [a, b, c], but a is already used. So, in that case, the code would attempt to pair a again, which is already used. Which is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to generate the lists for each step, considering only the unused elements.\n\nBut that would be computationally expensive. However, given that the total number of elements is O(n), and each element is processed once, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo here's the revised plan for the second step:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all the unused left and right boots.\n\nleft_available = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_available = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for the left_available, split into left_q and left_other:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_available if l[i] == '?']\nleft_other = [i for i in left_available if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_other:\n\nright_q = [i for i in right_available if r[i] == '?']\nright_other = [i for i in right_available if r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, proceed to pair:\n\n1. Pair left_q with right_other:\n\n   For each i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_other))):\n\n      pair left_q[i] with right_other[i]\n\n      mark them as used.\n\n   So, after this, the used arrays are updated.\n\nThen, collect again the available left and right boots. But perhaps, instead of doing that, we can re-collect the left_q and right_other again.\n\nBut perhaps, for the next steps, we can generate new lists based on the current used arrays.\n\nBut this would be computationally expensive. For example, for each step, re-collecting the lists.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all left_available and right_available. Then, for the second step, process them as follows:\n\nProcess the left_q and right_other:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_q)):\n\n   if used_left[left_q[i]] is False and used_right[right_other[i]] is False:\n\n      pair them and mark as used.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, for the second step:\n\nWe can generate the left_q and right_other as before, then for each pair in the first min(len(left_q), len(right_other)), add them to the answer and mark them as used. Then, for the next steps, generate new lists again.\n\nBut this would involve multiple passes over the data, which for n up to 150,000 may be acceptable.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect all left_available and right_available.\n\nThen, collect left_q and right_other as described.\n\nThen, for the first pairing:\n\ncount = min(len(left_q), len(right_other))\n\nfor i in range(count):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n\n    add to answer\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect again the left_q and right_other (but only those not used yet). But this would be redundant. However, perhaps in code, after this, we can generate new lists for the remaining steps.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to collect the left_q and right_other again for each step.\n\nBut that would be O(n) per step, which for three steps is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, for the code, perhaps the following steps can be taken:\n\nOnce the first step is done, collect all the left and right boots that are not used. Then, for the second step, we can pair as follows:\n\nCreate a list of all left boots with '?', and all right boots with non-? (but not used). Then, pair as many as possible. Then, create a list of all right boots with '?', and all left boots with non-? (but not used), and pair as many as possible. Then, pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut perhaps, for code, the following approach can be used:\n\nOnce the first step is done, collect all the unused left and right boots.\n\nThen:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\nleft_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for pairing left_q and right_other:\n\npairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_other))\n\nfor i in range(pairs):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n\n    add (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) to the answer.\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect again:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\nleft_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair right_q with left_other:\n\npairs = min(len(right_q), len(left_other))\n\nfor i in range(pairs):\n\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    l_idx = left_other[i]\n\n    add (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) to the answer.\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect again:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair them:\n\npairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(pairs):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    add (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) to the answer.\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThis way, each time we collect the current available lists, ensuring that they are not used yet.\n\nThis approach may be computationally expensive, but for n up to 150,000, it's manageable. Because each of these steps is O(n), and there are a few steps.\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions are fast, so this should be acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   collect right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(pairs):\n\n       add (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) to the answer.\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to the second step.\n\nCollect the left_q, right_q, left_other, right_other as described.\n\nThen, perform the three steps as above.\n\nBut for the first step, looping through each color in 'a' to 'z' may be time-consuming. However, for n up to 150,000, and 26 letters, it's 26 * O(n) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, we can generate the list of indices. However, for each color, generating the list is O(n) time.\n\nBut perhaps, we can optimize this by pre-processing for each color, the list of indices. However, for the purposes of code, perhaps it's better to proceed as written.\n\nBut let's think about an example.\n\nSample input:\n\nFor example, the first sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nThe output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut let's not get into that now.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read l and r.\n\nused_left = [False]*n\n\nused_right = [False]*n\n\nans = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(pairs):\n\n        ans.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect the left_q, etc.\n\nBut wait, for the first step, we are looping through all colors in a-z. But the problem is that for each color, we are generating the left_list and right_list, which includes all the indices that are not used yet. So, for example, if a color is processed first, and some of its indices are used in the pairing, then when processing another color, the used arrays are already updated.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to the second step.\n\nThen, collect:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nleft_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair left_q and right_other.\n\nfor i in range( min(len(left_q), len(right_other)) ):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n\n    ans.append( (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect again:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nleft_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair right_q and left_other:\n\nfor i in range( min(len(right_q), len(left_other)) ):\n\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    l_idx = left_other[i]\n\n    ans.append( (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect again:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair them:\n\nfor i in range( min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) ):\n\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n\n    ans.append( (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) )\n\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nOnce all steps are done, output the length of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors, where a color can be a specific letter or a wildcard ('?').
