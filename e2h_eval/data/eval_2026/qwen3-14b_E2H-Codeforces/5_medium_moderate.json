Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. Each character in l represents a left boot's color, and each in r represents a right boot's color. The goal is to pair them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One approach is to first pair the specific colors that match exactly. Then, handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but there's also the case where a question mark can be used to pair with a specific color or another question mark. However, since we want maximum pairs, maybe we should prioritize pairing specific colors first where possible, then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think step by step.\n\nStep 1: Pair left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if there's a 'a' in l and a 'a' in r, pair them. This is straightforward. However, we need to track which boots are already paired.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this? Maybe count the frequencies of each color in l and r, and for each color, take the minimum between the counts in l and r. But that's not enough, because the positions matter. Because once you pair a particular left boot with a right boot, they can't be used again.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual pairs. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to first pair the specific colors where possible, then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors, and then pair the remaining question marks among themselves.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\n1. First, pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. For each color c (not ?), we can pair as many as possible. For example, for each c, the number of pairs is the minimum of the count of c in l and the count of c in r. However, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nBut how to track the indices? Well, perhaps for each color, we can collect the list of indices in l and r where that color occurs. Then, for each color, pair the first min(count_l, count_r) elements from both lists.\n\nBut wait, this might not be optimal. For example, if there are multiple colors that could be matched, but perhaps pairing certain ones first would allow more overall pairs. However, since the problem allows any valid maximum pairing, perhaps the order doesn't matter as long as we pair as much as possible for each color.\n\nSo, for example, for each color c (not ?), we can collect the positions of left boots with color c, and positions of right boots with color c. Then, pair them in some order, like the first available ones.\n\nOnce these pairs are made, we can mark those positions as used and not consider them again.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), we have to deal with the question marks. Now, the question marks can be paired with any remaining boots (specific or ?). But how to maximize the number here.\n\nLet me think. After handling the specific color matches, we have some left boots with ? and some right boots with ?. Also, there may be some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (because the corresponding right boots were already used up). Similarly for the right boots.\n\nSo, for the next step, we can pair the ?s with any remaining boots. But how to do that optimally.\n\nAn idea is to first pair the ? in left with the ? in right. But maybe that's not optimal. For example, suppose there are more ? in left than in right. Then, after pairing all ? in right with ? in left, the remaining ? in left can be paired with specific colors in right that are still available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to pair the ? in left with the specific colors in right that are not yet paired. Because each ? can match any color, so using them to pair with specific colors that have leftovers would be better than using them to pair with other ?s. Wait, no. Because if you have a ? in left and a ? in right, pairing them gives one pair. If instead, you pair the ? in left with a specific color in right (say, 'a'), and the ? in right with another specific color in left (say, 'a'), then maybe that gives two pairs. But if there are no specific colors left, then pairing ?s is better.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. How can we model this optimally?\n\nAnother approach: Let's separate the left and right boots into two groups:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (non-?)\n- Left boots with ? (indefinite)\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nNow, after pairing all possible specific color matches (like l's 'a' with r's 'a'), the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft: specific colors (but their corresponding right boots are already used up) and ?.\n\nRight: specific colors (but their corresponding left boots are used up) and ?.\n\nSo, for the remaining specific colors, say, left has some 'a's left, and right has no 'a's left. Those 'a's can't be paired with anything except ? in right. Similarly for the right's specific colors.\n\nSo, perhaps the next step is to pair the ?s with the remaining specific colors.\n\nFor example, for each left ? boot, try to pair it with a right boot that is specific (non-?), and hasn't been paired yet. Similarly for right ? boots with left specific boots.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nLet me think of this as a bipartite graph. But given the constraints of n up to 150000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nAfter handling the specific color matches, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: a list of left boots that are not yet paired. These can be:\n\n- Specific colors (but their matching specific color in right was already used up)\n- ?\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nNow, for the left_remaining, we can collect the counts of each specific color. For example, left_remaining_specific is a dictionary where for each color c (not ?), we have the count of left boots with color c that are not yet paired. Similarly for right_remaining_specific.\n\nThen, for each left ? boot, we can pair it with any right boot that is not yet paired. But how?\n\nPerhaps, for the left ? boots, we can pair them with the right specific boots that are not yet paired. Similarly for right ? boots with left specific boots.\n\nBut how to do this in an efficient way.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter the first phase (pairing specific colors):\n\nWe can collect all the left ? boots and right ? boots.\n\nAlso, for the left, collect the counts of specific colors that are not yet matched. Same for right.\n\nThen, for the left ? boots, we can pair them with the right specific boots that are not yet matched. For example, if there is a left ? and a right 'a' that hasn't been paired yet, then pair them. This would allow using the ? to match with the specific color.\n\nSimilarly, for the right ? boots, pair them with the left specific boots that are not yet matched.\n\nOnce this is done, the remaining ? boots (both left and right) can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. First, pair all possible specific color matches. For example, for each color c (not ?), pair left's c with right's c. For this, we can collect the indices of left and right for each color, and pair them in order.\n\n2. Then, collect the left ? boots and right ? boots.\n\n3. Now, for each left ? boot, try to pair it with a right boot that is not yet paired and has a specific color. Similarly, for each right ? boot, try to pair it with a left boot that is not yet paired and has a specific color.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor the left ? boots, we can iterate through them and try to pair with any right boot that is not yet paired and is not a ?. Similarly for the right ? boots.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available. Let's think of using two sets: available_left and available_right. However, since we need to track which boots are already used, perhaps we can have two boolean arrays (or sets) indicating whether a left or right boot is already used.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150000), using arrays is feasible.\n\nSo, here's a possible approach:\n\nInitialize two arrays, used_l and used_r, of size n, initialized to False. These track whether a left or right boot is already paired.\n\nThen, for the first phase, for each color c (not ?), collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_l[i], and same for right indices where r[j] == c and not used_r[j]. Then pair them in some way (like, for each left index, find a right index and pair them).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. For example, for each color c, we can collect the list of left indices and right indices, and pair them in order. For example, for color c, take the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect those lists. For example, during the first phase, we can create a dictionary for left and right, mapping color to list of indices.\n\nOnce we have those lists, for each color c, we can pair the left and right indices in the same order, up to the minimum count.\n\nOnce that's done, the used arrays are updated accordingly.\n\nThen, for the second phase, we need to process the ? boots. Let's collect all the left ? indices and right ? indices that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to pair them. Let's think:\n\nFor each left ? that is not used, we can try to pair it with any right boot that is not used and has a specific color. Similarly for right ?.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. For example, we can create a frequency map for the right boots that are not used and have specific colors. Then, for each left ? boot, we can pair it with any such right boot (say, the first one found). Once paired, we remove that right boot from the available pool.\n\nSimilarly for the right ? boots.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for the left ? boots, we can iterate through them and for each, check if there is any right boot (not used) that is not a ?, and pair them. Similarly for the right ? boots.\n\nBut how to track available right boots with specific colors. Let's think of using two dictionaries:\n\nright_available: a dictionary that maps color to a list of indices (right boots not used yet, with that color).\n\nSimilarly for left_available.\n\nBut during the first phase, after processing the specific color pairs, we can build these dictionaries.\n\nWait, perhaps after the first phase, we can collect all the right boots that are not used and have specific colors. Then, for each left ? boot, we can try to pair it with any of these right boots. Similarly for the right ? boots.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nHere's an idea: for the second phase, we can collect all the right boots that are not used and have specific colors (i.e., not ?) into a list. Then, for each left ? boot, we can pair it with the first available right boot in this list. Similarly, for the right ? boots, pair them with the first available left boot that is not used and has a specific color.\n\nBut how to manage this list. For example, we can have a list of available_right_specific, which is a list of indices of right boots that are not used and have a non-? color. Similarly for available_left_specific.\n\nOnce these lists are built, we can iterate through the left ? boots and for each, take the first element from available_right_specific (if any), pair them, and remove that element from the list. Similarly for the right ? boots and available_left_specific.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining available_right_specific and available_left_specific are empty, and the remaining ? boots (left and right) can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to collect the available_right_specific and available_left_specific.\n\nLet me outline the steps again.\n\nPhase 1:\n\n- For each color c (excluding ?), collect all left indices where l[i] is c and not used. Similarly for right indices.\n\n- For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each left index in left_c and right index in right_c, pair them in order. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nPhase 2:\n\n- Collect all left ? indices not used into left_q.\n\n- Collect all right ? indices not used into right_q.\n\n- Collect all right indices not used and with non-? color into available_right_specific. Similarly collect all left indices not used and with non-? color into available_left_specific.\n\nNow, for each left ? in left_q, try to pair with a right from available_right_specific. For example, take the first element from available_right_specific and pair them. Similarly for each right ? in right_q, pair with a left from available_left_specific.\n\nOnce this is done, the remaining available_right_specific and available_left_specific are empty. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired among themselves. Since each ? can pair with any other ?, the number of such pairs is the minimum of the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to collect these available_right_specific and available_left_specific.\n\nBut perhaps, after phase 1, we can loop through all the right boots and check if they are not used and their color is not ?. Similarly for left.\n\nBut for n up to 150000, this is acceptable.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to pair left_q with available_right_specific, then right_q with available_left_specific, then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, create used_l and used_r arrays of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for phase 1:\n\nWe can create for each color (excluding ?) a list of left indices and right indices.\n\nFor example, create a defaultdict(list) for left_colors and right_colors.\n\nLoop through each index i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if l[i] != '?', add i to left_colors[l[i]].\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_colors and right_colors:\n\n   the number of possible pairs is min(len(left_colors[c]), len(right_colors[c])).\n\n   for each pair in this number, pair the left and right indices.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, take the first k elements from left_colors[c], and first k elements from right_colors[c], and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Wait, but during phase 1, the left_colors and right_colors are built before any pairing. So, for example, for color c, the left_colors[c] contains all left indices with color c. But during phase 1, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut in this approach, the left_colors and right_colors would have all indices for each color, and then for each color, we pair the first min(len(left), len(right)) pairs.\n\nBut how to do that. For example:\n\nfor c in all colors (excluding ?):\n\n   left_list = left_colors[c]\n\n   right_list = right_colors[c]\n\n   cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(cnt):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n       pair them (add to the answer list)\n\n       mark used_l[left_idx] = True\n\n       mark used_r[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this is not correct. Because, for example, if a color c has multiple left and right indices, but some of them may have already been used in previous pairings. Wait, no. Because during phase 1, we are building left_colors and right_colors as all the indices for each color. Then, for each color, we pair them. However, once we pair them, we mark them as used, so they are not considered again in other color pairings.\n\nWait, but this approach would process all colors, and for each color, pair their left and right indices. However, the problem is that if a left index is in multiple colors? No, because each left index is in exactly one color (either ? or a specific color). So, for example, if a left index is 'a', it's only in left_colors['a'].\n\nSo, this approach would work. For example, for each color c (excluding ?), we pair the left and right indices of that color. Once paired, they are marked as used, and not processed again.\n\nBut this approach may not be optimal. For example, imagine a scenario where pairing a left 'a' with a right 'a' would leave a left 'b' and a right 'b' unpaired. But if we had paired the left 'a' with a right 'b' (but that's not allowed unless they are ?), but in this case, the first approach would pair the 'a's and 'b's. But in reality, the first approach is correct, since the 'a's and 'b's are compatible only if they are same. So, the initial approach is correct.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, we proceed to phase 2.\n\nNow, collect left_q (all left indices where l[i] is ? and not used_l[i]).\n\nSimilarly, collect right_q (all right indices where r[i] is ? and not used_r[i]).\n\nThen, collect available_right_specific: all right indices not used, and r[i] is not ?.\n\navailable_left_specific: all left indices not used, and l[i] is not ?.\n\nNow, for each left_q index, we can try to pair with any available_right_specific. For example, take the first element from available_right_specific and pair them. Similarly for right_q with available_left_specific.\n\nBut how to collect available_right_specific and available_left_specific. For example:\n\navailable_right_specific = [j for j in range(n) if not used_r[j] and r[j] != '?']\n\navailable_left_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not used_l[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can process them.\n\nNow, for each left in left_q:\n\n   if available_right_specific is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from available_right_specific, pair them.\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in right_q:\n\n   if available_left_specific is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from available_left_specific, pair them.\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired among themselves. The number of pairs here is the minimum of len(left_q_remaining) and len(right_q_remaining). For example, take the first min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q after the above steps.\n\nBut perhaps, during the pairing of left_q with available_right_specific, we can process the left_q in order, and for each, pair with the first available in available_right_specific. Similarly for the right_q with available_left_specific.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think of code steps.\n\nOnce available_right_specific and available_left_specific are generated, we can:\n\nFor the left_q list:\n\n   for i in left_q:\n\n       if available_right_specific is not empty:\n\n           take the first element from available_right_specific, say j.\n\n           add (i+1, j+1) to the answer (since indices are 1-based)\n\n           mark used_l[i] = True\n\n           mark used_r[j] = True\n\n           remove j from available_right_specific.\n\nSimilarly for the right_q:\n\n   for j in right_q:\n\n       if available_left_specific is not empty:\n\n           take the first element from available_left_specific, say i.\n\n           add (i+1, j+1) to the answer.\n\n           mark used_l[i] = True\n\n           mark used_r[j] = True\n\n           remove i from available_left_specific.\n\nBut how to manage the available_right_specific and available_left_specific lists. Since popping from the front of a list is O(n), which would be expensive for large n. So, perhaps, using a deque for these lists.\n\nYes. So, for available_right_specific, we can create a deque. Then, for each left_q element, we check if the deque is not empty, and popleft().\n\nSame for available_left_specific.\n\nOnce that is done, we have some remaining left_q and right_q elements. Now, the remaining left_q and right_q are all ? and not used. We can pair them as follows: take the first min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) pairs, pairing left_q_remaining[i] with right_q_remaining[i].\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q. Wait, during the processing of the left_q and right_q, we may have already paired some of them. So, after that processing, the remaining left_q and right_q are those that were not paired with available_right_specific or available_left_specific. So, for example, after the left_q processing, some of the left_q elements are already paired (with available_right_specific), others are not. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut how to track which ones are still available. Alternatively, after processing the left_q and right_q, the available_right_specific and available_left_specific are empty. So, the remaining left_q and right_q are the ones that couldn't be paired with specific colors. So, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, for example, collect the remaining left_q (those that are not used) and the remaining right_q (those not used). Then, pair the first min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect them. Well, after processing the left_q and right_q as above, the remaining left_q can be collected by checking which ones are not used. But perhaps, during the processing, we can track which left_q elements are already paired.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial collection of left_q and right_q, we can have lists that are processed. For example:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_l[i]]\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_r[j]]\n\nThen, during processing, for each element in left_q, we try to pair with available_right_specific. So, after that, the left_q elements that were not paired are those that couldn't find a right_specific. Similarly for the right_q elements.\n\nBut how to track which ones are paired. Well, during the processing, when we pair a left_q element, we mark it as used. So, after that, we can collect the remaining left_q elements as those that are not used. But since the left_q list was built before processing, perhaps during the processing, we can track which elements are still available.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to collect the remaining left_q and right_q after processing.\n\nBut how? Let me think of code steps.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, collect:\n\nleft_q = list of indices where l[i] is ? and not used_l[i].\n\nright_q = list of indices where r[i] is ? and not used_r[i].\n\navailable_right_specific = deque of indices where r[j] is not ? and not used_r[j].\n\navailable_left_specific = deque of indices where l[i] is not ? and not used_l[i].\n\nThen:\n\nfor i in left_q:\n\n   if available_right_specific:\n\n       j = available_right_specific.popleft()\n\n       add pair (i+1, j+1)\n\n       mark used_l[i] = True\n\n       mark used_r[j] = True\n\nfor j in right_q:\n\n   if available_left_specific:\n\n       i = available_left_specific.popleft()\n\n       add pair (i+1, j+1)\n\n       mark used_l[i] = True\n\n       mark used_r[j] = True\n\nNow, the remaining left_q and right_q elements are those that couldn't be paired with available_right_specific or available_left_specific. So, they are all ? and not used. Now, collect the remaining left and right ? indices.\n\nBut how? Well, after the above steps, we can collect the remaining left_q and right_q as follows:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_l[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [j for j in right_q if not used_r[j]]\n\nBut since during the processing of left_q and right_q, we have marked the used_l and used_r, this would give us the remaining.\n\nBut perhaps, during the processing, the left_q and right_q lists are modified. However, in the code above, the left_q and right_q are processed in order, and during the processing, the used flags are set. So, the remaining_left_q can be obtained by iterating through the left_q list and checking if used_l[i] is True or not. But that would take O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, after processing, collect the remaining_left_q as those indices in left_q that are not used. But for large n, this is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, the number of pairs is min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)). So, for each pair in 0 to k-1, pair remaining_left_q[i] with remaining_right_q[i].\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nOnce that is done, all the pairs are accounted for.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut considering that for n up to 150000, the code needs to be O(n) time.\n\nNow, for the data structures:\n\n- For phase 1, we can collect left_colors and right_colors as defaultdict(list), then for each color, pair the first min(len(left), len(right)) pairs.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_l and used_r as lists of False.\n\nProcess phase 1:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_colors[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_colors[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color in left_colors and right_colors:\n\nWait, but for colors present in left_colors and right_colors, we need to process them. However, for each color, we need to check if it exists in both.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in left_colors, we check if it exists in right_colors.\n\nBut that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can iterate through all possible colors (from 'a' to 'z') and process them. But that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each color in left_colors:\n\n   if the color is present in right_colors:\n\n       process the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in left_colors and right_colors, process the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in left_colors, we can check if it's also in right_colors, and then process the pairs.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfor c in left_colors:\n\n    if c in right_colors:\n\n        left_list = left_colors[c]\n\n        right_list = right_colors[c]\n\n        cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(cnt):\n\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n            used_l[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_r[right_idx] = True\n\n            add to the answer list (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\nBut wait, this would process each color once. However, this approach would miss the case where a color is in right_colors but not in left_colors. But since the code is for phase 1, which is pairing specific colors, it's okay. For example, if a color c is in right_colors but not in left_colors, there are no left boots with that color to pair, so nothing to do.\n\nBut this approach would process each color once, and pair the left and right indices for that color.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because, for example, the code would process color 'a' once, but what if there are multiple colors?\n\nWait, no. The code loops through all colors in left_colors. For each of those colors, if the color exists in right_colors, then process them. However, this would miss colors that exist in right_colors but not in left_colors. But for those, there are no left boots with that color, so nothing to pair.\n\nBut the code is correct for phase 1.\n\nBut this approach may not pair all possible specific color pairs. For example, suppose a color 'a' exists in both left and right, but the code processes it once, and pairs all possible. That's correct.\n\nBut the code as written would process each color in left_colors once, which is correct.\n\nBut what about colors that are present in both left_colors and right_colors but are processed multiple times? No, because the loop is over the keys of left_colors.\n\nBut in this approach, for each color c in left_colors, we pair with the right_colors[c]. However, this way, for example, if a color 'a' is in both left and right, but after processing, there are left 'a's and right 'a's left, but they are not processed again. But that's not possible, because the code for phase 1 is supposed to pair all possible specific color matches. So, the code as written would process each color once, and pair as many as possible.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because, for example, suppose there are multiple colors. For example, color 'a' is in left_colors and right_colors, but after processing, there are some left 'a's and right 'a's left. However, the code would not process them again. But that's not possible, because the code is processing all left_colors once, and for each color, it pairs the left and right indices. So, for example, if the left_colors has 'a' and the right_colors has 'a', then during the loop, the code pairs the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. The remaining left and right indices for 'a' would not be processed again, because they are not in left_colors anymore. Wait, no. Because the left_colors is built before phase 1 processing, and the left_colors[c] contains all the left indices with color c. So, even if some of them are used during phase 1, the code uses the entire list. For example, if left_colors[c] has 5 elements, and right_colors[c] has 3, then during phase 1, the code pairs the first 3 elements of left_colors[c] with the first 3 elements of right_colors[c]. The remaining 2 elements in left_colors[c] are not used, but they are still in the list. However, during phase 1, the code does not process them again. So, this is incorrect. Because, for example, if there are other colors that are not processed yet, but perhaps the left and right indices for 'a' could be paired again. But that's not possible, because the code is designed to pair all possible specific color matches in phase 1.\n\nWait, no. The code for phase 1 is supposed to pair all possible specific color matches. But the way the code is written now, for each color in left_colors, we pair as many as possible between left and right. However, the code would miss cases where a color is present in both left_colors and right_colors, but the code is not processed. For example, if the code loops through left_colors, which is built before phase 1, and for each color in left_colors, process it once. However, suppose a color 'a' is in both left_colors and right_colors, but the code processes it once. But what if there are more left and right indices for 'a' that could be paired?\n\nWait, no. Because during phase 1, for each color in left_colors, we pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. So, for example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, then during phase 1, the code pairs 3 of the left 'a's with the right 'a's. The remaining 2 left 'a's will not be processed again, because the code is not reprocessing the same color again. However, the code is correct in that phase 1 is meant to pair all possible specific color matches. Because the code pairs all possible for each color once.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the code should process all colors in both left and right, not just those in left_colors. For example, if there are colors in right_colors that are not in left_colors, but that's not a problem. However, for colors that are in both left and right, the code is processing them once. So, the code is correct.\n\nBut then, the code as written would pair all possible specific color matches. Because for each color, it pairs as many as possible. So, the code is correct for phase 1.\n\nSo, the code for phase 1 is okay.\n\nNow, the next steps are phase 2.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, collect the left_q and right_q lists.\n\nThen, collect available_right_specific and available_left_specific.\n\nBut how to collect them. For available_right_specific:\n\navailable_right_specific = deque()\n\nfor j in range(n):\n\n    if not used_r[j] and r[j] != '?':\n\n        available_right_specific.append(j)\n\nSimilarly for available_left_specific.\n\nOnce that is done, process the left_q and right_q as discussed.\n\nBut how to collect left_q and right_q. For example:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_l[i]]\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_r[j]]\n\nThen, process each left_q index:\n\nfor i in left_q:\n\n    if available_right_specific:\n\n        j = available_right_specific.popleft()\n\n        add pair (i+1, j+1)\n\n        mark used_l[i] = True\n\n        mark used_r[j] = True\n\nSimilarly for right_q:\n\nfor j in right_q:\n\n    if available_left_specific:\n\n        i = available_left_specific.popleft()\n\n        add pair (i+1, j+1)\n\n        mark used_l[i] = True\n\n        mark used_r[j] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_l[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [j for j in right_q if not used_r[j]]\n\nThen, pair the first min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nBut in code, after processing the left_q and right_q, the used_l and used_r are marked. So, for the remaining_left_q, it's those indices in left_q which are not used.\n\nBut in code, after the processing of left_q, some of the left_q elements may have been marked as used. So, the remaining_left_q can be collected by checking which elements in left_q are not used.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, creating a new list for remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q may be O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that is done, the pairs between remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q can be added.\n\nNow, the code should collect all possible pairs.\n\nBut what about the order in which the pairs are added. For example, in phase 1, the pairs are added in the order of the colors. Then, phase 2 adds pairs in the order of left_q and right_q processing. However, the problem allows any valid pairing as long as it's maximum.\n\nNow, the code needs to collect all the pairs and output them.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n5\n\n7 8\n\n4 9\n\n2 2\n\n9 10\n\n3 1\n\nBut I'm not going to check that now. Let's proceed to code.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Time complexity. For n=150000, the code should run in O(n) time.\n\n- Handling the data structures correctly.\n\nBut for the phase 1, the code loops through all the colors in left_colors and for each, processes the pairs. The total number of pairs processed in phase 1 is O(n), since each left and right index is processed once.\n\nPhase 2 steps are O(n) as well.\n\nSo, the code should be efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_l and used_r as [False] * n.\n\nCollect left_colors and right_colors as defaultdict(list).\n\nThen, for each color in left_colors, process as per phase 1.\n\nThen, collect left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, collect available_right_specific and available_left_specific as deques.\n\nProcess left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, collect remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q, and pair them.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the phase 1 processing, the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    used_l = [False]*n\n\n    used_r = [False]*n\n\n    # Phase 1: pair specific colors\n\n    left_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\n    right_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if l[i] != '?':\n\n            left_colors[l[i]].append(i)\n\n    for",
