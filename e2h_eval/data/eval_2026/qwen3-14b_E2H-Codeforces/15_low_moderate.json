They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can win a tournament based on the given string s that dictates the rules for each phase. \n\nSo, the tournament has 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the rule is determined by s[i-1] (assuming 0-based index). For example, if s is \"101\" and n=3, then phase 1 (first phase) uses s[0] which is '1' meaning higher skill wins. Phase 2 uses s[1] which is '0', so lower skill wins. Phase 3 uses s[2] which is '1' again.\n\nThe goal is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as champion.\n\nFirst, I need to model how the tournament proceeds. Let's think recursively. For each round, the teams are paired, and based on the rule for that phase, the winner is determined. The key is that the permutation p is arbitrary except that it must satisfy the tournament results.\n\nBut since p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n, each team has a unique skill level. The question is, for a given x, can we arrange the initial bracket such that x wins through all the rounds according to the rules in each phase.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string s determines the rules for each phase. So during phase i (the i-th phase, which is the one that happens when there are 2^{n - i + 1} teams?), the rule is either higher or lower skill wins. So for each phase, when matches are played, the outcome depends on the rule for that phase.\n\nBut how do we model the possible winners? Because the structure of the tournament depends on the initial arrangement of the teams. However, the problem allows us to choose any permutation p, so we need to find x such that there exists some arrangement of the teams where x can win through all the phases according to the rules.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we need to determine whether it's possible to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all the rounds given the rules in each phase.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the tournament structure. The tournament is a binary tree. Each round halves the number of teams. For example, for n=3, there are 8 teams. The first round has 4 matches, then 2, then 1.\n\nEach team's path to the final requires winning in each phase. For each phase, the rule determines whether the team needs to have higher or lower skill than its opponent in that round.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents a team might face in each round?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal possible skill levels that x must have in order to win each round, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each round, depending on the rule (higher or lower), the team must be able to beat their opponents. Since the permutation is arbitrary, the arrangement can be chosen such that in each round, the team x faces opponents that allow it to win according to the rules.\n\nBut how to model the constraints on x's skill level?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. Let's say that in the first phase (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. In this phase, each match is between two adjacent teams. The winner proceeds to the next phase. Then, in phase 2, the rule is s[1], etc.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. Let's think about the possible range of x's skill level that would allow it to pass each round.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. For example, in the first round, the team x must be in a group of 2 teams. Depending on the rule, x must be the higher or lower of the two. Then, in the next round, it's grouped with another group's winner, and again the rule applies.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps we can model for each round the constraints on x's skill relative to the other teams in the bracket.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the permutation defines the initial bracket. So, for x to be the winner, we need to arrange the initial bracket so that in each round, when x plays, it can win according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible opponents in each round?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team x must have a certain relationship with the other teams in the bracket. For example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), then x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a tournament based on the given rules for each phase. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams, and the winner of each match proceeds to the next phase. The rules for each phase dictate whether the team with higher or lower skill level wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament has $2^n$ teams, and each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The string `s` dictates the rule for each phase (higher or lower skill level wins).\n2. **Recursive Constraints**: For each team with skill level `x` to win the tournament, it must be able to win all rounds according to the rules. This involves determining the minimum and maximum possible values of `x` that can satisfy the constraints of each phase.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the valid range of skill levels that `x` must fall into. If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), `x` must be in the upper half of the current range. If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), `x` must be in the lower half of the current range.\n4. **Iterative Range Adjustment**: Starting from the full range of possible skill levels (1 to $2^n$), adjust the range iteratively for each phase based on the rule specified in `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # Higher skill wins in this phase: x must be in the upper half of the current range\n            # So the new range is [mid + 1, high]\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            # Lower skill wins in this phase: x must be in the lower half of the current range\n            # So the new range is [low, mid]\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            high = mid\n\n    result = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` which dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament.\n2. **Initial Range**: Start with the full range of possible skill levels from 1 to $2^n$.\n3. **Adjusting Range Based on Rules**: For each phase, adjust the range based on the rule (higher or lower skill wins). If the rule is '1', the valid range for the winning team shifts to the upper half of the current range. If the rule is '0', the valid range shifts to the lower half.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all phases, the valid range of skill levels that can win the tournament is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible skill levels using a binary search-like method, adjusting the range iteratively based on the rules provided, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n` up to 18.",
