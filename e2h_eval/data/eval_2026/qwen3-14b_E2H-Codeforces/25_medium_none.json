При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has a positive length but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where one message completely covers the other) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just appending without overlapping isn't considered an error.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists a string s such that t is formed by overlapping two copies of s. If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, the key is to find a possible s such that when two copies of s are merged with some overlap, we get t. Let's think about the conditions for that.\n\nLet me denote the length of s as len_s. Then, the length of t should be equal to 2 * len_s - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k must be between 1 and len_s-1 (because the overlap must be positive and less than len_s), then:\n\nlen(t) = 2 * len_s - k → rearranged, len_s = (len(t) + k)/2. But since k can vary, perhaps we can approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, for a given possible s, the merged string would be s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping. For example, if s is \"abc\", and the overlap is 1 character, then the merged string would be \"abca\" (assuming the last character of the first s is 'a' and the first character of the second s is 'a').\n\nWait, but how do I check if t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s?\n\nLet me think: for a candidate s, the merged string would be s + s with some overlapping. So, the merged string t must be equal to s[0...len_s -k -1] + s[k ... len_s -1] + s[k ... len_s -1]? Wait, no. Wait, when you overlap two copies of s by k characters, the merged string would be of length len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, if the first s ends with some substring of length k, and the second s starts with the same substring. Then, overlapping them would result in the first s's prefix (without the overlapping part) plus the second s's suffix (without the overlapping part). Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose s is \"abcd\", and the overlapping is 2 characters. So the first s ends with \"cd\", and the second s starts with \"cd\". Then, overlapping them would produce \"abcd\" + \"d\" (since the second s starts with \"cd\", but the first s's \"cd\" overlaps with the second's \"cd\", so the merged string would be \"abcd\" + \"d\" (the second s's part after the overlapping part). Wait, no. Let me take an example. The first s is \"abcd\", the second is \"abcd\". Overlapping by 2 characters: the first s's last two characters (cd) overlap with the second's first two (cd). So the merged string would be abcd + (the rest of the second s after the overlapping part). The second s's part after the overlapping is 'd'? No, the overlapping is two characters, so the second s contributes len(s) - k characters. So the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters + s's entire string? No, wait. The merged string would be s's first (len_s -k) characters + the entire second s. But since the first s's last k characters are the same as the second s's first k characters, the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters + s's (k ...) ?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think that the merged string is the first s, but with the last k characters overlapped with the second s's first k. So the total length is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k.\n\nSo the merged string would be s[0... len_s -k -1] + s[k ... len_s -1] + s[k ... len_s -1]? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of the actual concatenation. Let me imagine that the first s is written, and then the second s starts at position (len_s -k) of the merged string. So, the merged string is s + s, but with the first s's last k characters overlapping with the second s's first k characters. Therefore, the merged string is s[0 : len_s -k] + s[k : ] + s[k : ]? No, because the second s is added after overlapping. Wait, the first s is written normally, then the second s starts after overlapping. So the merged string would be the first s's part before the overlapping (s[0 ... len_s -k -1]) plus the overlapping part (s[len_s -k ... ]) plus the non-overlapping part of the second s (s[k ... ]). Wait, but the overlapping part is the same in both. So the merged string is s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s[len_s -k ... ] + s[k ... ]? No, that would be s's first part (length len_s -k) plus s's overlapping part (length k) plus s's non-overlapping part (length len_s -k). But that would be len_s -k + k + len_s -k = 2*len_s -k. Which is correct. But the overlapping part is the same in both, so the merged string is s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s[k ... ] (since the overlapping part is s[len_s -k ... len_s -1] which is same as s[0 ... k-1] of the second s). So the merged string is s[0 ... len_s -k -1] + s[k ... len_s -1] + s[k ... len_s -1]? No, that seems wrong. Let me take an example. Suppose s is 'abcd', and k is 2. Then the overlapping part is the last two characters of the first s (cd) and the first two of the second s (ab? No, no. Wait, the overlapping is that the end of the first s and the start of the second s must match. So for example, if the first s ends with 'cd' and the second s starts with 'cd', then overlapping by two characters. So the merged string would be the first s's first len_s -k characters (which is 4-2=2 characters, 'ab') followed by the rest of the second s. Wait, the second s is 'abcd', but since the first two characters of the second s are 'ab', which are overlapping with the last two of the first s. Wait, no. If the first s ends with 'cd', and the second s starts with 'cd', then the overlapping would be that the first s's last two (cd) and the second's first two (cd). So the merged string would be the first s's first len_s -k = 2 characters (ab) followed by the second s's entire length (4) minus k (2) characters, which is 2 characters. So the merged string would be ab + cd (from the second s's part after overlapping?), but that's not right. Wait, perhaps the merged string is s's first part (before the overlapping) plus the second s's part after the overlapping. So the total is (len_s -k) + (len_s -k) = 2(len_s -k). But that would be 2*(len_s -k) = len(t). So len(t) = 2(len_s -k) ?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought len(t) = 2*len_s -k. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me take the example given in the problem statement. For example, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. The original s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The merged string is 2*11 -1 = 21. Let me check: the original input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So len(t) = 21, len_s is 11. So 2*11 -1 = 21. So in this case, len(t) = 2*len_s -k, where k is 1.\n\nAnother example from the problem: the second sample input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). The output is 'acaca' (length 5). Let's see: len_s is 5, k is 3. Because 2*5 -3 =7, which is not 9. Hmm, maybe my previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's check the second example. The input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). The output is 'acaca' (length 5). Let's see: two copies of s (each 5) would be merged with some overlap. So the merged string would be 5 + 5 -k = 10 -k. But the input is 9, so 10 -k =9 → k=1. So the overlap is 1. So the merged string is s's first 5-1=4 characters (acac) plus the second s's part after overlapping. The second s's part after overlapping is 5-1=4 characters? Or wait, the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters (4) plus s's entire length (5) minus the overlapping part (k=1) ? No, perhaps the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters plus the second s's (len_s -k) characters? That would give 2*(len_s -k) = 2*(5-1) = 8, which is not 9. So something is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the merged string is len_s + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k. For the second example, len_s is 5, and len(t) is 9. So 2*5 -k =9 →k=1. Which is valid. So the merged string is 5 + (5-1) = 9. So the merged string is the first s (length 5) plus the second s's part after the first k characters (so 5-1=4 characters). But how does that work?\n\nSo, the first s is 'acaca', and the second s is also 'acaca'. Overlapping by 1 character. So the first s's last 1 character is 'a', and the second s's first 1 character is 'a'. So overlapping them would give the first s's first 4 characters (acac) plus the second s's remaining 4 characters (caca)? Wait, no. The first s is 'acaca', and the second is 'acaca'. The overlapping is 1 character. So the merged string would be the first s (acaca) with the second s starting after overlapping. So the merged string would be 'acaca' + 'caca'? No, that's 5 +4=9 characters. But that would be 'acacacaca', which is indeed the input. So the merged string is the first s (acaca) and then the second s's part after the first 1 character. So the second s is 'acaca' → after the first 1 character (a), the rest is 'caca'. So the merged string is 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is the input. So that works.\n\nSo the way to check if t can be formed by two s's with overlapping k is:\n\nt must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], but with the overlapping part being the same. So, the first s's last k characters must be equal to the second s's first k characters. But since the second s is the same as the first, that means that the last k characters of s must be equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nTherefore, for a candidate s, the condition is that the first k characters of s are equal to the last k characters of s, and that the merged string t equals s + s[k:].\n\nBut how do I find s and k?\n\nLet me think about the possible lengths of s. Let len_t be the length of t. Since t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap of k, then len_t = 2*len_s -k. Also, since k is between 1 and len_s -1, substituting len_s gives:\n\nlen_t = 2*len_s -k → k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and len_s -1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n2*len_s - len_t ≥ 1 → 2*len_s ≥ len_t + 1 → len_s ≥ (len_t + 1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → 2*len_s - len_t ≤ len_s -1 → len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nSo combining:\n\n(len_t +1)/2 ≤ len_s ≤ len_t -1.\n\nBut len_s must be an integer. So for each possible len_s in this range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2*len_s - len_t) that satisfies 1 ≤k ≤ len_s -1.\n\nWait, but len_s is the length of s. So for each possible len_s in the range [(len_t +1)/2 , len_t -1], we can compute k = 2*len_s - len_t, and check if 1 ≤k ≤ len_s -1. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the second sample input, len_t is 9.\n\nPossible len_s ranges from (9+1)/2 =5 to 9-1=8. So len_s can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each len_s, compute k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nFor len_s=5: k = 10-9=1. Which is between 1 and 4 (since len_s-1=4). Valid.\n\nFor len_s=6: k=12-9=3. len_s-1=5. 3 is between 1 and 5. Valid.\n\nFor len_s=7: k=14-9=5. len_s-1=6. 5 is valid.\n\nFor len_s=8: k=16-9=7. len_s-1=7. So 7 is valid.\n\nSo for each of these len_s values, we can check if the first k characters of s (which is t's first len_s characters) equals the last k characters of s. And then check if the merged string is equal to t.\n\nWait, but how do I get s? Well, if the merged string is formed by overlapping two copies of s, then the first len_s characters of t is s, except that the overlapping part may be part of it. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose that the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the first part of the merged string is s. But the entire merged string is t. So the first len_s characters of t is s. Because the first s is fully present in t. Wait, no. Because when you have overlapping, the first s is s, and then the second s starts after overlapping. But the merged string is s's first (len_s -k) characters plus the second s's entire length. Wait, no. Let me take the example where len_s is 5 and k=1. The merged string is s (5 characters) plus s[1:] (4 characters), which is 5+4=9. So the first 5 characters of the merged string is s. So the first len_s characters of t is s. Thus, for any possible len_s, the first len_s characters of t is the candidate s. Then, we can check whether the last k characters of s (which is the first len_s characters of t) equals the first k characters of s. Also, the merged string (s + s[k:]) should be equal to t.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each possible len_s in the range [(len_t +1)/2 , len_t -1], check if:\n\n1. k = 2*len_s - len_t is between 1 and len_s -1.\n\n   (Which is already ensured by the len_s selection.)\n\n2. The first len_s characters of t is s_candidate.\n\n3. Check that the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n4. Check that s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] equals t.\n\nIf any of these len_s values satisfy these conditions, then output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nBut also, we need to make sure that the case where the two s's are completely overlapping (i.e., k = len_s) is not considered. But according to the problem statement, that's not considered an error. However, our calculation of len_s is such that k = 2*len_s - len_t. For example, if the merged string was formed by completely overlapping (k = len_s), then len_t = 2*len_s - len_s = len_s. Which implies that len_t = len_s. But according to the problem, this case is not considered an error. So in our code, we need to avoid considering cases where k = len_s. However, in our len_s selection, since k is 2*len_s - len_t, and len_t = len_s, then k = 2*len_s - len_s = len_s. But in our len_s selection, the upper bound is len_t -1. For len_t = len_s, len_t -1 is len_s -1. So for len_s = len_t, which would be possible only if len_t = len_s. But the upper bound is len_t -1, which is len_s-1. So len_s can't be len_t. Hence, the case where k = len_s is not considered here.\n\nAnother thing to check: the problem says that the case where the two messages are simply appended (no overlapping) is not considered an error. For example, if t is s + s, then it's not considered an error. So in this case, len_t is 2*len_s. Which would imply that k = 2*len_s - len_t = 2*len_s - 2*len_s = 0. But since k must be at least 1, this case is not considered. Therefore, our code will not consider this case, which is correct.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible len_s values in the range from ceil(len_t / 2) to len_t -1. Because (len_t +1)/2 is the lower bound. For example, if len_t is even, say 6, then (6+1)/2 is 3.5, so len_s starts at 4? Wait, no. Let me re-express the lower bound:\n\nThe lower bound is (len_t +1)/2. Since len_s must be an integer, len_s must be at least ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ). Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if len_t is 9, then (9+1)/2 =5. So len_s starts at 5. If len_t is 8, then (8+1)/2=4.5 → len_s must be ≥5? Or is it possible that len_s can be 4.5? No, len_s must be integer. So the lower bound is the ceiling of (len_t +1)/2 ?\n\nWait, the original inequality is len_s ≥ (len_t +1)/2. So for len_t even:\n\nlen_t = 6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → len_s must be ≥ 3.5 → since len_s is integer, len_s starts at 4.\n\nFor len_t = 5 → (5+1)/2 =3 → len_s starts at 3.\n\nSo the lower bound is ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, (len_t +1)/2 can be fractional. So len_s must be ≥ that value. So for integer len_s, the minimal len_s is floor( (len_t +1)/2 ) if (len_t +1) is even, else ceil(...). Wait, perhaps better to compute len_s_min as (len_t +1 +1)//2 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible len_s in the range from (len_t +1) // 2 to len_t -1, inclusive.\n\nBecause for example, when len_t is 9, (9 +1)/2 =5 → len_s starts at 5. When len_t is 8, (8+1)/2 is 4.5 → len_s starts at 5 (since 4.5 rounded up is 5).\n\nBut (len_t +1) // 2 in Python is integer division. Let's see:\n\nFor len_t =9: (9+1)//2 = 5 → correct.\n\nFor len_t =8: (8+1)//2 = 4.5 → no, wait in Python, 9//2 is 4. So (8+1)//2 is 9//2=4. Which is 4.5 floored to 4. But the lower bound is 4.5. So len_s must be ≥4.5 → len_s starts at 5.\n\nThus, the correct lower bound for len_s is (len_t +1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute len_s_min as math.ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ). But in Python, how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for len_s in the range from (len_t +1) // 2 to len_t -1, inclusive. Wait, but for len_t even, like 8:\n\n(len_t +1) // 2 = (8+1)//2 = 9//2 =4. So len_s starts at 4. But 4 is less than 4.5. So that would include len_s=4, which would give k = 2*4 -8 = 0. Which is invalid. So that's a problem.\n\nSo the initial approach of checking len_s in [ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ), len_t -1 ] is needed.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, (len_t +1)/2 can be written as (len_t +1) divided by 2. To compute the ceiling of that, we can use (len_t +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nLet me think:\n\nceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo here, a is len_t +1, and b is 2. So ceil( (len_t +1)/2 ) = (len_t +1 + 2 -1) // 2 = (len_t +2) // 2.\n\nYes. So len_s_min = (len_t + 2) // 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nlen_t =9 → (9+2)/2= 11/2=5.5 → integer division is 5. Which is correct.\n\nlen_t =8 → (8+2)/2= 10/2=5 → len_s_min is 5. Which is correct.\n\nlen_t=5 → (5+2)/2=3.5 → integer division is 3. Which is correct since (5+1)/2 is 3.\n\nSo len_s_min is (len_t +2) // 2.\n\nSo the possible len_s values are from len_s_min to len_t -1, inclusive.\n\nOnce we have that, for each len_s in that range, compute k = 2*len_s - len_t.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and len_s -1. Well, since len_s is chosen such that len_s_min is (len_t +2)//2, then for len_s in that range, k would be:\n\nFor len_s_min:\n\nk = 2*len_s_min - len_t.\n\nLet me take len_t=9, len_s_min=5 → k=10-9=1 → which is between 1 and 4 (len_s-1=4).\n\nFor len_t=8, len_s_min=5 → k=2*5-8=2 → len_s-1=4 → 2 is between 1 and 4.\n\nSo for all len_s in the range [len_s_min, len_t-1], k is between 1 and len_s-1.\n\nThus, for each len_s in that range, compute k, then check:\n\ns_candidate = t[0 : len_s]\n\nCheck if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Also, check if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] equals t.\n\nIf any of these checks pass, then output YES and s_candidate.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all possible len_s, output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: Input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (len 21). Let's compute len_s_min = (21 +2)/2 = 23//2=11. So len_s ranges from 11 to 20.\n\nFor len_s=11, k=2*11-21=22-21=1. Check if the last 1 character of s_candidate (t[0:11] is 'abrakadabra') is equal to the first 1 character. The last character is 'a', the first is 'a' → yes. Then check if s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] equals t. s_candidate is 'abrakadabra', s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'. So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the input. So this is correct. Hence output YES and s_candidate.\n\nSample 2: input is 'acacacaca' (len 9). len_s_min is (9+2)/2 = 5.5 → 5.5 floored? Wait, in Python (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So len_s ranges from 5 to 8.\n\nFor len_s=5: k=2*5-9=1. s_candidate is 'acaca'. Check last 1 character (a) equals first 1 (a). Yes. Then check s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is correct. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSample 3: 'abcabc' (len 6). len_s_min is (6+2)//2=4. So len_s ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor len_s=4: k=2*4-6=2. s_candidate is 'abca'. Check if last 2 chars 'ca' equals first 2 chars 'ab'? No. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=5: k=2*5-6=4. Check if len_s-1=4, so k=4 is allowed. s_candidate is 'abcab'. Check last 4 chars 'bcab' vs first 4 chars 'abca' → no. So invalid. Hence output NO.\n\nSample 4: input 'abababab' (len 8). len_s_min is (8+2)//2=5. len_s ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nFor len_s=5: k=2*5 -8=2. s_candidate is 'ababa'. Check last 2 chars 'ba' vs first 2 'ab' → no.\n\nlen_s=6: k=2*6 -8=4. Check if len_s-1=5 >=4. Yes. s_candidate is 'ababab' (first 6 chars). Check last 4 chars of s_candidate: 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (len 6). last 4 chars are positions 2 to 5 (indices 2,3,4,5?), assuming 0-based. Let's see:\n\ns_candidate[0:6] is 'ababab'.\n\nlast 4 characters: 'abab' → wait no. Let me think. The last k=4 characters are s_candidate[-4:] → 'abab'? Let me see:\n\ns_candidate is 'a b a b a b' (indices 0-5). The last 4 characters are indices 2,3,4,5 → 'a b a b'? Wait, index 2 is 'a', index 3 is 'b', index 4 is 'a', index 5 is 'b' → 'abab'. The first 4 characters are 'abab' (indices 0-3). So yes, they are equal. Then check if s_candidate + s_candidate[4:] equals t.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab', s_candidate[4:] is 'ab'. So merged string is 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab' which is the input. So this is valid. Hence output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWait but the sample output for the fourth input is 'ababab' (the output is 'YES\\nababab').\n\nYes, which matches.\n\nAnother sample input is 'tatbt' → output is NO.\n\nLet me think about that. len_t is 5. len_s_min is (5+2)//2=3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait, in Python (5+2)//2 is 3 (since 7//2=3). So len_s ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor len_s=3: k=2*3-5=1. Check if last 1 character of s_candidate (t[0:3] is 'tat') is 't' and first 1 is 't' → yes. Then check if s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] equals t. s_candidate is 'tat', s_candidate[1:] is 'at'. So merged string is 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' which is not equal to 'tatbt'. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=4: k=2*4-5=3. Check if len_s-1=3 ≥3 → yes. s_candidate is 'tatb'. Check if last 3 characters (positions 1-3: 'atb') equals first 3 characters (positions 0-2: 'tat') → no. So invalid. Hence output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nNow, steps for code:\n\nRead input string t.\n\nCompute len_t = len(t).\n\nIf len_t is 1, then it's impossible (since two messages would have to be merged, but len(t) = 2*len_s -k. For len_t=1, len_s must be >= (1+1)/2=1. So len_s can be 1. Then k=2*1 -1=1. But len_s-1=0. So k=1 is larger than len_s-1=0. So no possible len_s. Hence output NO.\n\nBut for general code:\n\nLoop len_s from len_s_min to len_t-1, inclusive.\n\nlen_s_min = (len_t + 2) // 2.\n\nFor each len_s in that range:\n\n   k = 2*len_s - len_t\n\n   if k <1 or k >= len_s: continue (but according to our previous analysis, this shouldn't happen)\n\n   s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n       if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n           print YES and s_candidate.\n\n           exit.\n\nIf none found, print NO.\n\nBut why do we need to check both the overlap condition and the merged string condition?\n\nBecause even if the overlapping part matches, the merged string may not be equal to t. For example, suppose the overlapping part matches, but the rest of the string is not as expected. However, I think that if the overlapping part matches, then s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] would be equal to t. Because the first len_s characters of t is s_candidate. Then, the rest of the t should be s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the overlapping is correct, but the rest of the string is not. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose t is 'aabbaa', and len_t is 6.\n\nlen_s_min is (6+2)//2=4. So len_s can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor len_s=4, k=2*4-6=2.\n\ns_candidate is 'aabb'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars 'bb' == first 2 'aa'? No. So invalid.\n\nFor len_s=5, k=2*5-6=4. Check if last 4 chars of s_candidate (t[:5] = 'aabba') is 'abba' and first 4 is 'aabb'? No. So invalid.\n\nSo no solution. So output NO.\n\nAnother example where the overlapping is correct, but the merged string is not t.\n\nBut how? Let's think of a scenario where the overlapping part matches, but the rest of the string is not.\n\nBut according to the way s_candidate is constructed, the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Which is the first len_s characters of t, plus the rest of the string from len_s -k onwards. Wait, but how do we know that the rest of the string is s_candidate[k:]?\n\nBecause the merged string is formed by overlapping two copies of s_candidate. So the entire t should be s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how do we know that the rest of the string is exactly s_candidate[k:]?\n\nBecause t is supposed to be the merged string. So if the overlapping is correct, then the entire t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how to verify this? Because the first len_s characters of t is s_candidate, and the rest of the string (from len_s onwards) should be s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut in the code, we check if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] equals t. So that's necessary.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the overlapping part matches, but the rest of the string is different. For example, t is 'ababa', len_t=5.\n\nlen_s_min is (5+2)//2=3.5 → 3.5 floored to 3? Wait, (5+2)//2 = 7//2=3 in Python. So len_s can be 3 and 4.\n\nFor len_s=3: k=2*3-5=1. s_candidate is 'aba'. Check if last 1 char 'a' equals first 1 'a' → yes. Then check if 'aba' + 'ba' (s_candidate[1:] is 'ba') → 'ababa' which is t. So valid. So output YES and 'aba'.\n\nSo the code would work here.\n\nAnother example where overlapping is correct, but the merged string is not t. But I can't think of such a case. Because if the overlapping is correct, then the merged string must be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Because the merged string is formed by overlapping two copies of s_candidate. Hence, the code's check is redundant? Or is there a case where the overlapping is correct, but the merged string is not t?\n\nWait, for example, let's say t is 'abacaba', len_t=7.\n\nSuppose len_s is 4, len_s_min is (7+2)//2=4.5 → 4.5 floored to 4. So len_s can be 4 and 6 (since len_t-1 is 6).\n\nFor len_s=4, k= 8-7=1. s_candidate is 'abac'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char is 'c' and first 1 is 'a' → no. So invalid.\n\nAnother len_s=5, len_t=7. len_s ranges from 4 to 6.\n\nWait len_s can be 4,5,6.\n\nFor len_s=5, k=2*5-7=3. Check if last 3 chars of s_candidate (t[:5] is 'abaca') → last 3 is 'aca', first 3 is 'aba' → no.\n\nFor len_s=6, k=2*6-7=5. Check if last 5 chars of s_candidate (t[:6] is 'abacab') → last 5 is 'bacab', first 5 is 'abaca' → no.\n\nSo no solution.\n\nBut suppose there's a case where the overlapping part is correct, but the rest of the string is not. How?\n\nLet me imagine a scenario where the first len_s characters is s_candidate, and the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k. But the rest of the string is not s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can that happen? Because the merged string is supposed to be the two s_candidates overlapped. So if the first len_s characters is s_candidate, then the rest of the string (after len_s) must be s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut perhaps the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has a positive length but less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Condition**: For a string `t` to be formed by overlapping two identical strings `s`, the length of `t` must be such that it can be derived from two instances of `s` with some overlap. This overlap length `k` must be between 1 and the length of `s` minus 1.\n2. **Determine Possible Lengths for `s`**: Calculate the possible lengths of `s` based on the length of `t`. The valid range for the length of `s` is derived from the constraints of the overlap.\n3. **Check Overlap Validity**: For each possible length of `s`, check if the overlap condition holds. Specifically, verify if the last `k` characters of the candidate `s` match the first `k` characters of `s`.\n4. **Construct and Validate `t`**: If the overlap condition is satisfied, construct the potential merged string using the candidate `s` and check if it matches `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nlen_t = len(t)\n\ndef find_s(t):\n    len_t = len(t)\n    len_s_min = (len_t + 2) // 2\n    for len_s in range(len_s_min, len_t):\n        k = 2 * len_s - len_t\n        if k < 1 or k >= len_s:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n                return s_candidate\n    return None\n\nresult = find_s(t)\nif result:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Range Calculation**: The minimum possible length of `s` (`len_s_min`) is calculated using integer division to ensure it meets the overlap constraints.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length of `s` within the calculated range, compute the overlap length `k`.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length, check if the overlap at the end of the candidate `s` matches the overlap at the beginning of the same candidate string.\n5. **Validation**: If the overlap is valid, reconstruct the potential merged string using the candidate `s` and check if it matches the original string `t`.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate string. If no valid `s` is found after all checks, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid configurations of `s` and determine if the given string `t` could be formed by an erroneous overlap of two identical messages.",
