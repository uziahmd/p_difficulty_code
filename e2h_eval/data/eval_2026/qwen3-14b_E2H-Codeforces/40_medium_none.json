    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to do this modulo a given mod. The constraints are up to n=500, which is quite big. So I need an efficient approach here.\n\nFirst, let me think about the total number of possible pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise. Since all permutations are considered, for each pair of distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. But since we want p < q, the total number of such pairs is (total permutations choose 2), which is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. But then we have to subtract those pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q). Wait, but the problem wants pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). So maybe the answer is equal to the total number of pairs (p < q) minus the number of pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q) and p < q. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. Then, for each such pair, we can check whether inv(p) > inv(q). However, for n=500, this approach is impossible because the number of permutations is way too large. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of inversion counts. For two permutations p and q, what is the relationship between their inversion counts? Also, considering that p and q are permutations of the same size.\n\nBut perhaps there's some symmetry here. Let me think: For all unordered pairs {p, q} where p ≠ q, exactly one of the following holds: inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p), unless inv(p) = inv(q). So, if we consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where p ≠ q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) divided by something. Wait, no. For each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) ≠ inv(q), then exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) has inv(p) > inv(q). So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p≠q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [Total number of ordered pairs (p,q) with p≠q] - [number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q)] all divided by 2. Because for each unordered pair where inv(p) ≠ inv(q), exactly one of the two ordered pairs contributes to the count.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and inv(p) > inv(q). So perhaps we can split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Compute the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [T - S]/2, where T is the total number of pairs (p < q) and S is the number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) = inv(q). But wait, this would be true if for every pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) ≠ inv(q), exactly half of them have inv(p) > inv(q) and the other half have inv(p) < inv(q). But that's only true if the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Is that the case?\n\nHmm. Suppose we consider all pairs (p, q) where p < q. Then, for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). Now, if we consider the pairs (p, q) and (q, p), but since p < q, (q, p) is not counted in the same set. However, for the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p ≠ q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) multiplied by zero. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p ≠ q is N = n! * (n! - 1). Let A be the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). B be the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). C be the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). So A + B + C = N. Also, since for any pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds unless they are equal. So A = B. Therefore, A = (N - C)/2.\n\nBut then, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total number of pairs (p < q) ) - (number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) <= inv(q)).\n\nBut how does that relate to A?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. Let's say that for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then it contributes to A if p < q, or to B if q < p. But since A = B, then the number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p < q) or (q < p) exists, and in that case, the inv(p) > inv(q) contributes to the count of (p < q) or (q < p). But since in the entire set, A = B, then the number of (p < q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of (p < q) with inv(p) < inv(q). Therefore, the number of (p < q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - D) / 2, where D is the number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBecause total_pairs is T = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. And for each pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of such pairs is T = X + Y + D, where X is the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q), Y is the number with inv(p) < inv(q), and D is the number with inv(p) = inv(q). But from earlier, we know that X = Y. So T = 2X + D → X = (T - D)/2. Therefore, the answer to the problem is X = (T - D)/2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing T and D, then calculating (T - D)/2 mod mod.\n\nBut wait, T is the total number of pairs (p < q) which is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. D is the number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nTherefore, the answer is ( (T - D) ) / 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how do we compute D? That's the main challenge here.\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute D, the number of pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex-wise and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nOnce we have D, we can compute the answer as (T - D) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute D?\n\nLet me think. For each possible inversion count k, let c_k be the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. Then, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q) is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2). However, this counts all unordered pairs where p and q have the same inversion count. But D is the number of such pairs where p < q. Since for each pair {p, q} with p != q and same inversion count, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total D is (sum (c_k choose 2 )) / 1? Wait, no. Because for each such pair {p, q} where p != q and same inversion count, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. Therefore, the total number of pairs (p < q) where inv(p) = inv(q) is exactly (sum (c_k choose 2 )) / 1? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is present. Therefore, the total D is exactly sum (c_k choose 2 ), because each unordered pair {p, q} contributes exactly once to D if p < q. Wait, no. Because sum (c_k choose 2) is the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). So D is exactly that sum. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, so the number of (p < q) pairs with same inversion count is exactly sum (c_k choose 2). Because each unordered pair is counted once in the sum, and exactly once in D. Therefore, D = sum (c_k choose 2).\n\nSo the problem now becomes:\n\nCompute sum_{k} (c_k choose 2) = D.\n\nOnce we compute that, then the answer is (T - D) / 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute c_k for all k?\n\nThe problem is that for n up to 500, the maximum number of inversions is n*(n-1)/2. Which for n=500 is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the maximum k is about 125,000. So for each n, we need to compute the number of permutations with exactly k inversions. This seems feasible with dynamic programming.\n\nYes, the standard approach for counting permutations with a certain number of inversions is to use dynamic programming. Let me recall.\n\nLet dp[i][j] be the number of permutations of length i with exactly j inversions. The recurrence relation is:\n\ndp[i][j] = sum_{k=0 to min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j -k]\n\nBecause when adding the i-th element (which is the number i in the permutation), inserting it into position m (0-based) in the permutation of size i-1. Inserting it at position m adds m inversions. So for each possible m (from 0 to i-1), we add to dp[i][j] the value of dp[i-1][j - m], but only if j >= m.\n\nBut for n=500, and j up to 125,000, this would be O(n^3) time. Because for each i from 1 to n, and for each j up to max_inversion, and for each possible m up to i-1. For n=500, the max inversion is about 125,000. So the total operations would be O(n^3) which for n=500 would be 500^3 = 125,000,000. Which might be manageable with optimizations, but perhaps we can find a better way.\n\nWait, but the standard approach for this problem uses a DP with convolution-like steps. Let me think again. For each i, the dp[i] can be computed from dp[i-1] by convolving with the possible number of inversions added by inserting the new element. For example, when inserting the i-th element into the permutation of i-1 elements, the number of inversions added can be from 0 to i-1. So for each i, the dp[i][j] is the sum over dp[i-1][j - m] for m from 0 to i-1, where j - m >= 0.\n\nThis is equivalent to taking the previous dp[i-1] array and for each j, adding the sum of the previous entries from j - (i-1) to j. But this can be optimized using prefix sums.\n\nYes, for each i, we can compute dp[i] from dp[i-1] by using prefix sums. Let's see:\n\nFor dp[i][j], it's the sum_{m=0}^{min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j - m]. Let's denote that as the sum of dp[i-1][x] for x from (j - (i-1)) to j, but x must be >=0. So for each j, the sum is the sum of dp[i-1][max(0, j - (i-1))] ... dp[i-1][j]. Therefore, if we precompute prefix sums of dp[i-1], then we can compute this sum in O(1) per j.\n\nThis reduces the time complexity to O(n^2 * max_inv), where max_inv is the maximum inversion count for n. For n=500, max_inv is about 125,000, so n^2 * max_inv would be 500^2 * 125,000 = 31,250,000,000. Oh no, that's way too big. Wait, that's 3e10 operations, which is way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible for n=500. So I need to find another way.\n\nWait, but maybe the maximum inversion count for n is n*(n-1)/2. For n=500, that's 124750. So the maximum j for dp[n][j] is 124750. But even then, for n=500, the total number of dp entries is O(n^2) = 500 * 125,000 = 62,500,000. But with the O(n^2) approach using prefix sums, perhaps it's manageable?\n\nLet me think again. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n- For i=1, the only permutation is [1], which has 0 inversions. So dp[1][0] = 1.\n\n- For i=2, inserting 2 into the permutation of 1 element. Inserting at position 0 adds 0 inversions (so [2,1] has 1 inversion?), wait no. Wait, inserting the new element (which is the largest element) into position m in a permutation of size i-1. For example, for i=2, inserting 2 into position 0 (the beginning) would create 0 inversions (since 2 is larger than 1, and there's nothing after it). But inserting into position 1 (the end) would create 1 inversion (since 2 is after 1, but 2>1, so that's one inversion. Wait, no. The permutation [1,2] has zero inversions. The permutation [2,1] has one inversion. So for i=2, the number of permutations with 0 inversions is 1 (the identity), and 1 inversion is 1. So dp[2][0] = 1, dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum possible inversion count is i*(i-1)/2. So for i=500, that's 124750. So the total number of entries across all i is sum_{i=1}^n (i*(i-1)/2 + 1) ) ≈ O(n^3) which is again too big. So for n=500, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps there's a generating function approach. The generating function for the number of permutations of size i with j inversions is the product of generating functions for each step. For example, when adding the ith element, the generating function is the previous generating function multiplied by (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{i-1} ), but this isn't exactly correct. Wait, the generating function for the number of permutations of size i is the generating function for permutations of size i-1 multiplied by the generating function for the number of inversions added by inserting the new element. For each insertion, inserting the new element into position m adds m inversions. So the generating function for the ith step is the convolution of the previous generating function with the polynomial x^0 + x^1 + ... + x^{i-1}.\n\nSo, the generating function for permutations of size i is G_i(x) = G_{i-1}(x) * (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{i-1}).\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nFor example, for n=500, we can compute G_1(x) = 1 (only 0 inversions). Then G_2(x) = G_1(x) * (1 + x). Then G_3(x) = G_2(x) * (1 + x + x^2), etc. Each multiplication is a convolution. However, for each step, the maximum degree of the polynomial increases by i-1. So for i=500, the maximum degree is 124750, which is manageable if we can perform these convolutions efficiently.\n\nBut even with that, for each step, the convolution would take O(m) time, where m is the current maximum degree. For n=500, the total time would be O(n^2 * m), where m is up to 125,000. Which is again O(500^2 * 125,000) = 3.125e10 operations. Not feasible in Python.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the fact that for each i, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions can be computed using the recurrence:\n\ndp[i][k] = sum_{m=0}^{min(i-1, k)} dp[i-1][k - m]\n\nBut this recurrence can be optimized using prefix sums. Let me think again. For each i, we can compute dp[i][k] as the sum of dp[i-1][k - m] for m from 0 to i-1. Which is the same as the sum of dp[i-1][x] where x ranges from k - (i-1) to k, but x must be ≥ 0. So for each k, the sum is the sum of dp[i-1][max(0, k - (i-1))] to dp[i-1][k].\n\nIf we have a prefix sum array for dp[i-1], then this sum can be computed quickly. For example, for each i, we can compute prefix_sums where prefix_sums[k] = sum_{x=0}^k dp[i-1][x]. Then, the sum from a to b is prefix_sums[b] - prefix_sums[a-1], assuming a>0. Otherwise, it's prefix_sums[b].\n\nSo for each i, the time to compute all dp[i][k] would be O(max_k), where max_k is the maximum inversion count for i. For i up to 500, max_k for i is i*(i-1)/2. So for each i, the time is O(i^2), because max_k is O(i^2). So the total time is O(n^3), which for n=500 is 500^3 = 125,000,000 operations. That's manageable in Python if optimized properly, but perhaps tight. Let's see: 1e8 operations take about a second in C++, but in Python, it's much slower. However, 1.25e8 operations may be acceptable with some optimizations, especially using arrays and precomputing prefix sums.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute dp[i][k], where dp[i][k] is the number of permutations of size i with exactly k inversions.\n\n   We can represent this as a 2D array. However, for space efficiency, since for each i, we only need the previous i-1's data, we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current.\n\n   For example, for each i, we compute current based on previous.\n\n   Initialize previous as [0] * (max_k_prev + 1), where max_k_prev is (i-1)*(i-2)/2.\n\n   For i from 1 to n:\n\n      For each possible k in 0 ... max_k_i (i*(i-1)/2):\n\n         current[k] = sum_{m=0}^{min(i-1, k)} previous[k - m]\n\n      But using prefix sums to calculate this sum efficiently.\n\n   However, for each i, the max_k increases. So for i=1, max_k is 0. For i=2, it's 1. For i=3, it's 3, etc. So for each i, the previous array is of size up to (i-1)(i-2)/2. But when we process i-th step, we need to compute the current array for up to i*(i-1)/2.\n\n   So for each i, we can compute the current array as follows:\n\n   - The previous array has size up to (i-1)(i-2)/2. For the current i, the max k is i*(i-1)/2. So we need to create a new array of size (i*(i-1)/2 + 1) for current.\n\n   However, for each i, the previous array is for permutations of size i-1, and for each k in 0 ... (i-1)(i-2)/2, previous[k] is known.\n\n   So, for each i, to compute current[k], for k up to i*(i-1)/2, we can compute the sum of previous[k - m] for m in 0 to i-1, but only if k - m >=0.\n\n   Using prefix sums:\n\n   For the previous array, compute prefix_sums where prefix_sums[x] = sum_{y=0}^x previous[y].\n\n   Then, for each k in 0 ... max_current_k:\n\n      lower = max(0, k - (i-1))\n\n      upper = k\n\n      sum_val = prefix_sums[upper] - (prefix_sums[lower-1] if lower >0 else 0)\n\n      current[k] = sum_val\n\n   So for each i, the time is O(max_current_k) for the prefix sums and O(max_current_k) for filling current.\n\n   So the total time is O(n^3), but for n=500, that's 500^3 = 125 million operations. Let's see if that's manageable in Python. Well, Python is slower, but with some optimizations, perhaps.\n\n   Let me think about the maximum possible k for n=500: 500*499/2 = 124750. So for each i from 1 to 500, the max_k for that i is i*(i-1)/2. For i=500, it's 124750. So the total number of entries across all i is sum_{i=1}^n (i*(i-1)/2 + 1) ) ≈ O(n^3) which is 125 million. But for each entry, we need to compute the sum using the prefix array. However, with the prefix sum approach, each entry is computed in O(1) time. So the total time is O(n^3) steps, which may be feasible with Python's speed if we use lists and avoid unnecessary overhead.\n\n   Now, the next step is to implement this DP approach.\n\nOnce we have the dp array for n, then for each k, we can compute c_k = dp[n][k]. Then D is sum_{k} (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2. Because for each k, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p)=inv(q)=k is (c_k choose 2), and D is the sum over all k.\n\nOnce we have D, then T is (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2, where total_perms = factorial(n). Then the answer is (T - D) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut wait, how to compute T? Because T is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise. Since there are total_perms permutations, the number of such pairs is (total_perms * (total_perms - 1 )) // 2. That's straightforward.\n\nBut how to compute factorial(n) mod mod? Well, since mod can be up to 1e9, but for n=500, the factorial can be very large, but since we need to compute (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2 mod mod, we need to compute this value. However, division by 2 mod mod requires that mod is odd, but the problem says that mod may not be prime. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, but T is (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2. However, since mod can be arbitrary, we need to compute this value mod mod. However, division by 2 is possible if 2 has a modular inverse modulo mod. But if mod is even, then 2 and mod are not coprime, so the inverse may not exist. However, the value (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) is always even, since either total_perms or total_perms -1 is even. So (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2 is an integer. Therefore, we can compute it as (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute that in code? Well, since Python handles big integers, we can compute the value as a big integer, then take mod. However, for n=500, the factorial(n) is a huge number. But since mod can be up to 1e9, we can compute factorial(n) mod (mod * 2), perhaps? Or compute the product step by step mod (mod * 2), then compute T as (fact * (fact -1 )) // 2 mod mod. Wait, but for that, we need to compute fact * (fact -1) as an integer, then divide by 2. But since fact * (fact -1) is even, (fact * (fact -1 )) // 2 is an integer. However, when working mod mod, we can't directly compute this because fact could be very large. But since mod is up to 1e9, and n is 500, we can compute fact mod (mod * 2) and then compute the value.\n\nWait, but for example, if mod is 1e9, and we compute fact mod (mod * 2), then fact * (fact -1) mod (mod * 2) will be correct. Then, since (fact * (fact -1 )) is even, dividing by 2 gives us an integer, and then taking mod mod would give the correct value. Because:\n\nLet me denote x = fact * (fact -1) // 2. We need x mod mod. Since x = (fact * (fact -1 )) // 2, and fact * (fact -1) is even, then (fact * (fact -1 )) = 2x. So, 2x mod (2*mod) is equal to 2x. Therefore, if we compute (fact * (fact -1 )) mod (2*mod), then divide by 2, the result mod mod is x mod mod. So the approach would be:\n\nCompute fact = factorial(n) mod (2 * mod). Then compute temp = (fact * (fact - 1)) % (2 * mod). Then x = temp // 2. Then the answer for T mod mod is x % mod.\n\nThis works because:\n\nfact = F mod (2*mod), where F = factorial(n). Then, F * (F -1) = 2x. So temp = F*(F-1) mod (2*mod). Since F ≡ F mod (2*mod), then F*(F-1) ≡ 2x mod (2*mod). Thus, temp is congruent to 2x mod 2*mod. So when we divide temp by 2, we get x mod mod. Because:\n\ntemp = 2x + k*(2*mod) for some integer k. Then temp//2 = x + k*mod. Taking mod mod gives x mod mod.\n\nYes, this approach works. So in code, we can compute fact as the product of 1..n mod (2*mod), then compute temp = (fact * (fact -1 )) mod (2*mod). Then x = temp // 2. Then T mod mod is x % mod.\n\nSimilarly for D, which is sum (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2. But since c_k can be very large, we need to compute this sum mod mod. However, for each term (c_k choose 2), we can compute it as (c_k * (c_k - 1 )) // 2 mod mod. Again, since c_k can be up to n! (which is huge), but we can compute each term mod (2*mod), then divide by 2, then sum all terms mod mod. Because for each term, (c_k * (c_k -1 )) is even, so same logic applies.\n\nBut how to compute c_k mod (2*mod)? Well, during the DP computation, we can compute the dp[n][k] mod (2*mod), because when we compute the sum for D, we need to compute (c_k choose 2) mod mod. However, since D is sum (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2, and we need this sum mod mod, perhaps we can compute each term as (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2 mod mod. To compute this, we can first compute c_k mod (2*mod), then compute the term.\n\nSo during the DP steps, we can compute the dp[i][k] values mod (2*mod), which allows us to compute the necessary terms for D.\n\nBut let's think about the DP steps. For each i and k, dp[i][k] is the number of permutations of size i with exactly k inversions. For n=500, the maximum k is 124750. But for each i and k, the value can be very large. However, since we need to compute D mod mod, and for each term in D, we need to compute (c_k choose 2) mod mod, which is (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2 mod mod. Therefore, during the DP steps, we can compute dp[i][k] mod (2*mod), because when we compute (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2, we need to have c_k mod (2*mod) to compute the term correctly.\n\nSo during the DP steps, we can compute the values mod (2*mod), which is manageable.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the dp table for permutations of size n, with inversion counts up to max_k = n*(n-1)/2, with each entry stored modulo (2*mod).\n\n2. Compute D as sum over all k of (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2 mod mod, where c_k is dp[n][k].\n\n3. Compute T as (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2 mod mod.\n\n4. The answer is (T - D) // 2 mod mod. Wait, but T and D are already modded. However, since T and D are computed modulo mod, and (T - D) can be negative. So we need to compute (T - D) mod mod, then multiply by the inverse of 2 mod mod. But wait, no. Because earlier, we have that the answer is (T - D) // 2. However, T and D are computed as integers mod mod. But how can we compute (T - D) // 2 mod mod?\n\nWait, no. Because T and D were computed as (T_val mod mod) and (D_val mod mod), but the actual value of (T_val - D_val) is even. Because T_val is (total_perms * (total_perms -1 )) // 2, and D_val is sum (c_k choose 2). So (T_val - D_val) is equal to X, which is the number of pairs (p < q) with inv(p) > inv(q). And X is an integer. However, when we compute T mod mod and D mod mod, then (T - D) mod mod could be negative, but we need to compute (X) mod mod. Since X = (T_val - D_val), and T_val and D_val are integers, but we have their mod mod versions. So how to compute X mod mod?\n\nBut since T_val = (T_mod + k*mod) for some integer k, and similarly for D_val. So X = T_val - D_val = (T_mod - D_mod) + (k - l)*mod. Therefore, X mod mod is (T_mod - D_mod) mod mod.\n\nBut since X is equal to (T_val - D_val) and the answer is X / 2. But X is even. So X / 2 is an integer. However, we can't directly compute (T_mod - D_mod) / 2 mod mod. Because division by 2 is not straightforward. However, since X is even, (T_mod - D_mod) must be even mod mod. Wait, no. Because X is even, so X mod mod can be even or odd depending on mod. For example, mod could be even. So how can we compute X/2 mod mod?\n\nBut X = (T_val - D_val) is even. So X is divisible by 2. Therefore, X mod (2*mod) is congruent to X. So if we compute X mod (2*mod), then divide by 2, we get (X / 2) mod mod.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute T_val and D_val as integers, then compute X = T_val - D_val. Then, answer = X // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut for n=500, T_val is (n! * (n! -1 )) // 2. Which is a huge number. How to compute this?\n\nBut earlier, we have a way to compute T mod mod by using fact mod (2*mod). Similarly, for D_val, which is sum (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2, we can compute each term mod (2*mod), sum them, then divide by 2, then mod mod. So the steps are:\n\nCompute T_val mod (2*mod) as follows:\n\nfact = factorial(n) mod (2*mod)\n\ntemp = (fact * (fact -1 )) % (2*mod)\n\nT_mod_2mod = temp // 2\n\nThen T_val mod mod is T_mod_2mod % mod.\n\nSimilarly for D_val:\n\nCompute each term (c_k * (c_k -1 )) // 2 mod mod by:\n\nfor each k, compute c_k mod (2*mod), then compute temp = (c_k * (c_k -1 )) % (2*mod), then term = temp // 2. Sum all terms, then D_mod_2mod = sum_terms, then D_val mod mod is D_mod_2mod % mod.\n\nThen, compute X_mod_2mod = (T_mod_2mod - D_mod_2mod) mod (2*mod). Since X is even, X_mod_2mod is even. Then answer = (X_mod_2mod // 2) mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute T_mod_2mod and D_mod_2mod?\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nFor T:\n\nfact = compute n! mod (2 * mod)\n\ntemp_T = (fact * (fact -1 )) % (2 * mod)\n\nT_mod_2mod = temp_T // 2\n\nSimilarly for D:\n\nsum_terms = 0\n\nfor each k:\n\n    c_k = dp[n][k]\n\n    temp = (c_k * (c_k - 1 )) % (2 * mod)\n\n    sum_terms += temp // 2\n\nsum_terms %= (2 * mod) ?\n\nWait, no. Because for each term, (c_k choose 2) is an integer, and we can compute each term as (c_k * (c_k -1 )) //",
