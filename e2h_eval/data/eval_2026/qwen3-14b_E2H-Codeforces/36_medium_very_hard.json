The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered, and each town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers allow such a setup. Let's think about the constraints. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower must cover it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nLet me think about how the signal powers work. A tower at position i with power p covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, no. The problem says |c - i| < p. So that means c can be from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the range is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], but since p is an integer ≥1. For example, if p=1, then |c-i| <1 implies c=i. So the tower covers exactly its own town. If p=2, then |c-i| <2 → c can be i-1, i, i+1.\n\nBut for the coverage to be exactly one per town, we need that each town is covered by exactly one tower. And also, the towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n\nSo how can the towers be arranged? Let's think of possible valid configurations.\n\nFor example, in the first sample where n=2, the only valid configuration is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can have power 1. That way, town 1 is covered by itself, town 2 by itself. Town 0 is not covered (since tower 1's power is 1: |0-1| = 1 is not less than 1. So no. Similarly for town 3 (n+1=3) is not covered by tower 2's power 1.\n\nAnother example given: when n=5, towers at 2,4,5. Then, tower 2 has power 2, covering towns 1,2,3. Tower 4 has power 1 (covers 4), tower 5 has power 1 (covers 5). So all towns 1-5 are covered once.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the towers must be arranged in such a way that they form a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. Also, each tower's coverage must not reach beyond the ends (so for a tower at position i, its coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1).\n\nWait, but the coverage of a tower depends on its power. For a tower at i, the maximum power it can have without covering town 0 is such that i - p + 1 > 0 → p < i. Similarly, for town n+1, the coverage can't reach it. So for a tower at i, the maximum power it can have is min(i, n+1 - i). But maybe that's not directly relevant here. Because when setting the power, you can choose any value as long as the coverage doesn't include 0 or n+1. But the main thing is that the coverage of the towers must exactly cover each town once.\n\nSo perhaps the valid tower configurations are those where the towers form a set of non-overlapping ranges that cover all towns 1..n, and each tower's range is such that it doesn't extend beyond the ends. But how do these ranges look?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as tiling the interval [1, n] with intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. Each such interval must be centered at some tower position. For example, if a tower is at position i, it can cover a range of length 2p-1 (since for power p, it covers from i-p+1 to i+p-1). However, the exact choice of p depends on the positions of other towers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration up to position i. How can we extend it?\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the configuration to be valid, each tower must be responsible for covering a certain segment of towns. Let's imagine that the towers are placed in such a way that each tower is responsible for a segment of towns. For example, a tower at position i could be responsible for covering towns from a to b, where a ≤ i ≤ b, and the coverage of this tower must not reach outside [a, b]. Also, the segments for different towers must not overlap.\n\nMoreover, the coverage of the tower must be such that the entire segment [a, b] is covered by exactly this tower. For that, the tower's power must be at least (b - a + 1)/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the tower's power must be large enough to cover the entire segment [a, b], but not so large that it covers beyond.\n\nWait, the tower's coverage is determined by its power. To cover the entire segment [a, b], the tower at position i must have power p such that:\n\ni - p + 1 ≤ a and i + p - 1 ≥ b.\n\nWhich simplifies to p ≥ (b - a + 1)/2 + ... Wait, solving for p:\n\nThe left inequality is p ≥ i - a + 1.\n\nThe right inequality is p ≥ b - i + 1.\n\nSo p must be at least max( i - a + 1, b - i + 1 ). But since the tower is at i, and the segment is [a, b], then the minimal p required to cover the entire segment is ceil( (b - a + 1)/2 ), but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the segment is from a=1 to b=3, and the tower is at i=2, then p needs to be at least 2 (since 2-1+1=2, 3-2+1=2. So p=2 covers from 1 to 3. If the tower is at i=1, then to cover up to b=3, the p must be at least 3-1+1 = 3. So the tower would cover from 1-3+1= -1 to 1+3-1=3. But that would include town 0, which is invalid. Hence, in that case, such a configuration is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the tower's coverage must not reach beyond the ends. Which means that for the entire segment [a, b], the tower's position i must be such that:\n\ni - p + 1 > 0 (so that the left end of coverage doesn't reach town 0), and i + p - 1 < n+1 (so the right end doesn't reach town n+1). But since the tower is responsible for [a, b], which is part of [1, n], then the coverage must be exactly [a, b]. Therefore, the tower's coverage must be exactly [a, b], meaning that:\n\ni - p + 1 = a\n\ni + p - 1 = b\n\nSolving these two equations gives:\n\nAdding them: 2i = a + b → i = (a + b)/2. So the tower must be at the midpoint of the segment [a, b]. Also, p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2 ? Let's see:\n\nFrom the first equation: p = i - a + 1.\n\nBut since i = (a + b)/2, substituting gives p = (a + b)/2 - a + 1 = (b - a)/2 + 1 = (b - a + 2)/2. Which is equal to (b - a + 1)/2 + 0.5. Wait, but p has to be an integer. So this suggests that the segment [a, b] must have length even or odd?\n\nWait, for i to be an integer, a + b must be even. So the segment [a, b] must have even length? Or maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose a=1, b=2. Then i=(1+2)/2 = 1.5, which is not an integer. But the tower must be located at an integer position. Therefore, this suggests that the segment [a, b] must be of even length? No, wait. Wait, the tower is located at position i, which is an integer. Therefore, for i to be (a + b)/2, the sum a + b must be even. Hence, a and b must be of the same parity. Otherwise, the midpoint is not an integer.\n\nSo this suggests that each segment [a, b] must be such that a + b is even, and the tower is located at i = (a + b)/2. Then, the power p is (b - a + 1 + 1)/2? Wait, let's re-calculate.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\ni - p + 1 = a → p = i - a + 1.\n\nSimilarly, i + p - 1 = b → p = b - i + 1.\n\nSo combining these two gives i -a + 1 = b -i + 1 → 2i = a + b → which is the same as before. So for the tower at i, the length of the segment is b - a + 1. And p is (i - a + 1) = (b - i + 1). Since i is the midpoint, then the length of the segment is (b - a + 1) = 2*(i - a) + 1? Let me see:\n\nIf i is the midpoint, then the distance from a to i is i - a. The distance from i to b is b - i. Since a + b = 2i, then b - i = i - a. So the total length is (i - a) + (b - i) + 1 (the i itself) = 2*(i - a) + 1. So the length is 2k + 1, where k = i -a. Then p is k + 1, because p = i -a + 1 = k + 1. So the power p is k+1, which is (length + 1)/2. For example, if the segment is length 3 (like a=1, b=3, i=2), then p is (3 + 1)/2 = 2, which works. If the segment is length 1 (a = b = i), then p is 1.\n\nSo, for the coverage to be exactly [a, b], the segment must be of length 2k + 1, and the tower is at the center. Moreover, the coverage of the tower must not reach beyond the ends. So for the left end, the tower's coverage starts at a, which is >=1. For the right end, it ends at b <=n. Also, the tower's coverage cannot reach town 0 or n+1. For example, if the segment is [a, b], then the tower's coverage is exactly [a, b], which does not reach beyond. Hence, the conditions for the tower's coverage are satisfied.\n\nSo this implies that the entire arrangement of towers must be a partition of the towns 1..n into segments, each of which is of length 2k+1 (for some k ≥0) and centered at a tower. Each such segment is covered by exactly one tower, and the towers are located at the centers of these segments.\n\nMoreover, since the tower is built with probability 1/2, the valid configurations are those where the towns selected for towers are exactly the centers of these segments. For example, if a segment [a, b] is present, then the tower must be built at i = (a + b)/2. Also, the tower must be present (probability 1/2), and all other towns in the segment must not be towers? No, no. Wait, the towers are built in towns 1..n. The problem says that each of these towns is built with probability 1/2, independently. But the configuration of towers that allows the assignment of signal powers is such that the towers are exactly the centers of these segments. So in such a valid configuration, the set of towers is exactly the centers of the segments. Therefore, the presence of a tower at position i is required if and only if i is the center of some segment.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the interval [1, n] into segments where each segment is of odd length and centered at a tower. Then, multiply by (1/2)^k, where k is the number of towers (since each tower must be present, and others not present). Wait, no. Because the towers are built with probability 1/2. So for a configuration that requires certain towns to have towers, the probability is (1/2)^m * (1/2)^{n - m} }? No. Wait, the total number of possible tower configurations is 2^n. For a particular configuration that requires exactly m towns to have towers, the probability is (1/2)^m * (1/2)^{n - m} }? No, no. Because each town is built with probability 1/2, independent. So the probability that exactly the towns in S are built is (1/2)^{|S|} * (1/2)^{n - |S|} }? No, that would be (1/2)^n. Wait, no. For each town, the probability that it is built is 1/2. So for a specific subset S of the towns, the probability that exactly S is built is (1/2)^n. Because each town is included or not, with probability 1/2. So for any subset S of the towns {1..n}, the probability is (1/2)^n. However, in our problem, the valid configurations are those subsets S where the towns in S can be partitioned into segments as described. So the total number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of such partitions multiplied by ... Well, for each such partition, there is exactly one subset S (the set of centers of the segments). So the total number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such valid partitions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (number of valid partitions) / 2^n.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: find the number of valid partitions of the interval [1, n] into segments of odd lengths, where each segment is centered at a tower (so the tower is present in the subset S). Then, the answer is (count) / 2^n.\n\nSo how do we compute this count?\n\nThis looks like a dynamic programming problem. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid ways to partition the interval [1, i].\n\nWe need to compute dp[n].\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty interval, one way to partition), and dp[1] = 1 (the segment [1,1], which is length 1, centered at 1).\n\nFor i >= 2, how can we compute dp[i]?\n\nFor each j < i, we can consider that the last segment ends at i. The segment must have odd length. Let's say the last segment is of length 2k + 1, ending at i. Then the starting position is i - 2k. The center of this segment is i - 2k + k = i -k. So the center is at position i - k. Wait, for a segment of length 2k+1, the center is at position (start + end)/2. Let me think. Suppose the segment starts at s and ends at e. Then e - s + 1 = 2k + 1. So e = s + 2k. The center is s + k. So for the segment ending at i, the start is i - 2k, and the center is i - k.\n\nBut since the segment must end at i, the start is i - 2k. The start must be ≥1. So for each possible k, such that i - 2k ≥ 1 → k ≤ (i-1)/2. Also, since k ≥0, the possible values of k are 0, 1, ..., floor((i-1)/2).\n\nBut for each possible k, the center is at position i -k. So for each possible center position j = i -k, which ranges from i - 0 = i down to i - floor((i-1)/2). Wait, for example, if i is 3, then k can be 0 (segment length 1, ends at 3, starts at 3) or 1 (segment length 3, starts at 1, ends at 3, center at 2). So j can be 3 (k=0) or 2 (k=1). So for each j in the range from 1 to i, such that j is the center of a segment ending at i, then the start is j -k, where k is the distance from the center to the start. Wait, perhaps another way: the segment ending at i must have its center at j, and the length is 2k + 1. Since the center is j, the end is j + k. So j + k = i → k = i -j. Also, the start is j -k = j - (i -j) = 2j -i. This start must be ≥1.\n\nSo 2j -i ≥ 1 → j ≥ (i + 1)/2. Also, since the start is 2j -i, and the end is i. So for the segment to be valid, the start must be ≥1. Therefore, j must be ≥ ceil( (i + 1)/2 ). Also, since the start is 2j -i, which must be ≥1, and the segment must be within [1, i].\n\nTherefore, for the DP transition, dp[i] can be computed as the sum over all j where the segment [start, i] is valid, of dp[start - 1]. Because the segment [start, i] is handled by the center j, and the rest of the partition is up to start-1.\n\nBut how do we find all possible j for each i?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can consider all possible centers j such that the segment [s, i] is centered at j, where s = 2j -i ≥1. Then, dp[i] += dp[s-1].\n\nSo for each i, we can iterate over all possible j where j is between ceil( (i+1)/2 ) and i, and s = 2j -i ≥1.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think for i. For j to be a valid center, the start s = 2j -i must be ≥1. So:\n\n2j -i ≥ 1 → j ≥ (i + 1)/2.\n\nSince j must be an integer, j ≥ ceil( (i+1)/2 )\n\nAlso, since the segment [s, i] must have s ≥1, and j is the center, which is between s and i. So j can be from ceil( (i+1)/2 ) to i.\n\nFor example, for i=3, j can be 2 and 3. For j=2: s=2*2 -3 = 1, which is valid. For j=3: s=2*3 -3 =3, which is valid.\n\nSo for each i, the possible j's are from ceil( (i+1)/2 ) to i. For each such j, we add dp[s-1], where s = 2j -i.\n\nBut s can be written as 2j -i. So s-1 = 2j -i -1.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently? Because if we naively loop for each j from ceil((i+1)/2) to i, for each i, then the time complexity would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5.\n\nWe need a way to compute this sum more efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the expression for s. For j in [ceil((i+1)/2), i], s = 2j - i. Let's denote m = i. Then, s ranges from 2*ceil( (m+1)/2 ) - m to 2m -m = m.\n\nLet me compute what s is for j in that range. For example, when j is ceil((m+1)/2), then s is 2j - m. Let's see:\n\nFor m even: say m=4. Then (m+1)/2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3. So j starts at 3. s = 2*3 -4 = 2. For j=3, s=2. For j=4, s= 8-4=4. So s ranges from 2 to 4.\n\nFor m odd: m=3. (3+1)/2=2, so j starts at 2. s= 2*2-3=1. For j=2, s=1; j=3, s=3. So s ranges from 1 to 3.\n\nSo for each m=i, the s ranges from s_min = 2*ceil( (m+1)/2 ) - m to s_max = m.\n\nBut what is s_min?\n\nLet me compute ceil( (m+1)/2 ). Let's note that for m even, m=2k: (m+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 = k + 0.5 → ceil is k+1. So s_min = 2*(k+1) - 2k = 2k + 2 - 2k = 2. For m even, s_min=2.\n\nFor m odd, m=2k+1: (m+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1 → ceil is k+1. So s_min = 2*(k+1) - (2k+1) = 2k+2 -2k -1 = 1. So for m odd, s_min=1.\n\nSo for each i=m, the possible s ranges from 1 (if m is odd) or 2 (if m is even) up to m. And for each s in that range, there's a j such that s = 2j - m → j = (s + m)/2. But since j must be an integer (as it's a position), then (s + m) must be even. Let's check:\n\ns + m = 2j → j is integer. Since s is in the range [s_min, m], and for each s, j is (s + m)/2.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, for each i=m, the sum over j is equivalent to summing dp[s-1] for all s such that s is in the range [s_min, m], and s + m is even.\n\nSo, for each i, the sum is sum_{s} dp[s-1], where s ranges from s_min to i, and (s + i) is even.\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly?\n\nLet me think about the parity. For each i, the s must satisfy s ≡ -i mod 2. Because s + i must be even → s ≡ i mod 2. So s and i have the same parity.\n\nSo for each i, the valid s's are those in the range [s_min, i], with s ≡ i mod 2.\n\nSo the sum is the sum of dp[s-1] for s in [s_min, i], and s ≡ i mod 2.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think of precomputing prefix sums for even and odd positions. Let's define two arrays:\n\nprefix_even[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} dp[k-1] if k is even.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's have two prefix sums:\n\nsum_even[i] = sum of dp[j] for j from 0 to i where j is even.\n\nsum_odd[i] = sum of dp[j] for j from 0 to i where j is odd.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think: For each i, when considering the sum for s in [s_min, i], and s has the same parity as i.\n\nLet me note that s ranges from s_min to i, and s has the same parity as i. Let me denote that parity as p (0 or 1). So for example, if i is even, then s must be even. So the sum is sum_{s in [s_min, i], s even} dp[s-1].\n\nSimilarly for odd.\n\nBut how to compute this sum for any range [a, b] with parity p?\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for even and odd indices. Let me think:\n\nLet's create two arrays:\n\npre_even: pre_even[k] = sum_{x=0}^k dp[x] if x is even.\n\npre_odd: pre_odd[k] = sum_{x=0}^k dp[x] if x is odd.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum for s in [a, b] with s even would be the sum of dp[s-1] where s is even. Let me think:\n\ns ranges from a to b, and s is even. So s-1 is odd. So for each s even, s-1 is odd. So the sum is sum of dp[s-1] for s even in [a, b], which is sum of dp[k] where k is odd and in [a-1, b-1].\n\nSimilarly, if i is even, then s must be even. So the sum is sum of dp[k] for k in [s_min-1, i-1], where k is odd.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose i is even, and s ranges from s_min to i, and s is even. Then s can be 2,4,...,i. For each s, s-1 is 1,3,...,i-1. So the sum is sum_{k= s_min-1, s_min+1-1, ... i-1} dp[k], where k is odd. So the sum is sum of dp[k] for k in [s_min-1, i-1], and k is odd.\n\nSimilarly, if i is odd, then s must be odd. So the sum is sum of dp[k] for k in [s_min-1, i-1], and k is even.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each i, compute the sum of dp[k] for k in [L, R], where L = s_min -1, R = i-1, and k has a certain parity (even or odd, depending on i's parity).\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly?\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for even and odd positions. Let's define:\n\nprefix_even[i] = sum_{x=0}^i dp[x] if x is even, else 0.\n\nprefix_odd[i] = sum_{x=0}^i dp[x] if x is odd, else 0.\n\nThen, for a given range [L, R], and parity p (0 for even, 1 for odd), the sum can be computed as follows:\n\nif p is 0 (even):\n\nsum_even(R) - sum_even(L-1)\n\nelse:\n\nsum_odd(R) - sum_odd(L-1)\n\nSo for each i, once we find L and R, and the required parity, we can compute the sum in O(1) time.\n\nNow, the question is, for each i, what is L and R?\n\nRecall that L = s_min - 1, and R = i -1.\n\nBut what is s_min?\n\nAs discussed earlier, s_min is 1 if i is odd, and 2 if i is even.\n\nSo for i even:\n\ns_min = 2 → L = 2 -1 =1, R = i-1.\n\nAnd the required parity for k is odd (since i is even, and s must be even, so k = s-1 is odd).\n\nFor i odd:\n\ns_min = 1 → L = 1-1 =0, R = i-1.\n\nThe required parity for k is even (since i is odd, and s is odd, so k = s-1 is even).\n\nSo putting this together, for each i:\n\nif i is even:\n\nsum = (sum_odd(R) - sum_odd(L-1)) where L=1, R=i-1.\n\nif i is odd:\n\nsum = (sum_even(R) - sum_even(L-1)) where L=0, R=i-1.\n\nBut L-1 for i even is 1-1=0. So for i even, the sum is sum_odd[i-1] - sum_odd[0-1], but sum_odd[-1] is zero (assuming prefix arrays start at 0).\n\nWait, the prefix arrays should be defined for x >=0.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nFor i even:\n\nL = 1 (since s_min=2 → s_min-1=1)\n\nR = i-1\n\nsum is sum_odd[R] - sum_odd[L-1] = sum_odd[i-1] - sum_odd[0]\n\nBecause L-1 = 0.\n\nFor i odd:\n\nL = 0 (since s_min=1 → s_min-1=0)\n\nR = i-1\n\nsum is sum_even[R] - sum_even[L-1] = sum_even[i-1] - sum_even[-1], which is sum_even[i-1] (since sum_even[-1] is zero).\n\nSo the transitions for dp[i] are:\n\ndp[i] = (sum_odd[i-1] - sum_odd[0]) if i even, else sum_even[i-1]\n\nBut wait, sum_odd[0] is the sum of dp[x] for x from 0 to 0, where x is odd. Since x=0 is even, sum_odd[0] is 0. So for even i, dp[i] = sum_odd[i-1] - 0 = sum_odd[i-1].\n\nFor odd i, dp[i] = sum_even[i-1] - 0 = sum_even[i-1].\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (base case)\n\nfor i >=1:\n\nif i is even:\n\ndp[i] = sum_odd[i-1]\n\nelse:\n\ndp[i] = sum_even[i-1]\n\nBut how do we compute sum_even and sum_odd?\n\nWe can maintain two variables as we compute dp. Let's think:\n\nInitialize prefix_even and prefix_odd as arrays. But since n can be up to 2e5, we can precompute them as we go.\n\nAt each step i, after computing dp[i], we can update the prefix_even and prefix_odd.\n\nBut for the purposes of the DP, we can track the prefix sums incrementally.\n\nLet me think. For each i, after computing dp[i], we can update the prefix_even and prefix_odd.\n\nFor example:\n\nprefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1] + (dp[i] if i is even else 0)\n\nSimilarly for prefix_odd[i].\n\nBut since we need to compute the sum up to R (which is i-1 for the current i), perhaps we can maintain two variables, even_sum and odd_sum, which represent the cumulative sum up to the current index.\n\nWait, let's think again. The sum_even[k] is the sum of dp[0], dp[2], dp[4], ..., up to dp[k] if k is even, or up to dp[k-1] if k is odd.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to have prefix_even and prefix_odd arrays where prefix_even[i] is the sum of dp[j] for all j from 0 to i where j is even. Similarly for prefix_odd[i].\n\nSo for example, prefix_even[0] = dp[0] (since 0 is even). prefix_even[1] = dp[0] (since 1 is odd, so not added). prefix_even[2] = dp[0] + dp[2], etc.\n\nSimilarly for prefix_odd[i].\n\nOnce we have these prefix arrays, then for any R, the sum of even numbers up to R is prefix_even[R], and sum of odd numbers up to R is prefix_odd[R].\n\nSo for each i, during the DP step, we can calculate the required sum based on whether i is even or odd.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[0] = 1 (since 0 is even, and dp[0] is 1).\n\nprefix_odd[0] = 0 (since 0 is even, not added to odd sum).\n\nThen for i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is even:\n\ndp[i] = prefix_odd[i-1]\n\nelse:\n\ndp[i] = prefix_even[i-1]\n\nthen, compute prefix_even[i] and prefix_odd[i] based on whether i is even or odd.\n\nFor example:\n\nif i is even:\n\nprefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1] + dp[i]\n\nprefix_odd[i] = prefix_odd[i-1]\n\nelse:\n\nprefix_even[i] = prefix_even[i-1]\n\nprefix_odd[i] = prefix_odd[i-1] + dp[i]\n\nThis way, we can compute the prefix arrays incrementally.\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nLet me test this with some small examples.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. Expected answer is 1/4. The count is 1 (only the case where towers are built at 1 and 2).\n\nLet's compute dp[2].\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[0] = 1, prefix_odd[0] = 0.\n\ni=1 (odd):\n\ndp[1] = prefix_even[0] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[1] = prefix_even[0] = 1 (since i=1 is odd, not added to even sum).\n\nprefix_odd[1] = prefix_odd[0] + dp[1] = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\ni=2 (even):\n\ndp[2] = prefix_odd[1] = 1.\n\nprefix_even[2] = prefix_even[1] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nprefix_odd[2] = prefix_odd[1] = 1.\n\nSo dp[2] = 1. Which is correct, since there's one valid way (the partition [1,2] into [1,1] and [2,2], but wait no. Wait for i=2, the dp[2] counts the number of ways to partition [1, 2]. Let's think:\n\nPossible partitions:\n\nEither [1,1] and [2,2], which requires towers at 1 and 2. Or, a single segment [1,2], which has length 2, which is even. Wait no! Wait earlier analysis said that the segments must be of odd length. Oh right! Because earlier we derived that the segments must be of odd length, since the length is 2k+1. So for i=2, the possible segments ending at 2 are:\n\nFor j in ceil((2+1)/2) = 2 to 2. So j=2. Then s = 2*2 - 2 = 2. So the segment is [2,2], which is length 1. So the partition is [1,1] and [2,2], but that would require that the first segment is [1,1], which is handled by dp[0] (since the start is 1, and the previous part is up to s-1 = 0). So dp[2] = dp[0] =1. Which matches the calculation. But what about a segment [1,2]? Its length is 2, which is even. Which is not allowed. Hence, it's not considered. Thus, dp[2] = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the count is 1. The probability is 1/(2^2) = 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. The expected answer is 1/4. Let's compute dp[3].\n\ndp[0] =1, prefix_even[0]=1, prefix_odd[0]=0.\n\ni=1 (odd): dp[1] = prefix_even[0] = 1. prefix_even[1] = 1, prefix_odd[1] = 0+1=1.\n\ni=2 (even): dp[2] = prefix_odd[1] = 1. prefix_even[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. prefix_odd[2] =1.\n\ni=3 (odd): dp[3] = prefix_even[2] = 2. \n\nSo dp[3] is 2. The total count is 2. The probability is 2/(2^3) = 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample for n=3.\n\nAnother sample for n=5: the real answer is 5/32. Let's compute dp[5].\n\nLet me compute step by step.\n\ndp[0] =1.\n\nprefix_even[0] =1, prefix_odd[0]=0.\n\ni=1 (odd): dp[1] = prefix_even[0] = 1. prefix_even[1] =1, prefix_odd[1] =0+1=1.\n\ni=2 even: dp[2] = prefix_odd[1] =1. prefix_even[2] =1+1=2, prefix_odd[2] =1.\n\ni=3 odd: dp[3] = prefix_even[2] = 2",
