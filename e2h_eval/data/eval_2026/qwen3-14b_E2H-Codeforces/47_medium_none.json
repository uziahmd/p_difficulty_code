    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. Let me first note that a and b are given, and we add the same k to both. So, let me denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are at least a and b respectively. But since k is the same for both, the difference between x and y is (b - a). Wait, because x - y = (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between x and y is fixed as (a - b), but since x and y are in the same order as a and b. So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think: Suppose a is 6 and b is 10. Then, when k is 2, x is 8 and y is 12. Their difference is 4, which is same as b - a (which is 4). So the difference between x and y is always (b - a) if a < b. Or if a > b, then the difference is negative. But in any case, the absolute difference between x and y is |a - b|.\n\nBut how does this help me? Well, the LCM of two numbers is minimized when they are as small as possible, but also when they have a large GCD. Because LCM(x,y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). So if x and y are close to each other, their GCD might be larger. For example, if x and y are equal, their LCM is x, which is the minimum possible. So perhaps the optimal k is such that x and y are as close as possible, or even equal?\n\nWait, but if a and b are different, then adding k can make them equal. Let's see. Let me take the first example: a=6, b=10. Then, if we add k=2, then x=8 and y=12. Wait, but they aren't equal. Oh, but maybe there's another approach. Let me think: suppose we want x and y to be equal. Then, a +k = b +k → a = b. Which is only possible if a equals b. Otherwise, it's impossible. So for the case where a ≠ b, we can't make x and y equal. However, perhaps we can make them such that their difference is a divisor of one of them. Or maybe find a k such that x and y have a large GCD.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal LCM occurs when the two numbers x and y have the largest possible GCD. Because LCM(x,y) = x * y / GCD(x,y). So, if GCD(x,y) is large, then the LCM is small.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote d = |a - b|. Let's assume that a < b. So, d = b - a. Then, x = a +k, y = b +k = x +d. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that x and x +d have the maximum possible GCD. Because then, their LCM would be (x*(x+d))/GCD(x, x+d). But since GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, the GCD of x and x +d is the same as the GCD of x and d. So, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x+d)) / GCD(x, d). To minimize this, we need to maximize GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find x (which is a +k, so x ≥ a) such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because once we have that, the LCM will be minimized.\n\nSo, what is d here? Let's say a and b are given, and we can compute d = |a - b|. Let's assume that a ≤ b, so d = b -a. Then, the problem is to find x ≥ a (since k ≥ 0) such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Once we find that, then the LCM is minimized.\n\nSo, the key is to find x ≥ a such that GCD(x, d) is maximized. Let me think about how to find that x.\n\nThe maximum possible GCD of x and d is the maximum divisor of d. Let me explain. Since GCD(x, d) must divide d. So, the maximum possible value of GCD(x, d) is d itself. But for that, x must be a multiple of d. However, x can be any number ≥ a. So, for example, if d is 4, then x can be a multiple of 4. Let's say a is 6, d is 4. Then, the first x ≥6 that is a multiple of 4 is 8. So, x=8. Then, GCD(8,4)=4. Which is the maximum possible.\n\nBut in that case, the LCM of x and x +d (which is 8 and 12) is (8*12)/4 = 24, which is the example given. So that's the case.\n\nSo, the plan is: find the maximum possible g that divides d, then find the minimal x ≥a such that g divides x. Then, compute the corresponding k and check.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum possible g?\n\nWell, the maximum possible g is the maximum divisor of d. So, the maximum possible g is d itself. But if we can find x ≥a such that x is a multiple of d, then that's the best. If not, then the next largest divisor of d.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a = b, so adding any k gives LCM(a +k, a +k) = a +k. So the minimal is when k is 0, so output 0.\n\nOtherwise, for d >0:\n\n2. Find all the divisors of d. Then, for each divisor g (sorted in descending order), check whether there exists an x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g. The minimal x would be the ceiling of a divided by g multiplied by g. Wait, no. Let me think: x must be ≥a, and x must be a multiple of g. The minimal x is the smallest multiple of g that is ≥a. That's equal to ((a + g -1) // g) * g. But if that x is such that x +d is (x +d) = x + (b -a) (since d = b -a, assuming a <b). Wait, but x is a +k. So, when a <b, then x = a +k, and y = b +k = x +d. So, the GCD(x, d) is g, and we want to maximize g.\n\nOnce we find the maximum possible g, then the minimal x is the first multiple of g that is ≥a. Then, the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible g?\n\nThe maximum possible g is the maximum divisor of d. So, we can generate all divisors of d, sort them in descending order, and for each divisor, check if there exists x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g. Well, since x can be as big as needed, but we want the minimal x, but for our purpose, the existence is always true. Because for any g, the minimal x is the first multiple of g that is ≥a. So, for each divisor of d, sorted in descending order, we can check for the minimal x and compute the corresponding k, and then select the one with the minimal LCM. However, since we are trying to maximize g, the first such divisor (the maximum) will give us the best possible scenario.\n\nWait, but perhaps for different divisors, even though they are smaller than the maximum, there might be a smaller x that gives a better LCM. Hmm, but since we are trying to maximize g, the maximum possible g will give the largest possible GCD, hence leading to the minimal LCM. So, once we find the maximum possible g, then the minimal x for that g will give us the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nIf a == b, then return 0.\n\nElse, compute d = |a -b|.\n\nFind all the divisors of d.\n\nSort them in descending order.\n\nFor each divisor g in this list:\n\n   compute the minimal x ≥ a such that x is divisible by g. Let's call this x_candidate.\n\n   Then, the corresponding k_candidate is x_candidate - a.\n\n   Now, compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d. Since d = |a -b|, and x_candidate +d = (a +k_candidate) +d = (a +k_candidate) + (b -a) = b +k_candidate. Which is correct.\n\nBut since d = |a -b|, and x_candidate is a +k_candidate, and the other number is (a +k_candidate) +d if a <b, or (a +k_candidate) -d if a >b. Wait, no, because d is |a -b|. So, regardless of whether a is bigger than b, the difference between the two numbers is d. So, for example, if a is larger than b, then d = a -b. Then, the two numbers are x = a +k and y = b +k = x -d. So, x and y = x -d. Then, the GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, x -d) = GCD(x, d). So same as before.\n\nSo, regardless of which is larger, the GCD is GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the process is the same. So, for each divisor g of d, sorted descending, compute x_candidate as the minimal x ≥a (assuming a is the smaller one?), wait, no. Wait, in the case where a is larger than b, then d = a -b. Then, x is a +k, and the other number is b +k = x -d. So, the same logic applies. But when we compute x_candidate, it's the minimal x ≥a (if a is the original a, which may be larger than b). But in that case, the minimal x is a, but that may not be a multiple of g. So, the process is the same.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|.\n\nIf d is zero, then return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nSort them in descending order.\n\nFor each divisor g in this list:\n\n   find the minimal x >= a such that x mod g == 0. How?\n\n   Well, x can be computed as follows:\n\n   if a % g == 0, then x = a.\n\n   else, x = ((a // g) + 1) * g.\n\n   But this x is the minimal x >= a that is divisible by g.\n\n   Then, compute the corresponding k_candidate = x - a.\n\n   Now, compute the LCM of x and (x + (b -a)) if a <b, or x and (x -d) if a >b. But since d is |a -b|, and x is a +k_candidate, then the other number is (b +k_candidate) = x + (b -a) if a <b. But if a >b, then (b +k_candidate) = x - (a -b) = x -d. Either way, the two numbers are x and x ±d. But since d is the absolute difference, the LCM can be calculated as (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, d) if a <b. But since GCD(x, d) is g, because we have x divisible by g, and g is a divisor of d. So, GCD(x, d) = g. So, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g. Wait, but x +d is (a +k) +d. If a <b, then d is b -a. So, x +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. Which is the other number. So yes.\n\nSo, for each candidate g, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g. But since x is a multiple of g, and d is also a multiple of g (because g is a divisor of d), then x +d is also a multiple of g. So, the LCM is (x * (x +d )) / g. But since x and x +d are multiples of g, their product is divisible by g^2, so dividing by g gives something divisible by g.\n\nBut how do I compare between different g's? Because for different divisors, even though they are smaller, maybe the LCM is smaller. Wait, but the idea is that the maximum possible g will lead to the maximum GCD, which leads to the minimal LCM. However, perhaps there are cases where a smaller g gives a better LCM. For example, suppose d is 4, and a is 3. Let's say we have two options: g=4 and g=2.\n\nFor g=4: x must be >=3 and multiple of 4. So x=4. Then, LCM(4, 4 +4=8) is 8. Which is 4*8 /4= 8.\n\nFor g=2: x can be 4 (since 3//2 is 1, so (1+1)*2=4). Then, LCM(4, 8) is also 8. But if x was 2 (but 2 is less than a=3, so not allowed). So the same LCM. So, in this case, both g=4 and g=2 give same LCM. But since we are choosing the maximum possible g first, we would choose g=4, and the k is 4-3=1. But in this case, the LCM is same. However, the problem says that if there are multiple k's with same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest k. So, in this case, maybe there's another k that gives the same LCM but smaller k.\n\nWait, but for the same g=4, the x is 4, which gives k=1. For g=2, the x is 4, which gives same k. So, same result. So, no problem. But what if there's a case where a smaller g gives a lower LCM?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose d=6. Let's say a=5. So, possible divisors of d=6 are 6,3,2, etc. Let's take g=6. The minimal x is 6 (since 5//6 is 0, so (0+1)*6=6). Then, x is 6, and the other number is 6 +6 =12. LCM(6,12) is 12. For g=3, the minimal x is 6 (since 5//3 is 1, 1*3=3 <5. So (1+1)*3=6). Then, x is 6, other number is 12. Same LCM. So again same result. What if there's a case where a smaller g gives a better LCM?\n\nAnother example: d=6, a=4. For g=6, x is 6, LCM is 6*12 /6= 12. For g=3, x is 6, same LCM. For g=2, x is 4 (since 4 is divisible by 2). Then, the other number is 4+6=10. LCM(4,10) is 20. Which is larger than 12. So, worse. So in this case, the maximum g gives better LCM.\n\nAnother example: d=4, a=3. For g=4, x=4, LCM(4, 8) is 8. For g=2, x=4, same LCM. So same as before.\n\nBut what if a=2, d=4. Then, for g=4, x=4, LCM(4, 8) is 8. For g=2, x=2 (since 2 is >=a=2). Then, the other number is 2+4=6. LCM(2,6) is 6. Which is better than 8. Oh! So here, choosing a smaller g gives a better LCM. So my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, why? Because in this case, the maximum possible g is 4. But the LCM when choosing g=4 is 8. However, when choosing g=2, which is a smaller divisor of d=4, but allows x to be 2 (which is smaller than 4), leading to a smaller LCM. So this shows that the initial approach of taking the maximum possible g may not be sufficient. Therefore, my previous idea is incorrect. So, how to handle this?\n\nThis is a problem. So, the assumption that maximizing the GCD(x, d) would lead to the minimal LCM is not correct. Because in this case, even though the GCD(x, d) is 2 (for x=2 and d=4), which is smaller than 4 (the maximum possible), but the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex than I thought. Therefore, I need to find for all possible divisors of d, compute the corresponding x and LCM, and choose the one with the minimal LCM, and among those, the minimal k.\n\nSo, the approach must be:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g, compute the minimal x >= a (or whatever the original a and b are) that is divisible by g. Then compute the LCM of x and (x +d) (or x -d, depending on which is larger). Then, compare all these LCMs, and choose the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple, choose the one with the minimal k.\n\nBut how do I generate all the divisors of d?\n\nYes. So, the steps are:\n\nIf a == b, then return 0.\n\nElse, compute d = abs(a -b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   compute x = the smallest number >= a such that x is divisible by g. Wait, but why a? Because x is a +k, so x must be >=a (since k >=0). So yes.\n\n   Then compute the other number, which is x + (b -a) if a <b, or x - (a -b) if a >b. But since d = |a -b|, then the other number is x + (b -a) if a <b, else x - (a -b) = x -d. But since d = |a -b|, then in either case, the other number is x ±d. So, the two numbers are x and y = x + delta, where delta is either +d or -d. However, since LCM is symmetric, it doesn't matter. So, the LCM of x and y is same as LCM of x and |x - y|, but in this case, the difference is d.\n\nBut in any case, the LCM is LCM(x, y) = x * y / GCD(x, y). But since y = x ±d, and GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d), as discussed earlier.\n\nBut since g is a divisor of d, and x is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. Wait, no. Because x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g (since g is a divisor of d). So, GCD(x, d) is equal to GCD(x, d). But since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is a multiple of g. But since g is a divisor of d, then GCD(x, d) could be larger than g. For example, if x is a multiple of g and d is a multiple of g, but x and d share a higher common divisor. For example, d=6, g=2, and x=4. Then, GCD(4,6) is 2. But if x=6, then GCD(6,6) is 6. So, the GCD can be larger than g. Therefore, the previous approach of considering all divisors of d and taking x as multiple of g may not capture the maximum possible GCD(x, d). Wait, but since g is a divisor of d, and x is a multiple of g, then the GCD(x, d) is a multiple of g. So, the GCD(x, d) is some multiple of g. But how?\n\nBut in this case, since we are considering all divisors of d, including those larger than g. For example, if g is 2 and d is 6, then the divisors of d are 1, 2, 3, 6. So, when considering g=2, but there's a higher divisor (like 3 or 6), which may give a better GCD.\n\nBut in the previous example where a=2, d=4, and the optimal choice is x=2 (g=2), but if we consider the divisor g=4 (which is a divisor of d=4), then x would be 4, leading to LCM(4, 8) = 8. But for x=2, LCM(2, 6) = 6, which is better. So, in this case, the code would generate all divisors of d (4) which are 1, 2, 4. Then, for each of them, compute x and the LCM.\n\nSo, for g=4, x is 4 (since a=2, which is less than 4. So x is 4. Then LCM(4, 8) is 8.\n\nFor g=2, x is 2 (since a=2 is divisible by 2). Then, LCM(2, 6) is 6. Which is better.\n\nFor g=1, x is 2 (since 2 is divisible by 1). Then, LCM(2,6) is 6. So same as for g=2. So, in this case, the minimal LCM is 6, achieved for g=2 and g=1. But when considering all divisors, the code would generate all possibilities and choose the minimal LCM.\n\nTherefore, the approach must be to generate all divisors of d, compute for each divisor the x and the LCM, and then select the one with the minimal LCM, and among those, the minimal k.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors of d efficiently?\n\nWell, for d up to 1e9, generating all divisors can be done by factorizing d into primes and then generating all combinations. But factorization can be time-consuming for large numbers. However, given that the constraints are up to 1e9, and per test case, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can generate all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d). For each i from 1 to sqrt(d), check if i divides d. If yes, then add i and d/i to the list of divisors. Then, after collecting all divisors, remove duplicates and sort them.\n\nBut for the problem, since the code has to handle multiple test cases (though the input is given as a single line?), but in the example input, there are multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is two integers a and b. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with two integers a and b. The sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just for illustration. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is \"the only line contains two integers a and b\". So, the code should read a single line with two integers, and output the answer for that case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines, but that's probably part of the example. So, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is only one line. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nOutput:\n['2', '9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably part of the example, perhaps in the problem statement, but the actual code needs to read from stdin. So, the code should read a single line of input, containing two integers. So, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says, the input is two integers a and b. So, the code should read a and b from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nSo, back to the problem. The approach is:\n\nFor the given a and b, compute d = |a -b|. If d is zero, return 0. Else, generate all divisors of d. For each divisor g, compute x as the minimal number >= a that is divisible by g. Then compute the LCM of x and (x +d) (or x -d, but since d is the absolute difference, the LCM is same as LCM(x, x +d) or LCM(x, x -d) depending on which is larger). But since LCM is symmetric, it's same as LCM(x, y) where y is x +d or x -d. However, in the case where x is smaller than the other number, the LCM is same as LCM(x, y) = LCM(y, x).\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute x and then compute the LCM. Then, among all these possibilities, choose the one with minimal LCM, and if there are multiple, choose the one with the minimal k.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM for each candidate x?\n\nWell, the LCM of x and (x +d) is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d). But since x +d = x + (b -a) if a <b, which is (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. But the GCD(x, x +d) is GCD(x, d). Which is the same as GCD(x, d). And since x is a multiple of g (which is a divisor of d), then GCD(x, d) is at least g. But perhaps more. For example, if x is a multiple of g and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is a multiple of g. However, since g is a divisor of d, then GCD(x, d) is equal to GCD(x, d) which can be any multiple of g.\n\nBut for the purposes of calculating the LCM, perhaps we can calculate it directly. However, since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then x = g * m, d = g * n. Then, GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, n). So, the LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / (g * GCD(m, n)).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute it directly with math.gcd.\n\nSo, for each candidate x, compute the LCM as (x * (x +d)) // gcd(x, x +d). But since x +d is x +d, which is x + (b -a) if a <b, or x - (a -b) if a >b. However, since d is |a -b|, x +d is x plus the difference. But regardless, the LCM can be computed as LCM(x, y), where y is the other number.\n\nBut how to compute y? Well, if a <b, then y = x +d. If a >b, then y = x -d. But since d is |a -b|, and x is a +k, then:\n\nIf a <b: y = a +k + (b -a) = b +k.\n\nIf a >b: y = a +k - (a -b) = b +k.\n\nSo, in both cases, y = b +k. Therefore, the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is same as LCM(x, y) where x = a +k and y = b +k. But since d = |a -b|, and x and y differ by d, then LCM(x, y) = LCM(x, x +d) if a <b, or LCM(x, x -d) if a >b. But since LCM is symmetric, it's same as LCM(x, y) regardless.\n\nSo, regardless of a and b, the LCM can be computed as LCM(x, x +d) if a <b, but since d is |a -b|, perhaps it's easier to compute y as (a +k) and (b +k) and compute their LCM. However, since x = a +k, and y = b +k, the difference between x and y is d. So, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y). But since x and y differ by d, and we have that gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, d), which is the same as gcd(x, d).\n\nBut for our purposes, perhaps it's easier to compute the LCM as (x * y) // gcd(x, y), where x = a +k and y = b +k. But since x and y are known once we have k, this is straightforward.\n\nBut how to compute x and y for each candidate g?\n\nWell, for each divisor g of d, compute x as the minimal number >= a such that x is divisible by g. Then, y = b + (x - a). Because since x = a +k, then k = x -a. So, y = b +k = b + x -a. But since d = |a -b|, and assuming that a and b are given, then:\n\nIf a <b, then d = b -a. So, y = b + (x -a) = (b -a) +x = x +d.\n\nIf a >b, then d = a -b. So, y = b + (x -a) = x - (a -b) = x -d.\n\nBut again, regardless of that, the LCM can be computed as LCM(x, y) where y is as above.\n\nBut how to compute it in code? Well, in code, once x is determined, then y can be computed as (b + (x -a)), which is the same as (b -a) +x = x + (b -a) if a <b. But since d is |a -b|, and (b -a) is either d or -d. But in code, perhaps it's easier to compute y as (b + (x -a)).\n\nBut in code, given a and b, x is a +k, and k is x -a. So, y is b + (x -a) = (b -a) +x = x + (b -a). Which is x + (b -a) if a <b, but if a >b, then (b -a) is negative, so y is x - (a -b) = x -d. But in code, the LCM can be calculated using the built-in math.gcd function.\n\nSo, in Python, for each x_candidate, compute y_candidate = b + (x_candidate - a). Then compute the LCM as (x_candidate * y_candidate) // gcd(x_candidate, y_candidate).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python 3.9+, math.lcm exists, but perhaps for older versions, it's better to implement it as above.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, generate x_candidate, compute y_candidate, compute LCM, then track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are considered, select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple, select the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nLet me think of a function to generate all divisors of a number d.\n\nFor example, for d=4, the divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nThe approach is to loop from 1 to sqrt(d), check if i divides d. If yes, then add i and d//i to the list. Then, after collecting all, deduplicate and sort.\n\nBut for d=0? Well, in the code, d is |a -b|. So, if a == b, then d=0, and we return 0. So, the code for generating divisors is only called when d>0.\n\nSo, the code for generating divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut then, for each of these divisors, we need to process them. However, the order in which they are processed may affect the selection of the minimal k. So, perhaps we need to process all divisors, compute their corresponding LCM and k, and then select the best.\n\nBut since the number of divisors is small (for d up to 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is around 1000 for numbers like 735134400, but in practice, it's manageable).\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each of them, compute x_candidate and then the LCM.\n\nBut what about when a is larger than b? For example, a=10, b=6. Then d=4. The same approach applies. So, the code can proceed regardless of which is larger.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\ngenerate all divisors of d.\n\nfor each divisor g in divisors:\n\n   compute x_candidate = the minimal x >= a such that x is divisible by g.\n\n   then compute k_candidate = x_candidate - a.\n\n   compute y_candidate = b + k_candidate.\n\n   compute current_lcm = lcm(x_candidate, y_candidate)\n\n   keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k_candidate.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the k with minimal current_lcm, and if tie, minimal k.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if there's a k that is not generated by any of the divisors of d? For example, suppose that the optimal k is such that the GCD(x, d) is not a divisor of d. But that's impossible, since GCD(x, d) divides d. Therefore, all possible maximum GCDs are covered by the divisors of d. Hence, considering all divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nBut why in the earlier example where a=2, d=4, and the optimal x=2 (g=2) is a divisor of d=4. So, it's covered.\n\nSo, the code will find that.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate all the divisors of d, and for each, compute x_candidate.\n\nBut how to compute x_candidate?\n\nAs mentioned earlier:\n\nx_candidate is the smallest number >= a that is divisible by g.\n\nSo, if a % g == 0, then x_candidate = a.\n\nElse, x_candidate = ((a // g) + 1) * g.\n\nBut let's test this formula.\n\nExample 1: a=2, g=2. 2%2=0 → x_candidate=2. Correct.\n\nExample 2: a=3, g=2. 3//2 =1, 1+1=2 → 2 *2=4. Which is >=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, g=4. 5//4 is 1. 1+1=2 → 2*4=8. Which is >=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code for x_candidate:\n\nif a % g == 0:\n\n    x_candidate = a\n\nelse:\n\n    x_candidate = ((a // g) + 1) * g\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\nx_candidate = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\nWhich is a more concise way.\n\nYes. For example:\n\na=3, g=2: (3 +2-1) //2 =4//2=2 → 2*2=4.\n\na=2, g=2: (2 +2-1)//2 =3//2=1 → 1*2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nx_candidate = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n\nOnce x_candidate is computed, then compute y_candidate = b + (x_candidate - a).\n\nThen compute LCM",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. If there are multiple values of $ k $ that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that the LCM of two numbers is minimized when their greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. This leads us to consider the difference $ d = |a - b| $, as the optimal $ k $ will be determined by divisors of this difference.\n2. **Divisors of Difference**: Generate all divisors of $ d $. For each divisor $ g $, compute the smallest $ x \\geq a $ such that $ x $ is a multiple of $ g $. This $ x $ corresponds to $ a + k $, and the corresponding $ k $ is derived from this $ x $.\n3. **Compute LCM**: For each valid $ x $, compute the corresponding $ y $ (which is $ b + k $) and calculate the LCM of $ x $ and $ y $. Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding $ k $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef compute_lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # Compute x_candidate\n        x_candidate = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n        k_candidate = x_candidate - a\n        y_candidate = b + k_candidate\n        current_lcm = compute_lcm(x_candidate, y_candidate)\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers $ a $ and $ b $.\n2. **Immediate Check for Equality**: If $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, the smallest $ k $ is 0 because adding any $ k $ will result in the same value for both numbers.\n3. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $.\n4. **Divisors Generation**: Generate all divisors of $ d $, which helps in determining potential candidates for $ k $.\n5. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor $ g $, compute the smallest $ x \\geq a $ that is a multiple of $ g $. From this $ x $, derive $ k $ and the corresponding $ y $, then compute the LCM of $ x $ and $ y $.\n6. **Optimal Selection**: Track the minimum LCM and the smallest $ k $ that achieves this minimum LCM.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all potential values of $ k $ based on the divisors of the difference between $ a $ and $ b $, leading to an optimal solution.",
