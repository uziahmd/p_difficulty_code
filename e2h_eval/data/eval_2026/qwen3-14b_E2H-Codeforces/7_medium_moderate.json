The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given number n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the structure of the snowflake graph. The problem says:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect it to k new vertices (k>1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n- Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. \n\nSo, the process is like building layers. Let's think about how the number of vertices grows with each step.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For k=4, the smallest snowflake. Let's see:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then connect to 4 new nodes. Now total is 1+4=5. But then, each of the 4 leaves (each connected to only one node) must be connected to 4 new nodes. So each of those 4 nodes adds 4 new nodes. But wait, how many steps are done?\n\nThe problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of the leaves from the first step. So the minimal case would be when we do that once.\n\nLet me calculate the number of vertices for that. Let's take k=4 as an example.\n\nAfter first step: 1 + 4 = 5 nodes. Then, each of the 4 leaves adds 4 new nodes. So the next step adds 4*4 = 16 nodes. Total becomes 5 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, maybe the process is that after the initial step, you have to perform the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when you do that once. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the snowflake structure. The snowflake is built in layers. Let's think recursively. The root has k children. Each of these children is a leaf, so they each get k children. But perhaps the process can be done multiple times. For example, after the first expansion, the leaves (the ones added in the first expansion) are connected to k new nodes. Then, those new nodes are leaves, and perhaps another expansion is done. However, the problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the expansion is done once.\n\nWait, but the example input includes n=13. Let's see. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think of the possible structures. Let's suppose that the snowflake is built with two layers.\n\nFirst, the root has k children. Then, each of those k children has k children. Let's compute the total number of nodes.\n\nOriginal root: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion: add k nodes. Total: 1 + k.\n\nSecond expansion: each of the k nodes from the first expansion adds k nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Total: 1 + k + k^2.\n\nSo for this case, the total is 1 + k + k^2. Let's see if that can be 13.\n\n1 + k + k² = 13 → k² +k -12 = 0. Solving: discriminant is 1 + 48 = 49. k = [-1 ±7]/2. Positive solution is (6)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes, 1+3+9=13. Hence, for n=13, answer is YES. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example: n=6. Let's see. Let's check possible k and steps.\n\nIf the snowflake is built with one expansion step (the initial step plus one expansion). So 1 +k +k² = 6. Let's see: k² +k +1 =6 → k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1 +20=21. Not a square. So no integer k. What about other possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to build the snowflake. Maybe the expansion is done once, but not all layers are filled. Wait, no. The rules say that each time you add new nodes to the leaves. So the expansion steps are done in layers. For example, the initial step is layer 0. Then, after first expansion, the leaves are layer 1. Then, expanding them gives layer 2. But the problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimum is that after the initial step, you do one expansion step. But what if there are more steps?\n\nFor example, maybe the snowflake is built with two expansion steps. Let's think: the initial step (root with k children), then expansion step 1 (each of those k children gets k children), then expansion step 2 (each of those leaves gets k children). So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k² + k³. But that would be for three layers. But how many expansion steps are done? The problem says that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So, for example, the initial step is adding k children. Then, the expansion step is done once (so adding k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 + k + k². If we do expansion step twice, then the total is 1 + k + k² + k³.\n\nBut for the problem, the snowflake can be constructed with any number of expansion steps, as long as there is at least one expansion step. So the total number of nodes can be written as:\n\nn = 1 + k * (k^m - 1)/(k - 1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, let's think again.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root node. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step adds k nodes (the root's children). Then, the second expansion step adds k * k nodes (each of the previous layer's k nodes has k children). Third expansion adds k * k^2 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes after m expansion steps is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1). \n\nWait, but the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥ 1. Because the initial step is the creation of the root, then the first expansion step adds the first layer. So the total is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, but that would mean that the sum is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But for m=1, that gives (k² -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is 1 +k, but according to earlier example, when m=1, the expansion steps have been done once. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is part of the process, and then the expansion steps (adding children to leaves) must be done at least once. So for example, the initial step (adding k children) is the first step, then the expansion steps (adding k children to each leaf) must be done once. So the total would be 1 +k + k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) - (k^2 -1)/(k-1) ? No, perhaps I need to re-express.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * (k^m - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nEach expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step (after the initial step) adds k nodes. The second expansion step adds k^2 nodes. The third adds k^3, etc. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Which is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But m must be at least 1. Because the expansion steps are done at least once.\n\nSo for example, m=1 gives 1 +k. But that's only the initial step and one expansion step? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second expansion step is adding k children to each of the leaves (the k children of the root). So the expansion steps are m steps, which would require that m ≥ 1. So for m=1, the expansion steps have been done once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k (from the initial step) plus k^2 (from the first expansion step)? Or is the initial step considered as the first expansion step?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to model the process more carefully.\n\nThe initial step is: create the root. Then, the first expansion step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second expansion step is adding k children to each of the leaves (which are the children of the root). So each expansion step adds a new layer. The number of expansion steps is m ≥ 1. The total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Because:\n\n- After the initial step (before any expansion steps), there's 1 node.\n\n- After the first expansion step (adding k children to root), there's 1 +k nodes.\n\n- After the second expansion step (adding k children to each of the k leaves), adding k*k nodes. So total is 1 +k +k².\n\n- After third expansion step, adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. So the total is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But since m ≥ 1, then S can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m ≥ 1. But since m can be any integer ≥1, and k ≥2.\n\nBut for the problem, given n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥1 such that n equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but let's check with the sample input.\n\nSample input n=13. Let's see:\n\nWe can have k=3, m=2. Then, (3^{3} -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2=13. Yes. So that works.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. The output is NO. Let's see:\n\nIs there any k and m ≥1 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = 6?\n\nLet's check possible values:\n\nFor m=1: (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So we need k+1 =6 →k=5. Which is allowed (k>1). So that would imply that n=6 can be achieved. But according to the sample input, for n=6, the output is NO. Wait, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input says for n=6, output is NO. But according to this calculation, for m=1 and k=5, the total is 1 +5 =6. Which would be allowed. But why is the sample output NO?\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. But according to the problem statement:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step (adding k children to the root) is part of the construction. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step is required. Then, the expansion step must be done once. So the minimal case is that after adding the initial k children, we do the expansion step once. Which would add k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWait, this contradicts my previous analysis. So perhaps my formula was incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Step 1: Create the root (1 node). Then add k children. Now total is 1 +k. This is the first part.\n\n- Then, step 2: Do the expansion step (each leaf is connected to k new vertices). This step must be done at least once. So after this step, the total is 1 +k + (number of leaves) *k. The number of leaves here is k, because after step 1, the root has k children, each of which is a leaf. So adding k *k nodes. Total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for the snowflake to be valid, the expansion step must be done at least once. Therefore, the total number of nodes must be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1? No, because the expansion steps are done once, but perhaps multiple times. Let me think again.\n\nThe expansion step is: each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So after step 1 (initial step), we perform the expansion step once. Then, after that, we can perform the expansion step again (but it's not required). So the expansion steps can be done once or more times.\n\nSo for example, after the initial step (adding k children), the expansion step is done once (adding k² nodes). Then, the expansion step can be done again, which would add k^3 nodes (since the current leaves are the ones added in the previous expansion step, which are k² in number). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1 (the number of expansion steps). Wait, but the initial step is the first part. The expansion steps are done m times. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k * (k^m -1)/(k-1). Or perhaps:\n\nThe total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because each expansion step adds a new layer. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But for m ≥1.\n\nWait, for m=1, that's 1 +k +k^1? No, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k² nodes. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m}? Or 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} ?\n\nWait, when m is the number of expansion steps. For example:\n\n- Initial step: 1 node.\n\n- After first expansion step (m=1): 1 +k +k^2? No. Let's think again.\n\nThe first expansion step is adding k children to the leaves (which are the k children of the root). So the first expansion step adds k * k =k² nodes. So after the initial step and one expansion step, the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nThen, the second expansion step adds k² *k =k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m} where m is the number of expansion steps. But the number of expansion steps must be ≥1. So m ≥1.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥1, and k ≥2.\n\nBut S can be rewritten as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Because the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). However, in our case, the sum starts from i=0 (which is 1) up to i=m. So the sum is indeed (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But m ≥1.\n\nSo for example, when m=1, the sum is 1 +k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to this, for n=6, we can have k=2, m=2. Let's check:\n\nsum is 1 +2 + 2² = 1+2+4=7. No. What about k=5, m=1: 1+5=6. Which would be allowed. But according to the sample input, n=6 returns NO. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. But the initial step (adding k children) is part of the construction. However, the expansion step is the step of adding k children to each leaf. So, for the case of m=1, the expansion step is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k^2? Or 1 +k?\n\nNo, this is the confusion. Let's re-express:\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step is done once. So the expansion step adds k^2 nodes. Thus, the total is 1 +k +k^2. But for m=1 expansion steps. So the formula S is 1 +k +k^2. Which would be (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. So for m=1, the exponent is m+1=2? No, the formula for sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1). So if the sum is 1 +k +k^2, that is sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i. Which is m=2. So in this case, m is the maximum exponent. So the number of expansion steps is m-1?\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the confusion. Let me re-express:\n\nThe initial step creates the root. Then, the expansion steps are done. Each expansion step adds a new layer.\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\n- Initially, the root is present (1 node). This is the 0th layer.\n\n- Then, the first expansion step (layer 1) adds k nodes. So now, the total is 1 +k.\n\n- Then, the second expansion step (layer 2) adds k *k nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\n- Then, the third expansion step (layer 3) adds k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the number of expansion steps is m. For example, if m=1 expansion steps, then the total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children) is part of the construction. But the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done once. So in this case, the expansion steps are done once. So that would mean that the expansion step is done once, which adds k^2 nodes. Hence, the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut according to this, the number of expansion steps is m, and the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} where m ≥1. Wait, no. Because:\n\nIf the expansion steps are done once, then the total is 1 +k (from initial step) plus k^2 (from expansion step). So 1 +k +k². Which is sum from i=0 to 2 of k^i. So the exponent is m+1 where m is the number of expansion steps. So if there are m expansion steps, the sum is up to k^{m+1} ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to think of the number of expansion steps as being m, leading to a total of m+1 layers. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me go back to the problem statement's example. For the minimal snowflake for k=4, the sample shows that the minimal case is when the expansion step is done once. Let's see what the number of nodes would be. For k=4, the initial step is 1 +4 =5. Then, the expansion step is done once, adding 4 *4 =16 nodes. Total is 5+16=21. But the sample input for n=13 is YES. So how can that be?\n\nAh, because in that case, the expansion steps are done once. Wait, but 1 +k +k^2 for k=3 is 1 +3 +9=13. So that suggests that the expansion steps are done once. Which would mean that the initial step is adding k nodes (the root's children), and then the expansion step adds k^2 nodes (each of those k nodes adding k children). So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which implies that the expansion step is done once. So the number of expansion steps is 1, and the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the formula is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which corresponds to m=2 (the exponent is m+1?), but that's unclear.\n\nBut the key point is that for the snowflake to exist, the number of nodes n must be equal to (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥2. Because:\n\nBecause the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when m=2. Because:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{m} k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So if m is the number of layers (including the root). So for the minimal case (expansion steps done once), the layers are root (layer 0), layer 1 (k nodes), layer 2 (k^2 nodes). So the total is sum from 0 to 2, which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m=2, and the formula is (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) with m ≥2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the expansion steps are done once. So the minimal case is when the number of layers is 2 (root, layer 1, layer 2). So the total is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². Which for k=3 gives 13. Which is the sample input.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that for m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k². Which would correspond to m=2 in the formula. So the formula is (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥2. Because the expansion steps must be done once. So the number of layers is m, where m ≥2. Because the expansion steps are done once. So the formula is:\n\nn = (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥2 and k ≥2.\n\nAh! That's the key. So the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form for some k ≥2 and m ≥2.\n\nSo the initial step (adding k children) is part of the process, and the expansion steps (adding children to each leaf) must be done at least once. Hence, the minimal case is m=2 (so that the expansion steps are done once).\n\nSo for example, for n=6, can we find k≥2 and m≥2 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =6?\n\nLet's try m=2: (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. So k+1=6 →k=5. Which is valid. So n=6 would be YES. But according to the sample input, for n=6, the output is NO. Which contradicts this. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input says that for n=6, the output is NO. Let's look back at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input includes 6 as one of the test cases, and the output is NO. But according to the above reasoning, for m=2 and k=5, n= (5^2 -1)/(5-1) = (25-1)/4=24/4=6. Which would be valid. So why is the sample output NO?\n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in my reasoning. So I must have misunderstood the problem's construction rules.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step is done once. Which means, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. So after the initial step, the leaves are the k children of the root. Each of them is connected to one vertex (the root). So during the expansion step, each of them is connected to k new vertices. So this step adds k *k new vertices. So the total number of vertices is 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1. Which for k=5, m=3? Or m=2?\n\nWait, if m is the exponent in the formula (k^m -1)/(k-1), then for the case of 1 +k +k^2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m=3. But according to the earlier logic, the expansion step is done once, which would correspond to m=3? That seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is (k^m -1)/(k-1) where m is the number of expansion steps plus one. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the example of the minimal snowflake. The expansion steps are done once. The number of layers is 3 (root, layer 1, layer 2). So the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which would be for m=3. But in that case, m ≥3?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when expansion steps are done once. Which leads to the formula (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So for that case, m=3. So the general formula is that n must be equal to (k^m -1)/(k-1) where m ≥3 and k ≥2. But that would mean that for n=6, which is 5+1=6, and m=2, but that would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which would be for m=2. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So what's the relationship between m and the number of expansion steps?\n\nThis is getting very confusing. Let me try to re-express the entire process again.\n\nThe process is:\n\nStart with one node (layer 0).\n\nStep 1: Add k children to the root. Now, layer 1 has k nodes. This is the first step.\n\nStep 2: Do the expansion step. Each leaf (layer 1 nodes) adds k children. This is the first expansion step. Now, layer 2 has k *k nodes.\n\nSo, after this, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². This requires that the expansion step is done once.\n\nSo the expansion step count is 1. So the number of layers is 2 (layers 0, 1, 2). The formula for the total is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m in the formula is 3. So for this case, m=3.\n\nBut if we do another expansion step (second expansion step), then layer 3 has k^3 nodes, and the total is 1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So m=4.\n\nSo the number of expansion steps is m-2, where m is the exponent in the formula. So the formula is (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥3 (since the expansion steps must be done at least once, which corresponds to m=3).\n\nWait, for m=3, the expansion steps are done once. For m=4, expansion steps done twice. So the condition is m ≥3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2 and m ≥3.\n\nAh! This explains the sample input for n=6. Let's see:\n\nIf m=3, then (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =6. So solving k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1 +20=21, which is not a perfect square. So no integer solution. Thus, n=6 cannot be expressed in this form. Hence, the answer is NO, which matches the sample input.\n\nEarlier mistake was thinking that m could be 2. But according to this, m must be ≥3. So the correct condition is that n must be expressible as (k^m -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2 and m ≥3.\n\nSo the problem now is to check for a given n, whether there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nNow, let's re-examine the sample input:\n\nFor n=13, we have m=3, k=3. (3^3-1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. So output is YES.\n\nFor n=6, no solution exists. Output is NO.\n\nNow, the task is to determine for a given n, whether there exists k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form.\n\nNow, how can we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet's think about the possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that (k^m -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}. So for m ≥3, this sum is the sum of m terms.\n\nSo for example, for m=3: sum is 1 +k +k² =n.\n\nFor m=4: 1 +k +k² +k³ =n.\n\nSo for each possible m ≥3, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way to check all possible m and k.\n\nLet's think about the possible values of m. Since for fixed m, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2. So for m=3, the minimal sum is 1+2+4=7. For larger m, the minimal sum increases. For example, m=3: 7, m=4: 1+2+4+8=15, etc.\n\nSo for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). For example, for n=1e18, the maximum m is around 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18. So for each n, we can iterate m from 3 up to log_2(n) (say up to 60), and for each m, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to check for a given m and n, whether there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\nNote that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i = (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation as k^m -1 =n*(k-1).\n\nBut solving this for k seems challenging. However, for a fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nFor example, for a given m, the minimal possible k is 2, and the maximal possible k can be found by considering that the sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{m-1} = 2^m -1. So for a given m, if n < 2^m -1, then no solution for this m. Otherwise, we can perform binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nThe sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} =n. For k ≥2, the sum is increasing with k. So for a fixed m, the maximum possible k is such that the sum is <=n. For example, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. We can find the upper bound for k by noting that for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +2 +4 =7. For a given n, the maximum k for which the sum is ≤n can be approximated as k ≈ n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo for each m, we can binary search for k in the range [2, ... , upper], where upper can be something like n^(1/(m-1)) + 1.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor each m ≥3:\n\n- Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2: s_min = 2^m -1 (since sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 2^i = 2^m -1). If n < s_min, then skip this m.\n\n- Else, perform binary search on k in [2, ... , upper], where upper is such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} upper^i >=n.\n\nBut how to compute upper? Well, for a given m and n, the sum increases with k, so for the upper bound, we can use something like n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. Because for large k, the sum is dominated by k^{m-1}, so k^{m-1} ≈n →k ≈n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nSo for each m, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nOnce we find a k for which the sum equals n, we return YES.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: output NO (since the minimal is 7 for m=3 and k=2).\n\n- Else, iterate m from 3 up to max_m (like 60):\n\n   For each m:\n\n   - Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2: s_min = 2^m -1. If n < s_min, skip.\n\n   - Else, perform binary search on k in [2, ... , upper] to see if there's a k such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i =n.\n\n   - If found, return YES.\n\n- After checking all m, if no such pair (k, m) is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the sum for given k and m, and how to handle large exponents (since n can be up to 1e18, and m can be up to 60, k can be up to 1e18^(1/(m-1))).\n\nBut computing the sum for a given k and m can be done iteratively, and we need to avoid overflow. However, since Python has arbitrary precision integers, we can proceed safely.\n\nBut for binary search, we need to compute the sum and compare it with n. However, for large m and k, the sum can be very large. But since we are doing binary search, we can stop early",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid \"snowflake\" graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single root node and expanding iteratively by adding new vertices to each leaf node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers. Each expansion step adds `k` new vertices to each leaf node. The minimum number of vertices required for a valid snowflake is when there are at least two expansion steps, leading to a structure that can be represented by the formula `(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)` where `k >= 2` and `m >= 3`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of `m` (number of layers) starting from 3 up to a reasonable upper limit (since `k^m` grows exponentially).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each `m`, use binary search to check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series `(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)` equals the given `n`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Use binary search within a feasible range for `k` to avoid unnecessary computations and ensure efficiency even for very large values of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False  # Minimum possible is 7 (k=2, m=3: 1+2+4=7)\n    \n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is ~1e18, and for m=60, even k=2 gives sum 2^60 -1 which is larger than 1e18\n    \n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        # Compute minimal possible sum for k=2\n        min_sum = (2**m - 1)\n        if n < min_sum:\n            continue\n        \n        # Binary search for k in [2, ... , upper]\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        while True:\n            current_sum = 0\n            for i in range(m):\n                current_sum = current_sum * high + 1\n            if current_sum < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        \n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total = 0\n            try:\n                for i in range(m):\n                    total = total * mid + 1\n            except:\n                # In case of overflow, but Python handles big integers\n                pass\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_snowflake Function**: This function checks if a given `n` can be represented as a valid snowflake structure. It iterates over possible values of `m` (layers) starting from 3. For each `m`, it uses binary search to find a suitable `k` such that the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n- **Binary Search**: For each `m`, the binary search efficiently narrows down the possible values of `k` by calculating the sum of the geometric series iteratively.\n- **Efficiency**: The approach ensures that we handle very large values of `n` efficiently by leveraging the exponential growth of the geometric series and limiting the range of `m` to a practical upper bound.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks all possible configurations of the snowflake graph structure to determine if a valid configuration exists for the given number of vertices.",
