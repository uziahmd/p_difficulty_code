The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I need to find out the conditions under which such a graph can exist.\n\nLet me first understand the structure of the snowflake. According to the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. \n\nSo the process is like building layers. Let's think about how the number of vertices grows with each step.\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The first layer is the root (1 node). Then, the first expansion adds k children to the root. Now, each of those k nodes is a leaf. Then, in the next step, each of those leaves gets k new children. So each time, we add more layers. But the process requires that the step of adding new children to leaves is done at least once. So the minimum snowflake would have two layers: the root and the first layer. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding to leaves is done once. So for example, if we do the first expansion (adding k children), then for each of those leaves, we add k children. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k*k. But wait, the problem says that the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two expansions: the initial step (adding k children), then expanding each leaf once. So the minimal n would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1 +4 + 16 = 21? But the example given in the problem says that the minimal for k=4 is shown in the figure. However, the sample input includes n=13 as a possible case. Let's see. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for example, when n=13, the output is YES. So maybe for some k, the total nodes is 13. Let's think. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the snowflake has two layers. The root has k children. Then, the step of adding to leaves is done once. But maybe that's not required. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding to leaves should be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step is adding k children to each leaf. So the minimal case is when the process is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k * k. But maybe there are other possibilities where the expansion is done multiple times. For example, after expanding once, you could expand again. Let's think.\n\nSo the snowflake construction can be thought of as follows: The graph is a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly k children. However, the construction process requires that the initial step (adding k children to the root) is done, and then each leaf (those in the first expansion) must be expanded once. But perhaps the expansion can be done multiple times. So the snowflake is a tree with depth m >= 2, where each node except those in the last layer has exactly k children. But how does the number of nodes look?\n\nLet me model the number of nodes. Let's say that the snowflake is built with m layers. The first layer is the root (depth 0). Then, the second layer (depth 1) has k nodes. The third layer (depth 2) has k * k nodes. The fourth layer (depth 3) has k^3 nodes, etc. But the construction process requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So the minimal number of layers is 2 (the root and the first expansion), but then the expansion step (adding children to leaves) is done once. Wait, maybe the expansion steps are done once. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe rules:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which are the ones connected to only one other vertex) is done at least once. So the process is that after the initial step, we perform this expansion step once or more. \n\nSo the snowflake is a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly k children. The number of layers is m ≥ 2. Because the expansion step is done at least once. So for example, if m=2, then the total nodes are 1 + k + k^2? No, wait. Wait, the initial step adds k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once. That expansion step adds k * k nodes. So total is 1 + k + k^2. For m=2, the depth is 2. But for m=3, the expansion step is done twice. So after the initial step, the expansion step is done once (adding k^2 nodes), then again (adding k^3 nodes). So total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But the expansion step is done once? Or how many times?\n\nWait, the expansion step is: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo after the initial step (the root has k children), the leaves are the k children. Then, the expansion step is done once, which adds k children to each of those leaves. So after that, the leaves are the new nodes. Then, if we do another expansion step, we add k children to each of those leaves. So the expansion steps can be done multiple times. So the total number of nodes depends on the number of expansion steps. \n\nSo the snowflake can be represented as a tree with depth d ≥ 2. The root has k children. Each of those children has k children. Each of those has k children, etc., up to depth d. The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i. Wait, no. Because the sum from i=0 to d of k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But the initial step is adding k children (so depth 1). Then, expansion steps are done once (depth 2), etc. So for example, if the expansion is done once, the depth is 2, and the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. If expansion is done twice, then depth is 3, and nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the snowflake can be of any depth ≥ 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Wait, but the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But the problem says that the expansion step is done at least once. Which would imply that m is at least 2. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), and then expansion steps add layers. So the sum for m layers (depth m) is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But how does this relate to the expansion steps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is built in such a way that after the initial step (adding k children to root), there are multiple expansion steps. Each expansion step adds a new layer. So the number of layers is at least 2. So the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{t-1}) ), where t is the number of expansion steps. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the process step by step.\n\nInitial step: 1 node (root).\n\nStep 1: add k children to root. Now, the total nodes is 1 + k. These k nodes are leaves. \n\nThen, the expansion step is done once: for each leaf (current leaves), add k children. So each of the k leaves gets k children, adding k * k nodes. Now, the total is 1 + k + k^2. The leaves are now the k^2 nodes. \n\nIf we perform another expansion step, each of these leaves (k^2 nodes) gets k children, adding k^3 nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since expansion steps are done at least once). Wait, because the expansion steps are done once. So for m being the number of layers after the initial step. Let me clarify:\n\nThe initial step creates a layer of depth 1 (k nodes). The first expansion step adds a layer of depth 2 (k^2 nodes). The second expansion step adds a layer of depth 3 (k^3 nodes). So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the depth. Since the expansion steps are done at least once, the depth is at least 2. Therefore, the sum would be from i=0 to m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. So for example, if m=2, then sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which corresponds to the initial step (adding k nodes) and one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes). So the expansion steps are done once. \n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step should be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because m is the maximum depth. For example, if m=2, then the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the initial step (adding k) and one expansion step (adding k^2). So the expansion steps are done once. So for the snowflake, the number of nodes can be written as S = (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1), where m ≥ 1 (since the expansion steps are done once). Wait, no. Because when m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the number of expansion steps as t. The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, t expansion steps are done, each adding a new layer. Each expansion step adds k^i nodes, where i is the current level. For example, t=1: sum is 1 + k + k^2. t=2: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*( (k^t -1)/(k-1) ) ). Because the initial step adds k, and each expansion adds k multiplied by previous layers. Wait, perhaps the formula is sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i, where t is the number of expansion steps. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the snowflake as a tree with depth d ≥ 2. The root has depth 0. Then, the depth of the tree is d. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i. Because for each level i (from 0 to d), there are k^i nodes. For example, depth 0: 1 node. Depth 1: k nodes. Depth 2: k^2 nodes. So sum is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). And since the expansion steps must be done at least once, the depth is at least 2. So d ≥ 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is S = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2 and d ≥ 2. \n\nWait, but for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case where the expansion steps are done once. Because the initial step (adding k children) and then one expansion step (adding k^2 children). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥ 2 and d ≥ 2. Additionally, since the problem allows for different numbers of expansion steps (so varying d), we need to check all possible k and d that satisfy this equation.\n\nBut how do we check this for a given n?\n\nThe approach is: For each test case n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut n can be up to 1e18. How can we check this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible d ≥ 2, we can try to find a k ≥ 2 such that the equation holds. Since for each d, the possible values of k are limited, perhaps we can iterate over possible d values and for each, compute possible k.\n\nBut what are the possible values of d? Let's think. For a given n, the maximum possible d is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the minimal value for a given d is (2^{d+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{d+1} -1. So for example, if n is 1e18, then 2^{d+1} -1 ≤ 1e18 → d+1 ≤ log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So d can be up to around 60. So for each n, we can check all possible d from 2 up to log2(n) + something. Since log2(1e18) is about 60, for each n, we can check d up to 60. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n:\n\nCheck if n is 1 → NO (since the minimal is 1 +k +k^2, which for k=2, d=2 gives 1+2+4=7. So n=1 is not possible. Also, according to the sample input, n=1 outputs NO.)\n\nFor each possible d ≥2 (up to say 60), check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nHow to check for each d?\n\nFor a fixed d, the equation becomes:\n\nsum_{i=0}^d k^i = n.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nk^{d+1} -1 = (k-1)*n → k^{d+1} - (k-1)*n -1 =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is challenging. However, for fixed d, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for a fixed d, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^d k^i is strictly increasing in k. So for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nWhat's the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nWell, for the sum to be equal to n, since sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d = n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least 1 +k (since d≥2). So for k ≥2, sum is ≥ 1 +2 + 2^2 = 7. So for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that k^d ≤ n. Because sum_{i=0}^d k^i ≥k^d. So k^d ≤n → k ≤n^(1/d). So for each d, the upper bound for k can be n^(1/d). Since n can be up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, for each d, the upper bound for k is about 1e18^(1/2) = 3e9 for d=2, but that's too big for binary search. However, for higher d, the upper bound is smaller. For example, for d=60, the upper bound is n^(1/60) which is about 1e18^(1/60) = e^( (ln(1e18))/60 ) ≈ e^( (41.5)/60 ) ≈ e^0.69 ≈ 2. So for d≥60, the upper bound is small. \n\nBut even for d=2, the upper bound is sqrt(n), which for n=1e18 is 1e9, which is way too big for binary search. However, considering that for each d, the maximum possible d is around 60, and for each d, we can perform a binary search on k. But for d=2, binary search from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps. For 60 d's, that's 60*30 = 1800 steps per test case. Since t is up to 1e4, that's 1.8e7 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and d? For large exponents, this could be a problem. For example, when d is 60 and k is 2, the sum is 2^61-1, which is about 2e18. So for n up to 1e18, we need to compute the sum accurately. But with Python's arbitrary precision integers, this is manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan for each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nFor each d from 2 up to max_d (like 60):\n\n   Compute the minimal and maximal possible k for this d.\n\n   Perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i == n.\n\n   If found, return YES.\n\nIf none of the d's found a k, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k for each d?\n\nWe can compute the upper bound as the integer part of n^(1/d) + 1. Because for k^d <= n, so k <= n^(1/d). However, since the sum is larger than k^d, but for the purpose of upper bound, we can use n^(1/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute n^(1/d) in Python? We can use binary search again, but perhaps for our purposes, we can just use a rough upper bound. For example, since for k >=2 and d >=2, the sum is at least 1 +k +k^2. For k >=2, the sum is at least 1 +2 +4 =7. So for n <7, we can immediately return NO. But in the code, we can handle that.\n\nBut for the binary search for k for each d, we can set the low to 2 and high to some value. For example, since sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. Since k^{d+1} is larger than (k-1)*n, then k^{d+1} > (k-1)*n. But for k >=2, (k-1) is at least 1, so k^{d+1} > n. Therefore, k^{d+1} >n → k > n^(1/(d+1)). So for the upper bound, we can set high to n^(1/(d+1)) + 1. But perhaps even better, we can use high = n. Because for k= n, sum_{i=0}^d k^i is way bigger than n. But for binary search, perhaps we can use high = 2, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, for each d, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d =n. Since the sum is increasing with k, we can find the upper bound for k by finding the maximum k where 1 +k + ... +k^d <=n. But for binary search, perhaps we can start with high = 2, and double until the sum exceeds n. Then use that as the upper bound. But for code efficiency, perhaps it's better to use a binary search with high as n^(1/d) + 1. However, for code simplicity, perhaps we can use a binary search between low=2 and high= some value, like 2e5 or something. But for n up to 1e18 and d up to 60, the maximum possible k for a given d is when d is small. For example, for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. So solving k^2 +k +1 =n. The maximum possible k is sqrt(n). So for n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. So binary search from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps. For each d, that's manageable.\n\nSo here's the code approach:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO (since the minimal possible is 7 when k=2, d=2)\n\nelse:\n\nfor d in 2 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound] to check if sum_{i=0}^d k^i ==n.\n\n   if found, return YES.\n\nif after all d's no solution found, return NO.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum for a given k and d? For example, for k=2 and d=2, sum is 1 + 2 + 4 =7.\n\nBut for large d and k, the sum can be very big. However, since we are comparing with n (up to 1e18), we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(d+1):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1  # overflow\n\n    return total\n\nBut exponentiating k^i for large exponents can be slow. Alternatively, we can compute the sum iteratively, adding k^i each time. But even better, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). However, for large exponents, computing k^{d+1} can be expensive. But for k up to 1e9 and d up to 60, k^{d+1} would be 1e9^61, which is way larger than 1e18. So perhaps for the purposes of checking, it's better to compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the incremental approach is better. Let's think:\n\nFor a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d. To compute this, we can do:\n\ns = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to d:\n\n   s += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k\n\n   if s > n:\n\n       break\n\nreturn s\n\nBut this is O(d) per check. For d up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nSo during the binary search for a particular d, for a given k, we can compute the sum and compare to n.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to find if there's a k such that the sum equals n. So for each d, binary search k between 2 and upper_bound, and check if the sum is equal to n.\n\nBut what's the upper_bound for k? Well, for the sum to be equal to n, the sum is at least k^d (since 1 +k + ... +k^d ≥k^d). So k^d ≤n → k ≤n^(1/d). So for upper_bound, we can compute it as n^(1/d) + 1. But how to compute this in Python? For example, using math.pow(n, 1/d) but that may not be precise. Alternatively, we can use binary search to find the upper bound. However, for code simplicity, perhaps we can use a high value of 2e5 or something. Wait, no. For example, when d=2 and n=1e18, the upper bound is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So for binary search, we can set high to 2e9, but that's a lot. However, even with that, binary search would take about 30 steps for each d. Which is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k for each d? Well, since for the sum to be equal to n, the sum is at least k^d. So k^d ≤n → k ≤ n^(1/d). So for the upper bound, we can set high to be n^(1/d) + 1. But how to calculate that in Python? For example, for integer n and d, perhaps using binary search to find the maximum k where k^d ≤n. But that's again a binary search. Alternatively, we can use the math.pow function and take the ceiling.\n\nBut in Python, for big numbers, using pow(n, 1/d) could be inaccurate due to floating point precision. So perhaps for the upper bound, we can use a binary search approach. However, for the sake of code efficiency, perhaps we can just use a high value of 2, and double it until the sum exceeds n. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach for finding the upper bound for k for a given d:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have high such that compute_sum(high, d) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut this approach would work. For example, for a given d, we can find the upper bound for k by doubling until the sum exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\nThis way, we avoid dealing with floating point inaccuracies. However, for cases where the sum for high is already larger than n, but the actual k is somewhere in between.\n\nSo combining all this, here's the plan for each d:\n\nFor a given d, find the possible k:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce this loop ends, we have high such that compute_sum(high, d) >=n. Now perform binary search between low and high to find a k where compute_sum(k, d) ==n.\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, d)? As discussed earlier, compute it incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nBut during the binary search steps, for a given mid, compute_sum(mid, d) could be:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large d and k, this could take O(d) steps. However, since d is up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nOnce we have this function, the binary search can proceed.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each test case:\n\nif n is 1 → no.\n\nelse:\n\nfor d in 2 to 60:\n\n   find if there exists a k ≥2 such that compute_sum(k, d) ==n.\n\n   if yes, return yes.\n\nif none found, return no.\n\nNow, what about the cases where the snowflake can be constructed with different d and k?\n\nFor example, n=7 is 1+2+4=7, which is d=2, k=2. So returns yes.\n\nSimilarly, n=13. Let's see: For d=2, 1 +k +k^2 =13 → k^2 +k -12=0 → k=(-1 ± sqrt(1+48))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So 1+3+9=13. So yes. Hence sample input n=13 returns yes.\n\nAnother example, n=15. Let's see:\n\nCheck for d=2: 1 +k +k^2 =15 → k^2 +k -14=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(1+56))/2 → sqrt(57) is ~7.5 → ( -1 +7.5 ) /2 ~ 3.25. Not integer. So no solution for d=2.\n\nCheck for d=3: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =15. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So for d=3, k=2. So returns yes. Hence sample input n=15 is yes.\n\nSo the code needs to check for all possible d's.\n\nNow, what about the case where n can be represented in multiple ways? For example, n=31 can be 1+2+4+8+16=31 (d=4, k=2). Or perhaps another combination. But the code would find it.\n\nNow, considering the constraints for the code:\n\nImplementing this approach in Python, handling large exponents, and for each test case, looping through d up to 60.\n\nBut what about the maximum d? For example, when d is such that for k=2, the sum is 2^{d+1} -1. For n=1e18, 2^{d+1} -1 <=1e18 → d+1 <= log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So d can be up to 59. So setting max_d to 60 is sufficient.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n in test cases:\n\nif n is 1 → print 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for d in 2 to 60:\n\n      perform the steps to check for possible k in this d.\n\n      if found, set flag to True and break.\n\n   if flag → print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nImplementing the check for each d:\n\ndef check(n, d):\n\n   # find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i =n\n\n   # find upper bound for k:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   while compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n   left = 2\n\n   right = high\n\n   while left <= right:\n\n       mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n       s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n       if s == n:\n\n           return True\n\n       elif s <n:\n\n           left = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           right = mid -1\n\n   return False\n\nBut compute_sum needs to return the sum, or -1 if it exceeds n.\n\nWait, but in the code above, compute_sum returns -1 if during the calculation the sum exceeds n. So during the binary search, if s is -1, then the actual sum is larger than n. So in that case, we need to adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nWait, the compute_sum function returns:\n\nif during the computation, the sum exceeds n, returns -1.\n\nElse returns the sum.\n\nSo during the binary search steps, for mid:\n\ns = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\nif s ==n → return True.\n\nelif s <n → need to increase k → move left to mid+1.\n\nelif s >n → need to decrease k → move right to mid-1.\n\nBut how to handle when compute_sum returns -1? Because that means that the sum exceeds n. So for example, if compute_sum returns -1, then the actual sum is greater than n. So in that case, the current mid is too big. So we need to move right to mid-1.\n\nSo in the code, during the binary search, when compute_sum returns -1, it's equivalent to s>n. So in the code:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nSo during the binary search:\n\ns = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\nif s == -1 → sum is larger than n → need to decrease mid.\n\nif s ==n → found.\n\nif s <n → need to increase mid.\n\nSo the code for the binary search part would be:\n\nleft = 2\n\nright = high\n\nwhile left <= right:\n\n    mid = (left + right) //2\n\n    s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n    if s == -1:\n\n        # sum is larger than n → need to decrease mid\n\n        right = mid -1\n\n    elif s ==n:\n\n        return True\n\n    else: # s <n\n\n        left = mid +1\n\nSo after this, if no k found, return False.\n\nBut also, during the initial phase of finding the upper bound for high, the code may have to check compute_sum(high, d, n) <n. However, if compute_sum returns -1, then that means that even the sum is larger than n. So during the loop for expanding high, we need to check if compute_sum(high, d, n) <n. However, if compute_sum returns -1, then the sum is larger than n, so the loop condition is not met. So the code for expanding high would be:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n    if s == -1:\n\n        # sum is larger than n → break\n\n        break\n\n    elif s <n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    else:\n\n        # s ==n → found, return True?\n\n        # but in this case, the code would have already returned True in the binary search part.\n\n        # but during the initial expansion of high, perhaps this can be handled.\n\n        break\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion of high is to find a high such that compute_sum(high, d, n) >=n. So during the loop, we keep doubling high until compute_sum(high, d, n) is >=n.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because compute_sum(high, d, n) can return -1 (meaning sum exceeds n) or returns a value less than n.\n\nSo:\n\nInitially, high is 2.\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nBut compute_sum returns -1 when sum exceeds n. So in that case, compute_sum(high, d, n) <n is False. So the loop stops.\n\nWait, no. Because compute_sum returns -1 when the sum exceeds n. So in the code:\n\nif compute_sum(high, d, n) <n → which would be True if the sum is less than n. But if compute_sum returns -1, then it's not less than n. So the loop condition is:\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) <n:\n\nBut how to handle when compute_sum returns -1? Because in that case, the sum is larger than n, so compute_sum(high, d, n) is not less than n. So the loop will stop.\n\nSo the code for expanding high:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n    if s == -1:\n\n        break\n\n    elif s <n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut this is not a loop with a clear exit condition. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) <n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(high, d, n) <n?\n\nBecause compute_sum returns either -1 (sum exceeds n), or the actual sum (which is <=n). So in code:\n\ns = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\nif s == -1 → sum exceeds n → not less than n → loop stops.\n\nelse if s <n → loop continues.\n\nSo the code for expanding high is:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n    if s == -1:\n\n        break\n\n    elif s <n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut how to implement this in code? Well, in Python, it's possible to write:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile True:\n\n    s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n    if s == -1:\n\n        break\n\n    if s < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nOnce this loop exits, high is such that compute_sum(high, d, n) is either -1 (sum exceeds n) or equal to n (but",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding iteratively. The challenge is to check for each given number of vertices `n` whether such a graph can exist.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph is structured as a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly `k` children. The total number of vertices for such a structure can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ \\text{sum} = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d $, where `d` is the depth of the tree (at least 2).\n\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible depth `d` (from 2 up to a reasonable maximum, say 60), check if there exists an integer `k` (≥ 2) such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Check**: For each depth `d`, use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the series equals `n`. This involves calculating the sum incrementally and adjusting the search range based on comparisons with `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1  # k^0\n    for _ in range(d + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return -1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check(n, max_d):\n    for d in range(2, max_d + 1):\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n            if s == -1:\n                break\n            if s < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now perform binary search between 2 and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == -1:\n                right = mid - 1\n            elif s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            else:  # s < n\n                left = mid + 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    max_d = 60\n    results = []\n    for n in cases:\n        if n == 1:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if check(n, max_d):\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for a given `k` and depth `d`, stopping early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n- **check Function**: For each possible depth `d`, this function determines if there exists a valid `k` using binary search. It first expands the upper bound for `k` by doubling until the sum exceeds `n`, then performs binary search within this range.\n- **main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and uses the `check` function to determine if a valid snowflake graph can be constructed for each `n`, outputting \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all feasible configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring it handles large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ effectively.",
