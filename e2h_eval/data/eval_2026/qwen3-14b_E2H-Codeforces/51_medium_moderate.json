Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), the combined letters should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile), considering the count of each letter. If there are any extra letters in the pile or missing ones, we have to output \"NO\".\n\nSo, the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two strings has the same character counts as the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Let's think. For example, take the first sample input:\n\nGuest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, but maybe the order doesn't matter. So, the counts of each character in the combined guest+host must equal the counts in the pile.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string and the third line have the same frequency of each character.\n4. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to check the frequencies?\n\nIn Python, one way is to use the collections.Counter class. Because Counter will count the occurrences of each character. So, if we create a Counter for the combined guest+host string, and a Counter for the pile string, then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So, if both have the same counts for all characters, then they are considered equal.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile): print YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. Because, if the counts are same, the lengths must be same. But checking Counter would automatically take care of that. Because, if the counts are same, then the total number of characters must be same. So, for example, if the combined string is length 10, and the pile is length 11, then the Counters would not be equal.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, read the three lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is three lines. So, in Python, perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the first example's input is:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS\nSecond line: DEDMOROZ\nThird line: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let me count the letters.\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check if the counts are same.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle that.\n\nBut let me think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if the combined string and the pile have the same length but different characters? Like, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"AA\", then Counter would have A:2, but combined is A:1, B:1. So the code would return no.\n\nAnother case: empty strings? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So no problem.\n\nAnother possible case: uppercase letters. But the problem says that all lines contain only uppercase letters, so no issues with case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the sample input given in the problem?\n\nLet me check the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\nWait, the first input line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's count letters.\n\nLet me count letters in combined:\n\nS: let's see:\n\nSANTACLAUS → S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S → S appears 2 times?\n\nWait, SANTACLAUS is spelled as S A N T A C L A U S → yes, S is first and last letters. So two S's.\n\nDEDMOROZ → D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z → D appears twice, E once, M once, O twice, R once, Z once.\n\nSo combined letters:\n\nLetters from guest and host:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS → letters:\n\nS: 2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nHost: DEDMOROZ → D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nA:3, C:1, L:1, N:1, S:2, T:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nNow the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile.\n\nLet me write it out: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nS: 2 (start and end)\nA: let's count: positions 2, 5, 15 → 3 times?\nWait let me count each letter:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nLetters:\n\nS: 2 (first and last)\nA: 3 (positions 2, 5, 15)\nN: 1\nT: 1\nM: 1\nO: 2 (positions 7 and 8)\nR: 1\nZ: 1\nD: 2 (positions 11 and 12)\nE: 1\nC: 1\nL: 1\nU: 1.\n\nSo the counts are same as the combined guest+host. So the code would return YES.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nSecond input: guest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nPile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me check the counts.\n\nCombined: guest is PAPAINOEL → letters:\n\nP: 2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3? Wait guest has P:2 (PAPAINOEL: first two letters are P and A, then another P?), let me recount:\n\nPAPAINOEL → letters:\n\nP, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → P appears 2 times? Wait, P is first, then third letter. So yes, 2 P's. Host is JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So P appears once here. So combined P is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBut the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile. Let's see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's break down:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nLet me count each character:\n\nJ: 1\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9)\nU: 3 (positions 3, 14, 16)\nL: 3 (positions 4, 11, 13)\nN: 1\nA: 2 (positions 6 and 8)\nP: 2 (positions 7 and 15)\nI: 2 (positions 10 and 19)\nE: 1\nK: 2 (positions 17 and 18).\n\nNow, the combined guest+host:\n\nguest (PAPAINOEL) has:\n\nP:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nhost (JOULUPUKKI) has:\n\nJ:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3\nA: 2\nI: 1+1=2\nN:1\nO:1+1=2\nE:1\nL:1+1=2\nJ:1\nU:3\nK:2\nSo the combined counts are:\n\nP:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2.\n\nBut in the pile, the counts are:\n\nJ:1 (correct), O:2 (correct?), U:3 (correct?), L:3 (but combined has L:2?), etc.\n\nWait, in the combined, L is 1 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 2. But in the pile, L is 3. So that's an extra L. Hence, the code would return NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO for that case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother sample input is the third case: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me check the counts. But perhaps the code would catch that.\n\nBut according to the note, the pile has an extra L. So the code would compare the counts and find that the pile has more Ls than the combined.\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut I need to read three lines. However, in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of three lines. But in actual input, the user will input three lines. For example, in the first sample input, the three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, the code would read them as guest, host, pile.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably for the test cases. The actual input is three lines.\n\nSo the code needs to read three lines from standard input.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading lines, there might be trailing newlines or empty lines. But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty and consist of uppercase letters. So the .strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but since the input lines are supposed to be only uppercase letters, perhaps using .strip() is safe. However, perhaps the problem expects that the input lines are read as-is, but the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So perhaps using input().strip() is okay.\n\nBut in some cases, maybe the input lines have leading or trailing spaces? No, according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of only uppercase letters. So the .strip() is redundant, but perhaps better to use it to avoid any possible issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using input().strip() is better to remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but the problem says that the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So perhaps the input is properly formatted. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes trailing newlines can be present, but the problem says that each line is not empty. So, perhaps using input().strip() is better.\n\nBut for example, if the input is given as:\n\nABC\\nDEF\\nGHI\n\nThen, using input().strip() would read each line correctly.\n\nSo, the code would work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut that's probably a list of three test cases. So for each test case, the code would read three lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So the code is written for one test case. The sample shows three test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So the code reads three lines, processes them, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when the combined string is empty? But the problem says that all lines are non-empty. So the combined string can't be empty. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: when the pile has exactly the same letters as the combined string. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"BA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABX\" → NO.\n\nSo the code handles all these.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict, and comparing two Counters with == checks if all counts are equal. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in Python, we need to import Counter from collections.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading from stdin, there might be issues with trailing newlines. For example, if the user inputs the three lines with some trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThe code would read them as guest, host, pile.\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ, pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nCounter(combined) equals Counter(pile) → YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nThe Counter for combined is:\n\nP: 3 (guest has 2, host has 1), A: 2 (guest has 2, host has 0?), etc. Let me recheck:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → letters P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts:\n\nP:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts:\n\nJ:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3, A:2, I:1+1=2, N:1, O:1+1=2, E:1, L:1+1=2, J:1, U:3, K:2.\n\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters:\n\nLet me write the pile as JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ:1, O:2 (positions 2 and 9?), U:3 (positions 3, 14, 16?), L:3 (positions 4, 11, 13?), N:1, A:2 (positions 6 and 8?), P:2 (positions 7 and 15?), I:2 (positions 10 and 19?), E:1, K:2 (positions 17 and 18?), and others?\n\nSo the counts for pile:\n\nJ:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2.\n\nComparing to combined counts:\n\nIn combined, L is 2, but in pile it's 3. So Counter would differ. Hence, returns NO.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: third sample input.\n\nguest: BABBONATALE → letters B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E → counts:\n\nB:3, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1.\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → counts:\n\nF:1, A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nB:3, A:3+2=5, O:1, N:1, T:2, L:1, E:1+1=2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nPile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile.\n\nBut according to the note, there's an extra L. Let's see.\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nB, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count each letter.\n\nBut regardless, the code would compare the counts.\n\nIn the combined, the count of L is 1 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 1. But in the pile, there are two L's (from the 'LL' in BONATALLE...). So the code would detect that and return NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Concatenation**: Combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: Check if the character counts of the combined string and the pile are identical. If they are, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure we capture each line correctly, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to represent all characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Character Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. This allows us to efficiently compare the character distributions.\n- **Comparison**: By comparing the two counters, we determine if the pile contains exactly the same characters in the same quantities as the combined names. If they match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the correct character distribution using Python's built-in data structures, leading to a clear and concise solution.",
