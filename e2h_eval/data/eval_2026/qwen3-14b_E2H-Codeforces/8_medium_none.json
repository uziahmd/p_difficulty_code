Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's like a conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph must not have cycles. Oh right, so the resulting directed graph should be acyclic.\n\nWait, how do we approach this? Let's think about the maximum flow. Since the problem says that the given ci values are the flow volumes, and we need to direct them correctly. But the problem says that the given graph is connected, and a solution exists.\n\nSo the main idea is to find a way to direct the edges such that all flow conservation laws are met, and the graph is acyclic. Also, the source has no incoming edges.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For any vertex v (not 1 or n), the total incoming flow equals outgoing. Which implies that for each such vertex, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even? No, wait. Because each edge contributes to either incoming or outgoing. But for the vertex, the total incoming equals total outgoing. Therefore, the sum of all flows on edges incident to it must be even? Because incoming + outgoing = 2*incoming (since they are equal). Wait, no. The sum of all flows for the edges incident to v is equal to incoming + outgoing. But since incoming equals outgoing, that sum is 2 * incoming. Therefore, the sum must be even. However, in the problem statement, the input gives us the ci values, which are already the flow amounts. So for each vertex (except 1 and n), the sum of ci of edges incident to it must be even. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so that must be the case.\n\nBut how does that help us here?\n\nThe problem requires us to assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic. Also, the source can't have incoming edges.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the directed graph. Since it's acyclic, there must be a topological order. So perhaps we can arrange the vertices in a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each edge, the direction is determined by the order of the vertices in the topological sort. For example, if u comes before v in the topological order, then the edge is directed from u to v. But how do we ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the source having no incoming edges, and the sink having no outgoing edges. But how do we assign the directions?\n\nAnother thought: Since the flow is a maximum flow, the flow must satisfy that the source's outgoing flow equals the sink's incoming flow. Also, for all other nodes, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree and out-degree such that the sum of the flows in equals the sum of flows out. \n\nBut how to construct such a DAG?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node except the source and sink, the net flow (inflow - outflow) must be zero. For the source, the net flow is the total outflow minus inflow (but since there are no incoming edges, it's just the total outflow). Similarly for the sink, the net flow is the inflow minus outflow (but since the sink can have outgoing edges, but in a max flow, the sink's outflow is zero? Not sure.)\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is to assign directions such that for each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it.\n\nBut how do we do that?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of constructing a DAG. Since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Suppose we have a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the earlier node in the order to the later one. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nBut the flow conservation depends on the direction of edges. So perhaps the topological order is chosen such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going out of it equals the sum of flows on edges going into it. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree. Like, for example, in a tree structure, each node except the root has exactly one parent. But the graph here is not necessarily a tree.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where the direction of edges is determined by some kind of flow balance. For instance, for each node, we can compute the required net outflow. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero. Then, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that the net outflow for each node matches these values.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, the net outflow for a node is the sum of the flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards it. For the source, this is the total flow (since all edges from the source are outgoing, and none are incoming). For the sink, this is negative of the total flow (since all edges to the sink are incoming, and none outgoing). For others, it's zero.\n\nBut how do we determine the direction of edges to achieve this?\n\nThis seems similar to an Euler tour problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node's net outflow is fixed. Then, the problem becomes equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow per node is as required.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think of the net outflow for each node. For node 1, the net outflow is the total flow value. For node n, the net outflow is -total_flow. For others, it's zero. Wait, but what is the total flow? It's the sum of all flows from the source. But since the graph is connected and the problem states that the given ci's form a valid maximum flow, perhaps the total flow is the sum of flows on edges incident to the source (directed away from it). But how do we know that?\n\nAlternatively, the total flow is the sum of all flows leaving the source. Since the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes, and the flow is maximum. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (which are directed away from it) must be equal to the maximum flow. But how do we compute that?\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to compute the actual flow value. Instead, for each node, we can calculate the required net outflow. For node 1, the required net outflow is the sum of all flows on edges incident to it (since all edges are directed away from it). Wait, no. Because the net outflow is (sum of flows on outgoing edges) - (sum of flows on incoming edges). But for node 1, since there are no incoming edges, the net outflow is the sum of flows on outgoing edges. For node n, the net outflow is (sum of outgoing flows) - (sum of incoming flows). But in a maximum flow, the net outflow of the source is the total flow, and the net inflow of the sink is the same. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how can we find the required net outflow for each node? Well, for each node, the net outflow can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor node v (other than 1 and n), the net outflow must be zero. For node 1, it must be equal to the total flow, and for node n, it must be -total_flow. But how do we find the total flow? Well, the total flow is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But since the source's edges can be directed either way, but the problem says that the source has no incoming edges, so all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Wait, that's a key point! The source (vertex 1) cannot have any incoming edges. Therefore, all edges connected to vertex 1 must be directed away from it. So for each edge connecting vertex 1 to another node, the direction is from 1 to that node. Therefore, the net outflow of the source is the sum of all ci's on edges connected to it. Similarly, the sink (vertex n) can have edges directed towards it or away from it. But for the sink, the net inflow must be equal to the total flow. Wait, but how do we ensure that?\n\nBut regardless, perhaps the key is to model the problem as follows. We need to assign directions to edges such that:\n\n- For each node v != 1 and v != n, the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\n- For node 1, all edges are directed away from it.\n\n- The directed graph has no cycles.\n\nSo, considering that the source has all edges directed away from it, perhaps we can build a DAG where the source is at the top, and the sink is at the bottom. Then, the rest of the nodes are arranged in a way that allows the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model it as a directed acyclic graph where each node (except the source and sink) has in-degree and out-degree such that the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges. \n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Once we have that, we can process the nodes in topological order and assign directions accordingly. But how to determine the topological order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each edge is directed from a node with lower potential to higher potential. So, for example, assign a potential to each node such that for every edge, the direction is from the node with lower potential to higher. Then, the graph is acyclic. But how to assign potentials such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let's denote the potential of node v as p[v]. For each edge between u and v, if p[u] < p[v], then the direction is u→v, contributing to outflow of u and inflow of v. If p[u] > p[v], then direction is v→u, contributing to outflow of v and inflow of u. If p[u] = p[v], then the direction could be arbitrary, but that would create a cycle if there's a path between them. So, to avoid cycles, all potentials must be unique and ordered in a way that allows topological sorting.\n\nSo, perhaps we can assign potentials such that for each node, the difference between the sum of flows on edges directed out of it and the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the required net outflow. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the net outflow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. For the source, this is the sum of flows on edges connected to it (since all are outgoing). For the sink, it's the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows directed towards it, which must be equal to -total_flow (since the sink's inflow is total_flow). For other nodes, this must be zero.\n\nBut how to model this with potentials? Let me think. For each edge between u and v, if u has a lower potential than v, then the edge is directed from u to v. This contributes +ci to u's outflow and +ci to v's inflow. Conversely, if v has a lower potential, then the edge contributes +ci to v's outflow and +ci to u's inflow. \n\nSo, the net outflow for node v is the sum over all edges where v is the lower potential end (so the edge is directed away from v) of ci, minus the sum over edges where v is the higher potential end (so the edge is directed towards v) of ci. \n\nSo, for each node v, the net outflow is (sum_{edges where p[v] < p[u]} ci) - (sum_{edges where p[v] > p[u]} ci). \n\nWe need this to be equal to the required net outflow for each node. For the source, this is the sum of all its edges' ci (since all edges are directed away from it). For the sink, this is -total_flow. For others, it's zero.\n\nBut how to find such potentials? It seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is fixed. Then, the problem is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is as required. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations. For each node v, the net outflow is equal to the required value. Let me denote the required net outflow for node v as d[v].\n\nFor example, d[1] = total_flow, d[n] = -total_flow, and for others, d[v] = 0.\n\nNow, for each edge between u and v, the direction determines whether it contributes +ci to u's net outflow (if directed from u to v) or +ci to v's net outflow (if directed from v to u). So, for each edge, choosing direction adds +ci to one node's d and subtracts it from the other. Wait, no. Because the net outflow for u is increased by ci (if the edge is directed from u to v), and the net outflow for v is decreased by ci (since the edge is directed into v, so it contributes to inflow, thus net outflow is outflow - inflow, so adding to inflow would decrease net outflow).\n\nBut the sum of all d[v] across nodes must be zero. Because the total net outflow of the entire graph is zero. For example, the source's d is total_flow, the sink's is -total_flow, others are zero. Summing to zero. That's correct.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each node v, the sum of ci's on edges directed away from v minus the sum of ci's on edges directed towards v equals d[v].\n\nBut how to find such an assignment?\n\nThis looks like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each edge contributes to the d[v] values. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For each node, the required net outflow d[v] must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Let me denote the sum of flows on edges directed away from v as out_flow[v], and the sum directed towards v as in_flow[v]. Then, out_flow[v] - in_flow[v] = d[v]. Also, for each edge, out_flow[u] + in_flow[u] + out_flow[v] + in_flow[v] = ... no, for each edge between u and v, if it's directed from u to v, then out_flow[u] increases by ci, and in_flow[v] increases by ci. So for each edge, exactly one of the two possibilities occurs.\n\nBut how to model this? It's like a system of equations. But solving this for large n and m (up to 2e5) is computationally impossible with standard methods.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the graph is connected, and we need to assign directions such that the net outflow for each node is d[v], perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the net outflow is d[v], and then find an orientation. But how?\n\nWait, here's a thought. The problem is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but for general graphs. However, in this case, the net outflow for each node is known. For the directed graph to exist, the sum of d[v] must be zero, which it is. And for each node, the net outflow is d[v]. So, the problem is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the outflow minus inflow is d[v].\n\nThis is known as an \"orientation with prescribed outdegrees\" or something similar. How can we find such an orientation?\n\nAn approach for this is to model the problem as a flow network. But I'm not sure. Another idea: For each node, the required net outflow is d[v]. The sum of all d[v] is zero. So, for each node, the number of edges directed away from it minus the number directed towards it (times their respective ci's) equals d[v]. But again, this seems too abstract.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. For each edge between u and v, we can choose to direct it from u to v or from v to u. Each choice affects the net outflow of u and v. Let's denote for each edge, the direction choice as a variable. We need to find a set of variables that satisfy the net outflow constraints.\n\nThis seems like a system of linear equations, but with variables being binary (0 or 1). However, solving such a system for large m is not feasible directly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where the net outflow of each node is d[v]. For this, we can think of the problem as a directed graph where the sum of the flows on edges leaving the node minus the sum of flows entering the node equals d[v]. To find such an orientation, perhaps we can use a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the required net outflow for each node. For the source, it's the sum of all flows on edges connected to it (since all edges are directed away from it). For the sink, it's -total_flow. For others, it's zero. Wait, but how to compute total_flow?\n\nWait, the total_flow is the net outflow of the source, which is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source (since all are directed away from it). But how can we compute that? Because the source's edges are directed away from it, so the sum of their ci is the total_flow.\n\nBut for other nodes, their net outflow is zero. However, the sum of all net outflows must be zero, which it is.\n\nBut how do we compute the required net outflow for the sink? Well, since the sum of all net outflows is zero, and the source's is total_flow, and the sink's is -total_flow, others are zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut how do we find the required net outflow for each node? For example, for the source, it's the sum of all edges connected to it. For the sink, it's -sum of all edges connected to it (but that's not correct). Wait, no. Because the sink's net outflow depends on the directions of edges connected to it. But how?\n\nThis seems like a chicken and egg problem. Because the net outflow of the source depends on the directions of its edges, but those directions are determined by the orientation.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the source has no incoming edges. So for every edge connected to the source, it must be directed away from it. Therefore, the net outflow for the source is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. Thus, the total_flow is this sum.\n\nOnce we have that, the sink's net outflow is -total_flow, and others are zero.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- For all edges connected to the source (vertex 1), direct them away from the source. For these edges, we can immediately assign direction 0 (ai is 1, bi is other, so direction is ai→bi, which is 0 if the original input is (ai, bi) and we direct it as such).\n\n- For other edges, we need to assign directions such that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. Also, the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nBut how to proceed with the other edges?\n\nLet me think of the nodes other than 1 and n. For each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows directed out of it. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on edges connected to it is even (since incoming equals outgoing, sum is twice the incoming). But the problem says that the input is always valid, so that's taken care of.\n\nNow, for the other edges (not connected to the source), how to assign directions to satisfy the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are arranged in a topological order. The source is first, the sink is last, and for each other node, it's placed somewhere in between. Then, for each edge between u and v, if u is before v in the topological order, we direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, from v to u. This ensures that the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the nodes are ordered in such a way that for each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows directed out of v. \n\nThis seems challenging. But perhaps we can model this with a spanning tree approach. For example, build a spanning tree rooted at the source, and assign directions based on the parent-child relationships. Then, for the remaining edges, assign directions based on the tree's hierarchy.\n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except the source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. This implies that the flow is a circulation on the graph, except for the source and sink. But since the graph is connected, maybe we can find a way to orient the edges to satisfy this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges connected to it is even. Let's denote this sum as S_v. Since S_v must be even, and for the flow conservation, the sum of flows directed into v must be S_v / 2, and the same for outgoing.\n\nSo, for each node v (not source or sink), we need to select exactly S_v / 2 flow units to be directed into it, and the same to be directed out of it. But how to do this for all nodes simultaneously?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a subset of edges for each node to be incoming, such that the sums are correct and the overall directions form an acyclic graph.\n\nBut how to find such subsets?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each node v (not source or sink), the net outflow is zero. Then, we can perform some kind of flow decomposition. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Assign directions to edges connected to the source as described.\n\n2. For the remaining edges, build a directed graph that satisfies the flow conservation and is acyclic.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the problem as a flow network where we need to assign directions to edges. For each node v (not source or sink), the net outflow must be zero. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it must equal the sum of flows directed towards it.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of an Eulerian trail, where for each node, the in-degree equals the out-degree. However, in our case, it's about the sum of flows, not the count of edges.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away equals the sum directed towards. Then, the directed graph is Eulerian for each node (except source and sink).\n\nBut again, how to find such a graph?\n\nAnother approach: Since the graph is connected and the flow conservation is possible, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal of the graph, and during the traversal, assign directions to edges in such a way that the flow conservation is maintained. For example, when visiting a node, we can direct edges towards unvisited nodes, ensuring that the flow conservation is handled.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. For this, we can model it as a directed graph where each node's net outflow is zero, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nTo achieve this, perhaps we can assign directions based on a topological order. For example, arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and for each node, all edges to nodes that come later in the order are directed away, and edges to earlier nodes are directed towards them. This ensures the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source (node 1). Assign directions for all edges connected to it as outgoing.\n\n- For the remaining nodes, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, assigning directions to edges in such a way that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's say we have a node v that has already been processed. We can look at the edges connected to v, and for those that are not yet directed, decide their direction based on the current state of the node's flow balance.\n\nFor example, suppose that for node v, we track the current balance (sum of flows directed out minus flows directed in). Initially, this balance is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v (for edges connected to the source, etc.) minus the flows directed towards v. For each node, we want this balance to be zero (except for source and sink).\n\nWhen processing an edge between v and u, if u is not yet processed, we can direct the edge from v to u. This would increase v's balance by ci and decrease u's balance by ci. But how to ensure that eventually, all balances are zero?\n\nThis sounds like a problem of maintaining a balance for each node and directing edges to adjust the balances. However, it's unclear how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: The problem resembles the problem of finding an Eulerian circuit, but with weighted edges. In such cases, the necessary condition is that for every node, the sum of the weights of incoming edges equals the sum of the weights of outgoing edges. This is exactly our condition for nodes other than the source and sink.\n\nSo, perhaps we can construct an Eulerian circuit for each connected component (but the graph is connected). However, since the graph is undirected, and we need to assign directions, perhaps we can find an Eulerian circuit and assign directions accordingly. But since the graph may not be Eulerian (due to the source and sink), this might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is connected and the flow conservation is satisfied for all nodes except the source and sink, perhaps we can add a virtual edge between the sink and the source to make the entire graph have an Eulerian circuit. But this is getting complicated.\n\nBut wait, the source and sink have non-zero net outflows. The source has a net outflow of total_flow, the sink has a net inflow of total_flow. So, if we add a directed edge from the sink to the source with weight total_flow, the net outflow for both would be zero. Then, the entire graph would be Eulerian. Then, we could find an Eulerian circuit and assign directions to edges accordingly. But since we added this virtual edge, we'd need to remove it later.\n\nBut how to translate this into an algorithm?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we add a directed edge from the sink to the source with weight equal to the total_flow. Now, all nodes have net outflow zero. So, the graph has an Eulerian circuit. We can then find an Eulerian circuit, and assign directions to the edges based on the circuit. However, the added edge is not part of the original graph, so we need to ensure that the directions assigned to the original edges satisfy the flow conservation conditions.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOnce the Eulerian circuit is found, each edge in the original graph is traversed in one direction. For example, if the edge between u and v is traversed from u to v, then we direct it that way. This would ensure that the flow conservation holds for all nodes. But since the added edge is not part of the original graph, we have to ensure that the flow conservation is maintained for the original graph.\n\nBut this might work. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total_flow as the sum of flows on edges connected to the source (since they are directed away from it).\n\n2. Add a directed edge from the sink (n) to the source (1) with weight total_flow. Now, all nodes have net outflow zero.\n\n3. Find an Eulerian circuit in this modified graph. Since the graph is connected and all nodes have even degrees (because the sum of flows on edges is even for each node), an Eulerian circuit exists.\n\n4. Traverse the Eulerian circuit, and for each original edge, assign its direction based on the direction it was traversed in the circuit.\n\n5. Remove the added edge (it's not part of the original graph, so we ignore it).\n\nBut how to find an Eulerian circuit in a weighted graph? Well, the standard algorithm for finding an Eulerian circuit works for undirected graphs, but here we have directed edges. However, the modified graph now has directed edges. Wait, no. The original edges are undirected, but after adding the directed edge from sink to source, the graph is directed. However, the original edges are undirected, but during the Eulerian circuit traversal, we need to assign directions to them.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is not applicable. Because the original graph is undirected, and adding a directed edge doesn't help in finding an Eulerian circuit. This line of thinking might not be helpful.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, and the source has no incoming edges, perhaps we can build a DAG where the nodes are processed in a certain order, and for each node, the flow conservation is ensured.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and assign directions to edges in such a way that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nFor example, during BFS traversal, when visiting a node u, we look at its adjacent edges. For each edge between u and v, if v is unvisited, we direct the edge from u to v, and add v to the queue. This ensures that the graph is acyclic (since it's a tree-like structure). But how to handle the flow conservation?\n\nBut this approach doesn't take into account the flow values. It just directs edges in a tree-like manner. This might not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree and out-degree such that the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges. This seems similar to finding a directed graph that satisfies certain flow constraints.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph is connected and we need to direct the edges to form an acyclic graph, perhaps we can assign directions based on a topological order. Once we have a topological order, we can direct each edge from the node appearing earlier in the order to the one later. This ensures acyclicity. Now, the question is: can we find a topological order such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum directed out of v?\n\nIf we can find such a topological order, then directing edges based on the order will satisfy the acyclicity condition. But how to find such an order?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node v (not source or sink) the required sum of flows directed into it (which is equal to the sum directed out of it, and equal to half of the total sum of flows on edges connected to v).\n\n2. Assume that we have a topological order. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it is the sum of flows from nodes that appear earlier in the order. Similarly for outgoing flows to nodes that appear later.\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm. For example, we can start with the source, and then iteratively select the next node to add to the topological order based on some criteria related to the flow conservation.\n\nBut what criteria? For example, we can choose a node whose current imbalance (the difference between the flows directed into it and out of it) can be corrected by directing edges to or from it.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the sum of flows directed into it is equal to the sum directed out of it. This is equivalent to saying that the sum of flows on edges directed out of it is equal to half of the total sum of flows on edges connected to it.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the total sum of flows on edges connected to it as S_v. For nodes other than source and sink, S_v must be even, and the sum of flows directed out of v must be S_v / 2.\n\nSo, during the topological ordering, when we add a node to the order, we can direct all edges from this node to nodes that come later in the order, and from nodes that come earlier in the order to this node. But how to ensure that the sum of flows directed out of this node is S_v / 2.\n\nThis seems like a complex constraint to satisfy.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (not source or sink), the required outflow is S_v / 2. We can model this as a directed graph where each node has an outflow requirement. We can build a directed graph where for each node, we have to direct enough edges to meet this requirement.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph and use a priority queue to select nodes with the smallest required outflow first. Or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where we have to assign directions to edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows directed out of it is equal to a precomputed value (S_v / 2). This is a classic problem in flow networks, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, this is similar to the problem of finding a directed graph where each node has a specified out-degree (but in our case, it's about the sum of flows, not the count). This seems like a flow problem.\n\nLet me think of it as a flow problem. We can model each edge as a variable that can be directed in either direction. For each node v, the sum of flows directed out of it must be equal to D_v (which is S_v / 2 for nodes other than source and sink, and for the source, it's the sum of flows on its edges, and for the sink, it's D_n = (sum of flows on edges connected to it) - total_flow, but I'm not sure).\n\nWait, for the source, the sum of flows directed out of it is D_1 = total_flow, which is the sum of flows on its edges. For the sink, the sum of flows directed out of it is D_n = (sum of flows on edges connected to it) - total_flow_in. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the required outflow is D_v. For the source, D_1 = sum of flows on its edges. For the sink, D_n = sum of flows on its edges directed out of it. But how to determine this?\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nLet me try to think of a concrete example. Take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe nodes are 1 (source), 2, and 3 (sink). The edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2 with 10\nEdge 2: 1-2 with 10\nEdge 3: 3-1 with 5.\n\nThe source is 1, sink is 3. For the source, all edges are directed away. So edge 2 is directed 1→2 (output 0). Edge 3 is directed 1→3? No, because the edge is between 3 and 1. Wait, the original input is 3 1 5. So the edge is between 3 and 1. Since the source is 1, this edge must be directed from 1 to 3. So output for this edge is 0 if the original is ai=3, bi=1, so the direction is ai→bi would be 3→1, but we need to direct it as 1→3, so the output is 1.\n\nSo for edge 3, output is 1.\n\nThen, for node 2, the sum of flows on edges connected to it is 10 (from edge 2) + 10 (from edge 1) = 20. So S_v = 20, and required outflow is 10.\n\nSo, for node 2, the sum of flows directed out must be 10. Let's see: edge 2 is directed from 1 to 2 (so outflow for 1 is increased by 10, inflow for 2 is increased by 10).",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The source (vertex 1) must have no incoming edges, and the sink (vertex n) must have no outgoing edges in the final configuration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex except the source and sink, the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges.\n2. **Acyclicity**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by using a topological sort.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: Use a topological sort to determine the direction of edges. This ensures that edges are directed from nodes that appear earlier in the topological order to those that appear later, thus avoiding cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c, i))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Compute total_flow for the source\n    total_flow = 0\n    for a, b, c, idx in edges:\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total_flow += c\n\n    # We need to assign directions such that the flow is conserved\n    # We will use a topological sort approach, building a DAG with source first, sink last\n    # We'll perform a BFS starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal order\n\n    # To ensure that the graph is a DAG and directions are assigned properly\n    # We'll use a queue and track visited nodes, and for each edge, direct it from the node that was visited first\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    order = []\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # Build the adjacency list again, but now with weights\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for a, b, c, idx in edges:\n        adj[a].append((b, c, idx))\n        adj[b].append((a, c, idx))\n\n    # First, build the initial in-degrees for the BFS\n    # But since the graph is undirected, we need to handle it carefully\n    # Instead, we'll perform a BFS starting from the source, and assign directions as we go\n\n    # We'll use a queue for BFS\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(1)\n    visited[1] = True\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # We'll track the direction for each edge\n    result = [0] * m\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        order.append(u)\n        for v, c, idx in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                q.append(v)\n                # The edge from u to v is directed from u to v\n                # Check if the original edge is (u, v) or (v, u)\n                original_a, original_b, original_c, original_idx = edges[idx]\n                if original_a == u and original_b == v:\n                    result[original_idx] = 0\n                else:\n                    result[original_idx] = 1\n            else:\n                # If v is already visited and is not the parent, then this edge is between u and v, where v is already processed\n                # We need to decide the direction based on the order in which they were visited\n                if parent[u] != v and parent[v] != u:\n                    # This is a back edge, but since we are doing BFS, it should not happen in a tree\n                    pass\n                # If v is already visited and is the parent of u, then do nothing\n                # Otherwise, we need to check if v is in the order before u\n                # Since we are processing in BFS, if v is already visited, it's either parent or processed earlier\n                # So we can direct the edge from v to u if v is processed before u\n                # But since u is being processed now, and v was processed earlier, we can direct from v to u\n                # However, we need to check whether this edge has already been directed\n                # So we can skip if already processed\n                pass\n\n    # Now, for the remaining edges (those not processed during BFS), we need to assign directions\n    # But since the graph is connected and BFS covers all nodes, all edges would have been processed?\n    # Wait, no.
