Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about directing the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are met. The given flows are already determined, and we just need to assign directions to each edge. The conditions are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So it's a conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the flow conservation. For each vertex except 1 and n, the total inflow must equal outflow. But since the edges are directed, each edge contributes to either inflow or outflow of its endpoints.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, for each edge, once directed, it contributes ci to one vertex's outflow and to another's inflow. Wait, no: if the edge is directed from u to v, then for u, this is an outgoing edge (so contributes to outflow), and for v, it's an incoming edge (contributes to inflow).\n\nSo for each vertex v (not 1 or n), the sum of all flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nBut how to assign directions so that this holds?\n\nLet me think about the flow values. Since the original graph was used to compute a maximum flow, the sum of flows leaving the source must equal the maximum flow. But in this problem, the flows are already given, and we need to direct the edges correctly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows leaving the source (vertex 1) must be equal to the maximum flow value, and similarly the sum of flows entering the sink (vertex n) must be equal to that value.\n\nBut how does that help us with directing the edges?\n\nAnother thought: the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. That suggests that the directed graph must be a DAG. Also, since the source has no incoming edges, perhaps the DAG is structured in a way that allows topological sorting. Maybe we can model this as a DAG where we can perform some kind of topological order processing.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that the direction assignments meet both the flow conservation and the acyclicity constraints?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each edge is directed in a way that satisfies the flow conservation. Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps there's a way to model this as a directed tree or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow conservation for intermediate nodes implies that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. For the source, net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, net inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nAnother approach: think of the flow as a circulation, but adjusted for the source and sink. However, since the source and sink have non-zero net flows, maybe we can model this by considering the flow as a flow network where the flow is already fixed, and we need to assign directions accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (vertex 1) is the maximum flow value, and similarly for the sink. So, for each node except 1 and n, the total flow going into it must equal the flow going out of it.\n\nSo, for each node v (other than 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed towards v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed away from v.\n\nNow, how to model this. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node, the net flow (outflow minus inflow) must be zero, except for the source and sink.\n\nBut since the flow is already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that satisfies these constraints. However, how to find such directions?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of building a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. This seems like a system of equations, but with variables being the direction of each edge.\n\nBut solving such a system directly would be computationally expensive for large graphs (up to 2e5 nodes and edges). Therefore, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions based on that. For example, if we process nodes in a topological order, then for each edge between two nodes, we can direct it from the earlier node to the later node in the topological order. But how does this help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG with a certain structure. For example, if we can construct a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of flows. But how?\n\nLet me consider the flow conservation condition. For each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow leaving v must equal the total flow entering v. Which implies that the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to v. Let's call this S_v. For each edge, regardless of direction, it contributes c_i to the sum of flows of both endpoints. So S_v is the sum of all c_i for edges connected to v.\n\nFor the flow conservation, for each intermediate node v, the total outflow must equal the total inflow. Which implies that the total outflow is equal to half of S_v? No, because each edge contributes to exactly one of the outflow or inflow of each node. Wait, for a directed edge u->v, the outflow of u increases by c_i and the inflow of v increases by c_i. So the total outflow from u plus inflow to u is equal to the sum of all edges incident to u. Similarly for v.\n\nBut for flow conservation, the outflow from u equals the inflow to u. So the total outflow from u is equal to (S_u)/2. Because outflow + inflow = S_u, and for conservation, outflow = inflow, hence each is S_u/2.\n\nBut this is only possible if S_u is even? Wait, but the problem says that a solution exists, so this must be the case. Therefore, for each node v not 1 or n, the sum of flows of edges incident to v must be even. But since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, perhaps this is already ensured.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, perhaps for each node, we can compute the required net outflow. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow (since it's the maximum flow). For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. For others, net outflow is zero.\n\nSo, for each node, the net outflow (sum of flows on edges directed away from the node minus sum of flows on edges directed towards the node) is:\n\n- For node 1: total_flow (which is the sum of flows on edges directed away from 1)\n- For node n: -total_flow (since sum of flows directed towards n is total_flow)\n- For others: 0.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like we need to assign directions to edges such that the net outflow for each node is as above.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is known, and the edges are directed. This is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and the net outflow for each node is fixed. How to find such directions?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the sum of the flows on edges directed away from the node minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards the node equals the required net outflow.\n\nThis can be modeled as a flow problem. Wait, but how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined by some potential function. For example, if we assign a potential value to each node, and direct the edge from the node with higher potential to the node with lower potential. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic if the potentials are assigned in a way that forms a DAG (like a topological order).\n\nMoreover, if we can assign potentials such that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v equals the sum of flows directed towards v. How?\n\nLet me think: For each edge between u and v, if we direct it from u to v, then this contributes +c to u's outflow and +c to v's inflow. The net outflow for u increases by c, and for v decreases by c.\n\nIf we have a potential function phi(v) such that for each edge between u and v, we direct it from u to v if phi(u) > phi(v), and vice versa. Then, the graph will be a DAG if the potentials are assigned in a way that there are no cycles (like assigning unique potentials in a topological order).\n\nBut how to choose phi(v) such that the net outflow for each node is correct.\n\nLet me think about the net outflow for a node v. Suppose that for each edge between v and another node w, if phi(v) > phi(w), then the edge is directed from v to w, contributing +c to v's net outflow. If phi(v) < phi(w), then the edge is directed from w to v, contributing -c to v's net outflow. If phi(v) == phi(w), which can't happen if all potentials are unique, but perhaps in general, the direction is arbitrary.\n\nSo the net outflow for node v would be sum_{edges (v,w)} [c * (1 if phi(v) > phi(w) else -1 if phi(v) < phi(w) else 0)].\n\nWe need this net outflow to be equal to:\n\n- For node 1: total_flow (let's say F)\n- For node n: -F\n- For others: 0.\n\nSo how to find such potentials?\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving this directly might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding a potential function where for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of c * sign(phi(v) - phi(w)) equals the required net outflow.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the net outflow is known. Then, the problem reduces to finding an orientation of the edges that satisfies the net outflow conditions. This is similar to the problem of finding a directed graph with given in-degree and out-degree differences. However, in our case, the net outflow is given for each node.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation. One approach is to model this as a flow problem. Let me think:\n\nEach edge can be considered as contributing to the net outflow of its endpoints. For example, directing an edge from u to v adds +c to u's net outflow and subtracts c from v's net outflow.\n\nSo, for each node, the sum of all contributions from edges must equal the required net outflow.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the required net outflow as D[v]. For node 1, D[1] = F, for node n, D[n] = -F, and for others, D[v] = 0.\n\nNow, for each edge between u and v, we can choose to direct it from u to v, which contributes +c to D[u] and -c to D[v], or from v to u, which contributes -c to D[u] and +c to D[v].\n\nBut since the D values are fixed, perhaps we can model this as a system where for each edge, the choice of direction affects the D values.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the sum of D[v] for all nodes must be zero. Let's check that. For the entire graph, the sum of D[v] is D[1] + D[n] + sum_{others} D[v] = F - F + 0 = 0. Which is correct, since the net outflow for all nodes must sum to zero.\n\nSo the problem is feasible.\n\nNow, how to find such directions.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum directed towards v equals D[v].\n\nThis is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation, but not exactly. In Eulerian orientation, each node's in-degree equals out-degree. But here, the difference is given.\n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. Suppose that for each node, the required net outflow is D[v]. Let's imagine that each edge can carry a flow of +c or -c, depending on the direction. The sum of these flows for each node must be D[v].\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a capacity of c, but the direction is to be determined. However, this might not be helpful.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v, the required net outflow is D[v]. Let me think of this as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that for each node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges minus incoming edges is D[v].\n\nThis can be transformed into a problem of finding a directed graph with certain properties. Perhaps, we can model this as a flow network where each edge has a capacity of c, and we need to find a flow that satisfies the net outflow conditions.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think of it as a flow problem where each edge can carry a flow of either +c or -c. The sum of flows at each node must be D[v].\n\nBut this seems abstract. Maybe we can model it as a flow problem where each edge is treated as a bidirectional edge with capacity c, and we need to find a flow that satisfies the demand at each node.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's create a new flow network where each original edge is replaced by two directed edges (u→v and v→u), each with capacity c. Then, we need to find a flow in this network such that for each node v, the net outflow (total flow leaving minus entering) equals D[v].\n\nBut how to find such a flow. Well, this is exactly the problem of finding a flow that meets the given demands. The standard approach is to create a super source and super sink to handle the demands.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me recall that in flow networks, the sum of all demands must be zero. Which is the case here.\n\nLet me think: For each node v, the required net outflow is D[v]. Let me define the demand as follows: if D[v] is positive, then the node needs to have a surplus of D[v] units of flow. If negative, it needs a deficit. To model this, we can create a super source S and super sink T. For each node v with D[v] > 0, we add an edge from S to v with capacity D[v]. For each node v with D[v] < 0, we add an edge from v to T with capacity -D[v]. Then, we need to find a flow in the original network (with edges having capacities c) that satisfies the flow conservation except for the super source and sink. If the maximum flow from S to T equals the sum of all D[v] (which is zero?), wait, no.\n\nWait, the sum of D[v] is zero. So the total demand is zero. So the maximum flow from S to T should be equal to the sum of the capacities of the edges from S to the nodes, which is sum_{v} max(D[v], 0). Since the sum of D[v] is zero, sum_{v} max(D[v], 0) = sum_{v} min(D[v], 0) * (-1).\n\nBut how does this help us? If we can find a flow that saturates all the edges from S and to T, then the residual network would give us the required flows on the original edges.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, given that the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps we can proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce we have the flow values on the original edges, we can determine their direction based on the flow. For example, if the flow on edge u-v is positive in the direction u→v, then we direct it that way.\n\nBut how to implement this. However, given the size of the problem (up to 2e5 nodes and edges), standard max flow algorithms may not be feasible. They would be too slow for such constraints.\n\nSo this approach may not be efficient enough. We need a better idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions based on that. For example, if we have a topological order where the source comes first, and the sink comes last, then all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later ones. But how does that ensure the flow conservation?\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation conditions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of flows. Let's consider that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows directed into v. Which means that the sum of flows on all edges incident to v is even, as mentioned before. But again, how to assign directions.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. Let's imagine that we assign a potential to each node such that the potential increases along the direction of the edges. For example, the potential of node u is less than the potential of node v if there is an edge from u to v. This ensures that the graph is acyclic.\n\nIf we can assign potentials to nodes such that for every edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential (from lower to higher), then the graph is acyclic. Now, how to choose these potentials so that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the potentials as numbers. For each node v, let's define the potential as p[v]. For each edge between u and v, if p[u] < p[v], then the edge is directed from u to v. If p[u] > p[v], it's directed from v to u. If equal, direction can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nThe flow conservation condition for node v (not 1 or n) is that the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows directed into v. Let's denote this sum as S_v/2, as before.\n\nBut how to relate this to the potentials. Let me think of the following: For each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is equal to (sum of flows of edges incident to v) / 2. Because the sum of all flows incident to v is S_v, and the outflow and inflow must be equal.\n\nBut how to ensure this with potentials.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v must be equal to D[v], which is zero for non-source/sink nodes.\n\nBut how to model this with potentials.\n\nLet me consider that for each edge between u and v, if p[u] < p[v], then the edge is directed from u to v, contributing +c to u's net outflow and -c to v's net outflow. If p[u] > p[v], then it's directed from v to u, contributing +c to v's net outflow and -c to u's net outflow. If p[u] = p[v], the direction can be arbitrary, but this would contribute zero to the net outflow.\n\nSo the net outflow for node v is equal to sum_{edges (u,v)} c * (sign(p[u] - p[v]) if p[u] != p[v], else 0). \n\nBut this seems hard to manage. However, if we can assign potentials such that for each node v, the net outflow is D[v], then we have our solution.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations, but again, solving it directly seems impractical.\n\nAnother observation: the problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. This suggests that the directed graph is a DAG. Therefore, there exists a topological ordering of the nodes. Let's assume that we can find such a topological order. Once we have it, we can direct all edges from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order. However, this may not satisfy the flow conservation conditions. So, how can we find such an order?\n\nPerhaps we can build a DAG based on the flow conservation requirements.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation for each node. For node v (not 1 or n), the net outflow is zero. Which means that the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows directed into v. Which is equivalent to saying that the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is S_v / 2.\n\nNow, suppose we have a topological order. Let's imagine that we process nodes in this order and assign directions to edges accordingly. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the concept of a directed tree. Suppose we build a directed tree rooted at the source (node 1), and then direct all edges away from the root. However, this might not work for all cases, but perhaps we can use some kind of hierarchical approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except sink) has a certain amount of flow that needs to be passed on. For example, the source has a certain amount of flow to distribute, and other nodes pass it along.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother thought: since the directed graph must be acyclic, it has a topological order. Let's imagine that we assign a topological order where node 1 comes first, node n comes last, and other nodes are in between. Then, for each node in the topological order, we can direct edges from earlier nodes to later nodes. But how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nLet me think of it as a problem of balancing the flows. For example, for each node v (except 1 and n), the amount of flow that enters v must equal the amount that leaves. So during the topological processing, when we reach node v, we can ensure that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Assign a topological order to the nodes, with node 1 first and node n last.\n2. For each node v in the topological order (excluding the first and last):\n   a. Calculate the total flow that must leave v (which is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of v).\n   b. But how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has a balance of zero. This suggests that for each node v, the amount of flow coming into it from previously processed nodes must be equal to the amount of flow that needs to be sent out through edges to later nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed from a node with a lower \"potential\" to a node with a higher \"potential\", ensuring acyclicity. The potential can be determined based on the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to compute the potential.\n\nLet's consider that for each node v, the potential p[v] is equal to the total flow that needs to be passed through it. For example, the source has a potential of zero (since all flow starts there), and the sink has some value. But this is vague.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the discovery order. However, this might not ensure the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed from parent to children in a spanning tree. For example, construct a spanning tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges away from the root. Then, for the non-tree edges, direct them according to the topological order. But again, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's try to think of the problem differently.\n\nSince the flow conservation for each node v (not 1 or n) requires that the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v, this implies that the net flow through v is zero. Which suggests that the flow through v is balanced.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a flow network where the flow conservation holds for all nodes except the source and sink.\n\nBut how to direct the edges to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each node v, the total flow on edges incident to v is S_v. For the flow conservation, the outflow from v is S_v / 2. So, for each node, we can calculate what the outflow should be.\n\nNow, imagine that we have a directed graph where each node v has an outflow of S_v / 2. How can we assign directions to edges to achieve this?\n\nFor example, consider that for each edge between u and v, if we direct it from u to v, it contributes c to u's outflow and c to v's inflow. If directed from v to u, it contributes c to v's outflow and c to u's inflow.\n\nSo, for each node v, the sum of c for edges directed out of v must be equal to S_v / 2.\n\nThis is a problem of choosing directions for edges so that for each node, the sum of the flows on edges directed out of it is equal to S_v / 2.\n\nThis is a classic problem, and it's known that such an orientation exists if and only if S_v is even for all nodes, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation.\n\nThis problem is known as the \"orientation of edges to achieve given out-degrees\" or something similar. However, the out-degrees here are not integer counts, but sums of flows.\n\nBut there's a way to model this as a flow problem. For example, for each edge between u and v, we can decide whether to add c to u's outflow or to v's outflow. The total for each node must be S_v / 2.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a flow in a graph where each edge can contribute to the outflow of either of its endpoints, and the total for each node is fixed.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a flow network. Let me try to model it.\n\nCreate a bipartite graph where each edge is represented as a variable that can be assigned to one of the two endpoints. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem where each edge is a variable that can be directed in either direction. For each node, the sum of flows directed out must be equal to the target value.\n\nThis is similar to a flow problem where each edge has a capacity of c, and we want to select a direction for each edge such that the sum of flows directed out of each node is equal to the target.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for each node v, the required outflow is O_v = S_v / 2. For the source node, O_1 is equal to the total flow F (which is the sum of flows on edges directed out of it). For the sink node, O_n is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of it, which is S_n / 2. But since the sink's inflow is F, and the outflow is S_n / 2, but how does that relate to F?\n\nWait, for the sink node n, the inflow is F, and the outflow is S_n / 2. But the inflow minus outflow must be equal to F (since the net inflow is F). So:\n\ninflow - outflow = F => (sum of flows on edges directed into n) - (sum of flows on edges directed out of n) = F.\n\nBut the sum of flows on edges directed into n is (S_n - outflow), since the total sum of flows incident to n is S_n, and outflow is the sum of flows directed out of n. So:\n\n(S_n - outflow) - outflow = F => S_n - 2*outflow = F => outflow = (S_n - F)/2.\n\nBut for the sink node, the outflow is O_n = (S_n - F)/2.\n\nBut how do I know what F is? F is the maximum flow value, which is the sum of flows on edges directed out of the source. But since the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, F is the total flow from the source to the sink.\n\nBut how to compute F? Well, F is the sum of flows on edges directed out of the source. But since the source has no incoming edges, all edges incident to the source must be directed away from it. So, F is equal to the sum of flows on all edges incident to the source.\n\nWait, yes! Because the source cannot have any incoming edges, so all edges connected to the source are directed away from it. Hence, the outflow of the source is the sum of flows on all edges incident to it. And this is equal to the total flow F.\n\nSo, F = sum_{edges incident to 1} c_i.\n\nOnce I know F, I can compute O_v for each node v as follows:\n\nFor v = 1: O_v = F.\n\nFor v = n: O_v = (S_n - F)/2.\n\nFor other nodes: O_v = S_v / 2.\n\nNow, the problem becomes to find an orientation of the edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is O_v.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network. Let me think about how to model it.\n\nConsider that each edge between u and v can contribute c to the outflow of either u or v. So for each edge, we have to choose whether to assign it to u or to v. The goal is to make the total for each node equal to O_v.\n\nThis is similar to a flow problem where each edge can be assigned to one of two nodes, and we need to find such assignments to meet the O_v targets.\n\nTo model this, we can think of it as a flow problem where we create a bipartite graph between nodes and edges, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: this is equivalent to finding a flow in a graph where each edge can carry a flow of +c or -c, and the sum of flows for each node is O_v - sum of flows on edges incident to it. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow circulation problem. For each edge between u and v, we can model it as a variable x_uv, which is +c if the edge is directed from u to v, and -c if directed from v to u. The sum of x_uv for all edges incident to node v must be equal to O_v - (sum of flows on edges incident to v) ? No, wait.\n\nWait, for each edge between u and v, the contribution to the outflow of u is +c if directed from u to v, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, the contribution to the outflow of v is +c if directed from v to u, and 0 otherwise. So the total outflow for node v is sum_{edges incident to v} (c if directed away from v, else 0).\n\nBut how to express this as equations.\n\nLet me define for each edge (u, v) in the original undirected graph, a variable d_uv which is 1 if the edge is directed from u to v, and 0 otherwise. Then, the outflow for node v is sum_{edges incident to v} (c * d_uv if the edge is (u, v), or c * (1 - d_vu) if the edge is (v, u)). Wait, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge between u and v, we can define a variable x, which represents the contribution to the outflow of u. If x = c, then the edge is directed from u to v. If x = 0, then it's directed from v to u. So for each edge, x can be either 0 or c. The sum of x for all edges incident to u must be equal to O_u.\n\nThis is a system of equations where for each node u, sum_{edges incident to u} x_uv = O_u, where x_uv is either 0 or c.\n\nBut solving this system is non-trivial. However, since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to construct it greedily.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source node (1). All edges incident to it must be directed away from it. So for each edge between 1 and v, we set the direction to 1→v. This contributes c to the outflow of node 1, which is O_1 = F. This is correct because F is the sum of flows on edges incident to node 1.\n\n- For other nodes, we need to ensure that their outflow is O_v. Let's process the nodes in some order, and for each node, direct the edges to other nodes in a way that balances the outflow.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach using a BFS or DFS traversal. For example, we can build a directed tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges in the tree away from the root. For non-tree edges, direct them in a way that maintains the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAnother idea: since the outflow for each node is known, we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain amount of \"excess\" flow that needs to be passed on. For example, for node v, after directing some edges, we calculate how much more flow needs to be directed out of it.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\n- Initially, for the source, all edges are directed away from it. This contributes to the outflow of the source, which is O_1 = F. For other nodes, their outflow is initially zero.\n\n- For each node v, we calculate the current outflow. If it's less than O_v, we need to direct more edges away from v. If it's more, we need to direct some edges towards v.\n\nBut how to do this systematically.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with capacities, and finding a flow that satisfies certain conditions. But again, for large graphs, this may not be feasible.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a directed graph where we can perform a topological sort, and for each node in the topological order, we direct the edges from it to other nodes in a way that adjusts the outflow.\n\nFor example, let's assume that we have a topological order where the source comes first, and the sink comes last. For each node in the topological order (excluding the sink), we process it and direct edges to later nodes in the order to adjust the outflow.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. Compute O_v for each node v.\n2. Build a directed graph where all edges are initially undirected.\n3. Perform a topological sort of the nodes, ensuring that node 1 is first and node n is last.\n4. For each node v in the topological order (excluding the last node n):\n   a. For each edge incident to v that hasn't been directed yet, direct it from v to the node that comes later in the topological order. This ensures that the graph remains acyclic.\n   b. After directing these edges, update the outflow of v and the outflow of the other node.\n\nBut how to ensure that the outflow for each node reaches O_v.\n\nThis seems like it might not work, but perhaps it's possible to adjust the directions of edges dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem where each node has a required outflow, and we can direct edges to satisfy this. For example, for each node v, if the current outflow is less than O_v, we need to direct more edges away from it. This could be done by finding edges connected to v that are not yet directed and directing them away from v.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct.\n\nLet me think of this as a BFS-like process. Start with the source node. For each node, we have a certain amount of flow that needs to be passed on. For example, the source has O_1 = F, which is the total flow. We can direct edges from the source to other nodes, contributing to their inflow. For each of those nodes, their outflow must be O_v. So, if a node receives some flow from the source, it must pass it on to other nodes.\n\nThis seems similar to building a directed graph where each node passes on the flow it receives. This could be modeled as a directed tree, but with multiple paths.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, we can use a priority queue or some data structure to track the nodes that need to pass on flow. For example:\n\n- Initialize a queue with the source node.\n- For each node u dequeued from the queue, calculate how much flow it has to pass on. This is O_u minus the flow already directed out of it.\n- For each undirected edge incident to u, direct it from u",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions, acyclicity, and correct flow direction from the source to the sink. The approach involves using a topological sort combined with a greedy strategy to ensure all constraints are met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. **Acyclicity**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by directing edges in a topological order.\n3. **Topological Order**: We use a topological sort to process nodes in an order where each node is processed only after all its dependencies have been processed. This helps in directing edges from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order, ensuring acyclicity.\n4. **Greedy Direction Assignment**: As we process each node in topological order, we direct edges away from the node to subsequent nodes in the order, adjusting for flow conservation requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Compute S_v for each node\n    S = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        S[a] += c\n        S[b] += c\n\n    # Compute O_v for each node\n    O = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # Compute F as the sum of flows on edges incident to source (1)\n    F = 0\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            F += c\n\n    O[1] = F\n    O[n] = (S[n] - F) // 2\n    for v in range(2, n):\n        O[v] = S[v] // 2\n\n    # Now, build a directed graph with directions determined by topological order\n    # We need to perform a topological sort starting from node 1, but since the graph is connected and undirected, we can construct a DAG based on the flow requirements.\n\n    # To ensure acyclicity, we can perform a BFS-based topological sort, treating the graph as a DAG once directed appropriately.\n    # However, since the graph is undirected, we need to build a directed version incrementally.\n\n    # We will use a modified BFS approach to assign directions while ensuring flow conservation.\n\n    # Initialize data structures\n    directed = [None] * m  # 0 means a->b, 1 means b->a\n    used = [False] * m\n    outflow = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # First, handle edges incident to source (node 1)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[i]\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            if a == 1:\n                directed[i] = 0\n                outflow[1] += c\n                outflow[b] += 0  # since it's incoming to b\n            else:\n                directed[i] = 1\n                outflow[1] += c\n                outflow[a] += 0  # since it's incoming to a\n            used[i] = True\n\n    # Now, for other nodes, we need to process them in some order to direct edges\n    # We'll use a queue to process nodes whose outflow is not yet satisfied\n    # But how to determine the order?
