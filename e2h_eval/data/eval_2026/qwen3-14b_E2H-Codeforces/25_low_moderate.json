При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have resulted from an error where two identical messages were merged. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that some part of the end of the first message matches the start of the second message. The overlapping length has to be positive but less than the length of the message. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (like \"abcd\" from two \"abcd\"s) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just concatenating them without overlapping (like \"abcabc\") isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if it's possible that it was formed by such an error. If yes, output YES and a possible original message s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the original message s must be such that when two copies of s are merged with some overlap, we get t. Let me think about what that implies.\n\nLet me denote the length of s as len_s. Then, the merged string t would have a length equal to 2 * len_s - k, where k is the overlap length. Since the overlap is between 1 and len_s-1, then the length of t must be between len_s + 1 (when k = len_s -1) and 2*len_s -1 (when k=1).\n\nWait, for example, if the original message is of length L. Then, merging two copies with overlap k (where 1 ≤k < L), the merged string length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. So, the length of t must be 2L -k. Since k is between 1 and L-1, then the length of t is between 2L - (L-1) = L +1 and 2L -1. So, for t to be possible, its length must be between L+1 and 2L-1, for some L.\n\nBut since L is the length of the original message s, which is unknown, we need to find possible L values.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible L values. Let's say the length of t is n. Then, for some possible L, we have:\n\nn = 2L -k, where 1 ≤k < L.\n\nRearranging, k = 2L -n. But since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these, L must be in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1].\n\nBut L must also be such that the original message s has length L. Also, since k must be positive and less than L, the value of k is 2L -n. Which must be between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive, we can check if there exists a k = 2L -n that satisfies 1 ≤k < L. Well, since L is in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], then:\n\nFor example, let's take L = n-1. Then k = 2(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. For this to be less than L (which is n-1), n-2 < n-1 → yes. And since n-2 ≥ 1? Well, depends on n. For example, if n is 3, then L = 2, k = 3-2 = 1. Which is okay.\n\nBut for L to be valid, k must be between 1 and L-1. So for each possible L in that range, we can compute k and check if it's valid.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nFor the given t of length n, iterate over possible L values from (n+1)/2 up to n-1. For each L, compute k = 2L -n. Check if 1 ≤k < L. If so, then check if the first L -k characters of t match the last k characters of t. Because when you merge two copies of s with an overlap of k, the merged string would be s[0 ... L-k-1] + s[L-k ... L-1] + s[L-k ... L-",

So t would be that, and L is 11, k=1. Then t[L - k:] is t[10:] which is 'a', and t[k:L] is t[1:11] which is 'brakadabra'. Wait, but that doesn't match. Wait, maybe my earlier logic is wrong.\n                # Let me think again. If the two messages are s and s, merged with overlap k. Then the merged string is s[0 ... L -k -1] + s[L -k ... L -1] + s[L -k ... L -1] (the second s starts at position L -k). Wait, no. When you merge two messages, the first message ends with the overlapping part, and the second message starts with that same overlapping part. So the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], but the overlapping part is removed once. So the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the total length is L + (L - k) = 2L -k = n. So for the given t, it should be equal to s + s[k:]. Since s is the original message, which is of length L. So s is the first L characters of t. Then, the rest of the string (from L onwards) should be s[k:]. So t[L:] == s[k:]. Since s is t[:L], then s[k:] is t[k:L]. So the check is whether t[L:] == t[k:L].\n                # Let me see with the example given in the problem statement. For the input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which has length 21. Let's say L is 11 (original message length), then k = 2*11 -21 = 1. Then t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra'. And t[k:L] is t[1:11] which is 'brakadabra'? Wait, no. Wait, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming the first example input). Let me check. Original s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Merging with k=1: the merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21). So t would be that. Now, for L=11, k=1. Then t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). And t[k:L] is t[1:11] which is 'brakadabra' (length 10). Wait, but that's not equal. Hmm, there's a mistake here. So what's wrong?\n\n                # Oh, I think I made a mistake here. The merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], which has length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. But in this case, L=11, k=1, so 2*11-1=21, which matches the length of the example input. But for the merged string, the part after the first L characters is s[k:], which is s[1:11], which is the substring from index 1 to 10 (since Python is exclusive on the end). So for s = 'abrakadabra', s[1:] is 'brakadabra' (length 10). So the merged string is s (11 chars) + s[1:] (10 chars) = 21 chars. So the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (which is the first example input). Now, for t = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', L=11, k=1. Then t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (the last 11 characters). But s[k:] is 'brakadabra' (10 characters). So how can t[L:] be equal to s[k:]? It's not. So there's a mistake in my earlier logic.\n\n                # What's wrong here? Let me re-express this. The merged string is s + s[k:]. So the merged string is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. So t should be equal to this. Therefore, the first L characters of t is s, and the remaining part (of length L -k) is s[k:]. Therefore, the entire t is s + s[k:], which implies that t[L -k:] == s[k:] (because the part after the first L -k characters is s[k:]). Wait, no. Let's think of the merged string as s[0...L-k-1] + s[L-k ... L-1] + s[L-k ... L-1] (the second s starts at L-k). Wait, no. The first message is s, and the second message is s. They are merged by overlapping k characters. So the first message ends with the overlapping part, and the second message starts with that overlapping part. Therefore, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:] (since the first k characters of the second message are overlapping with the last k of the first message). So the merged string is s + s[k:], which is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n.\n\n                # Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:]. Since s is the first L characters of t, then s[k:] is t[k:L]. So the part after the first L characters of t must be equal to t[k:L]. But the length of the part after the first L characters is n - L = (2L -k) - L = L -k. And the length of t[k:L] is L -k. So yes, they have the same length. Therefore, the check is whether t[L:] == t[k:L].\n\n                # In the example, for L=11, k=1, t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). But t[k:L] is t[1:11] which is 'brakadabra' (length 10). So this would not match. But according to the example, the correct answer is YES with s = 'abrakadabra' (length 11). So clearly, there's a mistake in my logic.\n\n                # What's wrong here? Let me take the example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21). The correct s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). So the merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21). So the first 11 characters are 'abrakadabra', and the next 10 are 'brakadabra'. So t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (11 characters), but s[k:] is s[1:] which is 'brakadabra' (10 characters). So t[L:] is longer than s[k:]. So why does this work? Because the merged string is s + s[k:], which is 11 + 10 = 21 characters. So t[L:] is s[k:]? No, because L is 11, and the length of t is 21. So t[L:] is from index 11 to 20 (inclusive), which is 10 characters. Which is exactly s[k:] (10 characters). So in this case, t[L:] is 'abrakadabra'? Wait, no. Let me take the actual string:\n\n                # Original s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' (11) + 'brakadabra' (10) → total 21 letters. So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra'. So the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', the next 10 are 'brakadabra'. So t[11:] is the substring starting at index 11, which is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). And t[k:L] is t[1:11], which is from index 1 to 10 (inclusive), which is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So yes, they are equal. Oh! Because the length of t is 21, and L is 11, so t[L:] is t[11:21], which is 10 characters. And t[k:L] is t[1:11], which is 10 characters. So in this case, t[L:] == t[k:L]. That works.\n\n                # So the correct check is whether t[L:] == t[k:L]. So for the example, it's true.\n\n                # So the code needs to check this condition.\n\n                if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n                    result = t[:L]\n                    found = True\n                    break\n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",

So t[L:] is t[11:] which is 'abrakadabra' (11 characters), but s[k:] is s[1:] which is 'brakadabra' (10 characters). So t[L:] is longer than s[k:]. So why does this work? Because the merged string is s + s[k:], which is 11 + 10 = 21 characters. So t[L:] is s[k:]? No, because L is 11, and the length of t is 21. So t[L:] is from index 11 to 20 (inclusive), which is 10 characters. Which is exactly s[k:] (10 characters). So in this case, t[L:] is 'abrakadabra'? Wait, no. Let me take the actual string:\n\n                # Original s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' (11) + 'brakadabra' (10) → total 21 letters. So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra'. So the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', the next 10 are 'brakadabra'. So t[11:] is the substring starting at index 11, which is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). And t[k:L] is t[1:11], which is from index 1 to 10 (inclusive), which is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So yes, they are equal. Oh! Because the length of t is 21, and L is 11, so t[L:] is t[11:21], which is 10 characters. And t[k:L] is t[1:11], which is 10 characters. So in this case, t[L:] == t[k:L]. That works.\n\n                # So the correct check is whether t[L:] == t[k:L]. So for the example, it's true.\n\n                # So the code needs to check this condition.\n\n                if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n                    result = t[:L]\n                    found = True\n                    break\n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
