He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about splitting n problems into exactly k days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous block of problems starting from the beginning. So the first day's problems are the first t1 problems, the second day's are next t2, etc., and the sum of all t_i is n. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima. We need to maximize this total profit.\n\nThe input gives n and k, followed by the array a of difficulties.\n\nConstraints: n up to 2000, k up to n. So O(n^3) might be too slow. But maybe with some optimizations, we can do it.\n\nFirst, let's think about dynamic programming. Because for each position and number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach.\n\nLet's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nOur goal is dp[n][k].\n\nNow, how to transition between states?\n\nFor dp[i][j], we need to consider where the j-th day starts. Suppose that the j-th day takes m problems. Then, the previous j-1 days must cover i - m problems, and the current day's max is the maximum of a[i - m + 1 ... i].\n\nSo for each i and j, we can look back at all possible m (from 1 to i - (j-1)), because we need to have at least j-1 days before. Wait, since for j days, the first j-1 days must have at least j-1 problems. So for the j-th day, the number of problems in the j-th day can be m, and the previous j-1 days would have i - m problems. So m must be at least 1, and i - m >= j-1 - 1? No, wait, the previous j-1 days must have exactly (i - m) problems, which must be split into j-1 days. Therefore, i - m must be >= j-1. So m <= i - (j-1).\n\nTherefore, for each i and j, we can iterate m from 1 to i - (j-1). But for each possible m, we can compute the maximum of a[i - m + 1 ... i], then add it to dp[i - m][j-1].\n\nBut computing the max for every possible interval is O(n) per interval, leading to O(n^3) time. For n=2000, that's 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to precompute the maximums for all intervals efficiently.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can precompute a 2D array max_range[i][j], which represents the maximum value in a[i..j] (assuming 1-based or 0-based indices). Then, when we need the maximum for a certain interval, we can retrieve it in O(1) time.\n\nHow to precompute max_range?\n\nWe can compute for all possible start and end positions. For each start i, we can keep track of the current max as we expand the end j. So for i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1:\n\nmax_range[i][j] = max(max_range[i][j-1], a[j])\n\nThis would take O(n^2) time and space, which for n=2000 is 4 million entries. That's acceptable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done in O(n^2) time.\n\nSo the overall plan is:\n\n1. Precompute max_range for all intervals.\n\n2. Initialize the DP table.\n\n3. For each i from 1 to n, and for each j from 1 to k, compute dp[i][j] as the maximum over all possible m (number of problems on the j-th day) of dp[i - m][j-1] + max_range[i - m][i - 1], assuming that the array is 0-based.\n\nWait, let's clarify the indices. Let's assume that the array is 0-based. So for the first i problems (i elements), and splitting into j days. Then, for the j-th day, the last day could be m problems. So the previous j-1 days would have covered i - m problems. So the j-th day is from (i - m) to i - 1 (since the first i - m problems are covered in j-1 days, and then the next m problems are the j-th day). So the interval is [i - m, i - 1].\n\nSo for the DP transition, for each i and j, we can iterate m from 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems into exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulties of each day's problems, is maximized. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and precomputing ranges for efficient maximum value queries.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: Use a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum difficulty from index `i` to `j` in the list of problems. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum difficulty for any subarray in constant time.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days. The transition between states involves considering all possible ways to split the first `i` problems into `j` days by iterating over the number of problems on the last day.\n3. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After computing the DP table, backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the distribution of problems across each day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        max_range[i][i] = current_max\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    # Also keep track of the path\n    prev = [[[-1, -1] for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]  # [prev_i, prev_j]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            if j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = max_range[0][i-1]\n                prev[i][j] = [0, 0]\n            else:\n                # Try all possible m (number of problems on the j-th day)\n                # m can be from 1 to i - (j-1)\n                # So the previous day ends at i - m\n                max_val = 0\n                best_m = 1\n                for m in range(1, i - (j-1) + 1):\n                    prev_i = i - m\n                    current_max = max_range[prev_i][i-1]\n                    total = dp[prev_i][j-1] + current_max\n                    if total > max_val:\n                        max_val = total\n                        best_m = m\n                dp[i][j] = max_val\n                prev[i][j] = [i - best_m, j-1]\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    result = []\n    current_i = n\n    current_j = k\n    while current_j > 0:\n        prev_i, prev_j = prev[current_i][current_j]\n        m = current_i - prev_i\n        result.append(m)\n        current_i = prev_i\n        current_j -= 1\n    result.reverse()\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_range` array is filled using dynamic programming where each entry `max_range[i][j]` is computed based on the maximum value from the previous entries, ensuring efficient range maximum queries.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The `dp` table is filled by considering all possible splits of the first `i` problems into `j` days. For each possible split, the maximum profit is calculated using precomputed maximum values.\n3. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to reconstruct the distribution of problems across days, ensuring the optimal solution is derived efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit using dynamic programming and precomputed range maxima, resulting in an optimal solution within feasible time complexity for the given constraints.",
