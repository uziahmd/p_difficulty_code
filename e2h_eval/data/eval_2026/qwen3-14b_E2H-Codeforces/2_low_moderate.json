Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nSo, the problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check all the cells on the two diagonals. Let me think: for a square of size n x n, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But wait, since n is odd, these two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo for the first condition, all cells on both diagonals must be the same. So, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal also has all 'x's, then that's okay. But if one diagonal has 'x' and the other has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nBut how do I check that? Well, I can collect all the characters on the diagonals and check that they are all the same. But also, the two diagonals must have the same character. Because if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'a', that's okay. But if the main is 'a' and the anti is 'b', then no.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters from both diagonals. Check that they are all the same. Let's think about that.\n\nThen, the second condition: all other squares (those not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, for example, if the diagonals are all 'x', then all other cells must be the same, say 'y', and 'y' != 'x'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same, and that they are not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid, determine whether it is on either of the two diagonals. For a cell (i, j), it is on the main diagonal if i == j. It is on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells not on either diagonal, they must be the same as each other, and different from the diagonal_char.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Read the grid.\n\n- Find the diagonal_char. For that, collect all characters from the diagonals. Check that all are the same. If any are different, return NO.\n\n- Then, collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same and different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. So for example, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j), check if it is on a diagonal. For each cell, if i == j or i + j == n - 1, then it is part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo for the first step, collect all the characters from the diagonals. Let's collect them into a set. If the length of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, the same for the non-diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but the diagonals may have overlapping cells (the center cell). So for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is on both diagonals. But when collecting, we can just collect all the cells from both diagonals, but even if there are duplicates, the set will have only one element if all are same.\n\nSo, for the first check:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    return \"NO\"\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because for the first part, all the diagonal cells must have the same character. So the set should have exactly one element. So that check is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to check the non-diagonal cells. For those, collect all their characters into another set. Let's call",
