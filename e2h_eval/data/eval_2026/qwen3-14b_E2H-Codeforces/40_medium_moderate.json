    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the inversion count of p is greater than that of q. And we have to do this for n up to 500, which suggests that a brute-force approach is impossible. So I need a smart way to compute this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of possible pairs. Since p and q are permutations, there are n! permutations each. But since p must be lex smaller than q, the total number of such pairs without considering the inversion condition would be (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. But here we have to consider the inversion counts.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q?\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For each permutation, we can compute its inversion count. Let's denote inv(p) as the number of inversions in p. Now, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we need to count those where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut considering that for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nLet’s denote for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p != q, the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 if p < q, but how?\n\nWait, no. For each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in the required condition. Specifically, if inv(p) > inv(q), then (p, q) will be counted if p < q, and (q, p) will be counted if q < p. But since inv(p) > inv(q), the required condition is only satisfied when p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Similarly, for the case where inv(q) > inv(p), the required condition is satisfied when q < p and inv(q) > inv(p). \n\nBut how does this help us? Well, the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 if p < q, but that's not helpful directly. However, considering that for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) contributes to the count. So the total number of valid ordered pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 (if p < q) plus the same for inv(q) > inv(p) multiplied by 1 (if q < p). But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p < q or q < p) is present, the total number of valid ordered pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 (since in exactly one of the ordered pairs, the condition p < q holds). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have two permutations p and q. If inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will have p < q or q < p. So for each unordered pair where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of pairs where p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, either p < q or q < p, the number of such unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) (but that's the same as inv(p) < inv(q)). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nTotal number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) = ?\n\nLet’s denote S as the set of all unordered pairs {p, q} where p ≠ q. For each such pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. Let’s say that for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will contribute to the answer. Specifically, if inv(p) > inv(q), then the answer counts (p, q) if p < q. Otherwise, if inv(q) > inv(p), then (q, p) is counted if q < p. So the total answer is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q in that pair. But how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p ≠ q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each pair, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) is true (assuming inv(p) != inv(q)), but what if inv(p) = inv(q)? Then neither contributes.\n\nSo, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). Let me denote T as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q). Then, the number of such pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is T / 2. However, this is only true if for every pair with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) is true. Which is correct.\n\nNow, considering that for each of these T/2 pairs, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) satisfies p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how many such pairs are there?\n\nWait, but the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is T/2, and for each of them, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q in that pair. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p < q) or (q < p) exists, the total number of such ordered pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1, but only if in that unordered pair, the p < q condition holds. Wait, but how can we know that? Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs is in the p < q category. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the fraction of ordered pairs in that set that satisfy p < q. Which is 1/2? No, because for each unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the p < q category. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1, but that's not possible. Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 if in that pair, the p is lex smaller than q. But how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. For each such pair, we check whether inv(p) > inv(q). The total answer is the count of these pairs.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe key insight here is that for all permutations p and q, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q) minus the number of pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q) and p < q.\n\nBut even that might not help directly. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me first precompute for all permutations, their inversion counts. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, check if inv(p) > inv(q). Summing over all such pairs gives the answer. However, for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big. So we can't compute this directly.\n\nThus, we need a mathematical approach to compute the answer without enumerating all permutations.\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For a permutation of size n, the number of inversions can range from 0 (sorted) to C(n, 2) (reverse sorted). Let's denote for each possible inversion count k, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions as f(k).\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding the sum over all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think about how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me first compute the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. This is equal to (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Because for each pair of distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations choose 2) = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nBut how to find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each possible inversion count k and l, compute the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l, and p < q. Then, for all k > l, sum these counts.\n\nSo the answer is sum_{k > l} (number of p with inv(p)=k) * (number of q with inv(q)=l) * (probability that p < q given inv(p)=k and inv(q)=l).\n\nBut how to compute that probability?\n\nWait, but for permutations with different inversion counts, how many pairs (p, q) have p < q? For example, if we have two permutations p and q with different inversion counts, how often is p < q?\n\nThis seems difficult. However, perhaps there's some symmetry here. Suppose that for all permutations p and q with inv(p) = k and inv(q) = l, and k != l, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to (number of such pairs) * 1/2. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) = k and inv(q) = l and k != l, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = k, inv(q) = l is equal to (count_k * count_l) / 2 if k != l. Wait, no. Because for each pair of permutations (p, q) where inv(p) =k and inv(q) = l, and k != l, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the p < q set. So for all such pairs, the number of (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) =k, inv(q) = l is equal to (count_k * count_l) / 2 if k != l. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs is counted in p < q.\n\nBut wait, this is only true when k != l. Because if k = l, then both permutations have the same inversion count. So for those pairs, we can't assume anything about their lex order.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nThe total answer is the sum over all k > l of (count_k * count_l) * 1/2.\n\nBut why? Because for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) =k and inv(q) = l, and k > l, we want to count the number of pairs where p < q. Since k != l, the total number of such pairs is (count_k * count_l) / 2, because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So for k > l, the pairs (p, q) with inv(p) =k and inv(q) = l contribute (count_k * count_l) / 2 to the answer. Because in those pairs, exactly half of them will have p < q, and for those, inv(p) is larger than inv(q). So the answer is sum_{k > l} (count_k * count_l) / 2.\n\nWait, but this seems to ignore the cases where k = l. Because when k = l, the pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) would not contribute to the answer (since inv(p) is not greater than inv(q)). So the answer is indeed the sum over all k > l of (count_k * count_l) / 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because if we have two permutations p and q with inv(p) =k and inv(q) = l where k > l, then for exactly half of the ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) =k and inv(q) = l, p is lex smaller than q. So the total number of such pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{k > l} (count_k * count_l) / 2.\n\nBut then, how does that fit with the example given?\n\nLet's take the sample input n=4. According to the sample output, the answer is 17. Let's compute using this formula.\n\nFirst, for n=4, the total number of permutations is 24. Let's compute count_k for each k. The inversion counts for n=4 are:\n\nThe possible inversion counts range from 0 to 6 (since C(4,2) = 6). Let me look up the inversion numbers for n=4.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The identity permutation [1,2,3,4] has 0 inversions.\n- [1,2,4,3] has 1 inversion.\n- [1,3,2,4] has 1 inversion.\n- [2,1,3,4] has 1 inversion.\n- [1,3,4,2] has 2 inversions.\n- etc.\n\nBut instead of calculating manually, perhaps there's a way to compute count_k for all k. However, for n=4, the count of permutations with k inversions can be found via dynamic programming. But for our problem, we need to compute for general n up to 500, which suggests that we need an efficient way to compute the inversion counts for all permutations.\n\nBut back to the sample. Let's assume that the formula is correct. For n=4, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{k > l} (count_k * count_l)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute for n=4:\n\nWe need to compute the count for each inversion number.\n\nFor n=4, the inversion counts for all permutations are as follows (from OEIS A008302):\n\nThe number of permutations of n elements with k inversions. For n=4:\n\nk | count\n0 | 1\n1 | 1+1+1 = 3?\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the actual numbers.\n\nFor n=4, the inversion counts are:\n\nThe inversion numbers are:\n\n0: 1\n\n1: 3\n\n2: 5\n\n3: 6\n\n4: 5\n\n5: 3\n\n6: 1\n\nWait, but adding these up gives 1+3+5+6+5+3+1 = 24, which is correct for 4!.\n\nSo count_0 =1, count_1=3, count_2=5, count_3=6, count_4=5, count_5=3, count_6=1.\n\nNow, according to the formula, the answer would be sum_{k>l} (count_k * count_l)/2.\n\nLet me compute this sum.\n\nWe need to compute for all pairs (k, l) where k > l, multiply count_k * count_l and sum them all, then divide by 2.\n\nLet me compute the sum S = sum_{k > l} count_k * count_l.\n\nThen the answer would be S / 2.\n\nSo compute S:\n\nFor each k from 0 to 6, and l from 0 to k-1:\n\nsum for k=0: nothing.\n\nk=1: l=0 → 3*1 = 3\n\nk=2: l=0 → 5*1=5; l=1 →5*3=15 → total 20\n\nk=3: l=0 →6*1=6; l=1→6*3=18; l=2→6*5=30 → total 54\n\nk=4: l=0→5*1=5; l=1→5*3=15; l=2→5*5=25; l=3→5*6=30 → total 5+15+25+30=75\n\nk=5: l=0→3*1=3; l=1→3*3=9; l=2→3*5=15; l=3→3*6=18; l=4→3*5=15 → total 3+9+15+18+15= 60\n\nk=6: l=0→1*1=1; l=1→1*3=3; l=2→1*5=5; l=3→1*6=6; l=4→1*5=5; l=5→1*3=3 → sum 1+3+5+6+5+3=23.\n\nAdding all these up:\n\nk=1: 3\n\nk=2: 20 → total 23\n\nk=3: 54 → total 77\n\nk=4: 75 → total 152\n\nk=5: 60 → total 212\n\nk=6: 23 → total 235.\n\nSo S = 235. Then the answer would be 235 / 2 = 117.5? Which is not possible, but the sample output is 17. So clearly, this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this shows that the formula is incorrect. So there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous reasoning was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nThe sample input says that for n=4, the answer is 17. But according to this approach, the answer would be 235 / 2 = 117.5, which is impossible. Therefore, the assumption that the answer is sum_{k > l} (count_k * count_l)/2 is incorrect.\n\nSo why is this wrong?\n\nBecause the earlier reasoning assumed that for any pair of permutations with different inversion counts, exactly half of the ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q would have inv(p) > inv(q). But that's not the case. Because the inversion counts and the lex order are not independent. For example, a permutation with higher inversion count may be lex smaller than a permutation with lower inversion count. So the relationship between the inversion counts and the lex order is not symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the earlier approach is invalid. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: For all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we need to count those with inv(p) > inv(q). How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of generating all pairs of permutations p and q, and for each such pair, check if p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). But for n up to 500, this is impossible due to the factorial growth. So we need a way to compute this using dynamic programming or combinatorial properties.\n\nAnother idea: For each permutation p, compute the number of permutations q such that q > p (lex order) and inv(q) < inv(p). Then sum over all p.\n\nBut again, how to compute this for all p?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For all pairs of permutations (p, q), where p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of such pairs (p < q) minus the number of pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q) and p < q.\n\nBut again, how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q. As before, this is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nLet me denote A as the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). We need to find A.\n\nAlso, let me denote B as the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). And C as the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nThen, T = A + B + C.\n\nBut since for any pair of distinct permutations (p, q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Let me consider all pairs (p, q) with p != q. Let me denote D as the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). Then, D = A + (number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)).\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for all pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), they contribute to either A (if p < q) or to B' (where B' is the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p))? Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nFor each pair (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So the number of such pairs where p < q is A, and the number of such pairs where q < p is the number of pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) (since inv(p) > inv(q) implies inv(q) < inv(p)). So the total D = A + B', where B' is the number of pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But B' is equal to B, since B is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). So D = A + B.\n\nBut also, D is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q). Which is equal to (total number of pairs with inv(p) != inv(q)) / 2. Because for each pair with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. Let me denote E as the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). Then, the total number of pairs with inv(p) != inv(q) is T_total = (n! * (n! - 1)) ), since there are n! * (n! - 1) ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q. Then D = (T_total - E) / 2.\n\nSo, D = (T_total - E)/2 = (n! * (n! - 1) - E)/2.\n\nBut D = A + B, and T = A + B + C. Also, T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Let me try to express A in terms of other variables.\n\nSince D = A + B, and D = (T_total - E)/2 = (2T - E)/2 = T - E/2.\n\nSo:\n\nA + B = T - E/2.\n\nBut from T = A + B + C → B = T - A - C.\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation:\n\nA + (T - A - C) = T - E/2 → T - C = T - E/2 → C = E/2 → E = 2C.\n\nBut what is E? E is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = inv(q). Which is sum_{k} (count_k)^2. Because for each k, there are count_k permutations with inv count k, so the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = inv(q) is sum (count_k)^2.\n\nOn the other hand, C is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is equal to sum_{k} (count_k choose 2). Because for each k, the number of unordered pairs of permutations with inv count k is count_k choose 2, and each such pair contributes exactly one ordered pair (p, q) with p < q.\n\nSo E = sum (count_k)^2 = sum (count_k choose 2) * 2 + sum (count_k) * 1 (since for each pair (p, q), (p, q) and (q, p) are counted in E if inv(p) = inv(q), except when p=q. So E = sum (count_k * count_k) = sum (count_k choose 2) * 2 + sum count_k (since for p=q, it's counted once). But since the original problem considers p and q as distinct permutations (since p < q implies p != q), the E here includes all ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q) plus the pairs where p=q. However, in our previous equations, E is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = inv(q), including p=q. But in our problem, when we talk about D, we are considering p != q. So perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLet me re-define:\n\nLet me denote E_total = sum_{k} (count_k)^2. This is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) including p = q.\n\nBut in our problem, when we consider D, it's for p != q. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) > inv(q) is D = (T_total - E') / 2, where E' is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is E_total - sum (count_k) (because for p=q, there are sum count_k such pairs, each with inv(p) = inv(q)).\n\nSo E' = E_total - sum count_k = sum count_k^2 - sum count_k.\n\nBut this might complicate things further. However, returning to the previous equations, perhaps I should find a way to express A in terms of D and B.\n\nAlternatively, since I need to find A, and I know that T = A + B + C, and that D = A + B = (T_total - E')/2, where T_total is n!*(n! - 1) (the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q), and E' is the number of ordered pairs with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is E_total - sum count_k (since E_total is sum count_k^2, and sum count_k is the number of pairs (p, p)).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me think of another way.\n\nLet me return to the sample input. For n=4, the answer is 17. Let's see what the correct value of A is.\n\nIn the sample explanation, there are 17 valid pairs. So A = 17.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, the formula gave us 235/2 = 117.5, which is way off. So clearly, the previous assumption that for each pair (p, q) with k != l, exactly half of them contribute to A is wrong. Hence, we need to find another way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem requires counting pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's consider all pairs of permutations p and q. For each such pair, we can determine if p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). The challenge is to find this count efficiently.\n\nBut for large n, we need to find a way to compute this using dynamic programming or combinatorics.\n\nLet me think about generating functions or dynamic programming for inversion counts. For example, for each permutation, its inversion count can be computed, and we can find for all pairs of permutations p and q with certain properties.\n\nBut again, for n=500, storing all inversion counts is not feasible. So we need to find a way to compute the required sum without explicitly storing all permutations.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each permutation p, let's compute the number of permutations q such that q > p (lex order) and inv(q) < inv(p). Then sum over all p.\n\nThis is equivalent to A, since for each p, the number of q > p with inv(q) < inv(p) is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each permutation p, compute the number of permutations q that are lex larger than p and have fewer inversions than p. Summing this over all p gives the answer.\n\nBut how can we compute this for all p efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can find that for all permutations p, the number of q > p with inv(q) < inv(p) is equal to some function based on the inversion count of p and its position in the lex order.\n\nBut I don't see an obvious way to compute this.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(q) < inv(p), which is the same as the number of pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But this doesn't seem to help directly.\n\nAnother Idea: For all permutations, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Let me denote that the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is A, and the number where inv(p) < inv(q) is B. Then, since for each pair (p, q) with p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q), we have A + B + C = T, where C is the number of pairs with equal inversion counts.\n\nBut since for each pair of distinct permutations (p, q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + B', where B' is the number of pairs (q, p) with q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But since B is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), this is equal to B. Thus, the total number of such pairs is A + B = D, where D is the number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) for all p != q.\n\nBut earlier, we said that D = (total_pairs_without_equal_inversion) / 2. So D = (T_total - E') / 2, where T_total is n! * (n! - 1), and E' is the number of pairs with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut T_total = 2*T, since T is (n! * (n! - 1))/2. So D = (2T - E') / 2 = T - E'/2.\n\nBut also, D = A + B. And from A + B + C = T, we have B = T - A - C.\n\nSubstituting into D = A + B:\n\nD = A + T - A - C = T - C → T - C = T - E'/2 → C = E'/2.\n\nBut C is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Which is equal to (sum_k (count_k choose 2)).\n\nAnd E' is the number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), which is sum_k (count_k choose 2) * 2. Because for each pair (p, q) with p != q and same inversion count, both (p, q) and (q, p) are counted in E', and the number of such pairs is sum_k (count_k * (count_k - 1)) = sum_k (count_k choose 2) * 2. Hence, E' = 2*C. Substituting into C = E'/2 gives C = C, which checks out.\n\nSo, going back to D = T - C. And D = A + B. But we also know that B = T - A - C. Substituting into D = A + B gives D = A + T - A - C = T - C, which matches.\n\nBut how does this help us find A?\n\nWe have:\n\nA = D - B.\n\nBut D = T - C.\n\nAnd B = number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q).\n\nBut how to find B?\n\nAlternatively, since D = T - C, and D = A + B, and also A + B = T - C, and A + B + C = T, which is consistent.\n\nBut this doesn't give us new information.\n\nLet me think about the sample input again. For n=4, T = (24 * 23)/2 = 276.\n\nC is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and equal inversion counts. For n=4, sum_k (count_k choose 2) = (1 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (5 choose 2) + (6 choose 2) + (5 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (1 choose 2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1 choose 2 = 0\n\n3 choose 2 = 3\n\n5 choose 2 = 10\n\n6 choose 2 = 15\n\n5 choose 2 = 10\n\n3 choose 2 = 3\n\n1 choose 2 = 0.\n\nSumming: 0 + 3 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 3 + 0 = 41. So C = 41.\n\nThen D = T - C = 276 - 41 = 235. Which is what we computed earlier. And D = A + B. But we also",
