During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the problem. Let me first understand what's happening here. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for a given k, we have x = a +k and y = b +k. But since both x and y are increasing as k increases, maybe there's a way to find the optimal k where their LCM is minimized.\n\nWait, but how do we find that k? Because for different k values, the LCM can vary in complex ways. Let's think about the difference between a and b. Let me assume that a and b are not equal. Let me suppose that a < b. Then, when we add k to both, the difference between them remains the same. Let's see: (b +k) - (a +k) = b -a. So, the difference is fixed. Let me denote d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume a ≤ b. So, d = b -a. Then, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x = a +k. Wait, because if a is smaller than b, then x = a +k, and y = b +k = x + (b -a) = x +d.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, where x = a +k. Since k is non-negative, x must be ≥ a. Also, since k can be zero, x starts from a.\n\nBut how to find x such that LCM(x, x+d) is minimized. Let's think about the LCM of x and x+d. Since x and x+d have a difference of d, their GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). Let me recall that GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Therefore, LCM(x, x+d) = x*(x+d)/GCD(x, d). So, for fixed d, the LCM depends on x and GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find x ≥ a (since k ≥0 implies x = a +k ≥a) such that x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d) is minimized. Then, once we find the optimal x, k would be x -a.\n\nBut how to find this x? Let's think about possible candidates for x. Since d is fixed, perhaps the optimal x is such that x divides d, or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, but that might not always be the case.\n\nLet me take the first example: a=6, b=10. Then d = 4. So, x is 6 +k. We need to find x such that LCM(x, x+4) is minimized. For k=2, x is 8. Then x+4 is 12. Their LCM is 24. What about other x's?\n\nIf x is 6 (k=0), then numbers are 6 and 10. LCM is 30. For x=7, numbers are 7 and 11. LCM is 77. For x=8, 8 and 12 → LCM is 24. For x=9, 9 and 13 → LCM 117. For x=10, 10 and 14 → LCM is 70. So indeed 24 is the minimum. So the optimal x is 8 here.\n\nBut why is that? Let's think about the formula. For x and x+d, the LCM is x*(x+d)/g, where g = gcd(x, d). Let me think: for d fixed, to minimize the LCM, perhaps we want to maximize the GCD. Because the LCM is inversely proportional to the GCD. So, the larger the GCD, the smaller the LCM.\n\nSo, the idea is to find x ≥a such that the GCD of x and d is as large as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose d is fixed. Let me denote g = gcd(x, d). Then, since g divides d, and x must be a multiple of g. Let me write x = g * m, and d = g * n. Then, since x and d share the GCD of g, m and n are coprime. Then, the LCM of x and x+d is (g*m * (g",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The approach involves leveraging the properties of GCD and LCM to efficiently determine the optimal value of $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The LCM of two numbers $ x $ and $ y $ can be expressed as $ \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} $. For $ x = a + k $ and $ y = b + k $, the difference between $ x $ and $ y $ remains constant, which is $ d = |a - b| $.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The LCM of $ x $ and $ x + d $ can be minimized by maximizing the GCD of $ x $ and $ d $. This is because the LCM is inversely proportional to the GCD. Thus, we need to find values of $ x $ such that $ \\text{GCD}(x, d) $ is maximized.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Instead of checking every possible $ k $, we focus on values of $ x $ that are divisors of $ d $. This reduces the search space significantly, as we only need to check divisors of $ d $.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, which simplifies the problem since $ k = 0 $ would be the optimal solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef find_optimal_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    # We need to check all possible divisors of d\n    for g in divisors:\n        # x must be a multiple of g, and x >= a (since k >=0)\n        # Also, x + d = x + (b - a) if a < b, so x is a + k\n        # Let's find the minimal x that is a multiple of g and >= a\n        # x = m * g, where m is a positive integer\n        # So m must be at least ceil(a / g)\n        m_min = (a + g - 1) // g  # ceiling division\n        x_candidate = m_min * g\n        # Compute corresponding k\n        k_candidate = x_candidate - a\n        # Now compute LCM(x_candidate, x_candidate + d)\n        x = x_candidate\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = compute_gcd(x, d)\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n    \n    # Also check the case where k is such that x = a + k = d - (some value)\n    # Wait, no, we already covered all divisors of d.\n    # But also check for k = (g - a % g) if a % g != 0?\n    # No, since we already computed m_min as the minimal m such that m*g >= a.\n    \n    # Additionally, check for k = 0 if not already considered\n    # Because when a and b are not equal, and d is not zero, but maybe the minimal k is zero\n    # For example, if a=5 and b=10, then d=5.
