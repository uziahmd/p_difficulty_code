Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) is zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need to find the minimal number of such cards required.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think. Each card can contribute a maximum of x (if positive) or a minimum of -x. So, for example, if T is positive, then each new card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of T divided by x. Wait, but maybe there's some adjustment needed based on the remainder.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. For example, 2 + 2 + 1. But since the maximum per card is 2, but the minimum is -2. Wait, but in this case, we want to add positive numbers. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Because each card can contribute up to x. Similarly, if T is negative, then the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), because each card can contribute as low as -x. But wait, for example, T is -5, x is 2. Then each card can contribute -2. So -5 divided by -2 is 2.5, so ceil(2.5) is 3. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. But that's a special case. So the general approach is:\n\nCalculate T = -sum_of_found_cards.\n\nIf T is zero, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf T is positive, then the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, let me check. Suppose T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which would be 2 + 1. But since each card can contribute up to 2. So yes, two cards. But how about if T is 4 and x is 2. Then 4/2 is exactly 2. So two cards. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if T is negative, then we can take the absolute value and do the same calculation. Because each card can contribute up to -x (so for T = -5, we need to get -5 by adding numbers each of which is at least -x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), since each card can contribute at most x in absolute value.\n\nWait, but for example, T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5 /3 is 1.666..., so ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 + 2. But since the maximum per card is 3. So yes, possible.\n\nSo the formula is: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is not divisible by x?\n\nYes, but when you take the absolute value, then divide by x, and take the ceiling, that gives the minimal number of cards needed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute sum of found cards. Let's call it S.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the absolute value of T, then divide by x. Take the ceiling of that division.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the ceiling of division in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, to compute ceil(a / b), where a and b are positive integers, you can do (a + b -1) // b.\n\nYes. So for example, 5 / 2 is 2.5. (5 + 2 -1) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for T being positive, the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut let's check some examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1: input is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the target",
