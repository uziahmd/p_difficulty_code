They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values provided for each edge (road). So, each road between two lawns has a GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two lawns. Our task is to find if there's a valid assignment of mushroom counts to each lawn that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how the GCD and LCM relate to the two numbers. For two numbers a and b, we know that GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. But here, for each edge, we have the GCD and LCM given. Let's denote for an edge between u and v, the GCD is g and LCM is l. Then, the product of the two numbers (a_u * a_v) must be equal to g * l. Also, since the GCD is g, both a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Let me think: So, a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where GCD(x, y) = 1. Because if x and y had a common divisor greater than 1, then the GCD of a_u and a_v would be higher than g. Also, since LCM(a_u, a_v) is g * x * y (since LCM(a_u, a_v) = (a_u * a_v)/GCD(a_u, a_v) = (g^2 x y)/g = g x y). But the given LCM is l. Therefore, we have that g * x * y = l. So x * y = l / g. But since x and y are coprime, this implies that x and y must be divisors of l/g and their product is exactly l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, they must be factors of l/g such that they are coprime.\n\nWait, but how do we determine x and y? Well, for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are such that x*y = l/g and GCD(x,y)=1. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value, and edges enforce certain relationships between adjacent nodes.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can think of each node's value as being a multiple of the GCD of its edges. But perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by some factors, and we need to assign values in such a way that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a graph where each edge imposes constraints on the values of the two nodes. For example, if there's an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then:\n\na_u = g * x\n\na_v = g * y\n\nwith x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nBut since x and y are coprime, this means that x must be a divisor of l/g and y must be another divisor such that their product is l/g and they are coprime.\n\nBut how do we choose x and y? For example, if l/g is 6, then possible (x,y) pairs could be (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But since x and y are coprime, these are the only possibilities.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the same node can be connected to multiple edges, so the choices for x and y in different edges must be consistent.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. However, the challenge is to assign values to each node such that for every edge, the GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to model this as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base value, and for each edge, the relationship between the two nodes is determined by the GCD and LCM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. However, since GCD and LCM are not linear operations, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: Since for each edge between u and v, the product a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. So, the ratio between a_u and a_v must be such that when divided by g, they are coprime. Let me think again: Let's take a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, GCD(x, y) must be 1, and LCM(a_u, a_v) = g * x * y. Which must equal l. So x*y = l/g. Therefore, for each edge, we have that l must be divisible by g. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, that's an important check. If for any edge, l is not divisible by g, then the answer is immediately \"NO\", because x*y would not be integer. So first, for each edge, we need to check that l is a multiple of g. If not, output NO.\n\nSo that's a preliminary check. Let's note that.\n\nOnce that is done, for each edge, we can compute k = l/g. Then, x * y = k, and GCD(x, y) = 1. So, x and y are coprime factors of k. Now, for each edge, the two nodes u and v must have their values set such that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y. However, the problem is that the same node can be part of multiple edges, so the x and y for different edges must be compatible.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a constraint satisfaction problem. For example, if two edges share a node, the values assigned to that node must be consistent across all edges.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a graph and Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others, and we can perform a BFS or DFS to assign values.\n\nLet me think of this as building a graph where each node's value is determined based on the edges. For example, if we have a connected component, perhaps we can assign a value to one node, and then propagate the constraints to the rest of the nodes.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph (since the graph may be disconnected), we can assign a value to one node, and then determine the values of other nodes based on the edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nSuppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node, say u. Assign a value to u. Then, for each edge connected to u, we can determine the possible value of the adjacent node. However, since there may be multiple possibilities, we need to make sure that the assignments are consistent across the entire component.\n\nWait, but how do we choose the values? For example, for an edge between u and v, once we have a_u, then a_v is determined as (g * l) / a_u. But wait, since a_u * a_v = g*l, then yes. However, we also need to ensure that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. Let's see:\n\nIf a_u * a_v = g*l, then the GCD(a_u, a_v) must be g. But how?\n\nBecause if a_u = g*x, a_v = g*y, then GCD(gx, gy) = g * GCD(x, y). And since x and y are coprime, this equals g. So that condition is satisfied as long as x and y are coprime. But how do we ensure that x and y are coprime?\n\nAh, but earlier, we have that x*y = k = l/g. So if we can find x and y such that x*y = k and GCD(x, y) = 1, then the GCD of a_u and a_v will be g. However, given that a_u and a_v are determined by the product, but how do we ensure that the x and y are coprime?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to assign a_u and a_v such that their product is g*l, and their GCD is g. Let me think: Let me take a_u and a_v. Let me suppose that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then their product is g^2 x y = g * l => x y = l/g. Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) is g * GCD(x, y). For this to equal g, GCD(x, y) must be 1. Therefore, the x and y must be coprime. Therefore, for any edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to k = l/g. However, given that, once we have a_u, then a_v is determined as (g*l)/a_u. But then, we have to check that GCD(a_u, a_v) is indeed g. How?\n\nBecause if a_u is chosen such that it divides g*l, then a_v is (g*l)/a_u. But then, the GCD of a_u and a_v must be g. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a_u is g * x. Then a_v is (g*l)/(g*x) = l/x. But since l = g * k, and x * y = k, then a_v is g * k /x = g * y. So yes, that's correct. But then, the GCD(a_u, a_v) is g * GCD(x, y). Which must be equal to g. Therefore, GCD(x, y) must be 1. Which implies that x and y are coprime. However, since x * y = k, and they are coprime, then x must be a divisor of k, and y must be k/x. So, for any edge, the value of a_u and a_v must be such that a_u is a divisor of g*l, and a_v is (g*l)/a_u, and also that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Well, if during the assignment process, we can ensure that for each edge, the a_u and a_v are chosen such that their product is g*l and that their GCD is g. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once we have a_u and a_v as (g*l)/a_v and a_v, then the GCD(a_u, a_v) must be equal to g. But how can we ensure that? Let's take an example. Suppose that for an edge, g=2, l=6. Then k = 6/2 = 3. So x*y = 3. Possible pairs (1,3), (3,1). Then, a_u = 2*1 = 2, a_v = 2*3=6. GCD(2,6) is 2. Correct. Or if a_u is 6, a_v is 2. Same result. So in this case, the product is 2*6=12 = 2*6. So the product is correct. And the GCD is 2.\n\nBut what if someone chose a_u as 3, which is not a multiple of 2? Then a_v would be 12/3 =4. Then GCD(3,4) is 1, which is not equal to the required g=2. So this would be invalid. Therefore, the problem is that if during the assignment process, the a_u is not a multiple of g, then the GCD will not be correct.\n\nTherefore, the key is that for each edge, the a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Which implies that when we assign a value to a node, it must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Wait, but how can that be? Because for each edge connected to a node, the node's value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. So if a node is connected to multiple edges, each with their own GCDs, then the node's value must be a multiple of the LCM of all those GCDs. Or perhaps the GCDs of those edges must divide the node's value.\n\nBut how to ensure that? For example, if a node is connected to two edges, one with GCD 2 and another with GCD 3, then the node's value must be a multiple of both 2 and 3. Hence, it must be a multiple of 6. So, the node's value must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it.\n\nBut how do we model this? Well, perhaps during the assignment process, we can track for each node the required factors. However, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge, the two nodes involved must have their values as multiples of the GCD of that edge. So, when we assign a value to a node, it must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, how can we ensure that?\n\nLet me think again about the approach. Let's model this as a graph where each edge between u and v has a certain relation. For each edge, the product of a_u and a_v is fixed as g*l. So, if we can assign a_u and a_v such that their product is fixed, and also that their GCD is g, then the problem is solved. But how to assign these values?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, in a connected component, we can choose a starting node and assign it a value, then propagate the constraints through the edges.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value? Because for the starting node, there are multiple possibilities. For example, suppose the starting node is connected to an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, the product of the starting node's value and its neighbor's value is fixed as g*l. However, the starting node's value must be a multiple of g, and the neighbor's value must also be a multiple of g. So, for example, if the starting node is assigned a value of g * x, then the neighbor's value is (g*l)/(g*x) = l/x. But since l/x must be a multiple of g, because the neighbor's value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge (which is g). So, l/x must be divisible by g. Which implies that x must divide l/g. Which is the same as before.\n\nWait, l/g is k. So x must be a divisor of k, and l/x = g * (k/x) = g * y, where y is k/x. Which is the same as earlier. Therefore, the value of the neighbor is g * y, which is a multiple of g. Therefore, if we choose x as a divisor of k, then the neighbor's value is valid.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning for each edge, the x and y such that x*y = k, and GCD(x,y) = 1. However, since x and y are coprime, once x is chosen, y is determined as k/x. So, for each edge, the choice of x and y is determined by the selection of x (or y) as a divisor of k, with the condition that x and k/x are coprime.\n\nBut how does this affect the propagation of values through the graph?\n\nLet me think of this as building a graph where each node's value is determined by the edges. For example, if I have a starting node u, and assign it a value of g * x (for the first edge connected to it), then the adjacent node v must be assigned g * y, where x*y = k. Then, for the next edges connected to v, the same logic applies.\n\nBut here's the problem: the choice of x for the first edge may affect the possibility of satisfying other edges. For example, if there's a cycle in the graph, the assignments must be consistent around the cycle.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a BFS or DFS traversal, where each node's value is determined based on the edges. However, during traversal, we need to ensure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to handle the choice of x and y for each edge? For example, suppose we have a tree structure. Then, once we assign a value to the root node, the rest of the nodes' values are determined by the edges. However, in a cyclic graph, the assignments must be consistent.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there's a cycle of three nodes: u-v-w-u. Each edge has GCD g and LCM l. Let's say for each edge, k = l/g is 6. So for each edge, the product x*y = 6, with x and y coprime. The possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1).\n\nNow, suppose we start at u, assign x as 1. Then, v's value is 6. Then, moving to w via the edge v-w, which has k=6. Suppose the edge v-w requires that the product of v's value and w's value is g*l. Since v's value is g*6 (from earlier), then w's value would be (g*l) / (g*6) = (g*l) / (g*6) = l/(6). But l = g*k = g*6. So l/(6) = g. Therefore, w's value is g. Then, moving back from w to u via the edge w-u, which has k=6. The product of w's value (g) and u's value (g*1) must be g*l = g*(g*6) = g² *6. But the product of g and g*1 is g². Which is not equal to g² *6. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial choice of x=1 for the first edge leads to inconsistency.\n\nThis suggests that the choice of x for the first edge must be such that the entire cycle is consistent. Therefore, in such cases, we need to find a way to assign x's and y's that satisfy all constraints.\n\nBut how can we do this algorithmically?\n\nPerhaps the key is to model the relations between the nodes as a graph where each edge enforces a ratio between the nodes. For example, if we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then the product of a_u and a_v is fixed. Therefore, a_v = (g*l)/a_u. But also, since a_u must be a multiple of g, and a_v must be a multiple of g. So, during traversal, when we assign a value to a node, the adjacent node's value is determined as (g*l)/a_u, which must be a multiple of g. However, this may not always be possible, leading to a contradiction.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- For each connected component of the graph:\n\n   - Choose a starting node and assign a value to it. However, this value must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Wait, but how?\n\n   - But how to choose the initial value? For example, the starting node could be assigned a value that is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS traversal, for each node, when we reach it from a neighbor, we can compute the required value based on the edge's parameters. However, if the node has already been assigned a value, we need to check that the new value matches the existing one.\n\nBut how to compute the required value. Let's think: Suppose we have an edge between u and v. When we process this edge during BFS, if u has already been assigned a value, then v's value is determined as (g * l) / a_u. However, since the edge's GCD is g, then a_u must be a multiple of g. Similarly, the computed value for v must be a multiple of g. If not, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but how can the computed value for v not be a multiple of g? Because a_u is a multiple of g, and (g*l) is divisible by g. Therefore, (g*l)/a_u = (g*l) / (g * x) = l/x. But l is the LCM, which is given. However, since for this edge, l must be divisible by g (as checked earlier), then l/g = k, which is an integer. Therefore, l = g*k. Therefore, (g*l) = g^2 *k. So (g*l)/a_u = (g^2 *k)/a_u. But a_u is a multiple of g, say a_u = g * x. Then, (g^2 *k) / (g x) ) = g * (k /x). Since x must be a divisor of k (from earlier), then k/x is an integer. Therefore, the computed value for v is g * (k/x), which is a multiple of g. So this is valid.\n\nTherefore, during the BFS traversal, once a node's value is assigned, the adjacent node's value is determined. However, when processing edges, we need to ensure that the computed value for the adjacent node is consistent with any previous assignments.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value for the starting node? For example, the starting node can be assigned any value that is a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, how do we know what that is?\n\nWait, for the starting node, which is connected to some edges, each of which has a GCD. The starting node's value must be a multiple of each of these GCDs. Therefore, the starting node's value must be a multiple of the LCM of all those GCDs. Let me think: suppose the starting node is connected to edges with GCDs g1, g2, etc. Then, the node's value must be a multiple of each of these, hence a multiple of their LCM.\n\nBut how to determine that LCM? For example, if the starting node is connected to edges with GCDs 2 and 3, then the node's value must be a multiple of 6.\n\nBut how do we know that? Because each edge connected to the node requires that the node's value is a multiple of the GCD of that edge. Therefore, the node's value must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it.\n\nBut during BFS traversal, how can we determine that? For example, when we first assign a value to the starting node, we can choose any value that is a multiple of the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. However, this seems difficult to compute unless we know all the edges connected to the node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the BFS traversal, the starting node's value can be chosen as the GCD of the edges connected to it multiplied by some factor. However, without knowing the other edges, it's unclear.\n\nBut here's an idea: for the starting node, we can assign a value that is equal to the GCD of the first edge connected to it multiplied by some x, where x is a divisor of k (the l/g of that edge). However, this choice of x may affect the rest of the assignments.\n\nBut this seems too vague. How can we choose x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the starting node can be set to g * x, where x is a divisor of k for the first edge, and then proceed with the BFS. However, since there may be multiple possible x's, this could lead to multiple possibilities. However, since the problem allows any valid solution, perhaps we can choose x as 1, and see if that leads to a contradiction. If it does, then try other possibilities. However, this approach may not be efficient for large graphs.\n\nBut given that the constraints are tight (n and m can be up to 1e5?), this approach may not be feasible.\n\nWait, but looking at the input constraints, the original problem statement says that n and m are given. However, the sample input shows for example '1 0', which is n=1 and m=0. But the actual problem's input constraints are not given here. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. \n\nBut the parentheses are empty. So perhaps the original problem has constraints like n and m up to 1e5 or similar. However, given that the problem is from programming competition, it's likely that n and m can be up to 1e5, but the code needs to be efficient.\n\nBut back to the problem. How can we model this?\n\nAnother idea: For each edge, the ratio between the two nodes is fixed. For example, a_u / a_v = x/y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = k. But since x and y are coprime, the ratio a_u/a_v is x/y, and the product a_u * a_v is fixed. However, since x and y are coprime, the ratio is in reduced terms.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the problem as a graph where each edge has a weight that represents the ratio between the two nodes. However, since the product is fixed, the ratio can be represented as a fraction. However, since the product is fixed, the ratio can be derived from the product.\n\nAlternatively, since a_u * a_v = g*l, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. Therefore, during BFS, once a_u is known, a_v can be computed. However, the problem is that when we have cycles, the computed values must be consistent.\n\nTherefore, the approach could be:\n\n- For each connected component, perform BFS or DFS, assigning values to nodes based on the edges.\n\n- Start with a node, assign it a value. For example, for the first edge connected to it, we can assign a value that is a multiple of the GCD of that edge. However, how to choose that value?\n\nWait, but the value can be any multiple of the GCD of the edge. However, since the product with the adjacent node is fixed, the adjacent node's value is determined. But how to choose the initial value?\n\nLet me think of the following: For the starting node, we can assign a value that is the GCD of the first edge multiplied by 1. Then, for the adjacent node, assign (g*l)/a_u. Then, proceed with BFS. However, this may not work if there are multiple edges connected to the starting node. For example, if the starting node is connected to two edges with different GCDs. Then, the value must be a multiple of both GCDs.\n\nBut how to choose such a value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the starting node can be set as the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. But how to compute that? For example, for a node connected to edges with GCDs g1, g2, ..., then the value must be a multiple of the LCM(g1, g2, ...). So, the minimal possible value is LCM(g1, g2, ...). However, during BFS, we can assign the starting node's value as this LCM, and then proceed.\n\nBut how to compute this LCM for each node? Well, for each node, during the BFS, we can collect all the GCDs of the edges connected to it, compute their LCM, and assign the node's value as this LCM multiplied by some factor. However, this seems computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut how do we know which edges are connected to a node? Well, during the initial processing, we can build an adjacency list for each node, storing the edges (u, v, g, l).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   - Select a starting node.\n\n   - Compute the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to this node. Let's call this base_gcd.\n\n   - Assign the starting node's value as base_gcd * x, where x is a divisor of k (for the first edge connected to it). However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node's value can be set to base_gcd, and then proceed. But then, for the first edge, the product with the adjacent node must be g*l. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the starting node is u, connected to v via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. The base_gcd for u is the LCM of all GCDs of edges connected to u. Since this edge's GCD is g, base_gcd is at least g. So setting u's value as base_gcd would make it a multiple of g, which is required.\n\nThen, the adjacent node v's value is (g*l)/base_gcd. However, this value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge (g). Which is true, since base_gcd is a multiple of g, and (g*l) is divisible by g. So (g*l)/base_gcd is l / (base_gcd/g). Since base_gcd/g is an integer, l must be divisible by this value? Or not?\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose base_gcd is LCM of g and other GCDs. For instance, if the edge's GCD is 2, and another edge connected to u has GCD 3, then base_gcd is LCM(2,3) = 6. Then, the value of u is 6. The edge between u and v has g=2, l= something. Let's say l= 2*6=12 (so k=6). Then, the product of u and v is 2*12 = 24. Since u is 6, v would be 24/6 =4. Which is a multiple of 2 (the GCD of the edge). So yes, this works.\n\nBut what if l is not divisible by base_gcd/g? For example, base_gcd is 6 (from previous example), and the edge has g=2, l= 2*5=10 (k=5). Then, the product of u and v is 2*10 =20. u is 6, so v is 20/6 = 10/3. Which is not an integer. That's a problem. But how can this happen?\n\nAh, because for the edge between u and v, the product of a_u and a_v is g*l. But if a_u is set to base_gcd, which is a multiple of g, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. However, this must be an integer. Therefore, the condition is that (g*l) must be divisible by a_u. Since a_u is base_gcd, which is LCM of all GCDs of edges connected to u. But how can we ensure that?\n\nWell, the problem is that base_gcd may not divide g*l. Therefore, this approach may not work. Hence, this suggests that the initial assignment of the starting node's value as base_gcd may not be sufficient.\n\nHmm. This seems to be getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. For each edge between u and v, we have a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g. Which implies that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g = k.\n\nSo, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be coprime and multiply to k. However, since x and y are coprime, they are uniquely determined by the factors of k. For example, for each k, we can split it into two coprime factors x and y. However, there may be multiple ways to split k into such factors.\n\nBut during the BFS traversal, when we assign x for one edge, it affects the possible assignments for other edges connected to the same node.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps for each node, we can keep track of the factors that are multiplied by g. For example, for each node u, a_u = g_u * x_u, where g_u is some base value, and x_u is a factor that depends on the edges connected to u.\n\nAlternatively, since for each edge between u and v, the product of a_u and a_v is fixed as g*l, and a_u must be a multiple of g, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nEach node's value is a multiple of some base value. For example, if we can find for each node u, a value that is a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it, then the product conditions can be satisfied.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nLet me look for similar problems or standard approaches. This seems similar to a problem where each edge has a ratio between the nodes, and we need to assign values such that the ratios are satisfied. For example, in a graph where each edge has a ratio a/b = r, and we need to assign values to nodes such that this holds. In that case, we can model this as a graph and perform BFS, keeping track of the ratios.\n\nIn our case, the product of a_u and a_v is fixed. Which can be rewritten as a_v = (g*l)/a_u. So, for each edge, the value of a_v is determined by a_u. Therefore, during BFS, once a_u is determined, a_v can be computed. However, during the traversal, if a node is visited again, we need to check if the computed value matches the previously assigned value. If not, then it's impossible.\n\nBut the problem is choosing the initial value for the starting node. How?\n\nThe starting node's value can be any value that is a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. But how to choose such a value? Well, perhaps the minimal such value is the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Let's call this value base. Then, assign the starting node's value as base, and proceed with BFS. However, this may not work if for some edge, the product (g*l) is not divisible by base. For example, if base is larger than g*l, then (g*l)/base would not be an integer. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nBut how to ensure that base divides g*l for all edges connected to the starting node?\n\nWait, for the starting node u, each edge connected to it has a GCD of g_i. The base is LCM of all g_i. For each edge, the product g_i * l_i must be divisible by base. Because a_u is base, and a_v = (g_i * l_i)/base. For this to be an integer, base must divide g_i * l_i. But since base is LCM of g_i's, and g_i divides base, then base divides g_i * l_i only if l_i is divisible by (base/g_i). But why would that be the case?\n\nThis seems uncertain. Perhaps there's no guarantee, and thus this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each edge, during the BFS, when we process it, we can check whether the product of the current node's value and the adjacent node's value equals g*l. However, the problem is that the initial value for the starting node must be chosen such that this holds for all edges connected to it.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a system of equations. For example, for each edge between u and v, a_u * a_v = c_uv, where c_uv = g_uv * l_uv. This is a system of equations. We need to find values a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for every edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = c_uv.\n\nThis is a system of multiplicative constraints. Such systems can be solved using a union-find data structure with additional information, or by checking for consistency during BFS.\n\nBut how to solve this system?\n\nLet's think of the variables as logarithms. Taking logarithm of both sides, we get log(a_u) + log(a_v) = log(c_uv). This transforms the multiplicative constraints into additive ones. However, since the variables are positive integers, this may not be helpful directly, but it suggests that the problem is similar to checking for bipartition in a graph, but with additive constraints. However, since the values are integers, this approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where each edge (u, v) has a value c_uv = a_u * a_v. Then, during BFS, we can assign values to nodes based on the edges. For example, if we assign a value to u, then v must be c_uv / a_u. But this requires that c_uv is divisible by a_u.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value for u?\n\nPerhaps, for the starting node u, we can choose a value that divides all c_uv for the edges connected to u. However, this seems difficult to compute.\n\nBut here's an observation: if the graph is connected, then all the c_uv's are related through the multiplicative constraints. For example, if there is a path from u to v, then the product of the c's along the edges must be compatible with the product of the a's. However, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the connected component. Suppose we have a tree structure. We can assign a value to the root, and then propagate it to the rest of the tree. For example, assign the root a value of 1 (but this may not work, as it may not satisfy the GCD constraints). However, the problem is that the root's value must be such that for each edge connected to it, the product with the neighbor's value",
