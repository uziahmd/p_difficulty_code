The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which is pretty big. So I need an efficient approach here.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of possible pairs. Since p and q are permutations, there are n! permutations each. But since p must be lex smaller than q, the total number of such pairs is (total permutations choose 2), because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. Wait, but if p != q, then exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs where p is lex smaller than q is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But that's the total possible pairs without considering inversion counts. However, we need to find how many of these pairs satisfy that inv_p > inv_q.\n\nBut how do we compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each possible pair of permutations (p, q) where p < q, we need to count those with inv_p > inv_q. Let's denote the total number of such pairs as T. How can we compute T?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of the following holds: p < q and inv_p > inv_q, or p > q and inv_p < inv_q, or some other combinations. Wait, maybe not. But perhaps there's some symmetry here.\n\nWait, suppose we consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Now, for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the following is true: inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q. Unless inv_p == inv_q. So, for the pairs where inv_p != inv_q, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. So, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv_p > inv_q equals the number of pairs (p, q) with p > q and inv_p < inv_q. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv_p != inv_q, exactly one of the two cases holds. Therefore, the total number of such pairs where p < q and inv_p > inv_q is equal to the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv_p != inv_q, divided by 2. But wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv_p != inv_q, then exactly one of (p < q and inv_p > inv_q) or (q < p and inv_p < inv_q) holds. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv_p > inv_q multiplied by 1 (since for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the entire set of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q. Letâ€™s split them into two categories:\n\n- Those where p < q.\n- Those where p > q.\n\nEach unordered pair {p, q} contributes exactly one to each category. Now, for each such pair {p, q}, if inv_p != inv_q, then exactly one of the following is true: inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q. So, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q and p < q. But how does this relate to the total number of unordered pairs with inv_p > inv_q?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have an unordered pair {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q. Then, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. So, if p < q, then the ordered pair (p, q) contributes to our desired count. If q < p, then the ordered pair (q, p) would contribute to the count of (p', q') where p' < q' and inv_p' > inv_q' only if inv_q > inv_p. Which is not the case here. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of ordered pairs where p < q. So, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and the number of inversions in $p$ is greater than that in $q$. This involves efficiently computing inversion counts for permutations and leveraging symmetry in the problem to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Inversion Count Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the number of inversions. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach with memoization.\n2. **Symmetry Consideration**: Instead of directly comparing all pairs of permutations, we use the symmetry of the problem. For each unordered pair of permutations $(p, q)$ where $p \\neq q$, exactly one of the following holds:\n   - $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and has more inversions.\n   - $q$ is lexicographically smaller than $p$ and has more inversions.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: By precomputing the number of permutations with each possible inversion count, we can efficiently determine the number of valid pairs using combinatorial logic and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7  # Placeholder, actual mod is provided in input\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo mod\n    max_n = n\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\n    # Compute inversion counts for all permutations of size n\n    # We'll use dynamic programming with memoization\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0] * (n*(n-1)//2 + 1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n\n    for length in range(2, n+1):\n        for inv in range(length*(length-1)//2 + 1):\n            for k in range(length):\n                # Insert the new element into position k in a permutation of length-1\n                # which adds k inversions\n                if inv - k >= 0:\n                    dp[length][inv] = (dp[length][inv] + dp[length-1][inv - k]) % mod\n\n    # Now, count the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv_p > inv_q\n    total = 0\n    # For all possible inversion counts i and j\n    for i in range(n*(n-1)//2 + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n*(n-1)//2 + 1):\n            cnt_i = dp[n][i]\n            cnt_j = dp[n][j]\n            # The number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j\n            # Each such pair contributes 1 to the total if i > j\n            # Since p < q is half of the ordered pairs\n            if i > j:\n                total = (total + cnt_i * cnt_j) % mod\n\n    # The answer is total\n    print(total % mod)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Factorial Precomputation**: Factorials up to $n$ are precomputed to facilitate efficient combinatorial calculations.\n2. **Dynamic Programming for Inversion Counts**: A dynamic programming table `dp` is used where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of permutations of length $i$ with $j$ inversions. This table is filled iteratively for each permutation length from 1 to $n$.\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each pair of inversion counts $i$ and $j$, we count the number of permutations with these inversion counts and sum the products of counts for pairs where $i > j$, adjusted by the symmetry of lexicographical order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid permutation pairs while adhering to the constraints and modular arithmetic requirements.",
