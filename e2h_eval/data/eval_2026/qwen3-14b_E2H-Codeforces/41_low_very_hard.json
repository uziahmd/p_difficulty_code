There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. My task is to find the maximum possible profit under all these constraints.\n\nHmm. So how to approach this? Since n and h and m are up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even with n=50, trying all possibilities for each house's height would be O(h^n), which is way too big. For example, 50^50 is astronomically large. So brute force isn't feasible here.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the constraints. Each restriction imposes that the maximum in some interval is <= x_i. So for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the heights in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nThe problem is similar to some kind of optimization problem with constraints. How can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: since the maximum height for each interval is constrained, perhaps for each position, we can determine the maximum possible height it can have, considering all the restrictions that apply to it.\n\nBut how? For example, if a house is part of multiple intervals, each of which has a restriction. For instance, if a house is in a range that has a restriction of x1 and another restriction of x2, then the maximum height of that house can't exceed the minimum of all such x's that apply to it through any of the restrictions. Wait, no. Because the restriction applies to the maximum in the interval. So even if a house is in an interval where the max is limited to x, that house can be up to x, but others in the same interval can't be higher than x. However, if there's another restriction that applies to a different interval that includes this house, then that might impose a stricter limit.\n\nWait, but for a particular house, say position i, what's the maximum possible height it can have? It's the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include this position in their [l_i, r_i], and also considering that the maximum in any of those ranges can't be higher than x_i. But that's not straightforward. Because if there's a restriction that says in [1,3], the max is 5, then each house in that interval can be up to 5, but maybe one of them is higher than others. However, if there's another restriction that says in [2,3], the max is 4, then the max in [2,3] can't be more than 4, so the house at position 2 or 3 can't be higher than 4, but the house at position 1 can be up to 5.\n\nSo for each individual house, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that cover that house, but only if that house is the maximum in the interval. Wait, that seems complicated. Because the restrictions are about the maximum in a range, not individual houses. So the problem is that even if a house is allowed to be up to x in some interval, but if another house in that interval is higher than x, then that would violate the restriction. So the constraints are interdependent.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex. How to model this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible assignment of heights to the houses, check if all the restrictions are satisfied. Then compute the sum of squares and find the maximum. But with n up to 50, this is impossible because the number of possibilities is h^n, which is way too big.\n\nBut since n is small (up to 50), and h is up to 50, perhaps there's a dynamic programming approach, or some other way to model the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints involve the maximum in a range, perhaps we can model the problem by determining for each position the maximum possible height it can have, given all the constraints that apply to it. However, how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that each restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i] implies that for every position in [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval can't be more than x_i. Therefore, for any position j in [l_i, r_i], the height of j can't be more than x_i if that's the maximum in the interval. But that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is 5. Then, the house at position 1 can be 5, but the others can be lower. However, if the house",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the profit as the square of its height, and we must ensure that the tallest house in any specified range does not exceed a given limit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Handling**: Each restriction imposes a maximum height for the tallest house in a specific range. We need to ensure that all these constraints are satisfied.\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Given the constraints on the number of spots (n ≤ 50), we can use a dynamic programming approach where each state represents the current configuration of house heights.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each possible configuration of house heights, check if it satisfies all the zoning restrictions. If it does, compute the profit and keep track of the maximum profit found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    cases = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input):\n        line = input[i].strip()\n        if line:\n            parts = list(map(int, line.split()))\n            n, h, m = parts[0], parts[1], parts[2]\n            restrictions = []\n            i += 1\n            for _ in range(m):\n                while i < len(input) and input[i].strip() == '':\n                    i += 1\n                if i >= len(input):\n                    break\n                l, r, x = map(int, input[i].strip().split())\n                restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n                i += 1\n            cases.append((n, h, restrictions))\n        i += 1\n\n    for case in cases:\n        n, h, restrictions = case\n        max_profit = 0\n\n        # Generate all possible height configurations\n        # Since n is up to 50 and h up to 50, brute-force is impossible\n        # Instead, we can use backtracking with pruning\n\n        # However, even with backtracking, for n=50, it's too slow\n        # Alternative idea: for each position, determine the maximum possible height it can have considering all restrictions that include it\n\n        # Let's precompute for each position the minimal x_i from all restrictions that cover it\n        # Because if a restriction says that in [l, r], the max is x, then every house in [l, r] can't be higher than x if it's the max in that interval\n        # However, this is not directly applicable, but perhaps we can find for each position the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum of all x_i where the position is in [l_i, r_i]\n\n        # But this is not sufficient because even if a house is allowed to be higher than x_i, if another house in the same interval is higher than x_i, it would violate the constraint\n        # Therefore, the above approach is not correct\n\n        # Alternative approach: since n is small (up to 50), we can try all possible height combinations for each position, but with pruning based on constraints\n\n        # However, even with n=50 and h=50, it's 50^50 possibilities, which is impossible\n        # So we need a smarter way\n\n        # Let's think of it as an integer programming problem with constraints on max in ranges\n        # But how to model it?\n\n        # Another idea: for each position, the maximum possible height is min(h, all x_i from restrictions that include this position in their range)\n        # But again, this is not correct because the max in the interval could be limited by some other restriction\n\n        # Let's think of the problem as follows: for each restriction, the maximum height in the interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Therefore, for each such interval, the height of each house in that interval can't be more than x_i. Wait, no. Because if one house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the max is higher than x_i, which violates the restriction. Therefore, for the restriction to be satisfied, all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the max is higher than x_i.\n\n        # Wait, no! Suppose the restriction says that the max in [l, r] is at most x. Then, the max of the interval must be <= x. Which means that every house in the interval must be <= x. Because if any house is >x, then the max is >x. Therefore, the restriction is equivalent to requiring that all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.\n\n        # Oh! That's a crucial insight. Because if the restriction says that the maximum in [l, r] is <= x, then every house in [l, r] must be <= x. Otherwise, the maximum would be greater than x, violating the restriction. Therefore, each restriction (l, r, x) implies that for each position i in [l, r], the height of i must be <= x. \n\n        # This is a game-changer. Because now, each restriction can be converted into individual constraints on each position. For example, for each restriction (l, r, x), we can add that for all positions i in [l, r], the height of i must be <= x. \n\n        # Then, the problem becomes: assign to each position a height between 0 and h, such that for each position i, the height is <= the minimum of all x's from restrictions that cover i. And the profit is the sum of squares of the heights.\n\n        # Wait, but what if there are multiple restrictions? For example, if a position i is covered by two restrictions, one requiring it to be <= x1 and another to be <= x2. Then, the height of i must be <= min(x1, x2).\n\n        # Therefore, the maximum possible height for each position i is min(h, min of x's from all restrictions that include i in their [l, r] interval). \n\n        # Once we have that, the optimal solution is to set each position to the maximum possible value, which is the min between h and the minimum x_i from all restrictions covering it. \n\n        # Wait, but why? Because the profit is the sum of squares. To maximize the sum, each term should be as large as possible. So for each position, set its height to the maximum allowed by the constraints.\n\n        # This would be the optimal solution!\n\n        # Let me test this against the examples.\n\n        # First example:\n        # n=3, h=3, m=3\n        # Restrictions:\n        # 1-1: <=1\n        # 2-2: <=3\n        # 3-3: <=2\n        # So for position 1, the max is 1. Position 2, max is 3. Position 3, max is 2. So the heights are [1,3,2], sum of squares is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the example.\n\n        # Second example:\n        # n=4, h=10, m=2\n        # Restrictions:\n        # 2-3: <=8\n        # 3-4: <=7\n        # So for position 1, no restrictions. So max is 10.\n        # Position 2 is in [2-3], so max is 8.\n        # Position 3 is in both [2-3] and [3-4]. So min(8,7)=7.\n        # Position 4 is in [3-4], so max is 7.\n        # Heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum of squares is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Which matches the example.\n\n        # So this approach works for the examples. But why? Because the constraints are transformed into per-position limits. So the maximum allowed for each position is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include it. Then, setting each position to its maximum allowed value will give the optimal profit.\n\n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n        # For each position i from 1 to n:\n        #   max_height[i] = h\n        #   for each restriction that includes i in [l, r]:\n        #       max_height[i] = min(max_height[i], x_i)\n        # Then, the total profit is sum of (max_height[i]^2) for all i.\n\n        # That's a very simple solution. But why didn't I think of this earlier?\n\n        # Let me think again. Suppose there is a restriction [1,3] with x=5. Another restriction [2,4] with x=6. For position 2, the max is min(5,6)=5. For position 3, same. But what if the actual maximum in [1,3] is 5 (as per the first restriction). So the first restriction is satisfied. The second restriction [2,4] has max 6, but the max in that interval would be 5 (position 2 or 3), which is <=6. So the constraints are satisfied. \n\n        # Therefore, by taking for each position the minimum of x_i's from all restrictions that cover it, we ensure that all the restrictions are satisfied. Because for any restriction [l, r, x], all positions in [l, r] are <=x, so the maximum in that interval is <=x.\n\n        # Therefore, this approach is correct.\n\n        # So the algorithm is:\n\n        # Initialize for each position i, max_h[i] = h\n        # For each restriction (l, r, x):\n        #     for i in l..r:\n        #         max_h[i] = min(max_h[i], x)\n        # Then compute the sum of squares of max_h[i]\n\n        # This is very efficient. For n and m up to 50, it's O(m * n) time.\n\n        # Now let's code this.\n\n        max_h = [h] * n  # 0-based index\n        for l, r, x in restrictions:\n            # Convert to 0-based or 1-based?\n            # The input is 1-based for l and r\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if max_h[i] > x:\n                    max_h[i] = x\n        total = sum(hi * hi for hi in max_h)\n        print(total)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into multiple test cases.\n2. **Processing Each Case**: For each test case, initialize the maximum height for each position to the global maximum `h`.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each position in the affected range to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's limit.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit as the sum of the squares of the allowable heights for each position.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied while maximizing the profit efficiently.",

Then, setting each position to its maximum allowed value will give the optimal profit.\n\n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n        # For each position i from 1 to n:\n        #   max_height[i] = h\n        #   for each restriction that includes i in [l, r]:\n        #       max_height[i] = min(max_height[i], x_i)\n        # Then, the total profit is sum of (max_height[i]^2) for all i.\n\n        # That's a very simple solution. But why didn't I think of this earlier?\n\n        # Let me think again. Suppose there is a restriction [1,3] with x=5. Another restriction [2,4] with x=6. For position 2, the max is min(5,6)=5. For position 3, same. But what if the actual maximum in [1,3] is 5 (as per the first restriction). So the first restriction is satisfied. The second restriction [2,4] has max 6, but the max in that interval would be 5 (position 2 or 3), which is <=6. So the constraints are satisfied. \n\n        # Therefore, by taking for each position the minimum of x_i's from all restrictions that cover it, we ensure that all the restrictions are satisfied. Because for any restriction [l, r, x], all positions in [l, r] are <=x, so the maximum in that interval is <=x.\n\n        # Therefore, this approach is correct.\n\n        # So the algorithm is:\n\n        # Initialize for each position i, max_h[i] = h\n        # For each restriction (l, r, x):\n        #     for i in l..r:\n        #         max_h[i] = min(max_h[i], x)\n        # Then compute the sum of squares of max_h[i]\n\n        # This is very efficient. For n and m up to 50, it's O(m * n) time.\n\n        # Now let's code this.\n\n        max_h = [h] * n  # 0-based index\n        for l, r, x in restrictions:\n            # Convert to 0-based or 1-based?\n            # The input is 1-based for l and r\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if max_h[i] > x:\n                    max_h[i] = x\n        total = sum(hi * hi for hi in max_h)\n        print(total)\n\nmain()",
