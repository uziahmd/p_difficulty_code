    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nSo, the first thing I need to understand is how these progress bars work. Let me rephrase the problem. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file's progress, and floor(100 * (sum of all previous files' sizes plus x) / total_sum) for the total progress. And we need to find all values that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nThe challenge here is to simulate all possible moments when these two percentages are equal. But since the number of files can be up to 100, and each file can be up to 1000 bytes, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000=10^5. So for each byte copied, we can check both percentages and track when they are equal. However, with 1e5 bytes, and n up to 100, this seems manageable. Wait, but even 1e5 steps would be okay for Python.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the approach.\n\nFirst, compute the total sum of all files. Let's call it total_sum. Then, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after each byte, the progress updates), we can compute:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\ntotal_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n\nWhere sum_prev is the sum of all previous files. So for example, for the first file, sum_prev is 0, and for the second file, sum_prev is a_1, etc.\n\nBut also, note that the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So we need to include that as well. Because the problem says that at the beginning, both show 0%.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the total_sum of all files.\n2. For each file i, compute the sum_prev (sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}).\n3. For each byte x in 1 to a_i (since after each byte, the progress is updated), compute the current_percent and total_percent.\n4. Also, check the initial state (before any bytes are copied) which is 0% for both.\n5. Collect all the percentages that are present in both bars at the same time.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the initial state? Because before any bytes are copied, both are zero. So 0 is definitely one of the answers. But during the processing of the first byte, after the first byte is copied, the current_percent would be floor(100 * 1 / a_1), and the total_percent would be floor(100 * 1 / total_sum). So we need to check for all possible x (each byte) in each file.\n\nBut the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte. So for each x in 1 to a_i, during the processing of the i-th file, we have to check the current and total percentages.\n\nBut how do we simulate this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize a set for the answer.\n\nAdd 0 to the answer set, since that's the starting point.\n\nThen, for each file i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (x * 100) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add this value to the answer set.\n\nSo, after checking all x in all files, collect all the values that were found.\n\nWait, but what about the end of the process? For example, when all bytes are copied. Let's say the last byte is copied. Then, both progress bars are at 100% (since total_bytes_so_far is total_sum, so 100 * total_sum / total_sum is 100, floored to 100). So in that case, 100 is added. But according to the first example, the output includes 100. So our code should capture that.\n\nBut in our loop, when x is a_i (the last byte of the file), then for that x, the current_percent would be (a_i * 100) // a_i = 100. The total_bytes_so_far is sum_prev + a_i = sum_prev + a_i = sum of all files up to i. Which is part of the total_sum. So, for example, when i is the last file, then sum_prev + a_i is total_sum. So the total_percent would be (total_sum * 100) // total_sum = 100. So yes, 100 will be captured in that case.\n\nBut what about when the total bytes so far is such that the total percent is 100? Like, suppose the total_sum is 100, and the sum_prev + x is 100. Then the total percent is 100. But for that, the code would capture it.\n\nSo the code above should capture all instances where the two percentages are equal, including 0 and 100.\n\nBut wait, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. However, in the code above, the initial 0 is added manually. But during the processing of the first byte, when x is 1, the current_percent is 100 * 1 / a_1 (floored), and the total_percent is 100 * 1 / total_sum (floored). But the initial state (before any bytes) is 0% for both. So that's why we need to add 0 to the answer set. However, perhaps the code misses that if the initial 0 is not considered. For example, in the first example, the output includes 0 and 100. So the code adds 0 manually, and then during processing, when x is 6 (for the first example, a_1 is 6), then the current_percent is 100 * 6 / 6 = 100, and total percent is 100 * 6 / 6 = 100. So 100 is added. So the code would collect 0 and 100.\n\nBut what if there's a case where during processing, both percentages are 0 again? For example, if the first file is of size 1000, and the total_sum is 2000. So when x is 1, the current_percent is 0.1% floored to 0. The total percent is (1 * 100)/2000 = 0.05 floored to 0. So in this case, during processing of x=1, the two percentages are 0. So 0 would be added again. But since we're using a set, duplicates don't matter. However, the initial 0 is added once. So the code would have 0 in the set.\n\nBut the problem says that the initial state is when both are 0. So even if during processing, there are other times when both are 0, it's still counted. But the code as written would capture all those cases.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- Then for each file, for each x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current and total percent, check if equal, add to the set.\n\n- Then, after all processing, collect all the numbers in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about when the total percent is 100%? For example, when all the bytes are copied. The code would catch that when x is the last byte of the last file. But what if the total_sum is such that even before all bytes are copied, the total percent reaches 100? Well, that's impossible because the total bytes so far can't exceed the total_sum. So the maximum total_percent is 100, which occurs exactly when the total bytes so far is equal to total_sum. Which is only when all bytes are copied. So the code captures that.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSample Output: 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWait, but according to the note, the first test case has one file. So the current progress and the total progress are always the same. Because for each x, the current percent is (x * 100)/a_i, and the total percent is (x * 100)/a_i. So for all x, the two percentages are same. Hence, all the values that appear in the progress bars are the same. So the answer is all the values that appear in the progress bar for the first file.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let's see:\n\nFor a file of size 6, the progress bar (current and total) is:\n\nAt x=0: 0% (but initial state is added).\n\nx=1: floor(100 * 1/6) = 16.666... → 16\n\nx=2: 33.333 → 33\n\nx=3: 50%\n\nx=4: 66.666 → 66\n\nx=5: 83.333 → 83\n\nx=6: 100.\n\nSo the values are 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample output. So the code would capture all those values, because for each x, the current and total percents are same, hence added to the set. So the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input: the second sample input is 2 files, 100 and 500. Total sum is 600. The output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's think about that.\n\nBut according to the note, the first progress bar (current) goes ahead, then resets to 0 and starts again. So during the first file (size 100), the total progress is (x) * 100 / 600. For example, when x is 100, the total progress is (100 * 100)/600 = 16.666 → 16. But the current progress is 100% (since x=100, a_i=100). So during the first file, the current progress is 100% when x=100, but the total is 16%. So they are not same. Then, when moving to the second file (size 500), sum_prev is 100. For each x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (x * 100) / 500 → which is 0.2x, floored.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 + x) * 100 / 600 → (100 + x) * (1/6) → which is (100 + x) divided by 6, floored.\n\nWe need to find when 0.2x == (100 + x)/6. Let's solve for x:\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n1.2x = 100 + x → 0.2x = 100 → x = 500. So when x is 500, the current_percent is (500 * 100)/500 = 100, and the total is (100+500)*100/600 = 600*100/600 = 100. So 100 is included. But during the processing of the second file, there may be other points where the two percentages are same.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the numbers are 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. How does that happen?\n\nWell, let's think about when the total_percent is 95. Let's compute for total_percent = 95:\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = (sum_prev + x) = 100 + x.\n\nWe have (100 + x) * 100 / 600 >= 95, and <96.\n\nSo:\n\n95 <= (100 + x) * 100 / 600 < 96\n\nMultiply all by 600:\n\n95 * 600 <= 100*(100 + x) < 96 * 600 → divide by 100:\n\n95 * 6 <= 100 + x < 96 * 6 → 570 <= 100 + x < 576 → 470 <= x < 476.\n\nSo x ranges from 470 to 475 (since x is integer). Now, for each x in this range, current_percent is (x * 100)/500 = (x * 0.2) → floor(x * 0.2). Let's compute for x=470: 470 * 0.2 = 94 → floor is 94. But the total percent is 95. So not equal. Hmm, so maybe my approach is missing something here. But according to the sample output, 95 is present. So there must be a moment where both percentages are 95.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check for each x in the second file, and see when current_percent equals total_percent.\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say during the second file, x is such that current_percent is 95 and total_percent is 95.\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100x / 500) = floor(0.2x) = 95.\n\nWhich implies that 95 <= 0.2x < 96 → multiply by 5: 475 <= x < 480. Since x is up to 500, so x ranges from 475 to 479 (inclusive).\n\nAt the same time, the total_percent is floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ) = floor( (100 + x) / 6 ). We want that to be 95.\n\nSo:\n\n95 <= (100 + x)/6 < 96 → 570 <= 100 + x < 576 → 470 <= x < 476 → x ranges from 470 to 475 inclusive.\n\nSo the overlap between x >=475 and x <476 is x=475. So for x=475:\n\ncurrent_percent is floor(0.2*475) = floor(95) = 95.\n\ntotal_percent is (100+475)/6 = 575/6 = 95.833..., which is floored to 95. So yes! So both are 95. So x=475 is a valid case. Thus, 95 is added. Similarly, for other values.\n\nSo the code would capture this scenario. Thus, the approach of checking for each x in each file is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to:\n\n- Compute the total_sum.\n\n- For each file, compute sum_prev (sum of previous files).\n\n- For each x in 1 to a_i, compute current_percent and total_percent, check if they are equal, and add to the set.\n\n- Also include 0 in the set.\n\nBut wait, what about when the total_percent is 0? For example, during the first file, when x is 1, and the total_sum is larger than x. So the code would capture that. But the initial 0 is already added. However, during the processing of the first byte, the current_percent could be 0 and the total_percent could be 0. For example, if the first file is size 1000, and the total_sum is 2000. Then, for x=1, current_percent is 0, total_percent is 0. So the code would add 0 again, but since it's a set, it's okay.\n\nBut in the first step, we add 0 to the set. So even if during processing, there are other moments when both are 0, they will be captured. However, the initial 0 is already in the set. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, considering that, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, then read the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all iterations are done, collect all elements in result, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev for each i?\n\nWell, we can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nSo for example, in code:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nThus, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\ncurrent_file_size = a[i]\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1, a = [6]\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6]\n\nfor i=0:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[0] = 0\n\ncurrent_file_size = 6\n\nloop x from 1 to 6:\n\nfor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = (1*100)//6 = 16\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 0 +1 =1\n\ntotal_percent = (1 * 100) // 6 = 16 → same. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2, current is 33, total is 33. So added. Etc.\n\nSo the set will contain 0,16,33,50,66,83,100 (when x=6, current is 100, total is (6*100)/6=100).\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: second example, input is 2, 100 500. So total_sum is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor i=0 (file 100):\n\nsum_prev = 0.\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\nFor each x, current_percent is (x*100)/100 = x.\n\ntotal_percent is (x * 100)/600 = x/6.\n\nWe need to check if x == floor(x/6). Which would be true only when x is 0 (but x starts from 1). So for example, x=0 is not processed here. So during this phase, current and total percent are equal only when x is 0 (but not processed). So no additions except for the initial 0. But during the first file, the current_percent is x (for x from 1 to 100) and the total_percent is x//6. So for example, when x=6, current is 6, total is 1. Not equal. So nothing is added during this phase except for the initial 0.\n\nThen, for i=1 (file 500), sum_prev is 100. So for x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (x * 100) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = (x * 2) // 10 = x//5 ?\n\nWait, 100 * x / 500 = x/5. So floor(x/5).\n\ntotal_percent is (100 + x) * 100 // 600 = (100 + x) * 100 // 600 = (100 + x) * (1/6) floored.\n\nSo for x=475, current_percent is 475 /5 = 95.0 → floor is 95. total_percent is (100 + 475) = 575 → 575 * 100 / 600 = 575 / 6 = 95.833... → floor 95. So yes, 95 is added. Similarly, other values.\n\nSo the code would capture those.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum is 1. For x=1, current and total are 100. So the output is 0, 100. But during x=1, the code adds 100. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_sum = 2.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nProcessing first file (size 1):\n\nx=1: current is 100, total is (1 * 100)/2 = 50 → not equal. So nothing added.\n\nProcessing second file (sum_prev=1):\n\nx runs from 1 to 1.\n\ncurrent_percent = (1 * 100) / 1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1 + 1 = 2 → total_percent is 2 * 100 / 2 = 100. So 100 is added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo the output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum=4.\n\nFor the first file (sum_prev=0):\n\nx=1: current is (1*100)/2 = 50. total is (1 * 100)/4 = 25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current is 100. total is (2 * 100)/4 = 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file (sum_prev=2):\n\nx=1: current is 50. total is (2 +1)*100 /4 = 3*25 = 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current is 100. total is (2+2)*100/4 = 100. So 100 added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when during processing, the same value is hit multiple times. For example, if during the first file, x=3 and x=4 both lead to same percent. But the set takes care of that.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all x from 1 to a_i for each file. Let's think about the computational complexity. For each file, the number of bytes is up to 1000. For n=100, total steps are 100 * 1000 = 1e5 steps. That's acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut how to read input? The input is given as first line n, then second line the a_i's.\n\nBut the user provided examples have inputs like:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...], but the actual input is read from stdin. So for the code, the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n        total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but let's test this code with the first sample input. For the first sample input, n=1 and a is [6]. The code would generate the set {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one: n=2, a = [100, 500]. The code would generate the set {0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100} ?\n\nWait, let's think. For the second sample input, the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. How does the code capture those?\n\nLet me think for the second file, which is 500 bytes. sum_prev is 100.\n\nFor x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_percent is (100 + x) * 100 // 600 = (100 + x) // 6.\n\nWe need to find all x where x//5 == (100 + x) // 6.\n\nLet me find for x in 1..500.\n\nLet me consider solving x//5 = (100 + x) //6.\n\nLet me denote k = x//5. Then:\n\nk ≤ (100 + x)/6 < k+1.\n\nBut also, k ≤ x/5 <k+1 → 5k ≤x <5(k+1).\n\nSo combining:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n6k ≤ 100 + x <6(k+1).\n\nBut x is between 5k and 5(k+1) -1.\n\nSo substituting x:\n\n6k ≤ 100 + x <6(k+1)\n\n→ 6k - 100 ≤x < 6(k+1) - 100.\n\nBut x is also between 5k and 5(k+1) -1.\n\nSo overlapping ranges.\n\nThis might be complex to find, but the code would check for each x.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the values 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are present. Let's see:\n\nFor example, when k=95:\n\ncurrent_percent is 95. So x must be in [475, 480) (since x//5 = 95 → 5*95=475 ≤x <5*96=480 → x ranges 475-479).\n\nAt the same time, (100 +x) //6 must be 95.\n\nSo:\n\n(100 +x) must be in [95*6, 96*6) → [570, 576).\n\nSo 100 +x ∈ [570, 576) → x ∈ [470, 476).\n\nSo for x in [475, 476) → x=475.\n\nThus, x=475 is in the range. For x=475, current_percent is 475//5 = 95, and (100 + 475) = 575 → 575//6 = 95 (since 95*6=570, 575-570=5, so 95.833 floored to 95). So yes, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for k=96:\n\ncurrent_percent is 96 → x must be in [5*96, 5*97) → 480 ≤x <485.\n\nAt the same time, (100 +x) must be in [96*6, 97*6) → 576 ≤ 100 +x < 582 → x ∈ [476, 482).\n\nSo overlapping x is between 480 ≤x <482. So x can be 480 or 481.\n\nCheck for x=480:\n\ncurrent_percent is 480//5 = 96.\n\ntotal_percent: 100+480 = 580 → 580*100//600 = 580/6 = 96.666 → floored to 96. So yes, 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=481: 100+481 = 581 → 581/6 = 96.833 → 96. So current is 481//5 = 96.2 → 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for k=97:\n\nx must be in [485, 490). And 100 +x must be in [97*6=582, 98*6=588). So x in [582-100=482, 588-100=488). So overlapping x is 485 ≤x <488. So x=485, 486, 487.\n\nCheck for x=485:\n\ncurrent_percent is 485//5 = 97.\n\ntotal_percent is 100 +485 = 585 → 585//6 = 97.5 → 97. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, x=486 → 586//6 = 97.666 → 97. So yes. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly for k=98:\n\nx must be between 490 and 495.\n\ntotal_percent requires 100 +x in [98*6=588, 99*6=594) → x in [488, 494).\n\nOverlap is x between 490 and 494. So x=490, 491, 492, 493.\n\nFor x=490:\n\ncurrent is 490//5=98.\n\ntotal is 590 → 590//6= 98.333 → 98. So yes.\n\nSame for others. So 98 is added.\n\nFor k=99:\n\nx is between 495 and 500 (since 5*99=495, 5*100=500). And 100 +x must be in [99*6=594, 100*6=600) → x in [494, 500).\n\nOverlap is x between 495 and 500 (exclusive). So x=495, 496, 497, 498, 499.\n\nFor x=495:\n\ncurrent is 495//5 = 99.\n\ntotal is 100+495=595 → 595//6 = 99.166 → 99. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for others. So 99 is added.\n\nFinally, for x=500 (the last byte of the second file):\n\ncurrent_percent is 500//5=100.\n\ntotal is 100 +500 = 600 → 600//6 = 100. So yes. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the code would collect 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Plus the initial 0. Which gives the sample output for the second case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample input is 4 files with sizes 1000, 2, 2, 998. The output is 0, 50, 99, 100. Let's think why.\n\nThe total_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nBut during the copying of the first file (1000 bytes), the total progress is (x) * 100 / 2002. The current progress is x * 100 / 1000 = x/10. So when is x/10 equal to (x * 100)/2002 ?\n\nLet me see for x=1000: current is 100, total is (1000 * 100)/2002 = approx 49.95 → 49. So not equal. So during the first file, perhaps no matches except for 0.\n\nBut when the first file is copied completely, sum_prev is 1000. Then, the second file is 2 bytes. For x=1, sum_prev is 1000, x=1: total bytes is 1001. total_percent is (1001 * 100)/2002 = 50.0... (since 1001 * 100 = 100100, 100100 / 2002 = 50.0). So the total_percent is 50. The current_percent is (1*100)/2 = 50. So 50 is added. Thus, 50 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, during the second file, for x=2: current is 100, total is (1000 + 2)*100 / 2002 = 1002 * 100 / 2002 = 100200 / 2002 ≈ 50.049... → 50. So current is 100, which is not equal to 50",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that are simultaneously displayed on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file progress and the total progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure the initial state (0%) is included as it is always a valid value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n            total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of files, and the second line contains the sizes of these files.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files up to any given point, which is essential for calculating the total progress accurately.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, both the current file progress and the total progress are calculated. If these values match, they are added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: The initial state (0%) is explicitly added to the result set since both progress bars start at 0%.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible moments when both progress bars could show the same value, leveraging the constraints provided to keep the solution within feasible computational limits.",
