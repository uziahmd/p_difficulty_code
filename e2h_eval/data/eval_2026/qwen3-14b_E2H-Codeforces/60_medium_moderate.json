Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of the current string S after each modification. The catch is that some Morse code strings are invalid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the Morse code mappings work. Each valid Morse code string is of length 1-4, made up of 0s and 1s, except for four specific ones. So, for any substring of S, if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of those four), then it represents a letter. And each such substring contributes to the count as a possible sequence. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Wait, but each such substring is a single letter. But sequences of letters would be combinations of multiple such substrings. Wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Oh, wait, perhaps each such sequence is a concatenation of Morse code representations. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings is a valid Morse code (assuming they are not in the invalid list). Each of these represents a letter. Then the sequences of letters would be any combination where the concatenation of their Morse codes forms a substring of S. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each possible way to split a substring of S into valid Morse code sequences counts as a sequence of letters. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which is valid, then it can be considered as a single letter. But also, if there's a way to split into \"1\" and \"1\", that's another sequence. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S, of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each such split corresponds to a sequence of letters. For example, if the substring is \"111\", then possible splits are:\n\n- \"111\" → one letter.\n\n- \"1\" + \"11\" → two letters.\n\n- \"11\" + \"1\" → two letters.\n\n- \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → three letters.\n\nSo for that substring, there are 1+2+1 = 4 ways? Or maybe the count is the number of possible splits, which for \"111\" would be 3 (the splits into 1, 1, 1; 1+11; 11+1; 111). Wait, the number of ways to split a string into valid Morse code letters. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence is formed by a substring of S (which is a concatenation of Morse codes for letters) and the way to split that substring into Morse codes. So the answer is the total number of such splits across all possible substrings of S.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, we track the number of ways to split the prefix up to that position. But since the problem requires considering all substrings, perhaps we can model it with dynamic programming.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i in the string, we can track for all possible ending positions j (where j <= i) the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i] into valid Morse codes. Then, the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of splits for that substring.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nLet’s denote dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse code sequences. Then, for each i, we can look back at positions i-1, i-2, i-3, i-4 (since Morse code is up to length 4) and check if the substring from i-k to i is a valid code. If so, then we add dp[i-k] to dp[i]. The base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split, which is nothing).\n\nBut this counts the number of ways to split the entire string up to i. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings of S. So for each position i, we need to consider all possible starting positions j (from 1 to i), and compute the number of splits for the substring S[j..i].\n\nThis seems computationally intensive. Because for each i, we have to consider all j's up to i, and for each j, compute the number of ways to split S[j..i], which is similar to the dp approach but for varying start points.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this efficiently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: For each position i in the string, we can compute for all possible lengths l (1 to 4) whether the substring ending at i with length l is valid. Then, for each such valid substring, we can add to the total the number of ways to split the previous part of the string.\n\nBut how to model this for all substrings?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: every time a new character is added to S, we need to update the total number of valid sequences. The total is the sum over all substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut maintaining this total incrementally is challenging. Because adding a new character could introduce many new substrings (all those ending at the new position). For example, when the new character is added, the new substrings are the ones that end at the new position and have lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 (if possible). So for each step, we can process the new character and compute for each possible length l (1-4) the number of ways to split the substring ending at this position of length l.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose after adding the i-th character, the string is S[1..i]. For each possible j from 1 to i, we want to consider the substring S[j..i], and compute the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes. The total answer is the sum over all j from 1 to i of the number of ways to split S[j..i].\n\nTo compute this sum efficiently, perhaps we can use dynamic programming. Let’s define for each position i, an array dp[i] which represents the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i]. Then, the total number of ways for all substrings would be the sum over all k from 1 to i of the number of ways to split S[k..i].\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of for each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i. Let’s say we have a variable f[i], which is the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i]. Then, the total number of sequences would be the sum over all i of f[i], but that's not correct because f[i] counts the number of splits for the entire string up to i. However, the problem requires considering all substrings, not just the entire string.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's think of the total answer as the sum over all possible substrings T of S of the number of ways to split T into valid Morse codes. Each such T can be represented as S[a..b], and the number of splits for T is the same as the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes.\n\nSo, for each position b (current end of the string), we need to calculate for all a ≤ b the number of splits of S[a..b]. The total answer is the sum of all these numbers for all b up to the current step.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently. Let's consider that for each new character added (say, at position m), we can compute for each possible starting position a (from m - 3 to m, but not less than 1) the number of splits for S[a..m].\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, we track the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i]. Then, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then dp[i -k] else 0 )\n\nBut with dp[0] = 1 (base case).\n\nBut this gives us the number of splits for the entire string up to i. However, the problem requires considering all substrings. So for example, the substring S[a..i] can be considered as a separate string. How can we model this?\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, we can compute for each possible length l (1 to 4) whether the substring ending at i with length l is valid. Then, for each such valid substring, we can add the number of ways to split the part before it. But this seems similar to the standard DP approach for counting the number of splits for the entire string. However, to get the sum over all substrings, we need to track for each possible starting point.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows. For each position i in the string, and for each possible length l (from 1 to 4), if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then we can add to the answer the number of ways to split the string up to i-l (i.e., the number of ways to split the part before the current substring) multiplied by 1 (since adding this substring as a new letter). However, this would only account for the splits that end with this substring. But how to accumulate all possibilities.\n\nWait, here's a better idea. Let's maintain a dynamic programming array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the substring S[1..i] into valid Morse codes. Then, the total number of sequences is the sum over all i of dp[i] multiplied by the number of possible starting points. No, that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a string of length 3. The total sequences would be:\n\nFor substrings of length 1: each can be split in 1 way (if valid).\n\nFor substrings of length 2: each can be split in 1 way if valid, or 0 otherwise.\n\nFor substrings of length 3: same.\n\nBut the dp[i] gives the number of ways to split the entire string up to i. So for the entire string up to i, it's one substring. But there are other substrings. So the dp approach alone isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternative plan: For each new character added (so after m steps, the string is of length m), we need to compute the sum for all possible substrings ending at position m. Let's denote this as total[m], and the overall answer is the sum of total[1] + total[2] + ... + total[m].\n\nSo, for each m, we compute total[m], which is the sum over all a (from 1 to m) of the number of ways to split S[a..m].\n\nHow can we compute this total[m] efficiently?\n\nLet's think recursively. When we add the m-th character, the new substrings that end at m are those of length 1, 2, 3, 4 (depending on the current length). For each possible length l (from 1 to 4, but not exceeding m), we can check if the substring S[m-l+1..m] is valid. If it is, then the number of ways to split the substring S[a..m] for a = m-l+1 is equal to 1 (the split is just this substring) plus the number of ways to split the previous parts. Wait, no. For example, if the substring S[a..m] can be split into a valid code of length l, then the number of splits for S[a..m] is equal to the number of splits for S[a..m-l] (since we can append this new code to any split of the previous part). But S[a..m-l] is a substring of length m-l - a + 1? No, wait. If the current substring is S[a..m], and we take the last l characters (from m-l+1 to m), then the remaining part is S[a..m-l]. So the number of splits for S[a..m] is equal to the number of splits for S[a..m-l] multiplied by 1 (since we can add this new code to any split of the previous part). But this is only if the substring S[m-l+1..m] is valid.\n\nSo, for each possible l (1-4), if the substring ending at m with length l is valid, then the number of ways to split the substring S[a..m], where a = m-l+1, is equal to the number of ways to split the substring S[a..m-l] plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is split as the single code). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the substring S[a..m]. Let's say that the last l characters (from m-l+1 to m) form a valid code. Then, the number of ways to split S[a..m] is equal to the number of ways to split S[a..m-l] (if m-l >=a) plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is taken as a single code). Wait, no. The number of ways to split S[a..m] is equal to the number of ways to split S[a..m-l] (if the code of length l is valid) multiplied by 1 (since each split of S[a..m-l] can be extended by adding this code). Also, if the entire substring is valid (i.e., l = m - a +1), then there's an additional case where we take the entire substring as one code.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible a?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i (current end of the string), we can track for each possible position j (start of the substring) the number of ways to split S[j..i]. But this would require O(n^2) space, which for m up to 3000 would be 9 million entries. That's manageable, perhaps.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a DP table. Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i]. Then, for each i, we can compute dp[i][j] for all j from 1 to i.\n\nThe recurrence would be: for each j, dp[i][j] = sum over l (possible lengths of the last code) such that the substring ending at i with length l is valid, and the substring S[j..i-l] can be split. Then, dp[i][j] = sum for each valid l (from 1 to 4) of dp[i - l][j] (if i - l >= j) plus 1 if the entire substring is valid (i.e., l = i - j + 1). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for the substring S[j..i], the number of ways to split it is equal to the sum for each possible l (1 to 4) such that the last l characters form a valid code. For each such l, if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to split S[j..i-l] (if i-l >=j) plus 1 if l equals the entire length (i-j+1) ?\n\nNo, more accurately, if we take the last l characters as a valid code, then the number of ways to split S[j..i] is equal to the number of ways to split S[j..i-l] (if i-l >=j) plus 1 if there is no previous part (i.e., if i-l = j-1, meaning that the entire substring is split into this one code). Wait, no. The number of ways would be the number of ways to split S[j..i-l] multiplied by 1 (since we add this code to each of those splits). If i-l < j, then that means that the entire substring is the code of length l. So in that case, it's 1 way.\n\nSo the recurrence for dp[i][j] is:\n\ndp[i][j] = sum over l in {1,2,3,4}:\n\n   if the substring S[i-l+1..i] is valid, then:\n\n      if i - l >= j:\n\n          dp[i-l][j]\n\n      else:\n\n          1\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, since we are building up the string incrementally, maybe we can find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut with m up to 3000, and for each i up to m, and j up to i, this would be O(m^2) time and space. For m=3000, that's 9 million operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the set of invalid codes: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\n- For each step, after appending the new character to S, we build the string S up to length m.\n\n- For each i (current length of S), and for each j (start of the substring), compute dp[i][j], which is the number of ways to split S[j..i].\n\n- The total answer after each step is the sum of dp[i][j] for all j from 1 to i.\n\nBut how to compute dp[i][j]?\n\nLet me think of the initial conditions. For i = j, the substring is of length 1. If it's valid, then dp[i][j] = 1. Else, 0.\n\nFor i > j, we can compute dp[i][j] based on the previous values.\n\nBut for each i, we can compute dp[i][j] for all j from 1 to i.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each i, we can iterate j from 1 to i. For each j, we can check for l=1 to 4, if the substring S[j..i] can be split by taking the last l characters as a valid code.\n\nWait, but for the substring S[j..i], the last l characters are S[i-l+1..i]. So for each l in 1-4, if that substring is valid, then we can add dp[i-l][j] (if i-l >= j) or 1 (if i-l < j). So for each j and i, dp[i][j] = sum over l in 1-4 (if valid) of (dp[i-l][j] if i-l >= j else 1).\n\nBut this seems like a feasible approach.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] is the number of ways to split S[j..i].\n\nInitially, for i=1, j=1: check if the first character is valid. It is, unless it's one of the four invalid codes. Wait, the invalid codes are of length 4. So for length 1, all codes are valid. So for any single character, it's valid. So dp[1][1] = 1.\n\nThen, for i from 2 to m:\n\n   for j from 1 to i:\n\n      dp[i][j] = 0\n\n      for l in 1 to 4:\n\n         if i - l + 1 < j: continue (since the l-length substring starts at i-l+1, which must be >=j)\n\n         start = i - l + 1\n\n         if start < j: continue\n\n         substring = S[start:i+1] (assuming 0-based or 1-based?)\n\n         if substring is valid:\n\n             if start == j:\n\n                 # the entire substring is the code of length l\n\n                 dp[i][j] += 1\n\n             else:\n\n                 # add dp[start-1][j] ?\n\n                 Wait, no. Wait, start is i-l+1. So the substring from j to i is split into the part from j to start-1 and the code from start to i. So the number of ways would be dp[start-1][j] (the number of ways to split j to start-1) multiplied by 1 (the current code). So dp[i][j] += dp[start-1][j]\n\nBut how is the start-1 related to j? Well, if start is i-l+1, then start-1 = i - l. So for j to start-1, that's j to i-l. So for that part, we need to have dp[i-l][j] ?\n\nWait, the substring from j to i-l is S[j..i-l], and the code is from i-l+1 to i. So the number of ways to split S[j..i] is the number of ways to split S[j..i-l] multiplied by 1 (since we add the code). So yes, if the code is valid, then dp[i][j] += dp[i-l][j].\n\nBut wait, the indices here are tricky. Let me clarify:\n\nAssuming that the string S is 1-based. For example, S[1] is the first character, S[2] the second, etc.\n\nFor a given i and j, and l, the code is S[i-l+1 ... i]. For that code to be part of the substring S[j...i], the start of the code (i-l+1) must be >= j. So i-l+1 >= j → l <= i -j +1.\n\nSo for each j, and for each possible l (1-4), if l <= i-j+1, then check if the code is valid. If yes, then add dp[i-l][j] to dp[i][j]. However, if i-l < j, that is, when l = i-j+1, then i-l = j-1, so dp[i-l][j] is dp[j-1][j], which is zero unless j-1 = j, which is impossible. So in that case, we should add 1 instead.\n\nWait, because if i-l = j-1, then the code is the entire substring S[j..i], and there's exactly one way to split it (just take the code). So in that case, we add 1.\n\nSo the formula for dp[i][j] is:\n\ndp[i][j] = sum over l=1 to 4:\n\n   if l <= i-j+1:\n\n       code = S[i-l+1 ... i]\n\n       if code is valid:\n\n           if i-l >= j:\n\n               dp[i][j] += dp[i-l][j]\n\n           else:\n\n               dp[i][j] += 1\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo for each i and j, we need to check for each l from 1 to 4, and if the code is valid, then add accordingly.\n\nBut for each i and j, the code is of length l. For example, when i=3, j=1, and l=3, then code is S[1..3], which is the entire substring.\n\nBut for this to be valid, the code must not be in the invalid list.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Precompute the invalid set. The invalid codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So for each possible code of length 1-4, we can check if it's in this set.\n\nSo during the processing of each i and j, when checking the code of length l, we can generate the string and check if it's invalid.\n\nBut generating the string each time might be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can precompute all possible valid codes. For example, for all possible codes of length 1-4, except the four invalid ones.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking, during the DP steps, for each l, we can generate the substring and check if it's in the invalid set.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 4, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is that for each i and j, and for each l, we need to check if the substring S[i-l+1 ... i] is valid.\n\nOnce that's done, the DP can be computed.\n\nOnce we have the dp[i][j] for all j, then the answer after each step is the sum of dp[i][j] for all j from 1 to i.\n\nBut with m up to 3000, and for each step, the sum over j from 1 to i of dp[i][j], this could be O(m^2) time.\n\nBut let's think about the time complexity. For each step i (from 1 to m), we process O(i) j's. For each j, we check up to 4 l's. So the total time is O(m^2 * 4) = 4*3000^2 = 36 million operations. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the invalid codes as a set.\n\n- For each step, build the string S as it's being appended.\n\n- For each i (current length of S), compute dp[i][j] for all j from 1 to i.\n\n- After each step, compute the sum over j from 1 to i of dp[i][j], and output that modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut how to manage the DP table? Since for each i, we need the dp[i][j] for all j's, but for i steps, it's O(m^2) space. For m=3000, that's 9 million entries. Each entry is an integer. In Python, that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize space. Since for each i, to compute dp[i][j], we need dp[i-l][j] for previous i-l. So perhaps we can use a 2D array, with rows for i and columns for j.\n\nBut let's proceed with the straightforward approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial steps.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAfter each step, the string S is:\n\nStep 1: \"1\"\n\nStep 2: \"11\"\n\nStep 3: \"111\"\n\nAt step 1, the sum is dp[1][1] = 1 → output 1.\n\nAt step 2, the sum is dp[2][1] + dp[2][2].\n\nFor dp[2][1]: check for l=1 and l=2.\n\nFor l=1: code is \"1\" (valid). Then add dp[1][1] = 1.\n\nFor l=2: code is \"11\" (valid). Then since i-l = 2-2 = 0, which is less than j=1? No, j=1, i-l = 0. So since i-l is 0 < j=1, we add 1. So dp[2][1] = 1 + 1 = 2?\n\nWait, no. For j=1, i=2. For l=1: the code is S[2-1+1 ... 2] → S[2 ... 2] → \"1\" (valid). Then i-l = 2-1 = 1. j is 1. So i-l = 1 >= j=1. So we add dp[1][1] = 1.\n\nFor l=2: the code is S[2-2+1 ... 2] = S[1 ... 2] → \"11\" (valid). i-l = 0. Since 0 < j=1, add 1. So dp[2][1] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ndp[2][2] is for j=2, i=2. Check l=1. Code is \"1\", valid. So add 1. So dp[2][2] = 1. Sum is 2 + 1 = 3 → which matches the sample's second output line.\n\nAt step 3, i=3. The sum is sum over j=1,2,3 of dp[3][j].\n\nFor j=1:\n\nCheck l=1, 2, 3.\n\nl=1: code is S[3] = \"1\" → valid. i-l = 3-1=2. So add dp[2][1] = 2.\n\nl=2: code is S[2..3] = \"11\" → valid. i-l = 3-2 = 1. So add dp[1][1] = 1.\n\nl=3: code is S[1..3] = \"111\" → valid. i-l = 0 < j=1 → add 1. So total is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nFor j=2:\n\nCheck l=1, 2.\n\nl=1: code is S[3] → valid. i-l = 3-1 = 2. j=2. i-l = 2 >= j=2. So add dp[2][2] = 1.\n\nl=2: code is S[2..3] → \"11\" → valid. i-l = 3-2 = 1. j=2. 1 < 2 → add 1. So total is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nFor j=3:\n\nl=1 → code is \"1\" → valid. Add 1. So dp[3][3] = 1.\n\nTotal sum is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 → which matches the sample's third output line.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut first, how to represent the string S. Since each step appends a character, we can keep it as a list, and build it step by step.\n\nNow, for the DP table. We can create a 2D list, say dp, where dp[i][j] is the number of ways for substring S[j..i].\n\nBut in Python, indices are 0-based. So perhaps we need to adjust for that. Let's think of S as 0-based. So for i-th character (after m steps), the string is S[0..m-1].\n\nBut during the steps, for each step k (from 1 to m), the string has length k. So for i in 1..m (current length), and j ranges from 1 to i (but in 0-based, it's 0 to i-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to make everything 1-based. So S is 1-based. So for the first step, S[1] = '1'.\n\nBut in Python, strings are 0-based. So perhaps during processing, we can have a list that is 1-based. For example, S = [''] + list_of_characters. So S[1] is the first character, etc.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to manage with 0-based indices.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to generate the substring for each l and check if it's in the invalid set.\n\nSo, the invalid set is {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}.\n\nNow, for each step, after appending the new character, we have the current string. For each i (current length of the string, from 1 to m), we compute dp[i][j] for j from 1 to i.\n\nBut for each i, j can be from 1 to i. For each j, and for l in 1-4, check if the substring from (i - l + 1) to i is valid. If yes, then add the appropriate value.\n\nBut for the code, let's think of the string S as a list, with indexes 0-based. So after m steps, the string has length m. For step i (current length), we have S[0..i-1].\n\nSo, for j in 1..i (but in 0-based, j ranges from 0 to i-1?), perhaps this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to use 0-based for the string and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nLet's have S be a list that grows with each step. Initially empty. For each step, we append a character (0 or 1) to S. So after m steps, the length is m.\n\nFor each i (current length, from 1 to m), we need to compute for all j in 0..i-1 (the start index of the substring), the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i-1].\n\nSo, for the DP table, we can have dp[i][j], where i is the current length of the string, and j is the start index (0-based) of the substring. The substring is S[j..i-1], which has length i-j.\n\nSo for example, when i=1, the string is length 1. j can be 0, and the substring is S[0..0], which is length 1.\n\nNow, the recurrence:\n\nFor dp[i][j], which represents the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i-1], we look for l in 1..4. For each l, check if the substring S[i-l..i-1] (since the end is i-1, and the length is l, so the start is i-l) is valid. Wait, for example, if the current length is i, then the substring of length l ending at i-1 starts at (i-1) - l + 1 = i - l. So the substring is from i-l to i-1 (inclusive), which is of length l.\n\nSo for each l in 1..4, if i-l >= j (so that the start of the code is >= j), then check if the substring S[i-l ... i-1] is valid. If it is, then:\n\nIf i-l == j → the entire substring is the code. So add 1.\n\nElse → add dp[i-l][j] (the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i-l-1], which is the part before the code).\n\nSo the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i][j] = sum over l=1 to 4:\n\n   if (i - l) >= j:\n\n       code = S[i-l : i] (since S is 0-based, and the substring from i-l to i-1 is S[i-l:i])\n\n       if code is valid:\n\n           dp[i][j] += dp[i-l][j]\n\n   else:\n\n       code = S[j : i] (since i-l < j, which implies that j is i-l + 1? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, if i - l < j → then the code starts at i-l, which is less than j. So the code is overlapping with the substring S[j..i-1]. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the code can only be considered if the start of the code (i-l) is >= j. So for l in 1..4, the code starts at i-l, and must be >= j. So the condition is i-l >= j. If that is not true, then we cannot take this code as the last part of the substring S[j..i-1].\n\nTherefore, for each l, we check if i-l >= j. Only then proceed.\n\nSo for each l, if i-l >= j, then check if the code is valid. If yes, then add dp[i-l][j] to dp[i][j].\n\nBut what if the code is of length l, and starts at i-l, which is >= j. Then the code is part of the substring S[j..i-1]. The rest of the substring is S[j..i-l-1], which is of length (i-l - j) + 1 = i-l -j +1 = i -j - l + 1. Wait, but the code is of length l, and the rest is from j to i-l-1. So the length of the rest is (i-l-1 - j + 1) = i-l -j.\n\nSo, the number of ways to split S[j..i-1] is the sum over all valid l of the number of ways to split S[j..i-l-1], which is dp[i-l][j], since the length of S[j..i-l-1] is (i-l-1 - j + 1) = i-l -j. So the length of that substring is (i-l -j) = (i - j) - l. But the dp[i-l][j] is the number of ways to split the substring of length (i-l - j) ?\n\nWait, the dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to split the substring S[j..i-1]. So when i-l is the length of the string up to (i-l) characters. So the substring S[j..i-l-1] is of length (i-l - j) + 1? Wait, no. For example, j is the start index, and the end index is i-l-1. The length is (i-l-1 - j + 1) = i - l - j.\n\nBut dp[i-l][j] represents the number of ways to split the substring S[j..(i-l-1)] (since when the length is",
