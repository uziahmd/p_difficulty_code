The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Since the districts form a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between any two districts), removing some districts will split the tree into parts. But the president wants the remaining districts to be connected. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i for those nodes is as large as possible. Then, the districts to remove are the ones not in this subtree.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree? Well, since the sum is maximized by keeping the districts with the highest possible i values. Because 2^i grows exponentially. So, the optimal strategy would be to keep the districts with the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure connectivity? For example, if we take the largest n - k districts, but they might not be connected. So we need to find a way to select the largest possible districts while maintaining connectivity.\n\nSo here's an idea: the optimal subtree must include the district with the highest number, because otherwise, if you have a higher-numbered district not included, you could replace a lower-numbered one in the subtree with it, which would increase the sum. So the maximum sum subtree must include the highest-numbered district. Then, recursively, we can think of building the subtree by including the highest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can approach this as a problem where we need to select the districts with the highest possible values, and then make sure that they are connected. But how?\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a subtree of size (n - k) with maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, and each node's value is 2^i, which is very large for higher i. Therefore, the optimal subtree must contain as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to start with the highest-numbered node, then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing which nodes to exclude. We need to remove k nodes. The key is to remove the nodes with the smallest possible values, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps we can find a way to remove the smallest nodes, but in a way that doesn't disconnect the tree.\n\nWait, but how to do that? For example, suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Suppose n=6, k=3. We need to remove 3 nodes. The best is to keep 4,5,6. But how to ensure that they are connected. Well, if the tree is a chain, then to keep the highest nodes, we need to remove the lower ones. But in that case, the subtree is connected.\n\nBut in a more complex tree structure, like a star, perhaps?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose the tree is rooted at node 2, with children 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. So node 2 is connected to all others. If n=6 and k=3. Then we need to remove 3 nodes. The best is to keep 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, but wait, no. Wait, n -k = 3. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The maximum sum would be 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4. But how to connect them? Well, if node 6 is connected to 2, and node 5 is connected to 2, and node 4 connected to 2. So the subtree is 2, 4,5,6. But we need to choose three nodes. Wait, maybe 5,6, and 2. Then the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6. Which is better than other combinations. So in that case, the subtree includes the highest possible nodes, but also their parent (node 2). But how to find this?\n\nSo the approach seems to be to select the nodes with the highest values, but ensuring that they are connected. So the way to do this is to start with the highest node, and then include as many high nodes as possible that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using a priority queue approach. Let's think:\n\nWe can model the problem as selecting the nodes to keep. We",

The districts are structured as a tree, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, so any removal of districts must ensure the remaining districts stay connected.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ grows exponentially with $i$, we should prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers.\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Start from the highest-numbered district and use a priority queue (max-heap) to greedily add the highest possible districts that are connected to the current subtree.\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to traverse the tree and maintain connectivity while selecting districts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts\n    # Start from the highest node, and perform a BFS to collect the largest possible nodes\n    # Using a max heap, but since Python has min-heap, we can store negatives\n    # We will use a priority queue to select the next best node to include\n    # Initially, we start with the highest node (n), and then add its neighbors\n    # But we need to track visited nodes to avoid cycles\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    # Start with node n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    count = 1\n    result = []\n    \n    while count < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        for neighbor in tree[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n                count += 1\n                # Also, we need to consider adding neighbors of neighbor?\n                # No, because we are using BFS here, but the heap ensures we take the largest next\n                # Wait, no.
