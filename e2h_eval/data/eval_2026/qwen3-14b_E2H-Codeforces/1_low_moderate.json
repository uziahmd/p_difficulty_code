    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the rectangle it's based on is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but the ring is the border of that rectangle. So for each such rectangle, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be calculated as 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter in cells is 2*(w + h) - 4. Wait, because each side contributes. Let me think again. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3. The perimeter cells would be 3*4 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let's compute it as 2*(w + h - 2). For 3x3: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8. So that formula seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. However, we have to make sure that the rectangle is valid. For example, if the rectangle's width or height is less than 1, then that ring can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. Because the input constraints say k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check that. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, the first ring is the outer perimeter. If we tried to do a second ring, the next rectangle would be 3 - 4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. But the input ensures that k is such that all rings are possible.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nBut how to compute the perimeter for each ring?\n\nLet me think again. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Because:\n\nThe top and bottom rows contribute W cells each. The left and right columns contribute (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). \n\nYes, that's correct. So for each ring i, the W is (original width minus 4*(i-1)), same for H. Then calculate 2*(W + H - 2) for that ring.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add perimeter to total\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. \n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h = 3. perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 -2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h 9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. \n\nFirst ring: 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring: i=2. current_w = 7 - 4*(1) = 3. current_h = 9 -4*(1) = 5. perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = ",
