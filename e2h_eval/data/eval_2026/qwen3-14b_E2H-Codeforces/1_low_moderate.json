The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, for example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells would be the total cells on the borders. For a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each of the four sides contributes W or H, but subtracting the four corners which are counted twice. For example, 3x3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8.\n\nYes, so for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*( (current_width) + (current_height) - 2 ), since current_width is (w - 4*(i-1)) and current_height is (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, no: the formula is 2*(W + H) - 4. Which is same as 2*(W + H - 2). So yes.\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, we calculate this value and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, what's the current_width and current_height for the i-th ring? Let's see. The first ring (i=1) is based on the original w and h. Then the second ring (i=2) is based on w - 4*(i-1) = w -4*(1) = w-4, and similarly for h. But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for each ring, we need to compute that.\n\nBut we have to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3, and the next ring would be 3-4*(1) = -1, but since k is given such that it's allowed, the input ensures that k is not larger than floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be more than 1. So the code doesn't have to handle invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add perimeter to total\n\nReturn total\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. Then current_w and current_h are 3 and 3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. For i=1, perimeter is 28. For i=2, current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w and current_h",
