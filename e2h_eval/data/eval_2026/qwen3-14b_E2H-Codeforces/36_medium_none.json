The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers are valid. Let's think about the conditions required for the signal setup.\n\nSo, for each tower, when you set its power p, it covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, the description says that a tower at i with power p reaches every city c where |c - i| < p. So that's equivalent to c being in (i - p + 1, i + p - 1)? Wait, no. Let me think: |c - i| < p implies that c is in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]?\n\nWait, for example, if p is 2, then |c - i| < 2 means c can be i-1, i, or i+1. Because |c - i| can be 0, 1. So the range is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. So the length is 2p-1. So the tower's coverage is a range of length 2p-1 centered at i.\n\nBut the problem requires that each town 1..n is covered by exactly one tower. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nSo how can we model the valid tower configurations?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the tower positions. For example, suppose there's a tower at position i. Then, the signal power p must be chosen such that:\n\n- The coverage of this tower does not reach town 0 or n+1. So, for town 0: if there is a tower at i, then the maximum possible p is such that i - p + 1 > 0. Wait, no. The coverage of the tower includes all cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered, we need that |0 - i| >= p. Which implies that p <= i. Similarly, for town n+1, the tower's coverage must not reach there. So for a tower at i, the maximum p is such that |n+1 - i| >= p. Which implies p <= (n+1 - i).\n\nBut since the signal power can be adjusted, perhaps the key is that the tower configuration must allow for some assignment of p's that satisfy these constraints. However, how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid tower configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that they form a certain pattern. For example, maybe each tower must be responsible for covering a certain interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping except for the exact coverage.\n\nWait, but the problem allows overlapping coverage as long as each town is covered exactly once. But how can that happen? For example, if two towers are adjacent, like tower at position i and i+1. If both have p=1, then their coverage would be [i-0, i+0] (since |c - i| < 1 implies c = i) for the first, and similarly for the second. So each covers their own town. But if they have higher p, their ranges could overlap.\n\nBut the problem requires that each town is covered exactly once. So, the way the towers are placed must allow for a partitioning of the towns 1..n into ranges, each assigned to exactly one tower, such that the tower's coverage includes that range, and the ranges don't overlap except for possibly the edges.\n\nWait, maybe the problem reduces to the towers forming a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain segment of towns, and the segments are non-overlapping. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for any valid configuration, each tower must cover a certain interval, and these intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n. Also, each interval must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\nBut how to find the number of such tower configurations?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the necessary conditions for the tower configuration.\n\nFor the towns 0 and n+1 to not receive any signal, the following must hold:\n\nFor any tower at position i, the signal power p must be chosen such that:\n\n- For town 0: i - p >= 0? Or wait, the condition is that town 0 is not covered. So for any tower, the coverage must not include 0. So the maximum p allowed for a tower at i is p <= i (since |0 - i| = i, so p must be <= i). Similarly, for town n+1, the maximum p is p <= (n+1 - i).\n\nBut since the signal power can be adjusted, the tower can choose p to be any value as long as it satisfies these constraints. However, the problem is not about choosing p's, but whether there exists a way to choose them such that all towns 1..n are covered exactly once.\n\nBut how can we model the tower positions that allow such a configuration?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a tiling problem. For example, each tower must be placed in such a way that there's a way to assign ranges to them that cover the entire 1..n region without overlapping, and each range is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of placing dominoes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the tower positions must form a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain segment, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's say that for a valid configuration, there must be a tower at position i, which covers some segment. Let's say that the first tower is at position i, and it covers up to some point. Then, the rest of the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the entire configuration to be valid, the towers must be placed such that there's a way to assign ranges where each tower's range starts at some position and ends at another, covering exactly the towns, and ensuring that each town is covered once.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the towers must be arranged such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain distance. For example, if there are two towers at positions i and j (i < j), then the coverage of the tower at i must not reach j, or the tower at j must not reach i. Otherwise, there's an overlap, but that's allowed only if the coverage is arranged such that each town is covered once.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as requiring that the tower positions form a valid \"domino\" tiling where each tower's coverage is exactly a certain range. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at the examples given.\n\nIn the first example, n=2. The valid case is when towers are built at both 1 and 2. Then, each can have power 1. So the coverage is 1 for tower 1 (covers town 1), and tower 2 covers town 2. Towns 0 and 3 are not covered. That works.\n\nAnother possible valid configuration would be if there's only a tower at position 1, with power 2. Then, the coverage would be towns 0 (since |0-1| < 2 is true?), wait no. Wait, for p=2, the coverage is all towns c where |c - 1| < 2. That is c can be 0, 1, 2. But town 0 is not allowed to be covered. So this configuration would not be valid. Hence, the tower at position 1 cannot have p=2. Therefore, the only valid configuration is when there are towers at both 1 and 2, each with p=1.\n\nSo the answer for n=2 is 1/4, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example is when n=3. The answer is 1/4. According to the note, this comes from two cases: towers at 1,2,3 (prob 1/8) and tower only at 2 (prob 1/8). So total 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nIn the first case, each tower has p=1. In the second case, the tower at 2 has p=2, which covers towns 1, 2, 3. But how does that work? Because town 0 is at position 0, and |0 - 2| = 2. So p must be <= 2. If p is 2, then |0 - 2| is equal to p, which is not less than p. So town 0 is not covered. Similarly, for town 4 (n+1 = 4), |4-2|=2, which is equal to p. So again, not covered. So that's acceptable. Then, the coverage of the tower at 2 with p=2 covers towns 1, 2, 3. Each of those towns is covered once. So that's valid.\n\nSo the tower configuration must allow for such assignments.\n\nNow, the question is: How to count the number of valid tower configurations?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1 to i), considering that the coverage ends properly and that the last tower is placed in a certain way.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the valid tower configurations as those where the towers are placed in such a way that they form a set of positions where each tower is responsible for a certain interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother observation: For a tower to cover a certain interval, say from a to b, the tower must be located at some position i in [a, b], and the power p must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. Wait, but since the coverage is all towns c with |c - i| < p, the maximum coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. So for the tower to cover exactly the interval [a, b], we need that:\n\na = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1 â†’ which implies that b - a + 1 = 2p - 1 â†’ p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2 = (b - a + 2)/2. But since p must be an integer, this requires that b - a + 1 is odd. Wait, perhaps not. Because p can be any integer as long as the coverage includes the interval. But for the tower to cover exactly [a, b], the p must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. So solving these equations gives i = (a + b)/2 and p = (b - a + 1)/2 + 1? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nFrom a = i - p + 1 â†’ i = a + p - 1.\n\nFrom b = i + p - 1 â†’ substituting i from above: b = (a + p - 1) + p - 1 = a + 2p - 2 â†’ rearranged: 2p = b - a + 2 â†’ p = (b - a + 2)/2.\n\nSo for p to be integer, (b - a + 2) must be even. Which implies that (b - a) must be even. So the length of the interval [a, b] is (b - a + 1). For example, if a=1 and b=3, length is 3. Then (b - a + 2) = 3 + 2 - 1? Wait, no. Wait, for a=1, b=3, then (b -a +2) is 3-1+2 =4, divided by 2 gives p=2. So the tower is at i = a + p -1 = 1 + 2 -1 = 2. Which makes sense. The tower at 2 with p=2 covers towns 1,2,3.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem?\n\nWell, for the entire configuration to be valid, the towns 1..n must be partitioned into intervals [a_1, b_1], [a_2, b_2], ..., each covered by exactly one tower. And for each such interval, there must be a tower at position i = (a_k + b_k)/2, and the tower must be present. Also, the tower's position must be in the interval [a_k, b_k], and the length of the interval must be such that (b_k - a_k) is even, allowing p to be integer.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, this suggests that the valid tower configurations are those where the positions of the towers form a set of positions such that each tower is the center of an interval covering some part of the towns 1..n, and these intervals are non-overlapping and cover the entire range.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems similar to tiling the line with certain blocks.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for the first k towns, the number of valid configurations is dp[k]. How can we build dp[k] from previous values?\n\nFor example, consider that the last interval is covered by a tower at position i, which covers from some a to k. Then, the tower must be placed at i, and the interval [a, k] must be covered by this tower. Then, the rest of the configuration (from 1 to a-1) must be valid.\n\nBut for the tower to cover [a, k], the length of the interval is k - a + 1. As discussed earlier, the tower must be placed at i = (a + k)/2. Which implies that a + k must be even. So a must be congruent to k modulo 2. Also, since the tower is located at i, which is between a and k.\n\nMoreover, the tower must exist (i.e., it's built). So for the interval [a, k], the tower at i must be present.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can look back to all possible a's such that a <= k, and a +k is even, and then add dp[a-1] * 1 (the presence of the tower at i).\n\nBut since each tower is built with probability 1/2, the total number of valid configurations would be the sum over all possible ways of partitioning the towns into such intervals multiplied by the probability of the towers being present.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the towers are built with probability 1/2, and we need to count the number of subsets S of {1, ..., n} such that there exists a way to assign intervals as described. Then, the total number of valid subsets is multiplied by (1/2)^n (since each subset has probability 1/2^n).\n\nBut how do we compute the number of valid subsets S?\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let dp[i] be the number of valid subsets for the first i towns (positions 1..i) that satisfy the conditions (i.e., that there exists a way to assign the signal powers such that towns 0 and i+1 are not covered, and each town 1..i is covered exactly once).\n\nThen, the recurrence for dp[i] would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j-1] * (number of ways to have a tower at position (j + i)/2 and no other towers in the interval [j, i], but wait no. Because the subset S must include the tower at position (j+i)/2, and the rest of the subset is determined by the dp[j-1].\n\nWait, for the interval [j, i], the tower must be placed at (j + i)/2. So, for this to be possible, j + i must be even. Let me denote m = (j + i)/2. So m must be an integer. Then, the subset S must contain m, and no other towers in [j, i] except m. Because otherwise, if there are other towers in [j, i], then their coverage would interfere with the coverage of m's tower. Wait, but maybe not. However, for the configuration to be valid, the entire interval [j, i] must be covered by exactly the tower at m. So, there cannot be any other towers in [j, i], because those would have to be covered by some other tower, but the way the intervals are structured would require that they are part of other intervals.\n\nTherefore, for the dynamic programming approach, when considering the interval [j, i], we must ensure that the only tower in this interval is m. Thus, the subset S must include m, and exclude all other positions in [j, i].\n\nSo, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j=1 to i} [if (i - j) is even, then dp[j-1] * 1 ] \n\nWait, but how do we account for the fact that the tower at m must be present (so contributes a factor of 1) and all other positions in [j, i] must not be present (so contributes a factor of 1 for each of those positions not being present). But since the subset S is considered, the total number of valid subsets for the interval [j, i] is 1 (the tower at m is present, others are absent). So for each such j, the number of ways is dp[j-1] * 1 (since for the interval [j, i], the tower is present and the rest are not).\n\nBut how to compute this? Let me think again.\n\nThe dp[i] counts the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. For each such subset, the entire interval 1..i is covered by some arrangement of towers. To compute dp[i], we can consider that the last interval ends at i. Let's say that this interval starts at j. Then, the tower must be at m = (j + i)/2. For this to be valid, j must be such that (j + i) is even, and m is between j and i. Also, the subset must contain m and not contain any other positions in [j, i]. The rest of the positions (before j) are handled by dp[j-1].\n\nSo, the number of ways for this choice of j is dp[j-1] * 1 (since the tower at m is present, and all other positions in [j, i] are not present). However, the positions outside [j, i] are handled by dp[j-1], which already accounts for their selection.\n\nSo, the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j=1}^i [ if (i-j) is even, then dp[j-1] * 1 ] \n\nBut wait, for each j, the interval [j, i] must be covered by the tower at m. Also, for the tower's coverage to not reach town 0 and i+1.\n\nWait, the tower is at position m. The coverage of this tower is from m - p + 1 to m + p - 1, where p is the signal power. For this interval to be exactly [j, i], we need that p = (i - j + 1 + 1)/2 = (i - j + 2)/2. Which is the same as p = (i - j)/2 + 1. Since the length of the interval [j, i] is i - j + 1. For example, if j = i, then the length is 1, and p = (0 + 1 + 1)/2 = 1. So the tower at m = i would have p=1, covering exactly [i].\n\nBut also, the tower's coverage must not reach town 0 or town i+1. For the tower at m, the coverage is [m - p + 1, m + p - 1] = [j, i]. So, the left end is j, which is >= 1. So town 0 is not covered. For the right end, i is the last town. The next town is i+1. The distance between m and i+1 is (i+1 - m) = (i+1 - (j + i)/2) = (i + 1 - j)/2. Since j and i are such that i - j is even, let's say i - j = 2k. Then, j = i - 2k. Then, the distance is (i + 1 - (i - 2k))/2 = (2k + 1)/2. Which is not an integer. But the signal power p is (i-j + 2)/2 = (2k + 2)/2 = k + 1. The distance from m to i+1 is (i+1 - m) = (i+1 - (j + i)/2) = (i+1 - (i - 2k + i)/2) ?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute for the tower at m, the distance to town i+1 is (i+1) - m. For the coverage to not reach i+1, we need that (i+1) - m >= p. Since p is the signal power. But p is chosen such that the coverage is exactly [j, i]. So p must be such that m - p + 1 = j and m + p -1 = i. Solving these equations gives p = (i - j + 2)/2. Then, m - p + 1 = j â†’ m - ((i-j+2)/2) +1 = j â†’ m = j + (i-j+2)/2 -1 â†’ m = (2j + i - j + 2 - 2)/2 â†’ m = (j + i)/2. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the distance from m to i+1 is (i+1 - m) = (i+1 - (j + i)/2) = (2i + 2 - j - i)/2 = (i + 2 - j)/2. Since i - j is even, let's write i - j = 2k. Then, j = i - 2k. Substituting, we get (i + 2 - (i - 2k)) / 2 = (2 + 2k)/2 = k + 1. Which equals p. So (i+1 - m) = p. Therefore, the distance is exactly p. Which means that town i+1 is not covered (because |i+1 - m| = p, which is not less than p). So the condition is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, for town 0: the distance from m to 0 is m. We need that m >= p. Since p = (i-j + 2)/2. Let's substitute j = i - 2k. Then, i-j = 2k â†’ p = (2k + 2)/2 = k+1. And m = (j + i)/2 = (i - 2k + i)/2 = (2i - 2k)/2 = i -k. So m = i -k. Now, m >= p â†’ i -k >= k + 1 â†’ i >= 2k + 1. But since j = i - 2k >= 1 (since j is between 1 and i), then i - 2k >= 1 â†’ 2k <= i -1 â†’ k <= (i-1)/2. So i >= 2k + 1 is equivalent to k <= (i-1)/2. Which holds. Because j = i - 2k >= 1 â†’ 2k <= i-1 â†’ k <= (i-1)/2. Therefore, m = i -k >= i - (i-1)/2 = (i + 1)/2. And p = k + 1. But since k can be up to (i-1)/2, then p can be up to (i-1)/2 + 1 = (i+1)/2. So m = i -k. For example, if k = (i-1)/2, then m = i - (i-1)/2 = (i + 1)/2. Then p = (i-1)/2 + 1 = (i+1)/2. So m = (i+1)/2, p = (i+1)/2. Then m >= p â†’ (i+1)/2 >= (i+1)/2 â†’ yes. So the condition holds.\n\nThus, for any valid interval [j, i] where j + i is even, the tower at m will not cover town 0 or i+1. Therefore, the recurrence for dp[i] is correct.\n\nSo, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (base case: zero towns, one way to do nothing)\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j-1], where j ranges from 1 to i, and i - j is even.\n\nBut wait, for each j, i - j must be even. So j must have the same parity as i. So for each i, j can be any number such that j â‰¤ i, and j has the same parity as i.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the recurrence. For example, for i=1, the possible j is 1. Because i-j = 0, which is even. So dp[1] = dp[0] = 1.\n\nFor i=2, j can be 2 (i-j=0) or j=0? No, j starts from 1. So j can be 2 (since 2-2=0 even). So dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. But according to the first example, when n=2, the valid subsets are those with towers at 1 and 2. But according to this dp, dp[2] is 1, which would correspond to the number of valid subsets. But in reality, there's only one valid subset (both towers present). So that's correct. Because the dp[i] counts the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. For i=2, the valid subsets are {1,2}, which is one subset. So yes, dp[2] = 1.\n\nBut for n=2, the probability is 1/(2^2) = 1/4. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: for n=3. Let's compute dp[3].\n\nFor i=3, j can be 1 or 3. Because 3-j must be even. For j=1: 3-1=2 even. For j=3: 3-3=0 even.\n\nSo dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. Which would correspond to two valid subsets. According to the note, for n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {2} (tower at 2, covering 1,2,3)\n- {1,2,3} (each with p=1)\n\nSo two subsets. Hence dp[3] = 2. Which matches.\n\nSo the DP approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute dp[n], and then the answer is dp[n] / 2^n, since each subset has probability 1/(2^n).\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, we need to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe problem now is how to compute dp[i] efficiently. The naive approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nBut looking for patterns in the recurrence.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again. For dp[i], it's the sum of dp[j-1] for all j where j has the same parity as i, and 1 â‰¤ j â‰¤ i.\n\nLet me split this into two cases based on the parity of i.\n\nLet me denote that for even i, the sum is over j even, and for odd i, over j odd. But j must be such that j â‰¤ i and same parity as i.\n\nBut how to find this sum?\n\nLet me think of the recurrence for dp[i] in terms of previous dp values.\n\nLet me consider that for i-th term, the sum is over all j with same parity as i, and j ranges from 1 to i.\n\nLet me define for even i:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} dp[2k - 1 - 1] ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the sum is equal to the sum of dp[j-1] for all j with same parity as i and j â‰¤ i.\n\nLet me denote that for a given i, the sum is equal to the sum of dp[k], where k ranges from 0 to i-1, and k = j-1, with j having the same parity as i. Since j has same parity as i, j-1 has parity i-1. Let me see:\n\nIf i is even, then j must be even. So j-1 is odd. So k = j-1 is odd.\n\nSimilarly, if i is odd, then j is odd, so j-1 is even. So k is even.\n\nThus, for i-th term, the sum is:\n\nif i is even: sum of dp[k] for all even k from 0 to i-1? No, wait:\n\nWait, j can be any number from 1 to i with same parity as i. Then, j-1 can be from 0 to i-1, and the parity of j-1 is (same parity as j) minus 1. Which is opposite parity to j. Since j has same parity as i, then j-1 has parity opposite to i.\n\nSo for example, if i is even, then j is even. So j-1 is odd. So the sum is sum of dp[k] for all k odd, where k = j-1, and j ranges from 1 to i. So k ranges from 0 (when j=1) up to i-1 (when j=i). So for i even, dp[i] = sum_{k odd} dp[k], where k ranges from 0 to i-1.\n\nSimilarly, if i is odd, then j is odd. So j-1 is even. So dp[i] = sum_{k even} dp[k], where k ranges from 0 to i-1.\n\nThis is a crucial observation. Because this allows us to compute the dp[i] based on previous sums of even or odd indices.\n\nSo, let's define two variables:\n\n- even_sum: the sum of dp[k] for all even k up to current i.\n- odd_sum: the sum of dp[k] for all odd k up to current i.\n\nBut how to track these sums as we compute dp[i]?\n\nLet me think. For each i:\n\nif i is even:\n\ndp[i] = odd_sum_prev (sum of dp[k] for odd k up to i-1)\n\nif i is odd:\n\ndp[i] = even_sum_prev (sum of dp[k] for even k up to i-1)\n\nThen, after computing dp[i], we can update the even_sum and odd_sum accordingly.\n\nLet me think of initial conditions.\n\ndp[0] = 1. Since for i=0, there are no towns. The base case.\n\nFor i=0, it's even (since 0 is even). So even_sum starts as 1, and odd_sum is 0.\n\nLet's simulate for small i.\n\ni=0: even_sum = 1, odd_sum = 0.\n\ni=1 (odd):\n\ndp[1] = even_sum_prev (which is even_sum up to i-1=0) = 1.\n\nThen, since i=1 is odd, we add dp[1] to odd_sum.\n\nNow, even_sum remains 1, odd_sum becomes 0 + 1 = 1.\n\ni=2 (even):\n\ndp[2] = odd_sum_prev (which is the sum of odd k up to 1, which is 1).\n\nThen, since i is even, we add dp[2] to even_sum. So even_sum becomes 1 + 1 = 2, odd_sum remains 1.\n\ni=3 (odd):\n\ndp[3] = even_sum_prev (which is even_sum up to i-1=2, which is 2).\n\nThen, add dp[3] (2) to odd_sum. Now, odd_sum is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\ni=4 (even):\n\ndp[4] = odd_sum_prev (sum of odd k up to 3, which is 3). So dp[4] = 3.\n\nAdd to even_sum: 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo for dp[4] = 3.\n\nLet's check for i=4. What is the number of valid subsets?\n\nLet me think. The valid subsets for i=4 are those that can be partitioned into intervals covered by towers. Let's see.\n\nFor example, possible ways:\n\n- One tower at 2 covering [1, 3], and another tower at 4 covering [4]. Then, the subset {2,4}.\n\n- Or, tower at 2 covering [1,3], and tower at 4 covering [4]. Also, the subset {2,4}.\n\nWait, but how many valid subsets are there?\n\nAlternatively, using the dp approach:\n\ndp[4] = 3. So there are 3 valid subsets.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nCase 1: One tower at 2 covering [1,3], and one at 4 covering [4]. Subset {2,4}.\n\nCase 2: One tower at 4 covering [1,4]. Wait, for that to be possible, the interval [1,4] must be covered by a tower at (1+4)/2 = 2.5? No, that's not integer. So that's invalid. So no.\n\nWait, for the interval [1,4], j=1 and i=4. i-j = 3, which is odd. So not allowed. So that's not considered.\n\nAnother possibility is tower at 3 covering [2,4], and tower at 1 covering [1]. So subset {1,3}.\n\nAnother possibility is tower at 1 covering [1], tower at 3 covering [2,4]. So subset {1,3}.\n\nAnother possibility is tower at 2 covering [1,3], tower at 4 covering [4]. So subset {2,4}.\n\nAnother possibility is tower at 3 covering [1, 5]? No, i=4.\n\nWait, another possibility is a single tower at 2.5? No, positions are integers. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: tower at 1, 2, 3, 4. Each with p=1. So subset {1,2,3,4}. This would be valid.\n\nBut how is that accounted for in the dp?\n\nLet me think: For this subset, the partitioning would be four intervals: [1], [2], [3], [4]. Each covered by their respective towers. So in the DP, this would be considered when for each step:\n\ndp[4] would be built by adding dp[0] (for j=1) + dp[1] (for j=3) + dp[3] (for j=4? No, j must be such that i-j is even. For i=4, j can be 1, 3, 4.\n\nWait, for i=4, j can be 1 (4-1=3, odd. No. Wait no, i=4 is even. So j must be even. So j can be 2 or 4.\n\nAh! Earlier mistake. When i is even, j must be even. So for i=4, j can be 2 or 4.\n\nSo for j=2: the interval [2,4]. Then, the tower is at (2+4)/2 = 3. So the subset must have 3, and no other towers in [2,4]. Then, the rest is dp[1] (for j=2, j-1=1). So dp[1] is 1.\n\nFor j=4: the interval [4,4], tower at 4. Then, the rest is dp[3] = 2. So total dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo the three valid subsets are:\n\n- {3, ...}? Let's think:\n\nWhen j=2, the interval [2,4] is covered by tower at 3. The rest is dp[1], which is the valid subsets for [1]. Which is {1} (tower at 1). So the subset is {1,3}.\n\nWhen j=4, the interval [4,4] is covered by tower at 4. The rest is dp[3], which has two valid subsets: {2} and {1,2,3}. So combining with {4}, the subsets are {2,4} and {1,2,3,4}.\n\nSo total of 3 subsets. Which matches dp[4] = 3. So the three subsets are {1,3}, {2,4}, {1,2,3,4}.\n\nYes. So the DP approach is working.\n\nSo the recurrence can be computed efficiently with maintaining even_sum and odd_sum.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\neven_sum = 1 (since 0 is even), odd_sum = 0.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is odd:\n\ndp[i] = even_sum_prev (the sum of even indices up to i-1)\n\nthen, add dp[i] to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and efficient summation techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns (positions 1 through i).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each `i`, compute `dp[i]` based on the sum of valid configurations from previous states. This is derived from the observation that valid configurations can be partitioned into intervals covered by towers.\n3. **Efficient Summation**: Maintain two running sums, `even_sum` and `odd_sum`, to keep track of the cumulative DP values for even and odd indices respectively. This allows us to compute `dp[i]` in constant time for each `i`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    even_sum = 1  # sum of dp[k] for even k up to current\n    odd_sum = 0   # sum of dp[k] for odd k up to current\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 1:\n            # i is odd, dp[i] = even_sum_prev (sum of even indices up to i-1)\n            dp[i] = even_sum\n        else:\n            # i is even, dp[i] = odd_sum_prev (sum of odd indices up to i-1)\n            dp[i] = odd_sum\n        \n        # Update even_sum and odd_sum\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum = (even_sum + dp[i]) % MOD\n        else:\n            odd_sum = (odd_sum + dp[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # The answer is dp[n] / (2^n) mod MOD\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute modular inverse of denominator\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there's exactly one way (doing nothing) to handle zero towns.\n2. **Running Sums**: `even_sum` and `odd_sum` keep track of cumulative DP values for even and odd indices, allowing efficient computation of `dp[i]`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle division in modular arithmetic. The modular inverse of `2^n` is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, making it feasible for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
