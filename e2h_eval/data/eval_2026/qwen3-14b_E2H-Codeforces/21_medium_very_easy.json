The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, exactly. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Calculate the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the plan. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities. \n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests=2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys=1 (7). \n\nThen min(3,1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys) and min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1. Chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: even_keys=0, odd_keys=1. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which is correct.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests=1, odd_chests=0. Keys: even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic works. Now, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps are straightforward. Read n and m, then the list of a's and b's. Then count even and odd in a, and even and odd in b. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of a_i. Then next line as list of b_j.\n\nCount even_a = number of elements in a that are even. odd_a = n - even_a.\n\nSimilarly for even_b and odd_b.\n\nResult is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nNow, handling the input. For each test case, but wait, looking at the sample input, the first line is the input for the problem, but the sample shows multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n integers a_i.\n\nThird line has m integers b_j.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different test cases. Like, the first input is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', which is one test case, then another '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5' and then '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem is for a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has a_i.\n\nThird line has b_j.\n\nSo, the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should process one test case. Wait, no, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three inputs, and the outputs are three outputs. But that's probably because the user is testing multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? But the problem's original input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases for the purpose of the example, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's input description: the first line contains n and m, etc. So the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases, which suggests that perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not mention that. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the sample input shows three examples. But in the problem's actual input, the code is supposed to read one test case. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is one test case. The sample output is 3. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But that's probably part of the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's original input is for a single test case. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is given as a list of three inputs. Wait, maybe the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but in reality, the code should process one test case. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line represents a separate test case. But that's not the case. For example, the first input line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20' which is one test case. So in the code, we need to read the input as per the problem's input description.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. So the code should read n and m, then the a array, then the b array.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as list of a's. Then read the next line as list of b's.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute even_a, odd_a, even_b, odd_b.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? Well, the problem's sample shows three test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code is written for one test case. But the sample input may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input is for one test case. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut why does the sample input have three test cases? Oh, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. But that's not clear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the output is given as a list of three outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. For example, in the problem's original statement, the input is for one test case. So the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which is perhaps for the purpose of the example. But in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as per the input description. So the code should read one test case. Therefore, the code should read n and m, then a's, then b's.\n\nTherefore, the code for the problem is straightforward. Now, let's proceed to code.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\ncount even in a: even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a.\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b.\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. That's the code. Let's test it against the sample.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a: 14,6,2 → 3. odd_a is 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1 (7).\n\nmin(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_a is 5, odd_a 0.\n\nb is [5]. even_b is 0, odd_b is 1.\n\nmin(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. total 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10]. even_a is 1, odd_a 0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50]. even_b is 4, odd_b 0.\n\nso min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. But for the code to read from stdin, the code should read lines properly. However, sometimes when reading input, there may be leading/trailing spaces, but in Python, the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n\nYes. That's the code. It's efficient, since it's O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All chests even, all keys even: result 0.\n\n- All chests even, all keys odd: min(even_a, odd_b) is min(even_a, m). But since even_a is n, and m is the number of keys. So for example, n=3, m=5: result 3.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are zero chests or zero keys. But according to constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: when there are more keys than needed. For example, even_a is 2, odd_b is 5. So min(2,5) is 2. Then the rest is handled by the other term.\n\nYes. So the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This means that an even-numbered chest requires an odd-numbered key and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. This is done by taking the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys, and adding it to the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n3. **Matching Chests and Keys**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of these two minimum values, which ensures optimal pairing.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
