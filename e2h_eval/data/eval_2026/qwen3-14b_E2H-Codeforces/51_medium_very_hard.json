Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenated string of guest + host has the same character counts as the pile string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Let's think. For example, take the first sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, host: DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see, the counts of each character in both should be same.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the guest and host names into a single string.\n2. Check if the pile string has exactly the same characters in the same counts as this combined string.\n\nBut how to check that? Well, one way is to sort both the combined string and the pile string, then compare if they are equal.\n\nYes. Because when you sort the characters, if they are the same, then the counts must be same. For example, \"AAB\" sorted is \"AAB\", and \"ABA\" sorted is also \"AAB\". So sorting both strings and comparing would work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTake the first two lines, concatenate them. Then take the third line. Sort both concatenated string and the pile string. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 10 and pile is 11 letters. Then obviously, it's impossible. So checking the lengths first would be a quick way to return NO.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Check if len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n- Else, check if sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS', host = 'DEDMOROZ', pile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined length: len('SANTACLAUS') + len('DEDMOROZ') = 10 + 8 = 18. The pile's length is len('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS') let's see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: Let's count letters. Let me see, but maybe the code would handle it. But the sorted approach would work.\n\nSo the code would check the lengths first. Then sort both.\n\nAnother example: the second input is guest 'PAPAINOEL', host 'JOULUPUKKI', pile 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nCombined length: len('PAPAINOEL') is 9, len('JOULUPUKKI') is 10. Total 19. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let's count letters. Let me see, but perhaps the code will check. But the note says that there's a missing P and an extra L. So when sorted, the combined guest+host would have a certain count, and the pile would have different counts.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nThird example: guest 'BABBONATALE', host 'FATHERCHRISTMAS', pile 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'. The note says there's an extra L. So the combined length would be len('BABBONATALE') + len('FATHERCHRISTMAS') = 10 + 14 = 24. The pile's length is len('BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER') — let's see: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count letters. Well, perhaps the code would check the length first. Let me see:\n\nOriginal combined length is 10 + 14 = 24. The pile's length: let's see, 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' — let me count letters. Let me think:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R — perhaps that's 25 letters? Because the original combined is 24. So the code would check the length first and return NO. Which matches the note.\n\nSo the code needs to do:\n\nRead three lines. Check if the sum of the first two's lengths equals the third's. If not, output NO. Else, check if sorted(guest + host) equals sorted(pile).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is three lines. So in Python, we can read them via input().strip() three times.\n\nWait, but in some cases, the input may have trailing newlines or other whitespace? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So we can read each line as input().strip(), but perhaps even just input() would suffice, but better to use strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace (though the problem says that they are not present).\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input consists of three lines, each not empty, and contains only uppercase letters. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nWait, but the actual input is three lines. So for each test case, the code reads three lines. So for example, in the first example, the three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo in code, we can read them as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, check len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print NO. Else, check sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All three lines are empty? But the problem says that all lines are not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case 2: All letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then sorted(guest + host) is [\"A\", \"A\"], sorted(pile) is [\"A\", \"A\"], so YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ACBD\". Then sorted(guest+host) is ['A','B','C','D'], sorted(pile) is same. So YES.\n\nAnother case: pile has one more letter. Then the length check fails.\n\nAnother case: same letters but different counts. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AAA\". Then len is 2 vs 3, so NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\". Then sorted(guest+host) is ['A','B'], sorted(pile) same. So YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"BA\", pile is \"AABB\". Then combined is \"ABBA\", which sorted is AABB. Pile is AABB. So YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead three lines.\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, check if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile): print 'NO'\n\nElse:\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile): print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the sorted function returns a list. So comparing the lists should be okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined length: 10 + 8 = 18. Pile length is 18. Then sorted combined and sorted pile must be same. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined length: 9 + 10 = 19. Pile length is len('JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI')?\n\nLet me count:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI: Let's see, J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I — perhaps 19 letters? Let me count:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → Let me count each letter:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), but maybe it's easier to trust the code. However, the note says that in this case, the pile has a missing P and an extra L. So the combined guest + host has a certain count, and the pile has different counts. So the code would return NO.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined length is len(BABBONATALE) = 10, FATHERCHRISTMAS is 14 → 24. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let me think:\n\nOriginal combined is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS → BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let me count letters. But the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let me check the length. The pile's length is len(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") — let's see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → Let's count each character. Let me count the letters step by step.\n\nBut maybe the code would check that the length is 24? Let me see:\n\nOriginal combined length is 10 + 14 = 24. The pile's length is len(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") — let me count:\n\n\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → 10 letters (B A B C H R I S T M A S ? Wait, BABCHRISTMAS is B A B C H R I S T M A S → that's 12 letters? Let me count:\n\nB (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), H (5), R (6), I (7), S (8), T (9), M (10), A (11), S (12). Then BONATALLEFATHER:\n\nB O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → B (1), O (2), N (3), A (4), T (5), A (6), L (7), L (8), E (9), F (10), A (11), T (12), H (13), E (14), R (15). So total 12 + 15 = 27? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the pile's length is longer than the combined. So the code would first check the length and return NO.\n\nIn any case, the code would handle that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of three strings, but in reality, the code should read three lines from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nBut the sample input shows that there are three test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three elements, each being a triple of lines. But perhaps the actual input is three lines per test case. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. Wait, the problem's sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is three separate test cases. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem's sample input is presented in a way that each element in the list is a separate test case. For example, each test case has three lines. So the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSecond test case:\n\nLine 1: PAPAINOEL\n\nLine 2: JOULUPUKKI\n\nLine 3: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nThird test case:\n\nLine 1: BABBONATALE\n\nLine 2: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nLine 3: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines for each test case. However, the problem says that the input is three lines, but the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how does the code know how many test cases there are?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\nSo the input is three lines. So the code should read three lines and process them once. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nThis seems to suggest that there are three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So the actual input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that represents three separate test cases. But the actual problem expects that the code reads three lines (one test case) and outputs one line (YES or NO). However, the sample shows that there are three test cases. Therefore, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how does the code know how many test cases there are?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo, the input is three lines. So the code should read three lines, process them once, and output one line (YES or NO). But the sample input shows three test cases, which suggests that there are multiple test cases. How to reconcile this?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three strings, each representing a test case. For example, the first test case is three lines (the first string is the three lines concatenated with \\n). So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem statement's input description says that the input is three lines. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that represents three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. But that would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line in the input. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is formatted in a way that each test case is given as a single line, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is three lines. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd third test case's input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the actual input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process them in groups of three, and output for each group.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which would imply that there is only one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the code is a single test case. So the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case (three lines) and output one line.\n\nBut that would not explain the sample output. Because the sample output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how many test cases are there? How does the code know when to stop reading?\n\nThis is a problem. Because the original problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines, implying one test case. But the sample shows three test cases, which implies that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that represents three test cases, but the actual input is one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs. That's not possible unless there are three test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. But looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three elements, each of which is a string containing three lines. For example, the first element is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', which is three lines. So the actual input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process them in groups of three, and output for each group.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Because normally, when you read from stdin, you can read all lines at once. For example, if the input is three test cases, each with three lines, then there are 3 * 3 = 9 lines in total. But how to read them?\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. Which would be one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases. The sample output shows three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that represents three test cases, but the actual input for the code is one test case. But then why does the sample output have three entries?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is three lines, and the sample input is written as three test cases, each with three lines, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output is three answers. So this is not possible.\n\nThis is a critical issue. Because if the code is written to process one test case, but the sample input has three, then it would not pass.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nOutput:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nBut this is likely a formatting issue. Perhaps the actual input is three lines, and the sample input is presented as three separate test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the first sample input is:\n\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\nSo the first sample is one test case. Hence, the code should read three lines and output one line.\n\nBut then why does the sample input show three test cases? Perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read three lines from standard input, which is one test case.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, given that the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines, and the sample input shows three test cases, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines for each test case, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? In competitive programming problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given, or it's implied that the code should read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention anything about multiple test cases. It says that the input consists of three lines. So the code should read three lines and process them once.\n\nBut then the sample input shows three test cases. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line in the input. For example, the first test case's input is a single line containing the three strings separated by newlines. But that would be a single line, but the problem says that the input consists of three lines.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, the problem's sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases and the output has three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nAssuming that the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the input is a series of test cases, each with three lines. The code should read all lines until EOF, processing them in groups of three.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin as a list, then iterate through them in chunks of three.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n    guest = lines[i]\n\n    host = lines[i+1]\n\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n\n    # process and print\n\nBut this would work if the input is a multiple of three lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three lines and process one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. This is very confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output, it's possible that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample output has three answers. This is impossible unless the code processes three test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is not properly formatted. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each consisting of three lines. And the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, in competitive programming, sometimes the number of test cases is determined by the input. For example, if the input is read until EOF.\n\nBut in this case, the code would need to process multiple test cases. For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, then process them in groups of three.\n\nAssuming that this is the case, the code should process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So this suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is incorrect. For example, the sample input is three test cases, but the problem says that the input consists of three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process three test cases. So perhaps the original problem is that the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem statement's input description is incorrect.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nWell, assuming that the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines, the code would look like this:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n    guest = lines[i]\n\n    host = lines[i+1]\n\n    pile = lines[i+2]\n\n    # process and print\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Probably, the problem ensures that the input is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's input description, the input consists of three lines. So this would imply that there is only one test case. However, the sample shows three test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. But given that the sample shows three test cases and the corresponding outputs, perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to resolve this ambiguity?\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output again:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three strings, each representing a test case. Each string is three lines joined by '\\n'. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is three lines.\n\nSo the actual input for the code is three test cases, each with three lines. Thus, the code should read three lines per test case.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, in the code, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nThus, the code should be written to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input consists of three lines. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given that the sample shows three test cases, and the sample output has three answers, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. So I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nBut then, how to handle it in code?\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n        guest = lines[i]\n\n        host = lines[i+1]\n\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n\n        # process and print\n\nBut in the case of the sample input, the lines list would have 3*3=9 lines. For example, the first three lines are the first test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines, which would imply that the code should process one test case. So this is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake. Perhaps the sample input is three test cases, but the actual problem expects one test case.\n\nBut the sample output shows three answers. So the code must generate three answers. Hence, the code must process three test cases.\n\nBut how to know?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is a list of three test cases, each of which is a single line, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should refer back to the problem statement's original wording.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\nSo the input is three lines. Hence, the code should read three lines and process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. This suggests that the sample input is not properly formatted. Perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the code is one test case.\n\nBut then why does the sample output have three entries? It's possible that the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual input is three lines, and the sample input is a mistake.\n\nIn this case, the code should process one test case, and the sample input is a mistake.\n\nBut given that the sample output has three entries, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line in the input. For example, the first test case is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich is three lines. But the sample input is written as a list of three strings, each representing three lines. So perhaps the actual input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nWell, the code would read all lines from stdin, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the original problem is that the code should process one test case, and the sample input is formatted incorrectly. Given that, I'll proceed with writing the code for one test case.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. So this would not match.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual input is three lines, and the sample input is a list of three test cases. But the sample output is also a list of three answers. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is to read three lines, and the code should output one line. But the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. This suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the problem's sample input is written in a way that each test case is represented as a single line in the input. But that's not possible since each test case requires three lines.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look at the original problem's source. But since I cannot do that, I'll proceed based on the problem's initial description.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: three lines. Output: one line.\n\nSample input shows three test cases, but this is likely a formatting error. For example, the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each test case is three lines. So the actual input for the code is three lines, and the sample input is a list of three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nHowever, given that the user provided the sample input as a list of three elements, each representing three lines, and the sample output as a list of three elements, the code should process each of those three test cases.\n\nThus, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read all lines from stdin, then process them in groups of three.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n        guest = lines[i]\n\n        host = lines[i+1]\n\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n\n        # process\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            combined = guest + host\n\n            if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem likely ensures that the input is valid.\n\nBut given that the sample input has three test cases, each with three lines, this code would process them correctly.\n\nFor example, the first test case's lines are:\n\nguest: 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost: 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nWhich would be processed as per the code.\n\nThus, this code would pass the sample input.\n\nBut according to the problem's input description, the code should read three lines. But the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem's input description is wrong, and the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nGiven that, the code above would handle the sample correctly.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut since the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases, I'll proceed with writing the code that handles multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFor the first test case:\n\nguest + host is SANTACLAUS + DEDMOROZ = SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Length is 10 + 8 = 18. Pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS, which is 18 characters. Sorted(guest+host) and sorted(pile) should be equal, so output YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL (9 letters), host: JOULUPUKKI (10 letters), total 19. Pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI (let's count: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let me count letters. But the code checks the length first. Assuming the length is 19, then the sorted comparison would fail, output NO.\n\nThird test case: guest is BABBONATALE (10 letters), host is FATHERCHRISTMAS (14 letters), total 24. Pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's count the length: let's see, the string is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's count:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → let's count the letters:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → 12 letters (B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S)\n\nBONATALLEFATHER → B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R → 15 letters. Total 12+15=27 letters. So len(pile) is 27, while guest + host is 24. So the length check fails, output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code in Python, with the above logic.\n\nBut the problem says that the input consists of three lines. But the code reads all lines and processes them in groups of three. This is a discrepancy. But given the sample, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nRead all lines, process in groups of three.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n        guest = lines[i]\n\n        host = lines[i+1]\n\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n\n        if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines from standard input.\n2. **Group Processing**: Process each group of three lines as a separate test case. Each group consists of the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n3. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If not, immediately output \"NO\".\n4. **Character Count Check**: If the lengths match, sort both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile string. If the sorted strings are identical, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined_len = len(guest) + len(host)\n        pile_len = len(pile)\n        if combined_len != pile_len:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            combined = guest + host\n            if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into individual lines for processing.\n- **Grouping Lines**: Each group of three lines is processed as a test case. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Length Check**: Before comparing character counts, we check if the total number of characters in the guest and host names matches the number of characters in the pile. This quick check helps avoid unnecessary sorting when lengths differ.\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: Sorting both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile string ensures that we can directly compare their character counts. If they match after sorting, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the pile of letters can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and host, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
