Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's like a conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Also, the given flows are already fixed, so we can't change them. We just need to assign directions.\n\nLet me think. The problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the flow is valid and the graph is acyclic. Oh right, because the maximum flow is already determined, and we just need to assign directions correctly.\n\nFirst, the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the total inflow equals outflow. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. \n\nBut since each edge contributes to either inflow or outflow of a node, depending on direction. Let's think of this as a problem where for each node v (excluding 1 and n), the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be even? Wait, no. Because for each edge, the flow is counted once in either incoming or outgoing. For example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then for u, it's outgoing, and for v, it's incoming. So, for node v, the sum of incoming flows minus outgoing flows equals zero. But since the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows, that implies that the total sum of flows for the node is even? Well, no. Because for each edge, the flow is added once to either incoming or outgoing. So the total sum of incoming plus outgoing is equal to the sum of all flows of edges incident to v. But since incoming equals outgoing, their sum is twice the incoming. So that sum must be even. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists. So we don't need to check that.\n\nBut how do we find the directions?\n\nAnother thought: the flow is a valid maximum flow. So the total flow from source to sink is fixed. But since we are given the flows on each edge, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is valid.\n\nBut how to assign directions?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, maybe we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, assign directions according to that order. For example, if the nodes are ordered in a topological order, then all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where the flow conservation holds for internal nodes, and the source has all edges outgoing, and the sink has all edges incoming.\n\nWait, but the source (node 1) has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to node 1 must be directed away from it. Similarly, for the sink (node n), perhaps all edges connected to it must be directed towards it. Or maybe not. Because the sink can have outgoing edges, but in a valid flow, the net flow into the sink is equal to the total flow. However, since the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow, the sink's inflow is the maximum possible. But in our case, we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model it as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has equal inflow and outflow. And the source's outflow is the total flow, and the sink's inflow is the same.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node, except 1 and n, the inflow equals outflow. Also, the graph is acyclic.\n\nAn idea comes to mind: construct a DAG where the nodes are arranged in a topological order, and for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. Then, the graph is acyclic. But how to ensure the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order. Alternatively, think of the nodes as being part of a tree structure, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: since the directed graph must be acyclic, there's a topological order. So, let's consider that the nodes can be ordered in such a way that all edges go from earlier to later in the order. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges coming into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out (to later nodes). Wait, but how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each edge has a fixed capacity (the given ci), but we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid. However, the problem says that the given ci's are the flow values, not capacities. So, the flow is already fixed. We just need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into the node must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node. Let me denote for each node v, the net flow is zero (for internal nodes), positive for the source (since it's emitting flow), and negative for the sink (since it's absorbing flow).\n\nSo for node 1, the sum of outflow minus inflow equals the total flow. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it are outgoing. Similarly, for the sink, the sum of inflow minus outflow is the total flow. But how to compute the total flow? Well, the total flow is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (since the source has no incoming edges). But perhaps that's not necessary here.\n\nBut how to find directions. Let's think of it as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it minus the sum on edges directed out of it is equal to the required value (which is zero for internal nodes, -total_flow for the sink, and total_flow for the source).\n\nBut since the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, we can compute the total flow as the sum of flows leaving the source. However, perhaps we don't need to compute it directly.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of each edge as contributing to the net flow of its endpoints. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with flow c. If we direct it as u→v, then for u, the net flow is increased by c (outgoing), and for v, the net flow is decreased by c (incoming). Alternatively, if directed as v→u, then for u, net flow is decreased by c (incoming), and for v, increased by c (outgoing).\n\nThe net flow for each node (except source and sink) must be zero. For the source, it must be +F (total flow), and for the sink, -F.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows directed towards it equals the required value (which is F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise).\n\nBut how do we find such directions?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations, but with m variables (each direction choice) and n equations (one per node). However, solving this system directly is not feasible for large n and m.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph with certain properties. For example, if we can find a directed spanning tree rooted at the source, and assign directions accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order where the source comes first, then other nodes, then the sink. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. This would ensure acyclicity.\n\nNow, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on incoming edges (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges (to later nodes). How can we ensure that?\n\nThis seems challenging. But perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding a topological order and assigning directions accordingly, ensuring that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the nodes form a DAG, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Which implies that the total flow through the edges incident to v is even? No, because the total is sum_in + sum_out = sum_in + sum_in = 2*sum_in. So yes, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. Since the graph is connected, perhaps we can build a directed tree structure starting from the source, and assign directions accordingly.\n\nWait, but how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. For each node except source and sink, the net flow (outgoing - incoming) must be zero. For the source, net flow is +F, and for the sink, it's -F.\n\nWe can model this as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that the net flow for each node is correct. This seems similar to a problem where each edge can contribute +c or -c to the net flow of its endpoints.\n\nBut how to find such an assignment.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of potentials. Suppose we assign a potential value to each node. Then, for each edge between u and v, if the potential of u is less than that of v, we direct the edge from u to v. Otherwise, from v to u. But how does this relate to the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the direction of each edge is determined by some property that allows the flow conservation. For example, if we can assign to each node a value (like a potential) such that for each edge, the direction is from lower to higher potential. Then, the graph is acyclic (as long as potentials are unique), and we can compute the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to choose these potentials to satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nLet me think. For each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let me denote for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v as outflow[v], and the sum of flows on edges directed into v as inflow[v]. For internal nodes, outflow[v] = inflow[v]. For the source, outflow[1] - inflow[1] = F. Since the source has no incoming edges, inflow[1] = 0, so outflow[1] = F. Similarly for the sink, inflow[n] - outflow[n] = F.\n\nBut how to find such a direction assignment.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a system of equations. For each node v, the net outflow is:\n\nnet_outflow[v] = sum_{edges directed out of v} c_i - sum_{edges directed into v} c_i.\n\nFor the source, net_outflow[1] = F. For the sink, net_outflow[n] = -F. For others, net_outflow[v] = 0.\n\nBut how to model this. For each edge, choosing direction adds c to one node's net_outflow and subtracts c from another. For example, if edge (u, v) is directed as u→v, then net_outflow[u] increases by c, and net_outflow[v] decreases by c (since it's an outflow from u and an inflow to v).\n\nBut solving this system for all edges is challenging. However, since the graph is connected and the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to find such directions.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of building a directed graph where the net_outflow is correct for each node. Let's imagine that we can find for each node, a value (like a balance) that represents the required net outflow. For example, for the source, it's F; for the sink, -F; others zero.\n\nThen, for each edge, directing it from u to v would add c to u's balance and subtract c from v's balance. Wait, no. Because net_outflow is the difference between outflow and inflow. If the edge is directed from u to v, then u's outflow increases by c, and v's inflow increases by c. So the net_outflow for u increases by c (because outflow increases), and for v, net_outflow decreases by c (because inflow increases, which is equivalent to net_outflow decreasing by c).\n\nSo, the total balance for each node is the sum of all the contributions from the edges. Let me denote the balance for node v as B[v]. Initially, B[v] is set to the required value: B[1] = F, B[n] = -F, and B[v] = 0 for others.\n\nNow, for each edge between u and v, we can choose to direct it from u to v, which would subtract c from B[v] and add c to B[u]. Or direct it from v to u, which would subtract c from B[u] and add c to B[v].\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose we have an edge between u and v. If we direct it as u→v, then the net_outflow for u increases by c (because it's an outgoing edge), and for v, the net_outflow decreases by c (because it's an incoming edge). Therefore, the B[u] (which is the required net_outflow) is adjusted by +c, and B[v] is adjusted by -c. But initially, the B values are the required values. Wait, no. The B values are the target. So, the idea is to find a way to assign directions so that after processing all edges, the B values are exactly the required ones.\n\nBut how? Let me think of this as a problem where each edge can contribute to adjusting the B values. For example, for each edge (u, v), we can choose to adjust B[u] by +c and B[v] by -c (if we direct it as u→v), or adjust B[v] by +c and B[u] by -c (if we direct it as v→u).\n\nBut initially, the B values are the required values. Wait, no. Wait, the B values are the required net outflow. So, the initial B values are the desired ones. But during processing, we need to adjust the B values by choosing directions. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me rephrase. The goal is that, after assigning directions, for each node v, the net_outflow (outflow - inflow) is equal to B[v], which is:\n\nB[v] = F if v is source,\n\nB[v] = -F if v is sink,\n\nB[v] = 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, the sum of all B[v] over all nodes must be zero. Because the total net outflow for all nodes is zero. Indeed, F + (-F) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for each edge, when we assign a direction, we are effectively adding +c to one node's net_outflow and subtracting c from another. So, the sum of B[v] remains zero. Which is good.\n\nBut how to find the directions such that the final B[v] is correct. The problem is that the initial B values are already correct, but how to reach them via the edge directions.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the B[v] values are the desired final values. So, the process of assigning directions must result in the B[v] values being achieved.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as a system of equations. Each edge contributes to the B values. For example, for each edge between u and v, we can choose to add +c to B[u] and -c to B[v], or vice versa. The initial B values are zero. Then, after processing all edges, the B values must match the required ones. But this seems like a problem of finding a way to adjust the B values to reach the required targets.\n\nWait, perhaps this is not the right way to look at it. Let me try again.\n\nInitially, all B[v] are zero. Then, for each edge, we have to decide which direction to take. Each decision affects the B values. The end result must be that B[v] is equal to the required value (F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise). But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find a way to distribute the adjustments across the edges. However, since the required B values sum to zero, this is possible.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems like a problem that can be solved using a spanning tree approach. For example, construct a directed tree from the source, and assign directions based on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges so that the B[v] values are correct. Let's imagine that we can start from the source and propagate the required flows.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the flow decomposition. Since the flow is a maximum flow, we can imagine that the flow is decomposed into paths from source to sink. For each such path, the edges are directed along the path. However, since the given flows are already fixed, perhaps we can find a way to assign directions based on the flow's path decomposition.\n\nBut how to find those paths. However, since the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, but we don't have the actual flow network (since the edges are undirected and the flows are given), this might not be helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. Once we have a topological order, we can assign directions of edges from earlier to later in the order. Now, the question is how to choose this order so that the flow conservation holds for internal nodes.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Choose a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and all other nodes are ordered in between.\n\n- For each node in the order, except the source and sink, ensure that the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from previous nodes) equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it (to later nodes).\n\nBut how to compute this. For example, for a node v in the order, after all previous nodes have been processed, how to decide the direction of edges between v and later nodes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except the source and sink) has the same amount of flow going into it as going out. To achieve this, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node's in-degree (weighted by flow) equals the out-degree (weighted by flow).\n\nBut again, how to assign the directions.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's think of the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation holds. We can model this as a problem of finding a directed graph with the given flows and satisfying the conservation laws.\n\nBut how to do that. For each node, except source and sink, the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum on outgoing edges. So for each such node, the sum of all flows of edges incident to it must be even, which it is because the problem says a solution exists.\n\nBut how to find directions.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Compute the total flow F. This is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it are outgoing. So F is the sum of ci for edges connected to the source.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. However, the source may have edges that are not part of the maximum flow. Wait, no. The maximum flow is determined by the flow values given. Since the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, the total flow from source to sink must be correct. However, how do we know what F is?\n\nActually, the total flow F can be calculated as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. So, for each edge connected to the source, we direct it away from the source. Then, the sum of these flows is F. However, the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges leaving the source must be equal to the sum of flows entering the sink. But since the sink can have outgoing edges (but they would be part of the flow?), I think this is getting complicated.\n\nBut perhaps we can calculate F as the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. However, this depends on the direction of those edges. But since the source cannot have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Therefore, for any edge between the source and another node, the direction is fixed: from source to that node. Thus, F is the sum of ci for all edges connected to the source.\n\nOnce we have F, we can proceed.\n\nBut how to assign directions to other edges.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a directed graph where we have to assign directions to edges not connected to the source or sink. For each node other than source and sink, the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum on outgoing edges.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, we can build a directed tree structure, and assign directions based on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has zero net outflow. This is similar to an Eulerian trail, but for a graph with weighted edges. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. For each node in the order, we can determine the direction of edges connected to it based on the current state of the flow conservation.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a topological order where the source is first, followed by other nodes, and the sink is last. For each node in the order (after the source), we can process its edges and assign directions to ensure that the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nThe edges connected to source are (1-2) and (1-3). Since source can't have incoming edges, both must be directed away from 1. So for edge 1-2, direction is 1→2 (so di is 0 for that edge?), and edge 1-3 is directed 1→3 (di is 0 for that edge? Wait, the input edges are given as (ai, bi, ci). The output is 0 if direction is ai→bi, else 1. So for the edge between 1 and 2, which is input as (1,2,10), if we direct it as 1→2, then output is 0. For the edge between 3 and 1, which is input as (3,1,5), if we direct it as 1→3 (i.e., the original is 3-1, but direction is 1→3, so the output is 1 (since it's the reverse of the original ai, bi).\n\nSo for the first sample, the edges are:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2 (ci=10)\n\nEdge 2: 1-2 (ci=10)\n\nEdge 3: 3-1 (ci=5)\n\nThe output is 1, 0, 1. So:\n\nEdge 1 is directed from 2→3 (original is 3-2, so direction is reversed → output 1).\n\nEdge 2 is directed from 1→2 (output 0).\n\nEdge 3 is directed from 1→3 (original is 3-1, so output 1).\n\nNow, the flow conservation for node 2 (which is not source or sink):\n\nIncoming flows: from edge 2 (10) and edge 1 (10) directed into 2? No. Edge 1 is directed from 2→3, so for node 2, it's outgoing. Edge 2 is directed from 1→2, so incoming. So inflow is 10. Outflow is 10 (edge 1). So it's balanced.\n\nThe source (node 1) has outflow of 10 (edge 2) and 5 (edge 3) → total 15. The sink (node 3) has inflow of 10 (from edge 1) and 5 (from edge 3) → total 15. So it's correct.\n\nSo the directed graph is 1→2, 2→3, 1→3. Which is acyclic.\n\nSo how was this direction chosen? It seems that the edge between 2 and 3 was directed away from node 2. But why?\n\nPerhaps the approach is to build a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a certain \"balance\" of flow, and the directions are chosen to maintain that balance.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Assign directions to all edges connected to the source. These must be directed away from the source.\n\n2. For other nodes, process them in a certain order and adjust the directions of their edges to maintain flow conservation.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAnother idea: model this as a directed graph and perform a DFS or BFS traversal, keeping track of the flow balance for each node. For example:\n\n- Start with the source. All edges from the source are directed away. For each neighbor of the source, we add their flow to their inflow.\n\n- Then, for each node that has been visited, process its edges. For each edge to an unvisited node, direct it in a way that maintains the flow conservation for the current node.\n\nWait, this sounds like a possible approach. Let me elaborate:\n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source. For each node, we keep track of the current \"excess\" of flow. The excess is the difference between the inflow and outflow so far. For the source, the excess is -F (since all its edges are outgoing, contributing to outflow). Wait, no. For the source, all edges are outgoing. So for the source, the outflow is F (sum of flows on edges leaving it). The inflow is zero. So the net outflow is F. For other nodes, we want their net outflow to be zero. But during traversal, we need to manage this.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nEach node has a current balance. Initially, the source's balance is -F (since it has to emit F units of flow). The sink's balance is +F (since it must absorb F units). All other nodes have balance zero. Wait, no. The net outflow for the source is F, which is outflow - inflow = F. So for the source, the balance is F. For the sink, the balance is -F (inflow - outflow = F → outflow - inflow = -F).\n\nBut how to track the balance for each node. Let me think of the balance as the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from the node. For example, for the source, the balance is F (it needs to send out F units). For other nodes, the balance is zero. For the sink, the balance is -F (it needs to receive F units).\n\nWhen we process a node, we look at its adjacent edges. For each edge that hasn't been processed yet, we direct it in a way that helps reduce the balance of the current node.\n\nFor example, suppose we're processing node u, which currently has a balance of b. We look at an adjacent node v that hasn't been processed yet. If we direct the edge from u to v, then u's balance decreases by c (since this contributes to outflow), and v's balance increases by c (since this contributes to inflow). Alternatively, if we direct it from v to u, then u's balance increases by c (inflow) and v's balance decreases by c (outflow).\n\nBut how to choose which direction to take. The idea is to direct the edge in a way that helps reduce the balance of the current node to zero.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we are processing node u, which has a current balance of b. We look at an edge between u and v. We want to direct the edge such that after this direction, the balance of u becomes closer to zero.\n\nFor example, if u's balance is positive (needs to send out more flow), then directing the edge from u to v would decrease u's balance by c (since it's sending out c units). This is good. If the balance is negative, then directing the edge from v to u would increase u's balance by c (since it's receiving c units), which helps bring it closer to zero.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to process and in what order.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. Here's how it could work:\n\n- Initialize the balance for each node. Source's balance is F (since it needs to send out F units), sink's balance is -F, others are zero.\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS traversal, starting from the source.\n\n- For each node u dequeued from the queue, iterate through all its adjacent edges. For each edge that hasn't been directed yet, check the other endpoint v. If v hasn't been processed yet, direct the edge from u to v (if that helps reduce u's balance) and update the balances of u and v accordingly. Then, enqueue v for processing.\n\nBut how to ensure that this process works. Let's see:\n\nFor example, take the first sample input. The source is 1, which has balance F = 10 (edge to 2) + 5 (edge to 3) = 15. Wait, no. The balance for the source is F, which is the total flow. So F is 15. Then, the source's balance is 15 (needs to send out 15 units).\n\nWhen we process the source, we look at its adjacent edges. For example, edge between 1 and 2 (ci=10). We direct it from 1 to 2. This reduces the source's balance by 10 (now 5). The balance of node 2 increases by 10 (now 10). Then, we enqueue node 2.\n\nNext, we process node 2. Its balance is 10. We look at its adjacent edges. One is the edge to 1, which is already directed. The other is the edge to 3 (ci=10). We direct it from 2 to 3. This reduces node 2's balance by 10 (now 0), and increases node 3's balance by 10 (now 10). Enqueue node 3.\n\nThen, process node 3. Its balance is 10. The only edge left is the one between 3 and 1 (ci=5). But it's already directed as 1→3 (from earlier processing?), but wait, no. Wait, the source's edges are processed first. The edge between 1 and 3 was directed as 1→3, which reduces the source's balance by 5 (from 15 to 10). Then, when processing node 3, its balance is 10 (from the edge directed from 2→3). But the edge between 1 and 3 is already directed. So, the balance for node 3 is 10 (from the edge 2→3) plus whatever from other edges. But node 3 is the sink, whose balance should be -F = -15. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, the initial balances are:\n\nsource (1): balance = F = 15\n\nsink (3): balance = -F = -15\n\nothers: zero.\n\nWhen we process the source, we direct the edge 1-2 (10) from 1 to 2. This reduces source's balance by 10 (now 5), and increases node 2's balance by 10 (now 10).\n\nThen, we direct the edge 1-3 (5) from 1 to 3. This reduces source's balance by 5 (now 0), and increases node 3's balance by 5 (now 5).\n\nThen, node 2 is processed. Its balance is 10. We look at the edge between 2 and 3. Directing it from 2 to 3 reduces node 2's balance by 10 (now 0), and increases node 3's balance by 10 (now 5+10=15). Node 3 is now enqueued.\n\nProcessing node 3 (balance 15). But the sink's balance should be -15. So something is wrong here.\n\nAh, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nThe balance for the sink is supposed to be -F = -15. But after processing the edges, the balance for node 3 is 15. That's the opposite of what it should be. So clearly, there's a mistake in how the balance is tracked.\n\nLet me re-examine the balance definition. The balance for a node is the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from it. For the source, it's F (needs to send out F units). For the sink, it's -F (needs to receive F units, which is equivalent to sending out -F units). For other nodes, it's zero.\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v, this means that u sends out c units, and v receives c units. So:\n\n- u's balance decreases by c (since it sends out more).\n- v's balance increases by c (since it receives more).\n\nBut for the sink, we want its balance to eventually be -F. So during processing, when we direct an edge into the sink (from some other node), this increases the sink's balance. But the sink's balance should be -F. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the balance definition inverted. Let's re-express:\n\nThe net outflow for a node is (outflow - inflow) = balance.\n\nFor the source, this should be F. For the sink, it should be -F. For others, zero.\n\nSo, when we direct an edge from u to v, the outflow of u increases by c, inflow of v increases by c. So:\n\nbalance[u] = (outflow - inflow) for u → after the edge is directed from u to v, balance[u] decreases by c (because outflow increases by c, so net outflow increases by c → no, wait, no. Original balance is outflow - inflow. Adding c to outflow increases the balance by c. So if we direct an edge from u to v, then balance[u] increases by c (since outflow increases by c), and balance[v] decreases by c (since inflow increases by c, which reduces the net outflow by c).\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with what I said earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me define balance[v] = outflow[v] - inflow[v]. \n\nIf I direct an edge from u to v:\n\n- outflow[u] increases by c → balance[u] += c.\n\n- inflow[v] increases by c → balance[v] -= c.\n\nSo, for example, directing an edge from u to v adds c to u's balance and subtracts c from v's balance.\n\nSo, the initial balance for the source is F (since outflow - inflow is F). The initial balance for the sink is -F (since outflow - inflow is -F). For others, zero.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\nsource balance is 15, sink balance is -15.\n\nWhen we direct the edge from 1 to 2 (c=10):\n\n- source's balance increases by 10? No, wait, no. Wait, when you direct an edge from u to v, balance[u] increases by c (outflow increases), and balance[v] decreases by c (inflow increases, so balance[v] = outflow - inflow decreases by c).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The balance is outflow - inflow. \n\nIf you add c to outflow of u, then balance[u] increases by c. \n\nIf you add c to inflow of v, then balance[v] decreases by c (since inflow increases by c).\n\nSo, for the first step, directing edge from 1 to 2:\n\nbalance[1] += 10 → from 15 to 25?\n\nBut that's not correct. Because initially, the source's balance is F = 15, which is the required net outflow. But directing the edge from source to 2",
