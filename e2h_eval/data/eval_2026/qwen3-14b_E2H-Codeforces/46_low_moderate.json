The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest subsegment in a sequence such that by changing at most one element, the subsegment becomes strictly increasing. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. A subsegment is a contiguous part of the array. For any such subsegment, we can change one element (to any value) to make it strictly increasing. Our goal is to find the maximum length of such a subsegment.\n\nHmm. How do I check for that? Well, for a given subsegment, if there's at most one place where a[i] >= a[i+1], then maybe we can fix it by changing one element. But since we can change any element, maybe there's a way to find the longest possible subsegment where there's at most one \"break\" in the strictly increasing order.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1e5)? A brute force approach checking all possible subsegments would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a dynamic programming approach or track some kind of increasing sequences with possible one error.\n\nLet me think about similar problems. Like the problem where you find the longest strictly increasing subarray. That's straightforward with a loop, keeping track of current length.\n\nBut here, we can have one error. So maybe we can track two things: the length of the longest increasing subarray ending at position i with 0 errors and with 1 error.\n\nWait, that might work. Let's think:\n\nFor each position i, we can track:\n\n- dp0[i]: the length of the longest increasing subarray ending at i with no errors (so a[i] > a[i-1]).\n- dp1[i]: the length of the longest increasing subarray ending at i with exactly one error (could be either an error in previous positions or this position).\n\nBut how to compute these?\n\nFor dp0[i], if a[i] > a[i-1], then dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + 1. Otherwise, it's 1 (since the subarray starting at i, but no errors yet). Wait, no. Because if the previous was not increasing, then the current can't be part of a longer sequence without error. So for example, if a[i] <= a[i-1], then dp0[i] = 1, because the subarray ending here with zero errors must start at i.\n\nFor dp1[i], there are two possibilities:\n\nEither there was a previous error (so we can have one error already), and the current element is okay. Or, there was no error before, but the current element breaks the strictly increasing order. Then, we can use the previous dp0[i-1] and add 1, but with one error.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely:\n\ndp1[i] can be computed based on whether the current a[i] is greater than a[i-1] or not.\n\nCase 1: If a[i] > a[i-1], then the current subarray can be extended. The existing error count (if any) remains. So, dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1. But wait, what if dp1[i-1] was already using the one error? Then adding this element doesn't add any error. So yes.\n\nCase 2: If a[i] <= a[i-1], then we can consider two options:\n\n- We can take the dp0[i-1] (which has no errors) and add 1 to it, but now we have one error (because this step is invalid). So the new length is dp0[i-1] + 1.\n\n- Or, we can take the dp1[i-1] (which already has one error) and add 1, but since there's already an error, this would not add any new error. So dp1[i] = max( dp1[i-1] + 1, dp0[i-1] + 1 )\n\nWait, but in this case, when a[i] <= a[i-1], we can choose to fix this by changing a[i] or a[i-1]. But how does that translate into the DP states?\n\nAlternatively, the dp1[i] represents the maximum length of a subarray ending at i with at most one error. So, for each i, we can compute dp1[i] as follows:\n\nIf the current a[i] is greater than a[i-1], then the current subarray can be extended. So dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1.\n\nBut if a[i] is not greater than a[i-1], then we can consider two possibilities:\n\n1. We have already used the error before. So, we can take dp1[i-1] and add 1 (since we can't fix this step, but we already have",
