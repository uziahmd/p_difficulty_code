Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, a standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let's think about grouping the items by their weight. For each weight group, sort them in descending order of cost. Because for each weight, we want to take as many as possible of the highest value items.\n\nBut how do I combine them optimally? For example, when considering items of weight 1, 2, and 3, how do I decide which ones to take?\n\nLet me think. Let's process each weight group:\n\nFor weight 1: Take as many as possible. But maybe there's a case where taking some of weight 2 could be better than taking some weight 1s. But since the weight is small, perhaps we can model it with some dynamic programming approach, but optimized.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for each weight group, the number of items can be large. For example, if there are 1e5 items of weight 1, then we can't process them all in O(m) time. However, since the weight is 1, the maximum number of items we can take is min(m, count of items). So for each weight group, we can sort them in descending order and take the top k items where k is up to m divided by their weight.\n\nBut how to combine the different weight groups?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach where for each weight group, we process them and update the DP array. However, given that m is up to 3e5, and n is 1e5, even O(m) per weight group might be acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each weight group, say for weight 1, the best way is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. So for weight 1, we can take up to m items (if there are that many). Similarly for weight 2, up to m//2 items, etc.\n\nBut combining them optimally is tricky. For example, if I have some leftover capacity after taking some items of weight 1 and 2, maybe replacing some items of weight 1 with a higher value item of weight 2 would be better.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to process each weight group, and for each possible weight, compute the maximum value. But how?\n\nAnother idea: For each weight group, precompute the prefix sums of the sorted values. Then, for each possible number of items taken from that group, we can know the total value. Then, the problem becomes choosing how many items to take from each weight group such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of values is maximized.\n\nBut how to combine these choices efficiently. Let's think:\n\nLet's suppose we have for weight 1, sorted list, prefix sum array s1. Similarly for weight 2, s2, and weight 3, s3.\n\nThe total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. We need to maximize s1[x] + s2[y] + s3[z].\n\nBut how to find x, y, z that satisfy this condition and maximize the sum.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, trying all combinations of x, y, z would be impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think of possible approaches:\n\nFirst, for each weight group, we can precompute the maximum possible value for taking k items of that weight. For example, for weight 1, we can take up to k1 = min(number of items, m) items. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, for weight 1 and 2, perhaps we can iterate over the number of items of weight 2, and compute the maximum possible for weight 1 and 3. Or something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can split into cases based on the number of weight 3 items taken.\n\nBut even that seems complex. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the optimal selection will consist of some number of items of each weight. For each weight, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, the problem is that sometimes, taking a combination of items from different weights may be better than taking the maximum possible of one weight.\n\nBut given that the weight is small, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach, but optimized for the weight constraints.\n\nWait, the standard knapsack problem is O(nm), but here n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which would be 3e10 operations. That's way too slow. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the weight is limited to 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find a way to compute the optimal selection using a modified approach.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group. So for each group, we can quickly find the total value if we take k items from that group.\n\n2. Now, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (say, z), we can compute the remaining capacity, and then solve the problem for the remaining capacity with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), the remaining capacity is m - 3*z. Then, we need to compute the maximum value from the weight 1 and 2 items with capacity m' = m - 3*z.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly for all possible z?\n\nSimilarly, for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities, the maximum value. However, for that, we can model it as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2, but since the capacity can be up to 3e5, and for each possible capacity, we need to compute the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum number of items for each weight is up to m. So perhaps we can model this with a DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum value for capacity i.\n\nBut how to compute this DP efficiently. Let's think:\n\nFor the weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, and for weight 2 items, sorted in descending order.\n\nWe can process the weight 1 items first. For each possible capacity, we can take as many as possible of the weight 1 items. Then, for the weight 2 items, we can try to take as many as possible.\n\nBut again, how to combine these.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can think of the problem as follows: for each possible capacity, what is the maximum value we can get by taking some weight 1 and 2 items. Let's denote this as dp[i].\n\nTo compute dp[i], we can consider for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut even that seems complicated.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity, the maximum value. Let's think of this as a knapsack problem where items can be of weight 1 or 2. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the following approach for weight 1 and 2:\n\nSuppose we have a list of sorted weight 1 items (sorted descendingly by cost) and a list of sorted weight 2 items (also sorted descendingly).\n\nFor each possible capacity, the optimal selection would be to take as many as possible of the highest value items. But how?\n\nLet me think about the following. For a given capacity m', the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is up to k2 = min( len(w2), m'//2 ). For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (from 0 to k2), we can take the remaining capacity as m' - 2*k2, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to min( len(w1), m' - 2*k2 )).\n\nSo for each capacity m', the maximum value is the maximum over all possible k2 (number of weight 2 items taken) of (sum of first k2 weight 2 items) + (sum of first (m' - 2*k2) weight 1 items).\n\nBut for each m', this would take O(k2) time, which could be up to O(m') steps. However, since m' can be up to 3e5, this would be O(m^2) time overall, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums for both weight 1 and 2, and then for each possible capacity, find the optimal k2 quickly.\n\nWait, but for a given capacity m', the possible k2 ranges from 0 to min( len(w2), floor(m'/2) ). For each k2, the number of weight 1 items we can take is m' - 2*k2. But since we can't take more than the available weight 1 items, the actual number is min( (m' - 2*k2), len(w1) ), but also, m' - 2*k2 must be >= 0.\n\nSo for each m', the maximum value is the maximum over all possible k2 in [0, ... , k2_max], of (prefix_w2[k2] + prefix_w1[ min( (m' - 2*k2), len_w1 ) ] )\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently for all possible m'?\n\nAlternatively, for the combined weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can find for each possible number of weight 2 items taken (k2), the maximum possible number of weight 1 items that can be taken for any capacity.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible capacity m', the optimal choice between weight 1 and 2 items can be found by considering that for each possible k2 (number of weight 2 items taken), the corresponding number of weight 1 items is (m' - 2*k2). However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (m' - 2*k2) items gives the maximum possible value for that number.\n\nBut how to find the best k2 for each m'?\n\nThis seems like for each m', we need to find the best k2 where 0 ≤ k2 ≤ m'//2, and also k2 ≤ len_w2, and (m' - 2*k2) ≤ len_w1.\n\nBut for each m', this would take O(1) time if we can find the optimal k2 quickly.\n\nBut how? Maybe we can precompute for all possible k2, and for each possible m', find the best k2.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for each possible m', the optimal k2 is around m'//2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible k2 (number of weight 2 items taken), and for each possible k2, compute the maximum possible number of weight 1 items that can be taken for any capacity.\n\nBut again, this seems unclear.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Suppose we have the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Let's say, prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i weight 1 items, prefix2[j] is the sum of the first j weight 2 items.\n\nFor a given capacity m', the maximum value is max_{j} (prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( m' - 2*j, len1 ) ]) ), where j ranges from 0 to min( len2, m'//2 )\n\nBut for each m', this would require checking all possible j's. However, if we can find for each m' the optimal j quickly, perhaps using binary search or other methods.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for a fixed m', the value of (m' - 2*j) can vary as j increases. For each j, the term is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ x ], where x = m' - 2*j, but x can't exceed len1.\n\nLet me imagine varying j. As j increases, the 2*j term increases, so x decreases. So for each m', the optimal j is somewhere in the range, and perhaps there's a way to find the best j.\n\nBut how to find it quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m', the best j is the one that maximizes (prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( m' - 2*j, len1 ) ]). Let's assume that m' - 2*j is non-negative, and that len1 is large enough.\n\nBut even then, finding the optimal j for each m' would take O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum capacity that can be used is 2*j + k, where k is the number of weight 1 items taken. So for each j, the maximum contribution is prefix2[j] + prefix1[k], where k can be up to min( (m - 2*j), len1 ). So for a given j, the maximum possible contribution is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( (m - 2*j), len1 ) ].\n\nBut for the overall problem, when considering the weight 3 items, we can loop through all possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), and for each z, compute the remaining capacity m' = m - 3*z, then compute the maximum value from the weight 1 and 2 items for capacity m', and then add prefix3[z].\n\nBut how to compute the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items for capacity m'.\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible m' (up to m) the maximum value for weight 1 and 2, then this would be manageable.\n\nBut how to precompute this?\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum possible capacity is m. For each possible capacity m' (from 0 to m), compute the maximum value.\n\nHow to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2.\n\n- For each possible capacity m', the optimal number of weight 2 items to take is between 0 and min( len2, m' // 2 ). For each of these j, we can calculate the corresponding value. However, trying all j for each m' would be O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each m' the optimal j in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nLet me think about the function f(j) = prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( m' - 2*j, len1 ) ].\n\nWe can think of j as varying from 0 to j_max = min( len2, m'//2 )\n\nThe function f(j) is not necessarily monotonic. For example, increasing j may decrease the number of weight 1 items taken, but the gain from the weight 2 items may be higher or lower.\n\nBut given that the prefix sums are non-decreasing, perhaps there is a way to find the optimal j.\n\nLet me think: For each j, the value of 2*j increases by 2 each time, and the number of weight 1 items decreases by 2 (but only if m' - 2*j is sufficient). However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, adding more weight 1 items increases the value.\n\nBut how does this affect the total?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m', the optimal j is either:\n\n- The maximum j where 2*j <= m' and j <= len2. In this case, take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nOR\n\n- Some j less than that maximum, where the sum of the weight 2 items and the weight 1 items is better.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, taking more of them may be better than taking fewer, but only up to a certain point. For example, if a weight 2 item has a higher value than two weight 1 items, then taking it is better. Otherwise, taking two weight 1 items is better.\n\nThis seems similar to the classic problem of choosing between items of different weights. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find an optimal way.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can greedily take the best possible items. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible capacity the optimal selection.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can model the problem as follows: the optimal selection is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, since each weight 2 item is worth more than two weight 1 items (or not), we need to find the best trade-off.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, the best approach is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but replacing some with weight 1 items if they are better. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a combined list of items where each weight 2 item is considered as two weight 1 items. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the weight 2 items as pairs of weight 1 items. If the value of a weight 2 item is greater than the sum of two weight 1 items, then it's better to take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to model this for arbitrary capacity.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items taken. For example, for each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken given the remaining capacity. Then, the maximum value for each capacity m' would be the maximum over all possible j.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum capacity that can be handled is 2*j + k, where k is the number of weight 1 items taken. So for a given j, we can compute the maximum value for all capacities that are at least 2*j, and then up to 2*j + len1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for all possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum value for that j plus the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken. Then, for each capacity m', the maximum value is the maximum over all j where 2*j <= m', and then the corresponding weight 1 items taken is min( m' - 2*j, len1 ), and the sum is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min(...) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all m' efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the following. For all possible j, we can generate events where for a certain capacity, the value is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ ... ].\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of weight 2 items is up to len2 (which can be up to 1e5), and for each j, the maximum capacity that can be handled is up to 2*j + len1. So for each j, we can compute the value for all capacities from 2*j to 2*j + len1. But this would be O(len2 * len1), which is not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for any capacity m', the optimal j is either floor(m' / 2) or floor(m' / 2) - 1, etc. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m', the optimal j is such that 2*j is as close as possible to m' minus the number of weight 1 items taken. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m', the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is j_max = min( len2, m' // 2 ). For this j_max, the remaining capacity is m' - 2*j_max. We can take as many weight 1 items as possible. Also, we can check j_max - 1, and compare the values. Because sometimes taking one less weight 2 item and taking more weight 1 items could yield a better value.\n\nBut how many possibilities do we need to check? For example, for j_max, j_max-1, j_max+1? Or maybe just j_max and j_max-1?\n\nLet me think: for a given m', the optimal j could be in the vicinity of j_max, but since the items are sorted, perhaps checking j in the range from max(0, j_max - k) to j_max, where k is small, like 100, would cover all possibilities. However, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is a viable approach.\n\nFor example, for each m', we can check all possible j in the range [max(0, j_max - 100), j_max], and choose the best among them. This would be O(100) per m', which is acceptable if m' is up to 3e5.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, then taking more of them (up to j_max) would give higher values. However, if the last few weight 2 items are not worth taking compared to some weight 1 items, then taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items may be better.\n\nBut for example, if the last weight 2 item has a value less than the sum of two weight 1 items, then it's better to not take it. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first few items have the highest value.\n\nSo, for each m', the optimal j is either j_max, j_max-1, etc., up to some small number. So checking a few possibilities around j_max could find the optimal value.\n\nBut how to determine how many to check? Well, considering that the worst case is when the optimal j is somewhere in the middle, this approach may not work. But given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way.\n\nAlternatively, for each m', the optimal j can be found by checking j_max and j_max-1. Let me think of an example.\n\nExample:\n\nWeight 1 items: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\nWeight 2 items: [9,8,7]\n\nCapacity m' = 5.\n\nj_max = 5//2 = 2. So j can be 0,1,2.\n\nFor j=2: 2*2 =4. Remaining capacity is 1. Take 1 weight 1 item (value 5). Total: 9+8 +5 = 22.\n\nFor j=1: 2*1=2. Remaining capacity 3. Take 3 weight 1 items (5+4+3=12). Total: 8 +12=20. Less than 22.\n\nFor j=0: take 5 weight 1 items (sum 5+4+3+2+1=15). Total 15. Less than 22.\n\nSo the best is j=2.\n\nAnother example: suppose weight 2 items have values [6, 6], and weight 1 items have [5,5,5,5].\n\nCapacity m'=4.\n\nj_max is 2. For j=2: 2*2=4, no weight 1 items. Total 6+6=12.\n\nFor j=1: 2*1=2. Remaining capacity is 2. Take 2 weight 1 items (sum 10). Total 6+10=16, which is better.\n\nSo here, j=1 is better than j_max=2. So checking j_max and j_max-1 is needed.\n\nSo for each m', we need to check j_max and j_max-1, maybe even j_max-2, etc. But how many to check?\n\nWell, in this case, the optimal j is j_max-1. So if we check j_max and j_max-1, we can find it.\n\nSo perhaps for each m', we can check all j in the range from max(0, j_max - 100) to j_max, but since j_max is up to m'//2, which can be up to 1.5e5, this would be O(1e5 * 100) operations, which is 1e7, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to choose the number of checks? Well, if we check up to 100 values, it's manageable. However, this is a heuristic and may not work in all cases. But given the problem's time constraints, this might be the only way.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, for each m', the optimal j can be found by checking j in the range of j_max down to j_max - k, where k is the minimum between j_max and some small number like 100. This would cover cases where the optimal j is near j_max.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\n- Precompute prefix sums for weight 1 and 2.\n\nThen, for any capacity m', compute j_max = min( len2, m' // 2 )\n\nThen, iterate j from max(0, j_max - 100) to j_max, and for each j, compute the value as prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( m' - 2*j, len1 ) ]\n\nTake the maximum among these.\n\nThis would give us an approximate solution, but with the hope that the optimal j is within this range.\n\nBut what if the optimal j is outside this range? For example, if the optimal j is j_max - 200?\n\nIn that case, the code would miss it and give a suboptimal solution. However, given that the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal j is not too far from j_max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal j is either j_max or j_max - 1, but that depends on the specific items.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nAnother Idea: Since the weight 1 items are sorted, for any j, the value of taking j weight 2 items and then as many weight 1 items as possible is:\n\nvalue = prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( (m' - 2*j), len1 ) ]\n\nBut since prefix1 is non-decreasing, and prefix2 is non-decreasing, for j increasing, the term prefix2[j] increases, but (m' - 2*j) decreases, leading to prefix1[ ... ] decreasing.\n\nSo the function is a balance between these two terms. It's possible that the function has a single peak, which can be found with ternary search. But since the function may not be strictly unimodal, ternary search may not work.\n\nBut if we assume that the function is unimodal, then ternary search can be used. Let's think about it.\n\nAssume that for j in 0 to j_max, the function value increases to a certain point and then decreases. Then, ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nBut is this the case?\n\nLet me think of an example where the function is unimodal.\n\nExample:\n\nprefix2[j] increases with j, and prefix1[...] decreases with j. The total may have a single maximum.\n\nBut it depends on the values of the items.\n\nAnother example: weight 2 items are [10, 10], weight 1 items are [9, 9, 9, 9]. For m' = 4.\n\nj_max = 2. For j=0: 0 + 4*9=36. For j=1: 10 + 2*9=28. For j=2: 20 + 0=20. So the function decreases as j increases. Hence, the maximum is at j=0.\n\nAnother example: weight 2 items are [6, 6], weight 1 items are [5,5,5,5]. m'=4. j_max=2. For j=0: 0 + 4*5=20. j=1:6 + 2*5=16. j=2: 12 + 0=12. Again, the function decreases as j increases.\n\nAnother example: weight 2 items are [5, 5], weight 1 items are [6,6]. m'=4. j_max=2. For j=0: 0 + 4*6=24. For j=1: 5 + 2*6=17. For j=2: 10 + 0=10. Still decreasing.\n\nAnother example where the function increases and then decreases. Suppose weight 2 items are [10, 3], weight 1 items are [9,9]. m'=4.\n\nj_max = 2 (since 4//2=2). For j=0: 0 +4*9=36 (but len1 is 2, so min(4, 2) = 2 → 9*2=18. So value is 18.\n\nj=1: 10 + (4-2*1)=2 → take 2 weight 1 items (9*2=18) → total 28.\n\nj=2: 10+3=13 + 0 → 13. So the function increases from j=0 to j=1, then decreases. So it's unimodal.\n\nAnother example: weight 2 items [5, 5], weight 1 items [6,6,6]. m'=5.\n\nj_max = 5//2 = 2. For j=0: 0 + 5*6=30 (but len1 is 3 → 3*6=18). So value is 18.\n\nj=1: 5 + (5-2) =3 → take 3 weight 1 items (18) → total 23.\n\nj=2: 5+5=10 + (5-4)=1 → take 1 weight 1 item (6) → total 16. So function increases then decreases.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum is at j=1.\n\nSo the function seems to be unimodal. Hence, ternary search could be used to find the optimal j.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each m', we can perform a ternary search on j in the range [0, j_max], to find the maximum value of the function.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nTernary search works on a unimodal function. However, we need to ensure that the function is indeed unimodal. But based on previous examples, it seems that the function is unimodal. Hence, we can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo for each m', we can perform a ternary search on j between 0 and j_max, and find the j that maximizes the value.\n\nThis would take O(log j_max) time per m', which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the function has multiple peaks? Well, if the function is not strictly unimodal, ternary search may not find the global maximum. However, given the nature of the problem, it's likely that the function is unimodal, and thus ternary search would work.\n\nThus, this seems like a feasible approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group. For example, prefix1[i] = sum of first i items in group 1, and similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\n4. For each possible number of weight 3 items taken (z), compute the remaining capacity m' = m - 3*z. If m' < 0, skip. Then compute the maximum value from the weight 1 and 2 items for capacity m', and add it to prefix3[z]. Keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items for capacity m'?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each m', perform a ternary search on j (number of weight 2 items taken) to find the optimal value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can write a helper function that, given m', returns the maximum value.\n\nNow, the question is: for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), what is the range of z?\n\nz can range from 0 to min( len3, m // 3 )\n\nFor each such z, we compute m' = m - 3*z, and then call the helper function for m' to get the value for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe maximum of all these values (prefix3[z] + helper(m')) is the answer.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this helper function.\n\nBut how to compute the helper function for m'?\n\nImplementing the ternary search for j in [0, j_max], where j_max = min( len2, m' // 2 )\n\nSo for a given m', the helper function is:\n\ndef get_max_1_2(m_prime):\n\n    j_max = min(len2, m_prime // 2)\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = j_max\n\n    best_val = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[ min( m_prime - 2*mid1, len1 ) ]\n\n        val2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[ min( m_prime - 2*mid2, len1 ) ]\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best_val = max(best_val, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best_val = max(best_val, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After the loop, check some points around low and high?\n\n    # Also, check the endpoints?\n\n    # Also, after the loop, check low, high, and some other points.\n\n    # Because ternary search may not find the exact maximum.\n\n    # So perhaps after the ternary search, we should check all j in the vicinity of low and high.\n\n    # Alternatively, during the ternary search, we can track the best value.\n\n    # But to make sure, perhaps we should also check the endpoints.\n\n    # So, after the loop, check j=0, j=j_max, and some others.\n\n    # Or, to be safe, check all j in the range [max(0, j_max - 100), j_max]\n\n    # But this may be time-consuming.\n\n    # Alternatively, after the ternary search, we can check all j in the range [low-2, high+2], etc.\n\n    # However, for the sake of time, perhaps during the ternary search, we can track the best value.\n\n    # Also, during the ternary search, we can return the best_val.\n\n    # But this may not capture the exact maximum. So, perhaps the ternary search is not reliable.\n\n    # Another Idea: instead of ternary search, we can iterate j from 0 to j_max, but that would be O(j_max) per m', which is not feasible.\n\n    # So, given the time constraints, perhaps the ternary search approach is the best bet, even if it's not 100% accurate.\n\nBut this brings up the possibility of errors. However, given the time, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think again about the helper function.\n\nThe helper function for weight 1 and 2 items for capacity m':\n\nWe can think of it as follows: for each possible j (number of weight 2 items taken), the value is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( m' - 2*j, len1 ) ]\n\nSince the prefix sums are non-decreasing, for j increasing, the first term increases, but the second term decreases.\n\nSo the function is unimodal. Hence, ternary search can be used to find the maximum.\n\nThus, the ternary search approach should work.\n\nSo, implementing the helper function with ternary search.\n\nOnce that is done, the overall approach would be:\n\nFor all possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), compute the remaining capacity m' = m - 3*z, and compute the max value from weight 1 and 2 items for m', then add it to the prefix3[z].\n\nThe maximum of all these values is the answer.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines, each with wi and ci.\n\nGroup the items by their weight.\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for",
