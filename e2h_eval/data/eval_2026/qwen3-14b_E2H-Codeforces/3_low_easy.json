Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. So I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the required d would be half of that gap (since the light from each lantern would cover up to the middle of the gap). But also, we need to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end at l.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be determined properly.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0), but since the lantern's light can cover up to d distance, the maximum needed here is a[0], because the lantern's light must reach 0. Wait, no. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the light needs to cover from a - d to a + d. But since the street starts at 0, the leftmost part is 0. So for the first lantern, the leftmost point that needs to be covered is 0. So the distance between 0 and a must be <= d. So the required d for this part is a - 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then this is zero. So the maximum between all these parts would be the required d.\n\nSimilarly, for the end of the street. The last lantern's position is a[-1]. The distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So the required d here is l - a[-1].\n\nThen, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions x and y (sorted), the maximum gap is y - x. The minimal d required for this gap is (y - x)/2. Because if you have two lanterns, the middle of the gap is (x + y)/2. Each lantern's light needs to reach that middle point. So the distance from x to the middle is (y - x)/2, same for the other lantern. So the required d for this gap is (y - x)/2.\n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's distance from l (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum of (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first position. If the first lantern is at 0, then no problem. Otherwise, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0], which is a candidate for max_d.\n\nCheck the last position. If it's at l, then no problem. Otherwise, the distance from last lantern to l is l - a[-1], which is another candidate.\n\nThen for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference (current - previous), divide by 2, and check if that's larger than current max_d.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the street is from 0 to l. The lantern is at a[0]. Then the max distance would be max(a[0], l - a[0]). Because the lantern's light has to cover from 0 to l. So for example, if the lantern is at 0, then the required d is l (since the light needs to reach l). But if the lantern is at l, then d is l. If it's in the middle, then the max between a[0] and l - a[0] would be the required d.\n\nSo yes, the approach works for that case.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they become [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck first lantern: 0. So no problem. Last lantern is 15, which is l. So no problem. Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to light up an entire street. The approach involves analyzing the positions of the lanterns and calculating the maximum distance that needs to be covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily determine the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover these gaps is half the size of the largest gap, as the light from each lantern must reach the midpoint of the gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = a[0]\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the list of lantern positions.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate gap calculation between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are checked. These values are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required radius for covering this gap is half the gap size, which is compared to the current maximum radius.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius required by considering both the ends of the street and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the entire street is illuminated.",
