Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street, if the last lantern isn't at l.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least half of that distance? Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius. So if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The coverage of the lantern would extend from a1 - d to a1 + d. But since the street starts at 0, the leftmost part of the street (0) needs to be covered. So the leftmost part is covered if a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a circle. So the lantern at a1 can cover from a1 -d to a1 +d. So for the street's beginning (0) to be covered, 0 must be within [a1 -d, a1 +d]. Which implies that d must be at least a1 - 0, but only if a1 is not zero. Wait, if a1 is zero, then d can be zero. But if a1 is say 3, then the distance from 0 to a1 is 3. So to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So d must be at least 3. Because the lantern's coverage extends from 3 -d to 3 +d. For 0 to be covered, 3 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ 3. So that's the case.\n\nSimilarly for the end of the street. If the last lantern is at a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that value.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is a[i+1] - a[i]. The worst case is the midpoint between them. Because the coverage of the two lanterns would need to reach that midpoint. So the required d for that gap is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because each lantern can cover up to d from their position. So the midpoint between them is (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from a[i] to that point is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. So d must be at least that value. \n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not 0)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (if it's not l)\n- the maximum of (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2\n\nWait, but if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero. So that part doesn't contribute. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position: if it's not zero, then the required d is a[0], because the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], and the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. So the radius must be at least a[0].\n\nSimilarly, check the last lantern's position. If it's not l, then the required d is l - a[-1].\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. Then the required d for that gap is (gap)/2. So the maximum of these values.\n\nThe answer is the maximum between the initial max_d and these values.\n\nSo for example, in the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nWait, the street is of length 5. So the street is from 0 to 5. The lanterns are at 2 and 5.\n\nFirst, sort the lanterns: [2,5].\n\nCheck first lantern: 2. So the distance from ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ such that all points on a street of length $ l $ are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a distance up to $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius required to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 gives the minimum radius required to ensure that the entire gap is covered by the lanterns' illumination.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the beginning\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = a[0]\n    \n    # Check the end\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        end_dist = l - a[-1]\n        if end_dist > max_d:\n            max_d = end_dist\n    \n    # Check gaps between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lanterns**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **End Checks**: The distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are checked first. These distances directly influence the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Gap Calculation**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the worst-case scenario is the midpoint of the gap. The radius required to cover this midpoint is half the gap's length. The maximum of these values ensures that even the largest gap is covered.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required by considering both the end points and the gaps between consecutive lanterns, ensuring that the entire street is illuminated with the smallest possible radius.",
