For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12, so after H comes C again. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. For example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Let me think: C to C# is 1 semitone, then D is another, D# another, E is another. So C to E is 4 semitones. Right. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps you take moving forward in the sequence, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is map each note to its position in the sequence. Let me create a list of the notes in order. The order given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in some notations, B is followed by C. So the order is as given. So the list would be:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that after H comes C again. So the index for H is 11, and then C is 0. So for any two notes, the distance between them (from X to Y) is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? No, because if X is before Y, then it's Y - X. If X is after Y, then it's (12 - X + Y) ?\n\nWait, for example, the distance between E (index 4) and C (index 0) is 8 semitones. Because E to F is 1, F to F# 2, etc., up to C. Let me compute: E to C is going backward. But according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between E (index 4) and C (index 0), the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given.\n\nSo the way to calculate the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Alternatively, (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then the distance is Y - X. If Y is before X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, X is C (0), Y is E (4): distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then distance is 0 + 12 -4 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Alternatively, (Y_index - X_index) % 12? Wait, let's see: if Y is after X, then Y - X is positive, mod 12 gives same value. If Y is before X, then Y - X is negative. For example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0): 0-4 = -4. Mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the distance is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y, that's exactly what we need.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4. Correct. Between E and C, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, which implies that for any two distinct notes, the distance is the minimal number of steps when moving forward. But in the case of the problem, the distance is not the minimal. Because for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. However, if you go the other way, it's 4 semitones. But according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So when you have X and Y, the distance is determined based on which is lower. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the formula is (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). But that can also be written as (Y_index - X_index) % 12? Let me check. For example, if Y is C (0) and X is E (4), then Y - X is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, since the problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken as from the lower to the upper, which is the same as the mod 12 calculation. So for example, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8, which is the same as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. So the formula holds.\n\nSo, the first step is to create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's create a dictionary for that. For example, note_to_index = {'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, ... 'H': 11}.\n\nOnce I have that, for any three notes, I need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nThe problem says that the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So the order of the three notes in the input doesn't matter. But for checking major or minor, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any of them fit the criteria.\n\nFor a major triad, there must exist an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Then, the total distance between X and Z would be 7 semitones. Similarly for minor, the distance between X and Y is 3, Y and Z is 4.\n\nBut how do I check all possible orderings of the three notes?\n\nWell, for three elements, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, perhaps there are multiple permutations that could satisfy the condition. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so we just need to check if any permutation satisfies either major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (all possible orderings of the three notes).\n- For each permutation, check:\n   - if the distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3 → major.\n   - if the distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4 → minor.\n- If any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'.\n- Similarly for minor.\n- If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) will generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nSo, steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input: three notes. For example, input is a list of three strings. So, for the example input, the first case is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\n2. Create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's create the list of notes in order. The order is given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, the problem says that the notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example says that the third input is 'A B H' which outputs 'strange'. Let's check that. Let's see what permutations of A, B, H would be.\n\nBut first, let's make sure the note_to_index is correct.\n\nLet me code that as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nSo for example, 'A' is index 9, 'B' is 10, 'H' is 11.\n\nNow, for the third example input: A, B, H.\n\nLet me consider all permutations of these three. Let's take one permutation, say A, B, H.\n\nCompute distance between A (9) and B (10): 10-9=1. Then between B and H: 11 -10=1. So not 3 and 4. Another permutation: A, H, B. Distance from A to H is (11 -9) = 2. Then H to B is (10 - 11) mod 12? Wait, H is 11, B is 10. So distance from H to B is (10 -11) mod 12 = (-1) mod 12 = 11. Which is 11 semitones. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. Distance from B to A: (9 -10) mod 12 is 11. Not 3 or 4. So maybe none of the permutations would satisfy the major or minor conditions. Hence the output is strange.\n\nSo the code needs to check all permutations.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the three notes as a list. Then generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if it meets major or minor conditions.\n\nNow, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck for major: distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3.\n\nCheck for minor: distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three strings.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = permutation\n\n   compute d1 = distance between x and y.\n\n   compute d2 = distance between y and z.\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets either condition, we can return the answer.\n\nSo, the code can loop through all permutations and check.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nImplementing the distance function:\n\ndef get_distance(note1, note2):\n\n    idx1 = note_to_index[note1]\n\n    idx2 = note_to_index[note2]\n\n    return (idx2 - idx1) % 12\n\nWait, but in the example where X is C and Y is E, (idx2 - idx1) is 4-0=4, mod 12 is 4. Which is correct. When X is E and Y is C, (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nYes. So this function returns the correct distance between note1 and note2, measured from note1 to note2.\n\nSo, for the permutation (X, Y, Z), we check the distance between X and Y (d1) and Y and Z (d2). So for major, d1 must be 4 and d2 3. For minor, d1 3 and d2 4.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies either, we can return the answer.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n\n    d2 = (note_to_index[z] - note_to_index[y]) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but for the example input:\n\nFirst case: C E G.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take C, E, G.\n\nd1 between C and E: (4-0) =4 mod 12 →4. d2 between E and G: G is index 7. 7-4=3 →3. So yes, major. So the code would print 'major'.\n\nSecond example input: C# B F → which is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's take B, C#, F.\n\ndistance between B (10) and C# (1) is (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9) mod 12 → 3? Let me compute:\n\n(1 -10) = -9. -9 mod 12 is 3? Because 12* (-1) is -12. -9 - (-12) = 3. Yes. So d1 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1 =4. So d2 is 4. So that's minor. So code would print 'minor'.\n\nThird example input: A B H. Let's check all permutations. For example, A, B, H: d1 between A (9) and B (10) is 1. d2 between B and H (11) is 1. Not matching. Another permutation: B, H, A. d1 is (H is 11, B is 10 → 11-10=1 → distance from B to H is 1? Wait, no. Wait, the distance between B and H is (H's index - B's index) mod 12. H is index 11, B is 10. So 11-10 =1 → mod 12 is 1. So d1 is 1. Then between H and A: A is index 9. So (9 - 11) mod 12 is ( -2) mod 12 = 10. So d2 is 10. Not 3 and 4. Another permutation: A, H, B. d1 between A and H is 11-9=2. d2 between H and B is (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11. No. Another permutation: H, A, B. d1 is (A's index - H's index) mod 12. A is 9, H is 11. (9-11) mod 12 is -2 mod 12 is 10. So d1 is 10. Then between A and B is 1. No. Another permutation: B, A, H. d1 between B and A is (9-10) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 → 11. Then between A and H is 2. No. Another permutation: H, B, A. d1 between H and B is (10 - 11) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 → 11. d2 between B and A is (9 -10) mod 12 → 11. No. So none of the permutations meet the criteria. So output is strange.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what about the permutation (B, A, H)? Let's check:\n\nd1 is distance between B and A. B is 10, A is 9. So (9 -10) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 is 11. So d1 is 11. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nSo the code would output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code seems to work for the examples.\n\nBut what about other cases? Let's think of a minor chord. For example, the example given: C# B F. The correct answer is minor. Let's see.\n\nIn the code, when the permutation is B, C#, F.\n\ndistance between B and C#: C# is index 1. B is 10. So (1 -10) mod 12 → -9 mod 12 = 3. So d1 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1 =4. So d2 is 4. So that's minor. So code returns minor.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. The input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the first sample input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but wait, the input is the three notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three elements. But in reality, the input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is:\n\nInput:\n\nC E G\n\nBut the sample shows the input as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three notes, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of three examples, but perhaps that's a formatting error. The actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is \"C E G\", and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code should read the input as input().split().\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably a mistake. For example, the problem says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. The actual input is three separate lines, or one line with three notes? The problem says that the input is the only line with three space-separated notes. So for example, the first test case is \"C E G\" as input, output is \"major\".\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is a list of three examples, which may be a mistake. However, the code should process a single line of three notes.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo, the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as input().split(), which gives a list of three elements.\n\nSo, for example, input_notes = input().split()\n\nNow, the code proceeds as discussed.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is repeated? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for the problem, the input is three notes. So the code can assume that the input is three distinct notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so even if there are duplicates, perhaps the code would not have to handle that. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but it's possible that they are the same. However, in that case, the code would check permutations, but for example, if all three are same note, then the distances would be zero, and thus not match major or minor. So the code would output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can proceed regardless.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # Compute distance between x and y\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutations are generated for the three notes. So for example, if the input is ['C', 'E', 'G'], then permutations would generate all 6 possible orderings. For each of them, check if any meets the major or minor condition.\n\nBut in the code, once any permutation meets the condition, it prints and exits. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → output is major.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC# B F → output minor.\n\nSample Input:\n\nA B H → output strange.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let me check for another case. Let's say the input is B C# F. Let's see:\n\nThe permutation B, C#, F. As discussed earlier, d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nAnother example: C E G → major.\n\nAnother example: C E G# → let's see. Let's check permutations.\n\nFor example, C, E, G#:\n\ndistance between C and E is 4. Between E and G# is 3? Let's see. E is index 4. G# is index 8. 8-4 =4. So d2 is 4. So not 3. So that's not major. What about other permutations?\n\nWhat about C, G#, E? Let's see:\n\ndistance between C (0) and G# (8) is 8 mod 12 → 8. Not 4. So no. Another permutation: E, C, G#. Distance between E and C is (0 -4) mod 12 → 8. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: E, G#, C. Distance between E and G# is 4 (8-4=4). Then between G# and C: (0 -8) mod 12 → 4? Because 0-8 is -8 mod 12 is 4. So d2 is 4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not matching. So no.\n\nSo this would be strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, B. Let's see.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take C, E, B. d1 is 4, then E to B is 10 -4 = 6. So 6. No. Another permutation: C, B, E. distance between C and B is (10-0) mod 12 = 10. No. Another permutation: E, B, C. distance between E (4) and B (10) is 6. Then B to C is 1. No. Another permutation: B, E, C. distance between B and E is (4 - 10) mod 12 → ( -6 ) mod 12 → 6. Then E to C is 8. No. So no. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G → major. So code works.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G. Let's see. Let's check for major. Let's see: C to D# is 3 semitones (D# is index 3. 3-0=3). Then D# to G is 3 (G is index 7. 7-3=4? No, 7-3=4. So d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor. So if the permutation is C, D#, G → d1=3, d2=4 → minor. So code would output minor.\n\nSo the code would correctly detect that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, I need to make sure that the note_order is correctly ordered. Let me check:\n\nThe problem says the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So the note_order list is correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations, which generates all possible orderings. For each, checks the two conditions.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nNeed to import itertools.permutations.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, the exit() function may not be the best practice. However, for code submission, using sys.exit() would be better. However, in the code, using exit() would work if the code is run in a context where exit is available. However, in some environments, it's better to use sys.exit(). However, in Python, the exit() function is available in the standard environment, but perhaps in some cases, it's better to import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nBut for the code to work, perhaps replacing exit() with sys.exit() is better. However, in code submission, sometimes exit() is allowed. However, in the code as written, when using exit(), it may raise an error. Let me think. In Python, exit() is a function in the sys module. However, in the default Python environment, exit() is available as a built-in function. But perhaps in some cases, it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nBut in the code submission, the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for all possible cases. Let's think about the case where the same note appears twice. For example, input is ['C', 'C', 'E']. Then, permutations would include (C, C, E). The distance between C and C is 0, so no. So the code would check all permutations and find none, output strange.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, G. The code finds the major.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, G#. Let's see. For any permutation, does any meet the criteria? Let's check:\n\nC, E, G# → d1 is 4, d2 is (G# is index 8, E is 4 → 8-4=4. So d2 is 4. So no. So no major. For minor, need d1=3 and d2=4. Let's check permutation C, G#, E. d1 is (G# is index 8 - C is 0 → 8 mod 12 → 8. Not 3. Another permutation: E, C, G#. d1 between E and C is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. No. Another permutation: E, G#, C. d1 between E and G# is 8-4=4. d2 between G# and C is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No. So output strange.\n\nSo code works.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: The 12 musical notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11 to facilitate distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, the corresponding result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found, \"strange\" is printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    d2 = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly when moving from one octave to the next.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three input notes are checked. For each permutation, the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note are calculated.\n4. **Criteria Check**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If a valid triad is found, the result is printed and the program exits immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification of the triad.",
