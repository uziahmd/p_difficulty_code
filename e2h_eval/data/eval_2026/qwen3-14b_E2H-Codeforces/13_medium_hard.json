For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. From the description:\n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y as 3 semitones, Y to Z as 4. So the total would be 7 as well, but the order is different.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Let's think about the order of the notes. The list given is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic.\n\nSo each note can be assigned an index. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the distance between two notes (when moving forward) is (target - start) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Let's check that.\n\nLooking at the order: C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). So from C to E is 4 semitones. That's correct. So the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance from E to C would be (0 -4 + 12) mod 12 = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the way to calculate the distance between two notes when moving forward (i.e., the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones you move upwards from X to reach Y) is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. However, if the result is negative, adding 12 would make it positive. Wait, no. Because if Y is before X in the list, then (y_index - x_index) would be negative. But mod 12 would give the correct positive value. For example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0): 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the distance between X and Y (as per the problem's definition) is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper, so when you have two notes, the distance is the minimal number of semitones you need to move upwards from the lower note to reach the higher. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. But if you have X and Y, then the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But that's only if you take the upward direction. Because if Y is lower than X, then that mod gives the correct distance. So for example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4), distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\nSo the key is that the distance between two notes is (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but since the problem defines that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, maybe the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when you move from X to Y in the upward direction. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). So for example, X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula for the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). Alternatively, (y_index - x_index) % 12. Because for example, when y_index is less than x_index, (y_index - x_index) is negative. But mod 12 would give the correct positive value.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nIf X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0=4 mod12 is 4. Correct.\n\nIf X is E (4), Y is C (0): 0-4 = -4 mod12 is 8. Correct.\n\nYes. So the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper, perhaps that's the correct way to calculate it.\n\nSo, for a given triad of three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. For example, for three notes A, B, C, there are 6 possible orderings. For each of them, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nBut how to generate all possible permutations of the three notes?\n\nWell, for three elements, there are 6 permutations. So for each of the three notes, we can generate all possible orderings and check each one.\n\nAlternatively, for the three notes, we can check all possible orderings where the first note is X, second Y, third Z. So, for each permutation of the three notes, check if the distance between X and Y is 4 and between Y and Z is 3 (for major), or if the distance between X and Y is 3 and between Y and Z is 4 (for minor).\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none meet either, then it's strange.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. Assign each note to its corresponding index in the list of notes.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n4. For each permutation, check if it's a major or minor triad.\n\n5. If any permutation is major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor are possible.\n\nBut how to generate the permutations? Let's think about that. For example, the three notes can be ordered in 6 ways. For each of these, check for major and minor.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the distances between X and Y is 4, Y and Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7. But since the order is X-Y-Z, then the distance between X and Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, perhaps there are multiple ways to arrange the same notes.\n\nBut regardless, checking all permutations is feasible here.\n\nSo first, I need a way to map the note names to their indices. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order is given as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe notes are listed as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as follows:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo for example, 'H' is index 11. Then, the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo, first step: create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example, note_to_index = {'C':0, 'C#':1, ... 'H':11}.\n\nOnce I have that, for each note in the input, I can get their indices.\n\nNow, for the three notes, say, note1, note2, note3, we can generate all permutations of these three, and for each permutation, check the distances.\n\nSo for example, for a permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\ndistance_XY = (Y_index - X_index) % 12\n\ndistance_YZ = (Z_index - Y_index) % 12\n\nif distance_XY == 4 and distance_YZ == 3 → major.\n\nif distance_XY == 3 and distance_YZ == 4 → minor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and between Y and Z is 3. So that's exactly the case where the first distance is 4 and the second is 3. So for the permutation (X,Y,Z), that's the case.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all permutations. So for example, the same three notes could be arranged in different orders, and any of them could satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo for example, the sample input 'C E G' is a major triad. Let's see:\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nIn the permutation (C, E, G):\n\ndistance between C and E is (4-0) =4 → correct. Between E and G is 7-4=3 → correct. So that's a major.\n\nAnother permutation could be (E, G, C). Let's check:\n\ndistance E to G is 3 (7-4=3?), yes. Then G to C is (0 -7) mod 12 → (0-7) is -7 mod12 is 5? Wait, no. Wait, (0-7) is -7. Adding 12 gives 5. So the distance is 5. Which is not 3 or 4. So that permutation would not meet the criteria. So only certain permutations will meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes and check each one.\n\nNow, in Python, generating permutations can be done using itertools.permutations. For example, for the list of three notes, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead the three notes into a list.\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   X, Y, Z = permutation\n\n   compute distance between X and Y: d1 = (Y_index - X_index) mod 12\n\n   compute distance between Y and Z: d2 = (Z_index - Y_index) mod 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major → return 'major'\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor → return 'minor'\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none of them meet the major or minor conditions, return 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- create the note_to_index mapping.\n\n- read the three input notes.\n\n- generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- for each permutation, check for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the condition, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So, for example, if there's a permutation that meets major and another that meets minor, but according to the problem statement, that can't happen. So the code can check for the first occurrence of either major or minor and return accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps there are multiple permutations that meet the same condition. For example, for a major triad, there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the major condition. But since the problem says that the answer is unique, once any permutation is found to meet the condition, we can return the answer.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck all permutations. For each permutation, check if it's major or minor. Once any of them is found, return the answer. If none found, return strange.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping. Let's code that.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the notes are given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is correct.\n\nNow, the input is three notes. For example, in the sample input, the first case is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo, for each of the three notes, get their indexes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check the distances.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, for the three notes, say, notes = [n1, n2, n3], for perm in permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       return 'major'\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       return 'minor'\n\nOnce any of these conditions is met, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the code can loop through all permutations. Once a permutation meets the condition, return the answer. Otherwise, after checking all, return 'strange'.\n\nBut what about permutations that are same in terms of order? For example, if the same three notes are arranged in different orders, but the code checks all of them.\n\nBut the code will check all permutations, so even if one of them meets the condition, it will be detected.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nPermutations include (C, E, G). For this:\n\nd1 = 4-0 =4, mod12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3 mod12 is 3. So yes, major. So returns 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: ['C#', 'B', 'F']\n\nThe sample output is 'minor'.\n\nLet's check. The correct permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nB's index is 10 (since notes_order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So B is index 10, H is 11.\n\nC# is index 1. F is index 5.\n\nSo for permutation (B, C#, F):\n\nd1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1-10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. Because 12-9=3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5 -1) mod12 → 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So returns 'minor'.\n\nAnother example: sample input 3 is ['A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nLet's check all permutations.\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nLet's see possible permutations.\n\nTake permutation (A, B, H):\n\nd1 = 10-9=1 → 1. d2 = 11-10=1 → 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (A, H, B):\n\nd1 is (H's index - A's index) → 11-9=2 → 2. d2 is B's index - H's index → 10-11 = -1 mod12 is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation (B, A, H): d1 is A's index (9) - B's index (10) → (9-10) mod12 = 11. So d1 is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation (B, H, A): d1 is H (11) - B (10) → 1. Then d2 is A (9) - H (11) → (9-11) mod12 = -2 mod12 = 10. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation (H, A, B): d1 is A (9) - H (11) → (9-11) = -2 mod12 is 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (H, B, A): d1 is B (10) - H (11) → (10-11) = -1 mod12 is 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead input: the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but the actual input is three notes separated by spaces. Wait, the input is a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the input is three lines? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three notes, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the example shows:\n\nInput: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWhich is probably a list of three test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is one line. So the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nBut in the problem's example, the sample input is three different cases. However, in the problem's actual input, the user is supposed to read one line. So for the code, the input is one line, e.g., \"C E G\" → output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code should read the input line, split into three parts, process them.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nThen, for the three notes in 'notes' list, generate permutations.\n\nThen, check each permutation.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major or minor condition, output the corresponding string.\n\nNow, code:\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print \"strange\".\n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that multiple permutations meet the same condition? For example, in a major triad, there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the major condition. However, the code will check them in order and return upon the first occurrence. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, once any permutation meets the condition, the code can return immediately.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is straightforward.\n\nBut what about the order of the permutations? For example, in the case where a permutation is checked first and meets the minor condition, but another permutation meets the major condition. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can safely return on the first match.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets the condition, the code can return.\n\nSo, the code would proceed as follows.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → code checks permutations. The first permutation that meets the condition is (C, E, G) → major. So output is 'major'.\n\nAnother sample input: 'C# B F' → the code will check permutations. One of them is B, C#, F → which gives d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H' → no permutations meet the conditions, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about the case where the same note is present multiple times? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is a set of three notes, but the input may have duplicates? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they are distinct. However, the code does not need to check for duplicates. For example, if the input is three same notes, then all permutations would have d1 and d2 as 0. So it's 'strange'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can process any input.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    \n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three examples. However, the actual input is one line. So for example, in the sample input, the user would input three lines? Or one line?\n\nNo, the problem says that the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, but each is a separate input. But the code is supposed to handle one input line. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nFor example, if the input is 'C E G', the code outputs 'major'.\n\nIf the input is 'C# B F', the code outputs 'minor'.\n\nIf the input is 'A B H', outputs 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same note is repeated? Like 'C C C'? Then, all d1 and d2 are zero. So outputs 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G' → major.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'? Let's see. Let's compute permutations.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutation (C, E, G#):\n\nd1 is 4-0 =4 → correct. d2 is 8-4=4 → which is not 3. So not major.\n\nAnother permutation (C, G#, E):\n\nd1 is 8-0=8 mod12 is 8. Not 4 or 3.\n\nAnother permutation (E, C, G#): d1 is (C - E) → (0-4) mod12 is 8. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation (E, G#, C): d1 is (G# - E) is 8-4=4 → yes. d2 is (C - G#) → 0-8 = -8 mod12 is 4. So d2 is 4. So 4 and 4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation (G#, C, E): d1 is C - G# → 0 -8 = -8 mod12 is 4. d1 is 4. d2 is E - C → 4-0=4. So again, 4 and 4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation (G#, E, C): d1 is E - G# → 4-8 = -4 mod12 is 8. Not 3 or 4.\n\nSo no match, so output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code would return 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: 'B C# F' → which is the same as the sample input's second case. Let's see:\n\nNotes are B, C#, F.\n\nPermutation (B, C#, F):\n\nB is 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod12 = -9 mod12 = 3. d2 is (5-1)=4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code is written correctly. So that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad by calculating the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the distances between notes in the cyclic musical scale. A major triad is identified by a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, followed by a distance of 3 semitones between the second and third note. Conversely, a minor triad is identified by a distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    \n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its respective index for quick lookup.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input line is read and split into three individual notes.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Distance Checks**: Each permutation is checked to see if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation satisfies the condition, the result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
