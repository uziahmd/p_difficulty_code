After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects. For example, if the input is '223', then the first student has marks 2, 2, 3 for subjects 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the input into a 2D array. Let's think about how to read that. For each of the n lines, we can convert the string into a list of integers. So for example, the first line after n and m is the first student's marks.\n\nOnce we have the data as a list of lists, we can process each column (subject) to find the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max values for each subject, then for each student, we check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the max of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each into a list of integers. So, for example, the first line becomes [2,2,3] for the first sample.\n- For each subject (columns 0 to m-1), find the maximum value. So for the first sample, the subjects are:\n   Subject 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n   Subject 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\n   Subject 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo, how to compute the max for each subject?\n\nWe can transpose the matrix. For example, if the original data is a list of lists (each row is a student's marks), then transposing it would give us columns as rows. For example, for the first sample:\n\nOriginal data:\n[\n [2, 2, 3],\n [2, 3, 2],\n [1, 1, 2]\n]\n\nTransposed would be:\n[\n [2, 2, 1],\n [2, 3, 1],\n [3, 2, 2]\n]\n\nThen, for each of these rows (which are the subjects), find the max. So for the first transposed row, max is 2, etc.\n\nSo, in Python, to transpose a matrix, we can use zip(*matrix). However, since each row is a list of integers, we can do:\n\ntransposed = list(zip(*data))\n\nBut since each row is a list, zip(*data) will give tuples. For example, for the first sample, the transposed would be [(2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,2,2)]. Then, for each of these, take the max. So for each subject, the max is max(subject_column).\n\nOnce we have the max values for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject equals the max of that subject.\n\nSo, for each student in data, iterate through their marks. For each mark in position j, check if it equals the max of subject j. If any of them is true, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, the problem is to collect all such students and count them.\n\nSo, the plan:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string, then convert each character to integer, making a list. So data = [[int(c) for c in input().strip()] for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen compute the max for each subject. For that, transpose the data and compute max for each column.\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(subject) for subject in zip(*data)]\n\nWait, zip(*data) gives us the columns as tuples. So for each column in data, we can get the max.\n\nOnce we have max_per_subject, which is a list of length m, where each element is the maximum of that subject.\n\nThen, for each student in data, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nSo, for each student_row in data:\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n   if student_row[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n       mark as successful and break.\n\nSo, the count is the number of students where at least one of their marks is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines. Then process.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo data becomes:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So this student is successful.\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]. subject 1: 3 == 3 → yes.\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]. For subject 0: 1 < 2. subject 1: 1 < 3. subject 2: 2 < 3. So no. So not successful.\n\nThus total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo data is:\n\n[[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each subject:\n\nsubject 0: max(9,1,1) → 9\n\nsubject 1: max(1,1,1) → 1\n\nsubject 2: max(7,8,1) → 8\n\nsubject 3: max(2,2,1) → 2\n\nsubject 4: max(8,8,1) → 8\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: has 9 in subject 0 (max is 9) → successful.\n\nStudent 1: has 8 in subject 2 (max is 8) and 8 in subject 4 (max is 8) → successful.\n\nStudent 2: has 1 in subject 1 (max is 1) → successful.\n\nSo all three are successful. Hence output is 3.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, m. Then read n lines, each line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute max_per_subject as [max(col) for col in zip(*data)].\n\nThen, for each student in data, check if any of their marks in the same position is equal to the max_per_subject for that column.\n\nSo, for each student_row in data:\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n   if student_row[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       break\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in data:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, that's the logic.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nIn Python, the input is read via input() function. However, when using multiple test cases, but in the problem description, the input seems to be for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line with n and m, then n lines of m characters. The output is a single number.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of two examples. However, the user is to write a Python script that reads from stdin. So, perhaps the code is supposed to handle one test case at a time. So, for example, in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nWhich is one test case. The second input is another test case. But in the problem statement, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So, perhaps the code should read one test case. But in the example given, the input is a list of two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m. Then n lines follow. So, the code should read one test case. However, in the example given, there are two input examples. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems, usually is a single test case. So, the code needs to read the input once.\n\nSo, the code will read n and m, then read n lines, each line being the marks for a student.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is given via a file, the code may need to read all lines. However, in programming competition, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ndata = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    data.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nThen compute max_per_subject.\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(col) for col in zip(*data)]\n\nThen count the students.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in data:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the code. Let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ndata becomes [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nzip(*data) gives columns as (2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,2,2). So max_per_subject is [2,3,3].\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 == 2 (subject 0) → count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 3 == 3 (subject 1) → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none of the marks are equal to the max. So no. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ndata is [[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\nzip(*data) gives columns:\n\n(9,1,1) → max 9\n\n(1,1,1) → 1\n\n(7,8,1) → 8\n\n(2,2,1) → 2\n\n(8,8,1) → 8\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nEach student:\n\nstudent 0: 9 == 9 → yes.\n\nstudent 1: 8 in subject 2 (third column) → yes.\n\nstudent 2: 1 in subject 1 (second column) → yes.\n\nSo all three are counted. Output is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1. The student has a mark of 5. Then max_per_subject is [5], so the student is successful. Output is 1.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=1. Both have 5. Then max is 5. Both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 1], student 2 has [8, 9]. max_per_subject is [9,9]. Student 1 has 9 in subject 0. Student 2 has 9 in subject 1. So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then each is best in both subjects. But each is counted once. So output is 2.\n\nYes, because each student has at least one subject where they are best.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 8], student 2 has [9, 9]. max_per_subject is [9,9]. Student 1 has 9 in subject 0. So he is successful. Student 2 has 9 in both. So both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when m is 0? But according to the constraints, m is at least 1. Because 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no problem.\n\nAnother possible case: when all students have the same marks. For example, n=3, m=2. All students have [5,5]. Then max_per_subject is [5,5]. All students are successful. Output is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code should be as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the grades for each student.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject, find the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in at least one subject. Count such students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ndata = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    data.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(col) for col in zip(*data)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in data:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for the number of students and subjects, followed by reading each student's grades as a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: Using the `zip` function, we transpose the matrix of grades to easily compute the maximum grade for each subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, we check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If so, the student is counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging transposition to simplify the process of finding maximum grades per subject and then checking each student against these maximums. The solution ensures that each student is checked only once per subject, leading to an efficient and straightforward implementation.",
