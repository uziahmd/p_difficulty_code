The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about a frog jumping on a number line. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't step outside the interval [0, x] when it's trying to reach some position. For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach under these constraints, and then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For a given x, the frog can only make jumps that keep it within [0, x]. So, for example, if the frog is at position k, it can jump to k+a only if k+a <=x. Similarly, it can jump to k-b only if k-b >=0.\n\nBut how do we model all the positions the frog can reach? It seems like a problem involving reachability with certain constraints. Since the frog can jump forward and backward, but the positions are limited by x, maybe there's a mathematical way to find the set of reachable positions.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Let's consider that the frog can perform any combination of adding a and subtracting b. But since the frog can't go beyond 0 or x, the actual reachable positions depend on the constraints.\n\nWait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. For example, if a=5 and b=3, like in the first example. For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5 (by jumping +a once). Also, maybe other positions?\n\nWait in the first example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5. But according to the note, f(5)=3. Oh right, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the note again. Oh, in the first example, f(5)=3. How?\n\nAh, perhaps the frog can also reach positions that are combinations of jumps. Like, maybe starting from 0, jumping +a to 5, then from there, can't jump +a again because 5+5=10 which is beyond x=5. But can it jump -b? 5-3=2, which is within [0,5]. So then 2 is reachable. Then from 2, can it jump +a to 2+5=7, which is beyond x=5. So no. Or jump -b to 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So only 0,5,2 are reachable. So f(5)=3. That makes sense.\n\nSo the problem is to find all positions reachable via any sequence of jumps, considering that during the process, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this for arbitrary x?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the general case. The frog can reach any position that can be written as a linear combination of a and b, but with some constraints. Wait, but since the frog can go back and forth, perhaps the positions reachable are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b), but also within certain ranges. However, the constraints here are that during the entire journey, the frog can't step outside [0,x].\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find for each x, the set of positions that are reachable, given that during the path, the frog doesn't go beyond 0 or x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into finding all positions that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and such that the position is between 0 and x. But this might not capture all possibilities, because the frog could have made jumps in different orders, but maybe the net effect is the same.\n\nWait, but the frog can move forward and backward. So the positions reachable are all numbers of the form (some multiple of a minus some multiple of b), but such that during the process of getting there, the frog never went beyond 0 or x. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as the set of positions that are reachable from 0 using any number of steps, where each step is +a or -b, and the path never leaves [0, x]. However, since the frog can choose any path, perhaps the positions that are reachable are those that are in the set generated by the linear combinations, but also lie within [0, x], and can be reached via some path that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how to compute this for arbitrary x?\n\nLet me think about the case where the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because the frog can add a and subtract b any number of times. So the set of positions reachable without any constraints would be all integers that are multiples of d, but this depends on the frog being able to reach them via some path.\n\nBut since the frog can't go beyond 0 or x, maybe the positions that can be reached are those that are multiples of d, and lie in [0, x], and also can be reached through some combination of steps that don't go out of bounds. However, this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, a=5, b=3. Their gcd is 1. So all integers are possible. However, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Which are 0, 2, 5. These are all congruent mod 1. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: when a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of their gcd (which is 1), but with some constraints based on x.\n\nBut how to model the constraints of the path not going out of bounds?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me consider the case where the frog can move freely, i.e., x is large enough. Then, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d = gcd(a,b). But since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the positions that are reachable are those that are multiples of d and are greater than or equal to 0. However, the frog can't reach negative numbers, but since it starts at 0, and can only add a or subtract b, but the frog can't go below 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the frog can't jump to positions outside [0, x]. So even if the frog can reach a position that is a multiple of d, but during the path, it had to go outside of [0, x], then that position isn't counted.\n\nThis seems really complicated. But perhaps for a given x, the positions that are reachable are exactly those positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a, b)), and lie between 0 and x, and also satisfy that they can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients (but that's not exactly correct, since you can subtract b steps as well).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions that can be reached are all multiples of d that are between 0 and x, and also can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients that allow the frog to reach them without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is between 0 and x, provided that x is sufficiently large. But when x is small, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the number of such positions?\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime. Let's take a=5 and b=3 as in the first example. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (so all integers), but only if there's a way to reach them without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nFor example, when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (as discussed). How about 3? Let's see. To reach 3, the frog would need to do something like:\n\nStart at 0. Jump +a to 5. Then jump -b to 2. From 2, can we get to 3? Well, 2 + a = 7, which is beyond x=5. So can't do that. 2 -b = -1, which is invalid. So 3 is not reachable. So even though 3 is a multiple of 1, it's not reachable for x=5.\n\nSo the problem is more complex than just counting multiples of d. The positions that are reachable depend on the ability to reach them via some path that doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need to find for each x, the maximum number of positions that can be reached given that the frog can't go beyond x. But how?\n\nLet me think differently. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (the gcd of a and b) and lies in the range [0, x], but only if that position can be achieved by some combination of steps that don't require stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a minimal distance that the frog can reach. For example, in the case where a and b are coprime, the minimal positive distance that can be achieved is 1, but perhaps the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain value. But again, this depends on x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the frog can reach any position k that is a multiple of d (gcd(a, b)), and such that k can be written as k = a * p - b * q, where p and q are non-negative integers, and during the process of building up k, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nThis feels too abstract. Maybe there's a pattern in the examples.\n\nLooking at the third sample input: m=100, a=100000, b=1. The output is 101. The note says that the frog can't make any jumps. So for any x, the frog can't jump. Because a=100000, so the first jump would be to 100000, but if x is less than that, then that's not allowed. For example, when x is 100, then the frog can't make any jumps. Hence, for all x, the frog can only reach position 0. Therefore, f(x) is 1 for all x. So the sum from 0 to 100 is 101*1=101. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo in this case, the frog can't make any jumps. So the answer is always 1 for each x. So the sum is m+1.\n\nThis suggests that if a is larger than x, then the frog can't make any forward jumps. Similarly, if b is larger than x, then the frog can't make any backward jumps. But since the frog starts at 0, and can't make any jumps, then the only reachable position is 0.\n\nSo, for a general x, the frog can make forward jumps (adding a) only if the new position is <=x. Similarly for backward jumps (subtracting b) only if the new position is >=0.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the general approach. For each x, the frog can reach positions that are reachable via some combination of adding a and subtracting b, but during the process, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph problem. Each position is a node, and edges represent the possible jumps. Then f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph.\n\nHowever, given that m can be up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5, we can't simulate this for each x. So we need a mathematical formula or pattern that can be computed efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: For the frog to be able to reach positions beyond 0, it must be possible to make some forward jumps. However, if a is larger than x, then the frog can't make any forward jumps. Similarly, if b is larger than x, then the frog can't make any backward jumps. But in that case, the frog can't move anywhere except 0.\n\nSo, for x < a and x < b, the frog can't make any jumps. So f(x) = 1.\n\nBut when x >= a, the frog can jump to a. Then, from there, it can jump to a + a, if that's within x, etc. Or jump back by b, if possible.\n\nBut this seems complicated again. Let's think about the case where the frog can make both forward and backward jumps. For example, when a and b are such that they are coprime, and x is large enough.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of the gcd(a, b) (which is 1), and lies between 0 and x. But how to confirm this?\n\nWait, in the first example, when x is 7, f(7) is 8. The positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, and others? Let me check. The note says f(7)=8. So there are 8 positions. Let's see:\n\nThe frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7 (from 0+5). Then from 5, can jump to 5-3=2. From 2, can jump to 2+5=7. From 7, can't jump forward. Can jump back to 7-3=4. Then from 4, can jump forward to 4+5=9>7, so no. Or back to 4-3=1. From 1, can't jump forward (1+5=6 <=7?), yes. So 6. Then from 6, can jump back to 6-3=3. Then from 3, can jump forward to 3+5=8>7, so no. Or back to 0. So the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. All of them are between 0 and 7. And they are all congruent to 0 mod 1 (so all integers). So the count is 8. Which is exactly the number of integers from 0 to 7, but wait, that's 8 numbers. But why can't the frog reach all positions?\n\nBecause for example, position 4 is reachable. How? Let me think. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. Then from 4, subtract 3 to get 1, then add 5 to get 6, etc. So yes.\n\nSo when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x that are multiples of d (gcd(a, b)). But how to find when x is large enough?\n\nThis seems to suggest that for sufficiently large x, the number of reachable positions is floor(x / d) + 1, where d is the gcd of a and b. But when x is not large enough, it's less than that.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can't make any jumps (i.e., x < a and x < b). Then f(x) = 1.\n\nCase 2: The frog can make some jumps. Then, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. But how to determine when x is large enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x], minus some exceptions when x is not large enough.\n\nBut how to find those exceptions?\n\nLet me think again about the example where a=5, b=3. The d is 1. So for x >= some value, all positions in [0, x] are reachable. But when x is small, like x=5, only certain positions are reachable.\n\nBut when x is large enough, say x >= a + b, then the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d. Because once you can reach a position, you can add or subtract steps to reach others.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nThis seems similar to the coin problem. For two coprime denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab -a -b. But this is for the case of forming amounts with non-negative integers. However, our problem is different, but perhaps there's a connection.\n\nIn our case, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. So the minimal x for which this holds would be something like (a + b) or similar.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAssuming that this is true, then the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\nFor each x, compute:\n\nif x is less than some threshold, then compute the number of reachable positions based on the specific constraints.\n\nOtherwise, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. Let me assume that once x is >= (a + b), then this holds. Then, for x < (a + b), we need to compute the number of positions manually.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nIn the first example, when x is 5, which is less than a + b (5+3=8), the frog can't reach all multiples. For example, 3 is a multiple of 1 but isn't reachable. However, when x is 8, can the frog reach 3?\n\nLet me think. Starting from 0, jump to 5 (x=8 allows that). Then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. So yes, when x is 8, the frog can reach 3. So for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of d.\n\nSo perhaps the threshold is a + b. But I need to confirm.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2, d=1. For x=4 (which is a + b = 5?), no. Wait, a=3, b=2, a + b =5. Let's take x=4. Can the frog reach 1?\n\nFrom 0, jump to 3. Then from 3, subtract 2 to get 1. Yes. So for x=4 (which is less than a + b=5), the frog can reach 1. Hmm, so maybe the threshold is lower.\n\nWait, but in this case, the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1) for x >= 1. So perhaps the threshold is not a + b.\n\nThis suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the problem in terms of the possible positions. The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and for which there exists some k such that k*a - l*b = pos, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, even if this equation holds, the frog needs to reach pos via a sequence of jumps that never goes out of bounds. But perhaps if x is large enough, this is possible.\n\nBut how to find for a given x, whether all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is >= max(a, b), then the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me take the first example where a=5, b=3. For x=5 (which is >= a=5 and >= b=3?), but in that case, the frog can't reach 3, which is a multiple of d=1. However, when x is 5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. So for x=5, it's not possible to reach all multiples. However, when x=6, can the frog reach 3?\n\nLet me think. From 0, jump to 5. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 5 to get 7 (but x=6, which is larger than 7? No, 7 is larger than x=6. So that's not allowed. So from 2, can't jump forward. So subtract 3 to get -1, which is invalid. So 2 can't reach anything else. So for x=6, the frog can't reach 3. But when x=7, the frog can reach 3 as shown earlier.\n\nSo the threshold seems to be higher than a + b. Or maybe the threshold is a * b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], and this happens when x >= (some value). But how to find that value?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Perhaps we need to find for a given x, the number of positions reachable is the number of multiples of d in [0, x], minus those positions that are not reachable due to the constraints of the path.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward and backward, but can't go beyond 0 or x, the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b (with integer coefficients), and are in [0, x]. However, the coefficients must be such that during the process of reaching the position, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nWait, but if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach any position that is k + n*(a + b), provided that those positions are within [0, x]. Because adding a and subtracting b gives a net change of a - b, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, adding a and then subtracting b gives a net change of a - b. But this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, once the frog can reach a position k, and the frog can move forward and backward, then it can reach any position that is congruent to k modulo d, provided that x is large enough. So, for example, if the frog can reach a position k, and can make steps that increase or decrease by (a + b) or something, then it can reach other positions.\n\nBut I'm stuck here. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of BFS. For a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached from 0 by any sequence of jumps (forward or backward) that stay within [0, x]. So, the maximum number of reachable positions is O(x), but for x up to 1e9, it's impossible to compute this for each x individually.\n\nThus, there must be a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can't make any forward or backward jumps. This happens when x < a and x < b. Then, the only reachable position is 0. So f(x) = 1.\n\nCase 2: The frog can make forward jumps but not backward. This happens when x >= a and x < b. For example, x = a. Then, the frog can jump to a, then from there, can't jump back (since a - b would be negative, assuming b > a). So the reachable positions are 0, a, a + a, ... as long as they are <= x. So the number of positions is floor(x / a) + 1. But since x < b, the frog can't make any backward jumps. However, this is only if the frog can't make any backward jumps. For example, if x >= a but x < b, then the frog can make forward jumps, but not backward.\n\nSimilarly, if x >= b but < a, then the frog can make backward jumps from 0? Wait, no. Because to make a backward jump, the frog has to be at position >= b. But initially, the frog is at 0. So it can't make any backward jumps. Thus, in this case, the frog can't make any jumps unless it can reach a position >=b via forward jumps. But if x < a, then the frog can't reach a position >=b.\n\nThus, this case is covered in case 1.\n\nSo, for case 2, the frog can make forward jumps but not backward. So the reachable positions are multiples of a up to x. So the count is floor(x / a) + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the frog can make forward and backward jumps? Like, x >= a and x >= b.\n\nIn this case, the frog can jump forward and backward. But what's the set of reachable positions?\n\nLet me think of the example where a=5, b=3, and x=5. As discussed earlier, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. Which is 3 positions. But according to the previous logic, if the frog can make forward jumps (since x >= a=5), and backward jumps (since x >= b=3). But how to model this?\n\nIn this case, the reachable positions are not just multiples of a or b, but combinations of both.\n\nThis suggests that when the frog can make both forward and backward jumps, the reachable positions are all multiples of d (gcd(a, b)) that are between 0 and x, and can be reached via some combination of steps that stay within [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this count?\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that once the frog can make both forward and backward jumps (i.e., x >= max(a, b)), then it can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. This would mean that for x >= max(a, b), f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nIn the first example, when x=5, which is equal to a=5 and b=3. But the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. However, floor(5/1)+1 = 6, which is not matching. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut when x=7, which is >= max(a, b) =5, the number of reachable positions is 8, which is floor(7/1)+1=8. So it matches. So why is x=5 not matching?\n\nAh, because x=5 is not large enough. So there's a threshold beyond which the frog can reach all multiples of d. But what is that threshold?\n\nIn the first example, for x=5, the frog can't reach 3, but for x=7, it can. So perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough to allow the frog to reach all multiples of d.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Suppose that the frog can make both forward and backward jumps. Then, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is at least (a + b) - something. Or perhaps the threshold is when x >= (a + b) - d.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x] if x is large enough. The question is, what is the minimal x for which this is true.\n\nThis is similar to the classic problem of finding the largest number that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b, but here it's a bit different.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the Bézout's identity. Any multiple of d can be written as k*a - l*b for some integers k, l >= 0. But the challenge is ensuring that during the journey, the frog doesn't go out of bounds.\n\nBut if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d by first moving forward enough times, then adjusting with backward steps.\n\nFor example, to reach a position k that is a multiple of d, the frog can first jump forward enough times to reach a position that is greater than or equal to k, and then jump backward to reach k.\n\nBut how to ensure that during this process, the frog doesn't go out of bounds?\n\nIf x is large enough, then this should be possible. For example, if x >= k + b, then the frog can jump forward to reach k + b, and then jump backward once to reach k.\n\nBut k can be any multiple of d up to x.\n\nSo the threshold for x is when x >= (some value) that allows the frog to perform such adjustments.\n\nLet me think: the minimal x that allows the frog to reach any multiple of d up to x is when x >= (a + b). Because for any k that is a multiple of d, the frog can reach it by first jumping forward to k + b (assuming k + b <= x), then jumping backward once to reach k. So if x >= k + b, then this is possible. But since k can be up to x, this requires that x >= x + b, which is impossible. So this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: For any multiple of d, say m, we can write m = p*a - q*b, where p and q are non-negative integers. Once the frog can reach p*a (which is m + q*b), then it can subtract q*b steps to reach m. But to do this, the frog must be able to reach p*a, which is m + q*b, and during the process, not exceed x.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible.\n\nAlternatively, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x]. Let's assume that once x >= a + b, this holds. Then, for x < a + b, we need to calculate manually.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nIn the first example, when x=5 (which is less than a + b=8), the frog cannot reach 3. But when x=8 (a + b=8), the frog can reach 3 as shown earlier. So the threshold seems to be a + b.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with another example.\n\nTake a=3, b=2. d=1. Let's say x=5, which is a + b = 5. Can the frog reach all multiples of d (which is all integers) in [0,5]?\n\nLet's see:\n\nPositions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nCan the frog reach 1?\n\nYes: 0 -> 3 (jump forward) -> 3-2=1 (jump backward).\n\nCan it reach 4?\n\nYes: 0 -> 3 -> 3+3=6 (but x=5, so this is invalid. So can't jump forward. So from 3, subtract 2 to get 1. From 1, jump forward to 4 (1+3=4 <=5). So yes.\n\nSo for x=5, which is a + b=5, the frog can reach all positions. So the hypothesis seems to hold.\n\nIn the previous example where x=5 and a=5, b=3, the threshold was x=7 (which is a + b - 1 = 5 + 3 - 1 =7). Let me check for x=8 (a + b=8).\n\nYes, for x=8, the frog can reach all multiples of d=1 in [0,8], which are 9 positions. And indeed, the example for x=7 has 8 positions, and x=8 would have 9.\n\nSo perhaps the threshold is x >= a + b. For x >= a + b, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < a + b, it's something else.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each x, compute:\n\nif x < min(a, b): f(x) = 1\n\nelse if x < a + b: compute f(x) manually (but how?)\n\nelse: f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1, where d = gcd(a, b)\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < a + b?\n\nBut given that a and b can be up to 1e5, and m up to 1e9, we can't precompute for all x < a + b for each test case. However, since a and b are up to 1e5, a + b is up to 2e5, which is manageable for each test case.\n\nSo the overall approach would be:\n\nFor each query, compute:\n\nd = gcd(a, b)\n\nif a == 0 and b == 0: but the problem states a and b are positive integers.\n\nNow, for the sum from x=0 to m of f(x):\n\nWe need to split the sum into two parts:\n\n1. For x < threshold (threshold = a + b), compute f(x) individually.\n\n2. For x >= threshold, compute f(x) as floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut what is the threshold? It's a + b.\n\nBut wait, what if a and b are not coprime? Let's take an example where d = 2, a=4, b=6. Then, d=2. The threshold would be a + b = 10. For x >= 10, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/2) + 1.\n\nBut for x < 10, what is f(x)?\n\nFor example, let's say x=6. The frog can jump forward to 4, then from 4 can jump forward to 8 (but x=6, so no). From 4, can jump back to 4-6 = -2 (invalid). So the only reachable positions are 0 and 4. So f(x) = 2.\n\nBut floor(x/d) + 1 = 6/2 +1 = 3+1=4. Which is not matching. Hence, the threshold is not a + b, but something else.\n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nIn this example, a=4, b=6, d=2. The frog can reach positions that are multiples of 2, but for x < threshold, it may not be able to reach all of them.\n\nBut what is the threshold for this case?\n\nLet me think. The frog can make forward jumps and backward jumps when x >= max(a, b) = 6.\n\nAt x=6, the frog can jump to 4 (0+4=4), and from 4 can jump to 4-6 = -2 (invalid). So the only reachable positions are 0 and 4. But the multiples of d=2 up to 6 are 0, 2, 4, 6. So why can't the frog reach 2 and 6?\n\nTo reach 2: from 0, can it jump to 4, then subtract 6? No, that would be -2. Can it jump to 0 + 4 = 4, then subtract 4 (but b=6, so no. Or can it jump to 0 - 6? No, since that's negative. So no way to reach 2.\n\nTo reach 6: jump forward twice. 0 +4 =4, then jump again to 8, which is beyond x=6. So no. So can't reach 6. Hence, for x=6, the reachable positions are 0 and 4. Hence, f(x) = 2.\n\nBut when x is increased to 8 (a + b = 10?), no, a + b is 10. So x=8 is less than 10.\n\nCan the frog reach 2 now?\n\nAt x=8, the frog can jump to 4, then from 4, jump to 4 + 4 = 8 (allowed). From 8, can it jump back by 6 to 2. Yes. So now, 2 is reachable. Also, from 8, can jump back to 2, then from 2, can jump forward to 6 (2+4=6), which is allowed. From 6, can jump back to 0. So for x=8, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. So that's 5 positions, which is floor(8/2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo for x=8 (which is less than a + b = 10), the frog can reach all multiples of d=2 up to x=8. So the threshold is not a + b, but something else.\n\nHmm. So what's the pattern here?\n\nIn this example, when x >= 2 * b (or some other value), the frog can reach all multiples of d.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x >= (a * b)/d. Or some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog needing to be able to reach a position that allows it to subtract b and get to another position.\n\nFor example, to reach a position m, the frog must be able to reach m + b, then subtract b to get m. So for m to be reachable, m + b must be reachable. But how to ensure that.\n\nBut this seems recursive.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x for which all multiples of d up to x are reachable is when x >= a + b - d. Or something similar.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b`, but it cannot step outside the interval [0, x] for any given x. We need to compute the sum of these reachable positions for all values from 0 to m.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is derived from Bézout's identity, which states that any linear combination of `a` and `b` is a multiple of their gcd.\n2. **Threshold Analysis**: For sufficiently large x (specifically, when x is greater than or equal to `a + b`), the frog can reach all multiples of the gcd within the range [0, x]. For smaller values of x, we need to manually calculate the reachable positions.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each query, we split the calculation into two parts:\n   - **Small x Values**: Directly compute the reachable positions for x values less than `a + b`.\n   - **Large x Values**: Use the formula based on the gcd to efficiently compute the number of reachable positions for larger x values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        threshold = a + b\n        total = 0\n        \n        # Compute sum for x < threshold\n        max_x_small = min(m, threshold - 1)\n        if max_x_small >= 0:\n            # For each x from 0 to max_x_small, compute f(x)\n            # But how?\n            # We can simulate BFS for each x up to threshold-1\n            # However, since threshold is up to 2*1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, it's manageable\n            # Precompute for all x in [0, threshold-1]\n            # But for each x, how to compute f(x)?\n            # For x < a and x < b: f(x) = 1\n            # Else, simulate BFS for each x\n            # However, since threshold is small, we can process each x in this range\n            \n            # Precompute for all x from 0 to threshold-1\n            # Create a list of f(x) for x in 0 to threshold-1\n            # But for each x, simulate BFS\n            # However, for m up to 1e9, this could be expensive if threshold is large, but given that a and b are up to 1e5, threshold is up to 2e5, which is acceptable\n            \n            # So for each x in 0 to max_x_small:\n            # Compute f(x)\n            # But how?\n            # For each x, perform BFS or use a set to track reachable positions\n            # However, since threshold is small (up to 2e5), and m can be up to 1e9, this is feasible\n            \n            # But for each x, we need to compute f(x).
