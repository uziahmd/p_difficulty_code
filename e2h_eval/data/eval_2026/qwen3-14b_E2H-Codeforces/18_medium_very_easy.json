The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. We need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m and sum them all. The challenge is to find an efficient way to calculate this sum, especially since m can be up to 1e9, which means we can't compute each f(x) individually in O(1) time or something like that.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without ever stepping outside [0, x]. So the frog can make any sequence of jumps as long as during the process, all positions are within 0 to x.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions?\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the positions are determined by some linear combinations. But with constraints on the range.\n\nWait, but the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So for example, when x is small, maybe the frog can't even make a single jump. Like if a is larger than x, then the frog can't jump forward. Similarly for backward jumps.\n\nBut the key here is to find all positions that can be reached through some combination of adding a and subtracting b, such that during the entire journey, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern or mathematical condition that determines which positions are reachable.\n\nLet me consider the case where the frog can move freely. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the frog can move in steps of a and -b. So the reachable positions (without constraints) are those that are multiples of the gcd of a and b. However, the constraints here are that during the jumps, the frog must stay within [0, x].\n\nBut how does that affect the reachable positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions reachable are all numbers that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and also that the path from 0 to that position doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nBut that seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of possible positions that can be reached given the constraints.\n\nAnother approach: For a given x, the frog can reach positions that are reachable via some combination of adding a and subtracting b, but ensuring that during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut considering that the frog can make multiple jumps, perhaps the set of positions reachable for a given x is all positions that are in the range [0, x], and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path remains valid.\n\nBut how can we find this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the frog can reach any position that is reachable through some sequence of steps, but during the steps, the frog never leaves [0, x]. So for example, if the frog wants to reach position k, there must be a way to get there by adding a's and subtracting b's, such that all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the minimal case. Suppose the frog can only jump forward (like when b is zero, but the problem says b is positive). Wait, no. The problem says that a and b are positive integers.\n\nSo the frog can jump forward by a, or backward by b. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nLet me consider the case when x is large enough that the frog can move freely. For example, when x is large enough that the frog can perform any necessary steps. Then, the reachable positions would be all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. But since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d and are in the range [0, x].\n\nBut how to determine when x is large enough for that?\n\nBut for our problem, the x varies from 0 to m. So for each x, we need to compute how many positions are reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(some small function) per test case approach.\n\nLet me think of the example given in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 7 5 3\n\nIn this case, a=5, b=3.\n\nFor x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5. But wait, according to the note, f(5)=3. Oh, that suggests that there are three positions. Let me check.\n\nWait, the note says f(5) is 3. How?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. From 0, it can jump to 5 (since 0+5=5 is within [0,5]). Also, can it jump to -3? No, because that's outside the interval. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0 and 5. But the note says f(5)=3. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says for the first example, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8. Let me see why.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can make multiple jumps. For example, for x=5:\n\nFrom 0, jump to 5. Then, from 5, can it jump back by 3? 5-3=2. Which is within [0,5]. So now the frog can reach 2. Then from 2, can it jump forward by 5? 2+5=7, which is beyond x=5. So that's not allowed. Or can it jump back by 3? 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 5, 2. Hence f(5)=3. Oh right! So the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2.\n\nSo how do we model this? It seems that the reachable positions depend on being able to reach them through some sequence of jumps, while staying within [0, x].\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a mathematical way to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote g = d.\n\nSince the frog can add a and subtract b, any position reachable must be a multiple of g. Because a and b are multiples of g, so any combination of steps will be a multiple of g. Therefore, all reachable positions are multiples of g. So for any x, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of g in [0, x], but only those that can be reached through the allowed jumps.\n\nBut how to find which multiples of g are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is large enough, all multiples of g in [0, x] are reachable. But for smaller x, some may not be.\n\nBut what's the condition for x being large enough?\n\nLet me think about the problem. For example, suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g and is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is sufficiently large.\n\nBut how large is \"sufficiently large\"?\n\nThis depends on the values of a and b. For example, in the first sample, a=5 and b=3. Their gcd is 1. So all integers are reachable once x is large enough. But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, etc.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all multiples of g in [0, x] are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled using the concept of the \"coin problem\". For two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab -a -b. But that's for the case where you can only add steps, not subtract. But here, the problem allows both adding and subtracting steps, but with constraints on the path.\n\nBut perhaps this is not directly applicable.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the frog can move forward by a and backward by b, perhaps the set of positions reachable (without constraints) is all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, the problem requires that during the jumps, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g, and is between 0 and x, provided that x is at least some value. Let me think about the first example again. For x=5, the positions are 0, 2, 5. For x=7, the note says f(7)=8. So 0, 2, 5, 7 (from 0+5=5, then 5+5=10 which is beyond x=7. Wait no. So how does the frog reach 7?\n\nWait, maybe for x=7, the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 2, 7 (from 5 + 2 steps?), but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 7 by jumping forward twice: 0 +5 =5, then from 5, can't jump forward again (5+5=10>7), but can jump back by 3 to reach 2. Then from 2, can jump forward by 5 to reach 7 (since 2+5=7 is within [0,7]). So yes, 7 is reachable. So for x=7, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, and others?\n\nLet me think: From 7, can the frog jump back by 3 to reach 4. Is 4 reachable?\n\nYes. So from 7, subtract 3 to get 4. Then from 4, can you jump back by 3 again to get 1. Then from 1, can you jump forward by 5 to get 6. Then from 6, subtract 3 to get 3. Then from 3, subtract 3 to get 0. So the positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are all reachable? But the note says f(7) is 8. Which matches that count. So in this case, all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable, except for 0? No, wait, 0 is included. So 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7: 8 positions. So yes.\n\nSo for x=7, which is larger than a and b, and since the gcd of a and b is 1, all positions are reachable. So the sum for x >= some value is x+1.\n\nBut how to find for each x, the number of reachable positions.\n\nSo the key idea is that once x is large enough, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/g) + 1 (since all multiples of g in [0, x] are reachable). But for smaller x, it's less.\n\nBut what's the threshold for x where all multiples of g are reachable?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Since the frog can move forward and backward, but the path must stay within [0, x].\n\nSo, for example, to reach a certain position k, the frog needs to have a path that allows it to get there without stepping outside the interval. For example, if k is a multiple of g and is within [0, x], then maybe there's a way to reach it once x is large enough.\n\nBut how to find that threshold.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime (g=1). Then, once x is greater than or equal to a + b, then all numbers can be reached. Wait, but in the first example, a=5, b=3. So a + b = 8. But in the sample, for x=7, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to 7. Which is less than a + b. So that theory is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the threshold is (a*b) - a - b, but that's the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, since in our case, the frog can subtract steps, perhaps the threshold is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough that the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x]. For example, once x is at least (a + b), then the frog can reach any multiple of g.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of g that is between 0 and x, provided that x is at least the maximum of a and b. But in the first example, when x=5, which is equal to a, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (which is 5-3). Then, for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. But for x=5, 5 is equal to a. So that's not sufficient.\n\nAnother thought: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g, and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the path, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this. It's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g and is in [0, x], and also can be written as some combination of a and b steps, but with the ability to move back and forth.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x]. The question is, what is that x.\n\nLet me think about the minimal x where the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x]. Let's denote that x as T.\n\nOnce x >= T, then for any x' >= T, f(x') = floor(x'/g) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute T.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5 and b=3. The g is 1. So T is 7. Because for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. So T is 7. How to compute T?\n\nBut how to find T for general a and b.\n\nAnother example: if a=1, b=1. Then g=1. T would be 0, since the frog can reach any position. Because from 0, you can jump to 1, then to 2, etc. But with x=0, the frog can only be at 0. So T is 0?\n\nBut for x=0, the frog can't make any jumps. So for x >= 0, the frog can reach all positions in [0, x], because it can just jump forward (but for x >= 1, but if a=1, then yes).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe we can find T as the maximum between a and b, but that's probably not correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of g that is >= 0 and <=x, provided that x is at least (some value). Let's assume that once x is large enough that the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x], then the answer for x is (x//g + 1). Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, whether it is >= T, and if so, then f(x) is x//g +1. Otherwise, it's something else.\n\nBut how to find T.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: For the frog to be able to reach any multiple of g in [0, x], the frog must be able to reach every multiple of g in that interval. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k+a (if within x) by jumping forward. Similarly, if it can reach k, then it can reach k-b (if within x) by jumping back.\n\nBut this suggests that once the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to some value, then it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a's.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of g in [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g, and is in [0, x], as long as there exists a way to reach it by moving forward and backward steps, and during the movement, never leaving [0, x].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the case when a and b are coprime. Then, the minimal x where all positions are reachable is (a + b - 1). Wait, in the first sample, a=5 and b=3. a + b -1 = 7, which matches the sample where x=7 allows all positions from 0 to 7 to be reachable.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3. Then, their gcd is 1. The minimal x where all positions are reachable would be 2+3-1=4. Let's see:\n\nAt x=4, can the frog reach 1?\n\nYes: from 0, jump forward to 2, then jump back by 3 to reach -1 (invalid). No. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, for x=4, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5 (but 5 is beyond x=4). So no. So how to reach 1?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm wrong about the minimal x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is (a*b) - a - b. But that's the largest number that cannot be formed with non-negative steps. But again, since the frog can subtract steps, maybe this is not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where all positions are reachable is max(a, b). Let's take the first sample where a=5, b=3. max(a,b)=5. For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. But not 1, 3, 4. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem from the perspective of dynamic programming. For a given x, the frog can reach certain positions. But for large x (up to 1e9), we can't simulate this for each x. So we need a mathematical formula.\n\nBut what's the pattern of f(x)?\n\nSuppose that after a certain point, the frog can reach all multiples of g in [0, x], and thus f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1. Before that point, it's less.\n\nSo the problem becomes:\n\nFind the sum for x from 0 to m of f(x), where for x < T, f(x) is some value, and for x >= T, it's floor(x/g) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute T and the sum for x < T.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the minimal x such that x >= a and x >= b, and x >= (a - b) or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x] if and only if x >= (a + b) - g. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g and is between 0 and x, provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to move back and forth. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k + a (if that's within x), and also k - b (if that's within x). So once the frog has reached some positions, it can expand further.\n\nBut for this to work, the frog needs to be able to reach all positions in the range [0, x], but how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to the BFS problem where the frog can move in steps of +a and -b, but constrained to [0, x]. However, since x can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x. But perhaps for all x >= some value, the number of reachable positions is (x // g) + 1. So we need to find for each x, whether it is in the 'large' region or not.\n\nBut how to find that 'large' region.\n\nLet me think about the following: once the frog can reach positions 0 and a, then it can reach a + a = 2a, and so on. But if the frog can also reach positions that are lower, like a - b, then it can reach more positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod g, and is in the range [0, x], provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to reach that position through some combination of steps. The minimal x where this is possible for all multiples of g in [0, x] is the minimal x such that x >= (a * b) / g. Or something like that.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let me think of the sample case where a=5 and b=3. The g is 1. The minimal x where all positions are reachable is 7. How is this related to a and b?\n\nWell, 5 + 3 = 8. 7 is one less than that. Maybe the threshold is a + b - g?\n\nIn this case, a + b - g = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7. Which matches the sample. Another example: a=2, b=3. Then g=1. Threshold would be 2+3-1=4. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nFor x=4, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 4?\n\nLet's see:\n\nPosition 0: yes.\n\nPosition 1: Can the frog reach it?\n\nFrom 0, jump to 2 (a=2). From 2, jump back by 3: 2-3 = -1 (invalid). So no. Alternatively, is there another way?\n\nWhat if the frog jumps to 2, then to 4 (add a again). From 4, subtract b=3 to reach 1. Yes! So for x=4, the frog can reach 1. So yes. Then for 2: yes. 3: from 0, can it reach 3? From 0, jump forward to 2, then forward to 4. From 4, subtract 3 to reach 1. From 1, can't jump forward (1+2=3, which is within x=4). So yes. So 3 is reachable. 4 is reachable. So all positions from 0 to 4 are reachable. Hence, for x=4, the threshold is met.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the threshold T is (a + b - g), where g is gcd(a, b).\n\nSo for any x >= T, the number of reachable positions is (x // g) + 1. And for x < T, it's something else.\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, then we can proceed.\n\nNow, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute for each x in 0..m:\n\nif x >= T: f(x) = (x // g) + 1\n\nelse: compute f(x) as the number of reachable positions, which depends on x.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < T.\n\nBut what is T? Let's define T = a + b - g.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, g=1. T=5+3-1=7. Which matches. In the second sample input, the input is 1000000000 1 2019. Here, a=1, b=2019. g = gcd(1, 2019) = 1. So T = 1 + 2019 -1 = 2019. For x >= 2019, f(x) = x//1 + 1 = x+1. But the note says that in the second example, f(i) = i+1 for all i. That implies that T is 0, but according to the calculation, T=2019. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, the second example input is m=1e9, a=1, b=2019. The output is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which suggests that for all x >=0, f(x) = x+1. Which implies that T is 0. So our previous hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo why is that? Because for a=1 and b=2019, the frog can reach any position. For example, starting from 0, it can jump forward by 1 to reach any position. Because the frog can keep jumping forward by 1. So even for x=0, the frog can only reach 0. For x=1, it can reach 0 and 1. For x=2, 0, 1, 2, etc. So in this case, T is 0. Because for x >=0, the frog can reach all positions. But according to our previous formula, T would be a + b - g = 1 + 2019 - 1 = 2019. Which is not correct.\n\nSo our previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the threshold T depends on whether a or b is 0. Wait, but a and b are positive integers. So this indicates that the previous approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps T is the maximum between a and b. For example, in the case where a=1, b=2019, T would be 2019. But the frog can reach all positions for x >=0. So that's not correct either.\n\nSo clearly, the previous idea of T = a + b - g is not universally applicable. Need to rethink.\n\nLet me think again. The key is to find for each x, the number of positions reachable under the constraints. How?\n\nLet me consider the case when a=1. Then, the frog can always jump forward by 1. So for any x, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Because it can just jump forward step by step. Similarly, if b=1, the frog can reach any position by jumping forward and backward as needed. So in these cases, for any x, f(x) = x+1.\n\nSo the presence of a=1 or b=1 allows the frog to reach all positions for any x.\n\nSo, the problem depends on whether the frog can reach all positions once x is large enough. This depends on whether the frog can reach any position in the range [0, x] through some combination of steps.\n\nLet me think of the following: if the frog can reach any position in [0, x], then for x' >=x, it can reach all positions in [0, x'].\n\nBut how to determine if the frog can reach all positions in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this for general a and b.\n\nLet me think of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of g, and for those positions, if the frog can reach them, then it can reach other positions by adding a's or subtracting b's. But this is only possible if the frog can reach a position that allows it to generate all other positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod g. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k + a (mod g), but since a is a multiple of g, k +a is congruent to k mod g. So all reachable positions are congruent to 0 mod g.\n\nSo for any x, the maximum number of positions the frog can reach is floor(x/g) + 1. But this is only achievable if the frog can reach all multiples of g in [0, x].\n\nSo the problem reduces to determining, for each x, how many multiples of g are in [0, x] and are reachable.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nNow, the key observation is that if the frog can reach at least one position in each residue class mod g, but wait no. All reachable positions are congruent to 0 mod g.\n\nSo the problem is to find for each x, the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that are reachable.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that are reachable.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: for the frog to reach a multiple of g, say k, it must be possible to reach it through some sequence of steps, without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as follows: for each multiple of g, k, the frog can reach it if and only if k is >=0, <=x, and there exists some integer t such that k = t*a - s*b, where t and s are non-negative integers, and during the process of reaching k, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut again, this seems hard to model.\n\nBut perhaps, for the frog to reach k, it's sufficient that k is a multiple of g and k is >=0 and <=x, and there exists some way to reach it, regardless of the path. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any multiple of g in [0, x] if and only if x >= k and x >= (k - a) + b, or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: if the frog can reach some position k, then it can reach k + a, provided that k +a <=x. Similarly, if it can reach k, it can reach k -b, provided that k -b >=0.\n\nSo this suggests that once the frog can reach some position, it can expand to other positions by adding a or subtracting b.\n\nBut for this to generate all multiples of g in [0, x], the frog must be able to reach a certain base set of positions.\n\nLet me think of the case when the frog can reach 0 and a. Then, it can reach 0 + a = a, then a + a = 2a, etc., as long as they are <=x. Similarly, from a, it can subtract b to reach a -b, as long as it's >=0.\n\nSo if the frog can reach 0 and a, and a -b >=0, then it can reach a -b. Then from a -b, it can add a to reach a -b +a = 2a -b, and so on.\n\nBut how to ensure that all multiples of g are reachable.\n\nThis seems like a BFS problem, but for large x.\n\nBut for our purposes, perhaps we can find that once x is large enough that the frog can reach all multiples of g in [0, x], then for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1.\n\nBut how to find T.\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer, provided that x is large enough. What is the minimum x where this is true?\n\nIn the first sample, a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. The minimum x is 7. For x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nHow to generalize this.\n\nIn the case where a and b are coprime, the minimum x where all positions are reachable is (a + b - 1). This is because, according to the coin problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab -a -b. But since the frog can also subtract steps, this might change things.\n\nBut in the case where the frog can subtract steps, the threshold is much lower.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the frog can reach any position >=0 by using the following approach: if the frog can reach a position k, and k >=b, then it can jump back by b to reach k -b. If k -b >=0, and this allows the frog to reach lower positions.\n\nBut this suggests that once the frog can reach a position >=b, then it can reach positions down to 0 by repeatedly subtracting b. However, this requires that the frog can reach positions >=b.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, if the frog can reach a position that is >=b and <=x, then it can reach any position in [0, x] by subtracting b steps as needed. But this is only possible if the frog can reach such a position.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nThis line of thinking suggests that the threshold T is max(a, b). Let's see:\n\nIn the first sample, max(a, b) is 5. But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Not all positions. So this is not sufficient.\n\nBut for x=7, which is a + b -1 = 5+3-1=7, the frog can reach all positions. So perhaps the threshold is a + b - g, where g is gcd(a, b).\n\nBut earlier example with a=1, b=2019, g=1: T = 1 + 2019 -1 = 2019. But for x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1. For x=2, 0,1,2. So it seems that for any x >=0, the frog can reach all positions. So this suggests that the formula is incorrect.\n\nSo why is this happening? Because when a=1, the frog can reach any position by jumping forward step by step. So regardless of x, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. So in this case, T is 0.\n\nSo the formula T = a + b - g is not universally applicable. It depends on whether one of the steps (a or b) is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] for x >= some value, which depends on whether a or b is 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nLet me think of the following: if either a or b is 1, then the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] for any x >=0. Because if a=1, the frog can reach any position by jumping forward 1 step at a time. Similarly, if b=1, the frog can reach any position by jumping forward and backward as needed.\n\nSo, in this case, for any x, f(x) = x+1.\n\nSimilarly, if the gcd(a, b) is 1 and either a or b is 1, then the same applies.\n\nSo, the problem can be divided into cases:\n\nCase 1: g = gcd(a, b) > 1. In this case, the frog can only reach multiples of g. So for any x, f(x) is the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that are reachable.\n\nCase 2: g = 1. In this case, the frog can potentially reach all integers in [0, x] if x is large enough. But how to determine when that is.\n\nSo, for case 1, we need to find the number of reachable multiples of g in [0, x]. For case 2, we need to find whether x is large enough to allow reaching all multiples of g (which is all integers).\n\nBut how to handle case 2.\n\nLet me think of case 2: g=1. So the frog can reach any integer in [0, x] if x is large enough. What's that x?\n\nIf either a=1 or b=1, then x can be 0. Otherwise, it's a + b - 1.\n\nSo, for example, if a=5, b=3, and neither is 1, then the threshold is 5+3-1=7. For x >=7, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut if a=2 and b=3, then threshold is 2+3-1=4. For x >=4, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut if a=2 and b=5, then threshold is 2+5-1=6. Let's see for x=6.\n\nCan the frog reach 1?\n\nFrom 0, jump to 2, then to 4, then to 6. From 6, subtract 5 to get 1. Yes. So 1 is reachable.\n\nSo for x=6, all positions are reachable.\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nThus, the threshold T for case 2 is:\n\nif a == 1 or b == 1: T = 0\n\nelse: T = a + b - 1\n\nSo, combining all this, the plan is:\n\nCompute g = gcd(a, b).\n\nIf g > 1:\n\n   Then, the frog can only reach multiples of g. So, for each x, f(x) is the number of multiples of g in [0, x] that are reachable. But how to compute this.\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable multiples of g for x < T.\n\nBut for g > 1, since the frog can only reach multiples of g, and since the steps are a and b (both multiples of g), we can divide everything by g. Let me define a' = a/g, b' = b",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to a given value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The key insight is that the reachable positions are determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If the gcd is `g`, then all reachable positions must be multiples of `g`.\n\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For the frog to reach all multiples of `g` within a range `[0, x]`, we need to determine a threshold `T`. If either `a` or `b` is 1, the threshold is 0 because the frog can always reach any position. Otherwise, the threshold is `a + b - gcd(a, b)`.\n\n3. **Summing Values**: For each integer `x` from 0 to `m`, we calculate the number of reachable positions. If `x` is greater than or equal to the threshold `T`, the number of reachable positions is `x // g + 1`. For values below the threshold, we simulate the reachable positions using a breadth-first search (BFS).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_div = a // g\n    b_div = b // g\n\n    if g == 1:\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            # All positions are reachable for any x\n            total = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n            print(total)\n            return\n        else:\n            T = a + b - 1\n    else:\n        # For g > 1, reduce the problem to a' and b' with gcd 1\n        # But since the reachable positions are multiples of g\n        # We need to compute for each x the number of reachable multiples of g\n        # So we can scale down the problem by dividing a and b by g\n        # And then treat it as the case where the gcd is 1\n        # Let's redefine a and b as a' and b'\n        a_new = a // g\n        b_new = b // g\n        if a_new == 1 or b_new == 1:\n            # All multiples of g are reachable\n            total = (m // g + 1) * (m + 1) // 2\n            print(total)\n            return\n        else:\n            T = a_new + b_new - 1\n            T *= g  # scale back to original problem\n\n    # Now, handle the case where g is 1 and T is a + b - 1, or similar\n    # Or for g > 1 and T is scaled accordingly\n    # Compute the sum for x from 0 to m\n\n    # Compute the sum for x < T\n    max_x_small = min(m, T - 1)\n    # For x >= T, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/g) + 1\n\n    # First, compute the sum for x >= T\n    # The count is sum_{x=T}^m (floor(x/g) + 1)\n    # Which is sum_{x=T}^m floor(x/g) + (m - T + 1)\n\n    # Compute sum_floor = sum_{x=T}^m floor(x/g)\n    # Let's compute it as follows:\n    # For each k, find how many x in [T, m] have floor(x/g) = k\n    # Alternatively, use formula: sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/g) = (n//g)*(n//g -1)*g//2 + (n%g +1)*(n//g)\n    # But we need sum from T to m.\n\n    def sum_floor(n, g):\n        # returns sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/g)\n        q = n // g\n        r = n % g\n        return q * (q - 1) * g // 2 + (r + 1) * q\n\n    sum_total = 0\n\n    if g == 1:\n        # All positions are reachable for x >= T\n        # But what if T is larger than m?\n        if T <= m:\n            sum_floor_high = sum_floor(m, 1) - sum_floor(T - 1, 1)\n            count_high = m - T + 1\n            sum_total = sum_floor_high + count_high\n        else:\n            sum_total = 0\n    else:\n        # For g > 1, the number of reachable positions for x >= T is (x//g) + 1\n        if T <= m:\n            sum_floor_high = sum_floor(m, g) - sum_floor(T - 1, g)\n            count_high = m - T + 1\n            sum_total = sum_floor_high + count_high\n        else:\n            sum_total = 0\n\n    # Now compute the sum for x from 0 to max_x_small\n    # For this, we need to find f(x) for x in 0..max_x_small\n\n    # To compute f(x), we can use BFS for each x up to T-1\n    # However, since T can be up to a + b - 1, which is up to 2e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5)\n    # This is feasible.\n\n    # We can precompute for all x up to T-1 the value of f(x)\n    # But since T can be up to 2e5, and m can be up to 1e9, but for x up to T-1, we need to process each x.\n\n    # However, for each x, we need to find the number of reachable positions up to x.\n    # But doing this naively for each x would be too slow.
