The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. The goal is to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the frog moves. The frog starts at 0. From any position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But it can't go outside [0, x]. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x directly. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, maybe there's some periodicity or pattern based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b?\n\nWait, but the frog can only make jumps in certain ways. Let me think: the frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of a and b, but with some constraints. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is gcd(a, b). Because any combination of adding a and subtracting b would result in multiples of d. But since the frog starts at 0, which is a multiple of d, all reachable positions must be multiples of d. \n\nSo first, let's compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. But wait, what if a and b are not coprime? For example, if a=5, b=3, their gcd is 1. So any integer can be reached? Wait no, because the frog can't jump backwards beyond 0. So even though the linear combinations can reach any integer, the constraints of staying within [0, x] may prevent that.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, provided that they are within the allowed range. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog being able to reach any position that is a multiple of d, but also depends on the ability to move forward and backward. However, since the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b, maybe the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d and can be expressed as some combination of steps. \n\nBut perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering the case where the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and greater than or equal to zero, but within some constraints based on the maximum steps.\n\nWait, but the frog can't go below 0. So for example, suppose d is 1. Then, the frog can reach any position that is non-negative and can be formed by adding a's and subtracting b's. But how?\n\nLet me take the example given in the first input. The example is m=7, a=5, b=3. The output sum is 19. For x=5, f(5)=3. The positions are 0,5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Then for x=7, f(7)=8. The positions would be 0, 2, 5, 7 (from 5+2?), but wait, how do you reach 7? Let me see:\n\nStarting at 0, the frog can jump +a (5) to reach 5. From 5, it can jump +a to 10 (but x is 7, so that's invalid). Or jump -b (3) to 2. From 2, it can jump +a to 7. So yes, 7 is reachable. Then from 7, can you jump back? Well, if x is 7, then jumping back from 7 would be 7-3=4. So 4 is reachable. Then from 4, you can jump +a to 9 (invalid), or -b to 1. So 1 is reachable. From 1, you can jump +a to 6 (since 1+5=6). So 6 is reachable. From 6, you can jump +a to 11 (invalid) or -b to 3. Then 3 is reachable. From 3, you can jump +a to 8 (invalid) or -b to 0. So the positions reachable when x is 7 are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions. So f(7) is 8.\n\nSo for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. So how does that relate to the parameters a and b?\n\nThe key seems to be that once the frog can reach positions up to some value, it can reach more positions by adding a's and subtracting b's. But the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x, and can't go below 0.\n\nBut how to model this for general a and b?\n\nAnother observation: since the frog can jump forward a steps or backward b steps, but cannot go below 0 or above x. So for a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be formed by sequences of adding a and subtracting b, such that all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nBut for large x, perhaps there's a way to model the reachable positions as all numbers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a, b), and also satisfy some other condition.\n\nWait, but in the first example, d is gcd(5,3)=1. So all integers are allowed. However, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (from 5-3), and then from 2, adding 5 would get to 7 (which is beyond x=5, so not allowed). So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. So three positions. Which matches the sample. So even though d=1, the positions are not all numbers between 0 and x, but only those that can be formed via the allowed steps.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the problem is similar to the classic coin problem, but with the twist of being able to subtract. But since the frog can jump forward and backward, perhaps the reachable positions are those that are >=0, and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But also, the path to reach them must not go out of the [0,x] interval. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (since d divides a and b), and also can be written as some combination of steps. But again, how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the frog can move in both directions. Suppose that after some steps, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and lies within [0, x], provided that x is sufficiently large. But for small x, it might not be possible.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to find for each x, the number of reachable positions. However, given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(some small function) per test case approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the possible reachable positions. Let me first compute d = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. Because each step adds a or subtracts b, which are multiples of d. Therefore, all reachable positions are multiples of d. Thus, for any x, the maximum possible positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0, d, 2d, ... up to floor(x/d)*d). But this is only if all these positions are reachable. However, in reality, some positions may not be reachable because of the constraints of the movement.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, d=1. So floor(x/d) +1 is x+1. But for x=5, the answer is 3, not 6. So clearly, there's a discrepancy here. Hence, my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nSo why can't the frog reach all multiples of d? Because the movement is constrained. For instance, in the first sample, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, etc. But for x=5, the positions 0, 2, 5 are reachable. However, 1, 3, 4 are not multiples of d (d=1, so all are multiples). But why can't they be reached?\n\nAh, because the frog can only move by adding a or subtracting b. So the frog can reach positions that are reachable by some combination of adding a's and subtracting b's. However, the problem is that the frog can't reach certain positions even if they are multiples of d. For example, in the first sample, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4 (from 7-3), 1 (from 4-3?), etc. But for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. How do we get 2? It's 5-3. So 2 is a multiple of d=1. But why can't the frog reach 1? Because to get to 1, you need to have some combination like 5-3* something. Let's see: 5 - 3*1 = 2, 5 -3*2 = -1 which is invalid. So can't reach 1. How else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach positions that are >=0 and can be written as (a*k - b*l), where k and l are non-negative integers. So for example, in the first case, 1 can't be written as 5k -3l for non-negative integers k and l. Let's see:\n\nLooking for 5k -3l =1. Trying k=1: 5 -3l=1 → 3l=4 → no. k=2: 10-3l=1 → 3l=9 → l=3. So 5*2 -3*3=10-9=1. Oh right! So that's possible. But how does the frog reach 1? Because the path would involve jumping forward twice (to 10), then subtracting 3 three times (to 10-3*3=1). But during that process, the frog would have to pass through positions like 10, 7, 4, 1. However, if x is 5, then during the journey, the frog can't go beyond x. So in this case, when x is 5, the frog can't reach 1 because to get there, it would have to jump to 10 first, which is outside of x=5. Therefore, even though 1 is a possible value of a*k -b*l, the frog can't reach it when x is 5.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for each x, find the number of positions that are multiples of d (since d divides a and b) and can be reached by some sequence of jumps that never go outside [0, x].\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is within [0, x], and also satisfies that the position is >= (some minimal value). But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the frog's ability to reach positions once it can reach some base positions. For example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then by adding a's, it can reach higher positions. But since the frog can also subtract b's, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions beyond that, as long as they are multiples of d and within x.\n\nWait, but how? Let's say the frog can reach position k. Then, from k, it can jump to k + a. If k + a <=x, then it can reach that. Similarly, from k, it can jump to k -b, but that has to be >=0. So perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate more positions by adding a's and subtracting b's, but this depends on the values of a and b.\n\nBut this feels like a BFS problem. However, since m can be up to 1e9, doing BFS for each x is impossible. So we need a way to find for all x, the count of reachable positions.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Suppose that the frog can reach all positions >= some value S, which is a multiple of d. Then, for x >= S, the number of reachable positions would be floor(x/d) + 1 minus the number of positions below S that are not reachable. But how to find S?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0, and can be written as k*a - l*b where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process of reaching that position, all intermediate steps are within [0, x]. However, this seems too abstract.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime. Let's take a=5, b=3. Then, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of 1 (so all integers). But for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. For x=7, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. So for x >= some value, the frog can reach all positions. For example, when x is 7, the frog can reach 1, which is 5*2 -3*3 = 10-9=1. But to reach 1, the frog would have to go through 5, then 10 (but that's beyond x=7?), but no, in the example, x=7 allows reaching 1. How?\n\nWait, in the example where x=7, the frog can reach 1. How?\n\nThe path would be 0 -> 5 (jump +a) -> 5-3=2 (jump -b) -> 2+5=7 (jump +a) -> 7-3=4 (jump -b) -> 4-3=1 (jump -b). All these positions (0,5,2,7,4,1) are within [0,7]. So yes, the frog can reach 1. So for x=7, the frog can reach 1. So for x >= 7, maybe all positions can be reached.\n\nBut how to determine when the frog can reach all positions >= some value.\n\nThis seems similar to the Frobenius problem. The Frobenius number for two coprime integers a and b is ab -a -b. But this is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can subtract b steps. So the problem is different. But perhaps there's a similar concept here.\n\nIn our case, the frog can reach any number that is a linear combination of a and -b, with non-negative coefficients. So the numbers that can be expressed as (a * k) - (b * l), where k and l are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to numbers that are >=0 and can be written as a*k - b*l.\n\nBut since a and b are coprime, the set of such numbers includes all integers greater than or equal to (some value). For example, in the case of a=5, b=3, the Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. So according to the Frobenius problem, numbers larger than 7 can be expressed as combinations of 5 and 3. However, in our case, the frog can reach 1, which is less than 7. So this suggests that the Frobenius problem isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all numbers >= (something) once x is large enough. For example, in the case of a=5 and b=3, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions >= some value. But how?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog can jump forward by a or backward by b. So, once the frog can reach a position k, it can reach k+a (if it's within [0, x]) and k -b (if it's >=0). So, for example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, etc., as long as they are within x. Also, from k, it can reach k -b, and from there, k -b +a, etc.\n\nSo, if the frog can reach a position that is >= b, then it can keep subtracting b until it reaches a position that is less than b. But since the frog can also add a's, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain range of positions, it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the frog can reach some position s. Then, from s, it can reach s + a, s + 2a, etc. Also, from s, it can reach s -b, s -2b, etc., as long as they are >=0. So, if the frog can reach a position s such that s >= b, then from s, the frog can reach s -b, and then from there, add a's. This seems to suggest that once the frog can reach positions in a certain range, it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0, and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and -b with non-negative coefficients. Let's denote that the set of such positions is R. Once x is large enough, the number of positions in R that are <=x is floor(x/d) + 1 (since all multiples of d are in R). But for smaller x, it's less.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of elements in R that are <=x and >=0.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Let's assume that. Then, R is the set of all integers >=0 that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k, l are non-negative integers.\n\nWhat is the structure of R?\n\nFor example, with a=5, b=3. The numbers in R include:\n\n0 (0*5 -0*3)\n5 (1*5 -0*3)\n2 (1*5 -1*3)\n7 (1*5 + 1*5 - 1*3 = 2*5 - 3*1 = 10-3=7)\netc.\n\nBut how to find all numbers that can be represented as such?\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a's. But to reach those positions, the frog must have a way to get there without going out of bounds.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model this as follows: For the frog to reach a position x, it must be possible to reach it via a series of steps that don't go out of [0, x]. But since the frog can jump forward and backward, perhaps the minimal steps to reach a position are not important, but whether it's possible to reach it at all.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that is >= (some minimal value). For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, say, s, then all positions >= s can be reached by adding a's. However, this depends on whether a and b are coprime.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0, and is >= (some value) that depends on a and b.\n\nBut how to find that value?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: Once the frog can reach a position that is at least b, then from there, it can subtract b as many times as needed to reach lower positions. For example, if the frog is at position s >=b, then it can reach s -b, s -2b, etc., down to 0. But since the frog can also add a's, perhaps once the frog can reach positions up to a certain point, it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be written as a linear combination of a and b (but with signs). However, since the frog can only add a's and subtract b's, the coefficients for a are non-negative, and for b are non-negative.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should look for patterns in small examples.\n\nTake the first example: a=5, b=3, d=1. The reachable positions for x=7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which is all positions from 0 to 7. So for x >=7, all positions are reachable. But earlier for x=5, only 0,2,5 were reachable. So there's a threshold where once x is large enough, all positions are reachable.\n\nSo what's the threshold for x?\n\nIn this case, the threshold seems to be 7. Which is the Frobenius number for a=5 and b=3. But the Frobenius number is ab -a -b = 15-5-3=7. So for numbers larger than the Frobenius number, they can be expressed as a combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can reach positions that are a combination of adding a and subtracting b. So perhaps the threshold is related to the Frobenius number.\n\nBut in this example, once x is >=7, all positions are reachable. So for x >= Frobenius number +1, all positions are reachable. But how?\n\nLet me check for x=7. The Frobenius number is 7, so according to the Frobenius problem, 7 cannot be expressed as 5k +3l for non-negative integers k and l. But in our case, the frog can reach 7 via adding a twice and subtracting b once: 5*2 -3*1=10-3=7. So this is a valid expression, but in the Frobenius problem, it's about expressing numbers as positive combinations of a and b. Here, the frog uses subtraction of b.\n\nSo the Frobenius problem doesn't apply directly here. But perhaps there's another way to think about this.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and -b with non-negative coefficients. So the set of reachable positions is { a*k - b*l | k,l >=0 }.\n\nWe want to find for each x, the number of elements in this set that are between 0 and x inclusive.\n\nNow, since a and b are positive integers, and d = gcd(a,b), we can divide everything by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, since gcd(a',b') = 1, the problem reduces to finding the number of positions in the set { a'*k - b'*l | k,l >=0 }, multiplied by d, and then within [0, x].\n\nBut since d divides all positions, the positions are multiples of d. Let's focus on the case where d=1. Then, the positions are all integers in the set { a*k - b*l | k,l >=0 }.\n\nNow, the question is: for a given x, how many integers between 0 and x are in this set?\n\nLet me think of the set S = { a*k - b*l | k,l >=0 }.\n\nNote that since a and b are coprime, the set S contains all integers greater than or equal to some value. For example, in the case where a=5 and b=3, the set S contains all integers >= 0 except for 1, 2, 4, 7? Wait, no. Earlier example shows that 1 is in S. Let me see:\n\nFor example, 1 = 5*2 -3*3 = 10-9=1. So 1 is in S. 2 = 5*1 -3*1 = 2. 3=5*1 -3*0 =5? No. Wait, 3 can be achieved by 5*1 -3* (something)? 5*1 -3* (something) =3 → 5 - 3l =3 → 3l=2 → no. So 3 is not in S. How about 3 = 5*0 - (-3*l) ? No, because l must be non-negative. So 3 can't be formed by a*k -b*l with k and l non-negative. But how is 3 reachable in the first example? In the example where x=7, the frog can reach 3. How?\n\nAh, because the frog can reach 7 (from 5+2), then subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1. But how does it reach 3? Let me think again. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. Then add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. Subtract 3 again to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. Subtract 3 to get 3. Ah, there we go. So 3 is reachable. So 3 = 6 -3 = (5 +1) -3. But how does 1 get into the picture? Because 1 is in S. So 3 is in S as well. How?\n\nWell, 3 = 5*2 - 3* (something). Let's see: 5*2 =10. 10 -3* l =3 → l= (10-3)/3 = 7/3 → not integer. So that's not possible. But 3 can be achieved by 5*1 - 3* (something) plus some other steps. But how does that fit into the linear combination?\n\nAh, the problem is that the set S is not closed under addition. For example, if 1 and 2 are in S, then adding them gives 3. But how does that work in terms of linear combinations?\n\nWait, the set S is not closed under addition, but the frog can reach positions by combining jumps. However, the linear combination representation is not unique. So perhaps the set S is all integers that are >= (some value), but how to find that value.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are coprime, the set S contains all integers >= (a*b -a -b) + 1? Or something like that. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is >=0 and congruent to 0 mod d. And once x is large enough, the frog can reach all such positions. Then, for x >= some value, the count of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find that value for which x is large enough. Let's call this value T. Once x >= T, the count is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, it's less.\n\nIf we can find T, then for each query m, the sum can be computed as:\n\nsum_{x=0}^{min(m, T-1)} f(x) + sum_{x=T}^m (floor(x/d) + 1).\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet's think for the case where d=1. Assume a and b are coprime. Then, T is the maximum value that cannot be expressed as a*k - b*l for non-negative integers k and l. But I'm not sure what this value is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is (a*b -a -b). But in the first example, a=5, b=3. Then, T would be 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. And for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. So that seems to fit. For x=7, the count is 8 (which is 7+1). For x=7, the sum would be 8. But earlier, in the first sample, f(7) is 8, which matches.\n\nSo this suggests that for x >= T, where T is the Frobenius number (a*b -a -b), the count is x+1. But wait, for x=7, which is the Frobenius number, the count is 8. However, according to the Frobenius problem, the Frobenius number is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But in our case, the frog can reach numbers that are combinations of a and -b with non-negative coefficients. So perhaps for x >= Frobenius number, the count is x+1.\n\nBut this needs to be verified. Let's take another example. Suppose a=3, b=2 (coprime). Frobenius number is 3*2 -3 -2 = 1. So for x >= 1, all numbers can be reached. Let's see:\n\nFor x=1, the frog can reach 0, 3 (but x=1, so can't reach 3). So how?\n\nWait, the frog starts at 0. Can it reach 1?\n\nTo reach 1: from 0, can it jump +a (3) to 3 (but x=1, so invalid). Or jump -b (2) to -2 (invalid). So no. So for x=1, f(x)=1 (only 0). But according to the Frobenius idea, x >= 1 should allow all numbers. But this contradicts. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, the Frobenius number is for the case of positive combinations. Our problem is different. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo back to square one. How to find T?\n\nAlternative idea: For the frog to be able to reach all positions >= some value, the frog must be able to reach positions that allow it to generate all higher positions by adding a's. For example, if the frog can reach a position s such that s + a - b >= s, and s + a -b is reachable, then adding a's would allow generating higher positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the case where a=5, b=3. Once the frog can reach 5 and 2, then from 5, it can add a to get 10, but that's only possible if x is >=10. Alternatively, from 2, it can add a to get 7 (if x is >=7), and then from 7, subtract b to get 4, and so on. So for x >=7, the frog can reach positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, and then from 3, add a to get 8 (if x >=8), which allows reaching 8, then 8-3=5, etc. So once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut how to find the threshold x where this becomes possible.\n\nMaybe the threshold is max(a, b). Or perhaps it's (a + b). Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimal number of steps required to reach all positions. For example, in the first example, once the frog can reach positions up to a + b, it can generate all higher positions.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I need to think of the problem in terms of BFS for small cases and find a pattern.\n\nLet me consider the case where a=5, b=3. What positions can the frog reach for various x?\n\nFor x=0: only 0.\n\nx=1: 0.\n\nx=2: 0, 2.\n\nx=3: 0, 2, 3? Or not?\n\nWait, how to reach 3? From 5-3=2. Then from 2, add 5 to get 7 (if x >=7). But for x=3, the frog can't reach 7. So how to reach 3? From 0, add 5 to get 5 (x=3 is too small). Or from 0, subtract 3 to get -3 (invalid). So no. So for x=3, f(x)=2 (positions 0 and 2).\n\nFor x=4: can the frog reach 4? How?\n\nFrom 2, add 5 to get 7 (invalid). Or from 5 (if x >=5). So no. So for x=4, f(x)=2.\n\nFor x=5: positions 0,2,5. So f(x)=3.\n\nx=6: can the frog reach 6? From 2 +5 =7 (invalid). From 5, subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7 (invalid). Or from 5, add 5 to get 10 (invalid). No. So how to reach 6?\n\nWait, from 0, add 5 to get 5. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 5 to get 7 (invalid). From 2, subtract 3 to get -1 (invalid). So no. So for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. So f(6)=3. But in the sample, f(6) is 3, which matches.\n\nFor x=7: the frog can reach 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. So 8 positions. So how to reach 6? From 7-3=4, then 4+5=9 (invalid), or 4-3=1. Or from 5, add 5 to get 10 (invalid). Or from 2, add 5 to get 7 (valid), then subtract 3 to get 4, subtract 3 again to get 1, add 5 to get 6. So yes. So for x=7, the frog can reach 6.\n\nSo for x=7, all positions are reachable. For x=7, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Which is 8 positions. Which is x+1=8. So for x >=7, the count is x+1.\n\nBut for x=7, which is the Frobenius number, it works. So perhaps the threshold is the Frobenius number.\n\nBut for the earlier example where a=3, b=2, Frobenius number is 1. Let's see:\n\nFor x=1, the frog can't reach 1. For x=2: can it reach 2? Yes, by adding a=3? No, because that would be 3, which is beyond x=2. Or subtract b=2 from 0 to get -2, which is invalid. So no. So for x=2, f(x)=1. For x=3: can reach 0, 3 (from 0+3). So f(x)=2. For x=4: from 3, subtract 2 to get 1. So positions 0,3,1. Can the frog reach 2? No. So f(x)=3. For x=4, the count is 3. For x=5: from 3, add 3 to get 6 (invalid). From 1, add 3 to get 4 (valid). So now positions 0,3,1,4. From 4, subtract 2 to get 2. So now positions include 2. So for x=5, f(x)=5 (positions 0,1,2,3,4,5? Wait, no. Wait, 5 can be reached? How? From 3 + 2 steps? No. Let's think:\n\nFrom 0, add 3 to get 3. From 3, subtract 2 to get 1. From 1, add 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 2 to get 2. From 2, add 3 to get 5 (which is within x=5). So yes, 5 is reachable. So for x=5, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4,5: total of 6 positions. Which is x+1=6. So for x=5 (which is larger than the Frobenius number of 1), it works.\n\nSo this suggests that for x >= Frobenius number, the count is x+1. But for x=2, which is larger than Frobenius number 1, the count is 1, which is not x+1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nWait, but in this case, the Frobenius number is 1. For x=2, which is larger than 1, the count is 3, which is not x+1 (2+1=3). So it works. Wait, for x=2, the count is 3? No,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The challenge is to compute the sum of these reachable positions for all values from 0 to `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is because any combination of jumps will always result in a multiple of this gcd.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: Once the frog can reach a certain threshold value, it can reach all subsequent positions within the allowed range. This threshold is determined by the Frobenius number when `a` and `b` are coprime.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: For values below the threshold, we compute the reachable positions using BFS. For values above the threshold, we use a direct formula based on the threshold and the gcd.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        # If either a or b is zero, but per problem statement, they are positive\n        pass\n\n    # Now, a and b are coprime\n    # Compute the threshold T where all positions >= T are reachable\n    # For coprime a and b, T = a*b - a - b\n    # But since we have divided by d, the original a and b were a*d and b*d\n    # So the original Frobenius number is (a*d)*(b*d) - a*d - b*d = d*(a*b*d - a - b)\n    # However, since we divided by d, the new a and b are coprime, and the Frobenius number for them is a*b - a - b\n    # So the threshold for the original problem is (a*b - a - b) * d\n    # Wait, no. Because after dividing by d, a and b are coprime. The Frobenius number for them is (a*b - a - b). But since the actual positions are multiples of d, the threshold in terms of the original problem would be (a*b - a - b)*d ?\n\n    # However, in our transformed problem, a and b are coprime, and the positions are multiples of d. So the threshold in the transformed problem is (a*b - a - b), and then multiplied by d to get the original scale.\n\n    # But wait, the transformed a and b are a' and b', which are coprime. So the Frobenius number for a' and b' is a'*b' - a' - b'. But the positions in the original problem are multiples of d. So the threshold for the original problem is (a'*b' - a' - b') * d ?\n\n    # Let me think again. After dividing by d, the problem reduces to finding positions in the transformed space (where a and b are coprime). In this space, the positions are integers (since d was factored out). Once the threshold is reached in this space, all positions beyond it are reachable. Then, in the original problem, the threshold is (threshold_in_transformed_space) * d.\n\n    # So the threshold in the original problem is (a*b - a - b) * d ?\n\n    # Wait, after dividing by d, the new a and b are coprime. Let's call them a' and b'. The Frobenius number is a'*b' - a' - b'. So in the transformed space, once x' >= Frobenius number, all positions are reachable.

For x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable via BFS.\n\n    # However, given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute the sum for x < T and x >= T.\n\n    # Let's consider the following approach:\n\n    # If T is larger than m, then all x in 0..m are below T.
