The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. We need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m and sum them all. The challenge is to find an efficient way to calculate this sum, especially since m can be up to 1e9, which means we can't compute each f(x) individually in O(1) time or worse.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions reachable by the frog without stepping outside [0, x]. The frog can make any number of jumps as long as it doesn't go out of bounds. So the problem is about finding all reachable positions under the constraints of the interval [0, x].\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog starts at 0, and can add a or subtract b. But the key is that the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So the positions are constrained.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions? Let's think about the mathematical conditions here.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach a position k if there exists some integers p and q such that:\n\nk = 0 + p*a - q*b\n\nBut also, during the entire path of jumps, the frog must not have gone beyond [0, x]. However, considering that the frog can take any path, perhaps the constraints on the path are more complex. However, maybe the problem can be simplified by considering that the reachable positions are those that satisfy certain linear combinations, but also that they are within [0, x].\n\nWait, but the frog can't go beyond [0, x] during any jump. So even if a position is reachable via some sequence of jumps that temporarily goes outside the interval, it's not counted. But the problem says that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So the entire path must stay within [0, x]. Therefore, the reachable positions are those that can be reached through some path where every intermediate step is within [0, x].\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model this using some mathematical properties. Let's think about the problem without the constraints of the interval first. What positions can the frog reach?\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, i.e., positions of the form pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers. But since the frog can jump forward and backward, perhaps the set of reachable positions is the set of all integers congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), but with certain conditions.\n\nWait, the general theory of linear Diophantine equations tells us that the set of all integers that can be expressed as pa - qb (for non-negative integers p and q) is more complex than just multiples of the gcd. Because the coefficients are non-negative. However, when you allow both positive and negative coefficients, the set is the multiples of the gcd. But here, the frog can only add a (so p increases by 1) or subtract b (so q increases by 1). So the positions are of the form pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to the set of integers that can be written as pa + (-qb), so the set is all integers that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b), but with some restrictions based on the signs.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can reach it through some sequence of jumps. However, this is only true if the frog can reach that position without going out of the interval [0, x]. But for the problem of f(x), which considers the interval [0, x], perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are within [0, x], but also satisfy some other conditions.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Because even if a position is a multiple of d, the frog might not be able to reach it without stepping outside the interval. For example, if the frog needs to jump forward to reach a position, but that requires going beyond x. However, in the case where the frog can reach a position via some path that stays within [0, x], then it's allowed.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output for f(5) is 3. Let's see:\n\nAt x=5, the frog can reach positions 0, 5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Wait, how? Let's see:\n\nFrom 0, the frog can jump to 5 (since 0+5=5, which is within [0,5]). Then from 5, it can jump to 5-3=2. From 2, can it jump further? Let's see: adding 5 would take it to 7, which is outside [0,5], so that's not allowed. Subtracting 3 would take it to -1, which is also invalid. So the reachable positions are 0, 5, 2. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly, for x=7, the frog can reach more positions. For example, from 2, can it jump to 2+5=7 (which is allowed). Then from 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1, then add 5 to get 6, etc. So the reachable positions are all numbers that are multiples of gcd(5,3)=1. But since the frog can reach any integer once it's able to reach a certain range, perhaps for x large enough, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x that are congruent to 0 mod d (where d is gcd(a,b)).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the case where the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, but only if x is large enough. However, for small x, some positions may not be reachable because the frog can't reach them without stepping outside the interval.\n\nSo the first step is to determine the greatest common divisor d of a and b. Because any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because the frog's movement is based on adding a and subtracting b. So the difference between any two positions is a linear combination of a and b, hence divisible by d. Therefore, the positions reachable must be multiples of d.\n\nSo, the first thing is to compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then the positions are multiples of d. But for the frog to reach a certain position, it must be possible to express it as pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers, and during the process of jumping, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this for varying x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions being all multiples of d that are within [0, x], and also satisfy some condition that allows them to be reached without stepping out of the interval.\n\nBut how to find that condition?\n\nLet me think of the problem where the frog can move freely (i.e., no restriction on the interval). Then, the set of reachable positions is all integers of the form pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers. However, this is equivalent to the set of all integers that are multiples of d, and greater than or equal to some minimal value. For example, according to the coin problem, if a and b are coprime, then the largest number that cannot be expressed as pa + qb (with p, q non-negative) is ab - a - b. However, in our case, the frog can add a or subtract b. So perhaps the problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is â‰¥0, provided that the frog can reach it through some sequence of jumps. But again, this depends on the path taken.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem of f(x), the key is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. However, for smaller x, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. Determine for a given x, the set of positions that are multiples of d, and are reachable under the constraint that the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a graph. Each position is a node, and there's an edge from k to k+a and k-b (if those positions are within [0, x]). Then f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph.\n\nBut for large x (up to 1e9), building this graph is impossible. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me consider that the frog can reach a position k if and only if:\n\n- k is a multiple of d (d = gcd(a, b)), and\n\n- there exists some way to reach k without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this condition?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position k that is a multiple of d and satisfies k â‰¤ x and k â‰¥ 0, and there exists some integer t such that k = pa - qb, with p and q non-negative integers, and during the process of jumping, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps we can model the problem as follows: for the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it by some sequence of jumps that never go below 0 or above x. Let's consider that the frog can move forward (adding a) and backward (subtracting b). However, the backward jumps require that the current position is at least b, otherwise, it can't subtract b. Similarly, forward jumps can be made as long as the new position is â‰¤x.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for a given x, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are in [0, x], and also satisfy that they can be reached by some combination of forward and backward jumps without violating the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the minimal x where all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. Once that x is found, for larger x, the count is simply the number of multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that minimal x?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For a given x, the reachable positions are all multiples of d in [0, x] that can be written as pa - qb, where pa - qb is between 0 and x, and during the process of getting there, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the frog can reach any integer that is in [0, x], provided that it can be formed by some sequence of jumps. But how?\n\nLet me take the example from the first sample input: a=5, b=3, d=1. For x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2. For x=7, it can reach more positions. For example, 0 â†’ 5 â†’ 2 â†’ 7 (by adding 5). Then from 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, adding 5 gives 6. From 6, subtract 3 gives 3. From 3, subtract 3 gives 0. So all positions from 0 to 7 except maybe some?\n\nWait, the positions reachable for x=7 are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions, which matches the sample's f(7) = 8. So all integers from 0 to 7 are reachable. Wait, but 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Yes, that's 8 numbers. So for x=7, the frog can reach all positions in [0,7], which is 8 positions. But why is that possible?\n\nBecause once the frog can reach a certain range, it can generate all numbers in that range by adding and subtracting. For example, once you can reach 5 and 3, then you can subtract 3 from 5 to get 2, then subtract 3 again to get -1 (but that's invalid). However, with x being large enough, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nSo perhaps when x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], and for x < that threshold, some positions are missing.\n\nSo the problem is to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d in [0, x], but adjusted by some threshold.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach all positions that are multiples of d in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Let's assume that for x â‰¥ some value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. Then, for x less than that value, the number of reachable positions is something else.\n\nSo the problem splits into two parts:\n\n1. For x below a certain value (let's call it T), the number of reachable positions is less than floor(x/d)+1.\n\n2. For x â‰¥ T, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d)+1.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the maximum between a and b. Or perhaps T is some other value.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is â‰¥0 and â‰¤x, provided that there exists some way to reach it by moving forward and backward. For example, if the frog can reach some position k, then it can reach k + a (if that's â‰¤x) by jumping forward. Similarly, if it can reach k + b, then it can reach k by jumping backward.\n\nBut this suggests that once the frog can reach a certain range, it can expand that range by adding a and subtracting b. So perhaps once the frog can reach a certain value, say, the value a, then it can reach all positions from a onwards by adding a, but also subtracting b when possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again about the case where a and b are coprime. For example, a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, etc. Once the frog can reach 5 and 2, then it can reach 5+5=10 (if x is big enough), but also 2-3=-1 (invalid). However, for x >= 5, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (5+2?), etc.\n\nBut for x=7, all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable. So in this case, the threshold T is 5 + 3 - 1 = 7? Or maybe it's related to the Frobenius number. But since the problem is about being able to reach positions by adding a and subtracting b, it's different from the classic Frobenius problem.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: For the frog to reach a position k, there must exist some number of forward jumps (adding a) and backward jumps (subtracting b) such that the total displacement is k. So, k = pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers. Also, during the process of making these jumps, the frog must not leave the interval [0, x].\n\nBut how to ensure that the path doesn't go out of bounds?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the key insight is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x]. For example, once the frog can reach a position that is at least b, then it can subtract b to reach another position. Similarly, adding a allows moving forward.\n\nBut to reach all positions, the frog must be able to reach a contiguous block of positions. For example, if the frog can reach a range of positions that are consecutive modulo d, then it can generate all positions in that range.\n\nBut since d is the gcd, all positions are multiples of d. So, for example, if the frog can reach positions in the range [k, k + d - 1], then it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a or subtracting b.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this becomes possible?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is â‰¥ some value S, and â‰¤x. Once x is large enough, S is 0, so all multiples are reachable.\n\nBut how to compute S?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is â‰¥ (some value) and â‰¤x. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a (if within x), and k - b (if â‰¥0). So the question is whether the frog can reach all multiples of d from some point onwards.\n\nIn the case of a and b being coprime, once the frog can reach a position that is â‰¥ b, then it can subtract b to reach lower positions. So perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough to allow the frog to reach positions that can generate all multiples of d.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think of the problem differently. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x] if x is large enough. Let's assume that this is true for x â‰¥ max(a, b). Then for x â‰¥ max(a, b), the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this may not be the case. For example, take a=5, b=3. For x=5, the reachable positions are 0,5,2 (three positions). But floor(5/1) +1 = 6. Which is not the case. So clearly, that assumption is wrong.\n\nSo there must be some threshold T, beyond which the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. How to find T?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a BFS. The frog starts at 0. It can jump to a (if a â‰¤x) or to -b (but that's invalid unless b=0, which it's not). So initially, the frog can only jump to a if a â‰¤x. Then from a, it can jump to a +a (if within x) or a -b (if a -b â‰¥0).\n\nBut for large x, this BFS would be too slow. However, perhaps we can find that once x is large enough, the reachable positions are all multiples of d in [0, x]. So the problem becomes: find the minimal x where this is true, and for all x â‰¥ that value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nIf we can find this minimal x, then for the sum from i=0 to m, we can split it into two parts: for i < T, compute f(i) directly (maybe via BFS for small T), and for i â‰¥ T, compute floor(i/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, T is the minimal value such that for any multiple of d between 0 and T, the frog can reach it. Once T is found, for x â‰¥ T, the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Suppose a=5, b=3. What is T?\n\nIn the first sample, when x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. So T is 7. For x â‰¥7, the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1) in [0, x], so floor(x/1)+1 = x+1. But for x=5, it's not the case.\n\nSo T is the minimal value such that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, T]. Once that is achieved, for larger x, the same applies.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nAnother thought: The frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are â‰¥ (a - b) * something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal T is (a + b) - gcd(a, b). But I'm not sure. For example, in the sample case, a=5, b=3, d=1. So (5+3) - 1 =7, which matches the T=7. In that case, when x is 7, the frog can reach all positions. So maybe T is (a + b) - d?\n\nBut wait, let's think of another example. Suppose a=2, b=2. Then d=2. The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of 2. From 0, it can jump to 2 (if xâ‰¥2), and from 2, it can jump to 4 (if xâ‰¥4) or to 0 (by subtracting 2). So for any x â‰¥2, the frog can reach 0 and 2. For x=4, it can reach 0,2,4. For x=5, it can reach 0,2,4. So the number of reachable positions is floor(x/2) +1. For x=2, floor(2/2)+1 = 2, which is correct (positions 0 and 2). For x=3, floor(3/2)+1 = 1 +1 = 2, which is also correct. So in this case, T is 2, which is (a + b) - d = 2+2-2=2. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=5. d=1. Then T would be 3+5-1=7. Let's see. For x=7, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nYes. Because for example, starting from 0, jump to 3, then to 6, then to 6+3=9 (but that's beyond 7). Alternatively, from 3, subtract 5 to get -2 (invalid). So maybe not. Hmm. Wait, perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, in this case, a=3, b=5. The frog can jump to 3 (if xâ‰¥3). From 3, it can jump to 6 (if xâ‰¥6), or subtract 5 to get -2 (invalid). From 6, it can jump to 9 (invalid) or subtract 5 to get 1. Then from 1, can it jump to 1+3=4 (if xâ‰¥4). From 4, jump to 7 (if xâ‰¥7) or subtract 5 to get -1 (invalid). From 7, subtract 5 to get 2. From 2, add 3 to get 5. From 5, subtract 5 to get 0. So for x=7, the frog can reach 0,3,6,1,4,7,2,5. All numbers from 0 to 7. So yes, T=7. Which matches the formula (a + b -d) = 3+5-1=7.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So perhaps T is (a + b -d). But wait, what if a and b are not coprime?\n\nLet's take a=4, b=6. Then d=2. So T would be (4+6) - 2 = 8. Let's see. The frog can reach positions that are multiples of 2. Let's check for x=8.\n\nFrom 0, the frog can jump to 4 (if xâ‰¥4). From 4, it can jump to 8 (x=8) or subtract 6 to get -2 (invalid). From 8, subtract 6 to get 2. From 2, add 4 to get 6. From 6, subtract 6 to get 0. From 0, jump to 4 again. So the reachable positions are 0,4,8,2,6. Are there any others? For example, can the frog reach 2? Yes, from 8-6. But how to get to 8? From 4 +4. So yes. For x=8, the positions are 0,2,4,6,8. So floor(8/2)+1=5, which matches. Now, what about x=6. For x=6, the frog can reach 0,4, and 8 is not allowed. From 4, subtract 6 would be -2. So 0,4, and from 4, can we jump to 4+4=8 (invalid). So for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,4, and 4-6= -2 (invalid). So only 0 and 4? But wait, can the frog reach 2? Well, to reach 2, the frog would need to jump from 0 to 4, then subtract 6, but that's -2. Not allowed. So for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,4. So floor(6/2) +1 = 3+1=4. But actual count is 2. So the formula T=(a+b-d) is 8. For x=6 < T, the count is not floor(x/d)+1.\n\nSo this suggests that for x â‰¥ T, the count is floor(x/d)+1, and for x < T, it's something else.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then the positions are multiples of d. But even for d>1, the same logic applies.\n\n- Compute T = a + b - d. For x â‰¥ T, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut wait, in the case where a=4, b=6, d=2. T=4+6-2=8. For x=8, the count is 5 (0,2,4,6,8). Which is floor(8/2)+1 = 4+1=5. Correct. For x=7, which is less than T, the count would be ?\n\nFor x=7, the frog can reach 0,4, 8 is not allowed. From 4, can it subtract 6 to get -2 (invalid). So only 0 and 4. But wait, can it reach 2? No. Because to reach 2, the frog would need to reach 2 via some path. For example, 0 +4 (to 4) then subtract 6 (invalid). Or maybe another way. But there's no way. So for x=7, the count is 2. But floor(7/2) +1 is 3 +1 =4. So the formula holds for x >= T.\n\nSo the idea is that for x >= T, the count is floor(x/d) + 1, and for x < T, it's something else that we need to compute.\n\nThus, the sum from i=0 to m of f(i) can be computed as:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{min(m, T-1)} f(i) + sum_{i=T}^m (floor(i/d) + 1)\n\nBut how to compute the first part, the sum for i from 0 to T-1?\n\nBut what is T? T is a + b -d. However, for some cases, T could be very large. For example, if a and b are large, but since a and b are up to 1e5, T would be up to 2e5. Which is manageable. Because for each test case, even if m is 1e9, we can precompute all f(i) for i from 0 to T-1, which is up to 2e5 steps. For each of these steps, we can compute f(i) using BFS or some other method.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is zero, but since a and b are positive integers, that's not possible.\n\n2. Compute T = a + b - d.\n\n3. For x < T, compute f(x) by BFS or some other method.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < T efficiently?\n\nWell, for each x, we can model the reachable positions as a set, and perform BFS. However, since T is up to 2e5, and for each x up to T-1, we need to compute f(x), this would be O(T^2) in the worst case, which is 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. Need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: For all x, f(x) is the number of positions reachable by the frog under the constraint that it never steps outside [0, x]. But since T is up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute all reachable positions up to T, and then for each x, f(x) is the number of positions reachable up to x.\n\nWait, but how to model this. For example, the reachable positions for x=5 may be a subset of the reachable positions for x=6. So if we can find all positions that are reachable for any x up to T, then for each x, f(x) is the count of positions <=x.\n\nSo here's the idea:\n\nWe can perform a BFS to find all positions that are reachable for any x (i.e., without considering the x limit). Once we have all these positions, for any x, f(x) is the number of positions in this set that are <=x and >=0.\n\nBut wait, this is only valid if the positions are reachable without violating the x constraint. However, the problem is that for a position k to be in the set, it must be reachable via some path that never leaves [0, x]. But if we ignore the x constraint and compute all positions reachable by the frog, then for x being large enough, those positions are valid. However, for smaller x, some of these positions may not be reachable because the path requires going beyond x.\n\nSo this approach is not correct. For example, position 5 is reachable for x=5, but if x is 4, then it's not allowed.\n\nSo how can we find for each x, the positions that are reachable with the x constraint?\n\nAlternative idea: For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog's jumps, and are in [0, x], and during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. However, this seems difficult to model.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the reachable positions for x as follows: the frog can reach any position k such that k is a multiple of d, and there exists some sequence of jumps that starts at 0, ends at k, and never leaves [0, x].\n\nBut again, how to compute this?\n\nAnother observation: The frog can only jump forward or backward. To reach a position k, the frog must have some way to get there by adding a's and subtracting b's, but ensuring that during the process, all intermediate positions are within [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps for a given x, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are between 0 and x, and can be written as k = pa - qb, where pa - qb is between 0 and x, and pa - qb can be achieved by some sequence of jumps that never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut this seems like a dead end.\n\nLet me think of another approach. For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to reach it by some sequence of jumps that starts at 0 and ends at k, with all intermediate positions between 0 and x. So for each x, the reachable positions are those that are in the set S_x, where S_x is the set of positions reachable from 0 by the frog's moves, with the restriction that during the journey, the frog never leaves [0, x].\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute S_x for all x up to T.\n\nBut for x up to T, which is up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute for each x, the reachable positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea is to precompute for all positions up to T, whether they are reachable by the frog, assuming that the frog can use any x >= the position. Then, for a given x, the reachable positions are those positions that are reachable by the frog (without any x constraint), and are <=x, and also can be reached without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to determine which of those positions can be reached for a given x.\n\nThis seems tricky, but perhaps we can model it with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each position k, we can determine the minimal x needed to reach it. Then, for any x >= that minimal x, k is included in f(x). Otherwise, it is not.\n\nFor example, for k=5 in the first sample, the minimal x is 5. For x >=5, it is included. For x <5, it is not.\n\nSo if we can compute for each position k, the minimal x_min[k] such that the frog can reach k with the x constraint of x_min[k], then for any x >= x_min[k], k is included in f(x). \n\nOnce we have x_min[k], then for any x, f(x) is the number of k's such that k is a multiple of d, 0<=k<=x, and x_min[k] <=x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x_min[k] for each k that is reachable by the frog (without x constraints), and then for each x, sum over all k in [0, x] that are multiples of d and x_min[k] <=x.\n\nBut how to compute x_min[k]?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can model this with BFS, where during the BFS, we track the minimal x required to reach a position.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: For a position k to be reachable, it must be possible to reach it with some sequence of jumps, and during the jumps, the frog never steps beyond k (since x is at least k). Wait, no. Because during the jumps, the frog might have to go higher than k. For example, to reach k=2 in the first sample, the frog jumps from 0 to 5 (which is higher than 2), then back to 2. So for x to be at least 5, the frog can reach 2. But if x is 2, the frog can't jump to 5, so it can't reach 2.\n\nSo the minimal x for position k is the maximum position visited during any path from 0 to k. Thus, x_min[k] is the minimal value such that there exists a path from 0 to k where all intermediate positions are between 0 and x_min[k].\n\nBut how to compute this for all k?\n\nThis sounds like a shortest path problem, where the cost is the maximum position visited along the path. We want to find, for each k, the minimal maximum position along any path from 0 to k.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. So for each k, x_min[k] is the minimal value of the maximum position visited along any path from 0 to k.\n\nOnce we have x_min[k], then for any x >=x_min[k], the position k is included in f(x).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find all positions k that are reachable by the frog (without any x constraints). These are the multiples of d that can be expressed as pa - qb for non-negative integers p and q.\n\n2. For each such k, compute x_min[k], the minimal x such that the frog can reach k without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nOnce we have x_min[k], for each x, f(x) is the number of k's such that k is a multiple of d, 0<=k<=x, and x_min[k] <=x.\n\nNow, how to compute x_min[k]?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with Dijkstra's algorithm. Because for each position, we want to find the minimal maximum position along a path to it.\n\nLet me think of it as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps (k -> k+a and k -> k-b, if applicable). The cost of a path is the maximum position visited along it. We want to find for each k, the minimal such cost.\n\nThis is similar to finding the minimal bottleneck path from 0 to k.\n\nDijkstra's algorithm can be adapted for this. Here's how:\n\n- Use a priority queue where the priority is the current maximum position encountered along the path.\n\n- For each node, keep track of the minimal maximum position required to reach it.\n\n- When processing a node, for each neighbor, compute the new_max = max(current_max, neighbor). If this new_max is less than the previously recorded value for the neighbor, update it and add to the queue.\n\nThis way, we can find the minimal x_min[k] for each k.\n\nOnce we have this, we can proceed.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible k we need to consider?\n\nSince T is a + b -d, and for x >= T, all multiples of d up to x are included. So for k up to T, we need to compute x_min[k]. For k > T, since for x >= T, all multiples of d up to x are included. So for any k that is a multiple of d and k <= T, we need to compute x_min[k]. For k > T, since x_min[k] would be <= T (since for x=T, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to T",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to a given value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The reachable positions are determined by linear combinations of `a` and `b`, constrained by the interval [0, x].\n\n2. **GCD Insight**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` determines the set of reachable positions. All reachable positions must be multiples of `gcd(a, b)`.\n\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: We calculate a threshold `T` which is `a + b - gcd(a, b)`. For values of `x` greater than or equal to `T`, the frog can reach all multiples of `gcd(a, b)` within the range [0, x].\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For values of `x` less than `T`, we use BFS to determine all reachable positions up to `T`. This helps in efficiently computing the number of reachable positions for smaller values of `x`.\n\n5. **Summing Values**: The sum of reachable positions for all values from 0 to `m` is split into two parts: values below the threshold `T` computed using BFS, and values above `T` computed using arithmetic progression.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    T = a + b - d\n\n    # Precompute all reachable positions up to T\n    max_pos = T\n    reachable = set()\n    visited = set()\n\n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append(0)\n    visited.add(0)\n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        reachable.add(current)\n        # Jump forward\n        next_forward = current + a\n        if next_forward <= max_pos and next_forward not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_forward)\n            queue.append(next_forward)\n        # Jump backward\n        next_backward = current - b\n        if next_backward >= 0 and next_backward not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_backward)\n            queue.append(next_backward)\n\n    # Now, for each x from 0 to T, compute f(x)\n    # Create an array that stores for each x the count of reachable positions up to x\n    # But since we have all reachable positions, we can precompute a prefix sum\n    sorted_reachable = sorted(reachable)\n    # For each x, the count is the number of elements in sorted_reachable <= x\n    # So we can build a prefix sum array for sorted_reachable\n\n    # Build prefix sums for sorted_reachable\n    sorted_reachable = sorted(reachable)\n    prefix = {}\n    for i in range(len(sorted_reachable)):\n        prefix[sorted_reachable[i]] = i + 1\n\n    # Function to compute f(x) for x < T\n    def f_small(x):\n        # Find how many elements in sorted_reachable are <=x\n        low = 0\n        high = len(sorted_reachable) - 1\n        res = 0\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if sorted_reachable[mid] <= x:\n                res = mid + 1\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        return res\n\n    # Compute sum for x < T\n    sum_small = 0\n    for x in range(min(m, T) + 1):\n        sum_small += f_small(x)\n\n    # Compute sum for x >= T\n    if m >= T:\n        # Number of terms is m - T + 1\n        # Each term is floor(x/d) + 1\n        # Sum from x = T to m of (floor(x/d) + 1)\n        # Let's compute it as sum_floor + (m - T + 1)\n        def sum_floor(start, end, d):\n            # sum_{k=start}^{end} floor(k/d)\n            # floor(k/d) = q when k is in [qd, (q+1)d -1]\n            # So total is sum_{q} q * (number of terms in [qd, min((q+1)d-1, end)] - start + 1 ?)\n            # Or compute total = (end//d) * (end - (end//d)*d + 1) - (start -1)//d * ((start -1) - ( (start-1)//d )*d +1 )\n            # But better to compute it as:\n            # sum_{k=0}^n floor(k/d) = sum_{q=0}^{n//d} q * (min(d, n - q*d + 1))\n            # Alternatively, the formula is (n - r) * (n - r + 1) // (2 * d) ) + ... but perhaps it's easier to compute using arithmetic series.\n            # Another approach: sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/d) = sum_{q=0}^{Q} q * (number of x where floor(x/d) = q)\n            # Q = n // d\n            # For q < Q: number of x is d\n            # For q = Q: number of x is n - Q*d + 1\n            Q = end // d\n            total = 0\n            for q in range(Q):\n                total += q * d\n            last_q = Q\n            count_last = end - Q * d + 1\n            total += last_q * count_last\n            return total\n\n        start = T\n        end = m\n        sum_floor_val = sum_floor(start, end, d)\n        count_terms = end - start + 1\n        sum_large = sum_floor_val + count_terms\n        total_sum = sum_small + sum_large\n    else:\n        total_sum = sum_small\n\n    print(total_sum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed.\n2. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` is computed to determine the set of reachable positions.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold `T` is calculated to determine when all multiples of `gcd(a, b)` become reachable.\n4. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: A BFS is used to determine all reachable positions up to the threshold `T`.\n5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of reachable positions is computed by combining results from BFS for values below the threshold and arithmetic progression for values above the threshold.
