    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. \n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach here. Since the array elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model this efficiently without checking all possible subarrays, which would be O(n^2) possibilities. But even for n=2000, that's 2000^2 = 4 million possibilities, and for each of those, we'd need to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS), which is O(n^2) time. That would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the original LNDS can be computed easily. But when we reverse a subarray, how does that affect the LNDS? Let's think about the optimal reversal. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence would be as long as possible, ideally all 1s followed by all 2s. So perhaps the best way is to find a subarray that when reversed, increases the number of 1s before 2s.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think: the original sequence has some number of 1s and 2s. For example, if the original sequence is already non-decreasing, then reversing any subarray would not help. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that part could help.\n\nBut since the problem allows any reversal, maybe the optimal scenario is to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and 2s at the end. So, the idea is to find a segment where reversing it would connect more 1s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's only if the sequence is all 1s followed by all 2s. But maybe there's a way to maximize the LNDS by combining some parts.\n\nWait, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is simply the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Because the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the count of 1s (if you take all 1s) or the count of 2s (if you take all 2s), or something in between. But actually, for a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s is equal to the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Wait, no. For example, if the sequence is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But the total number of 1s is 2 and 2s is 2. So the maximum is 3. So how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be calculated as follows: the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But maybe that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for any sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be found by taking all the 1s and then all the 2s. So the length is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, then this might not be the case. However, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1s, the total number of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 (if there are any 1s). Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nBut regardless, when we reverse a subarray, we can consider how that affects the overall structure. For example, if the original array has a segment with some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that segment would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, which would contribute more to the LNDS.\n\nSo the key idea is to find a subarray that when reversed, increases the number of 1s before 2s. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's denote the original array as a list of 1s and 2s.\n\nSuppose we reverse a subarray from l to r. Let's think about the effect on the entire array. The reversed subarray will have its elements flipped. For example, if the original subarray was [2,1], reversing it gives [1,2], which is better for the LNDS.\n\nThe problem is to find the reversal that maximizes the LNDS. Since the LNDS can be calculated based on the positions of 1s and 2s, perhaps we can model this by considering the number of transitions between 1 and 2.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the maximum possible LNDS is either:\n\n- the original LNDS, or\n\n- the LNDS after reversing a certain subarray.\n\nBut how to find the best such subarray?\n\nLet me think about the optimal scenario. The best possible LNDS after reversal would be the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but only if the entire array is non-decreasing. However, if the original array has some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that part can merge them into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to find the best subarray to reverse?\n\nAnother idea: For any possible reversal, the LNDS can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's suppose that after reversing the subarray [l, r], the array becomes A. The LNDS of A is the maximum between:\n\n- the number of 1s in A, plus the number of 2s in A that come after the last occurrence of 1 in A.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are not preceded by any 1s (but this doesn't make sense). Maybe another way: the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1.\n\nBut perhaps for the entire array, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- the number of 1s (if all 1s are taken)\n\n- the number of 2s (if all 2s are taken)\n\n- the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the array.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2), but the number of 1s is 2, the number of 2s is 2, and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1 is 1 (the last 1 is at position 3, and the 2s after it is 1). So 2+1=3, which matches. So maybe this formula works.\n\nIn that case, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between:\n\ncount_ones + count_twos_after_last_one,\n\ncount_twos + count_ones_after_last_two,\n\nand the maximum of count_ones and count_twos.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the case, but assuming it's correct, then perhaps we can model the problem as trying to find the best reversal that maximizes this value.\n\nSo, the original array's LNDS is determined by the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, and the count of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1, etc.\n\nWhen we reverse a subarray, how does it affect the positions of 1s and 2s? For example, suppose the original array has a segment with some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn the 2s into 1s and vice versa, but in reverse order. So, for example, if the original segment is [2, 2, 1, 1], reversing it would give [1, 1, 2, 2], which is better.\n\nSo the key is to find a subarray that has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing that would convert them into 1s followed by 2s, which could increase the count of 1s before 2s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (number of 1s in the array) + (number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the modified array) after reversing a subarray. Alternatively, the maximum between the original value and the best possible after reversal.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nLet me precompute for the original array the maximum possible LNDS. Then, for every possible reversal, compute the new LNDS and find the maximum. However, with n=2000, this would be O(n^2) reversals, each requiring O(n) time to compute the LNDS. That would be O(n^3), which is 8e9 operations for n=2000. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: since the array only contains 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed as the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear after the last 1 in the array. Similarly, the number of 2s plus the number of 1s that appear after the last 2 in the array. But since the array is non-decreasing, the last 1 is before the first 2. So perhaps the maximum LNDS is max(count_ones + count_twos_after_last_one, count_twos + count_ones_after_last_two, count_ones, count_twos).\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect these values?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I reverse a subarray [l, r]. How does that affect the positions of 1s and 2s?\n\nWell, the reversed subarray is now the reverse of the original. So, any 1s and 2s inside [l, r] are flipped in order.\n\nBut the key is to find how this reversal affects the count of 1s before the last 1 in the entire array, and how many 2s are after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best possible scenario after reversing a subarray is to have as many 1s as possible before the 2s. So, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array. Therefore, the problem becomes to find the maximum value of (total_ones + number_of_2s_after_last_1_in_modified_array).\n\nSo, how to compute this maximum?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say the original array has some positions where there are 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that part would make them 1s followed by 2s, which would increase the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array has a segment like [2, 2, 1, 1]. Reversing it gives [1, 1, 2, 2]. Now, the last 1 in the entire array is at position (original array's last 1 in the reversed part) but depends on other parts.\n\nBut how to find the optimal subarray to reverse?\n\nAnother idea: the optimal reversal is one that connects the leftmost 1s and rightmost 2s. For example, if there are some 2s before some 1s, reversing that segment would turn them into 1s followed by 2s, thus contributing to the LNDS.\n\nLet me think of the original array as consisting of some 1s, then some 2s, then some 1s, then some 2s, etc. The worst case is when there are 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that part would help.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the original maximum plus the maximum number of 2s that can be merged with 1s by reversing a segment that has some 2s followed by some 1s.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's consider that the original array has some 2s followed by some 1s. Let's say the number of such 2s is x and the number of such 1s is y. Reversing this segment would turn them into y 1s followed by x 2s, which would contribute x + y to the LNDS (assuming they are connected to the rest of the array's 1s and 2s).\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible x + y?\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire array. Let's imagine that the best scenario is when we have all the 1s in the array followed by all the 2s. The length of this would be the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, which is n. But this is only possible if the original array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence. However, if the original array can't be turned into such a sequence, then the maximum would be less than n.\n\nBut the problem allows us to reverse a single subarray. So, the question becomes: what's the maximum number of 2s that can be placed after the 1s by reversing a single subarray?\n\nSo, for example, if there is a segment of 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would add those 2s and 1s into the 1s and 2s parts. But how to find the maximum possible.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nCompute the total number of 1s and 2s. Let total_ones = c1, total_twos = c2. The maximum possible LNDS is min(c1 + c2, ...), but that's trivial. However, if we can arrange the array to have all 1s followed by all 2s, then the LNDS is c1 + c2. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nBut how to check if that's possible with a single reversal?\n\nWell, the original array may have some 2s followed by 1s. If there's exactly one such occurrence, then reversing that part would make the array non-decreasing. But if there are multiple such occurrences, then reversing a certain subarray may not fix all of them.\n\nBut given that we can reverse any subarray, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original value and (c1 + c2 - k), where k is the number of \"inversions\" (i.e., 2s before 1s) that can be fixed by a single reversal.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between the original value and the maximum of (c1 + c2 - (number of inversions that are not covered by the reversal)).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of inversions (i.e., pairs of indices i < j where a_i = 2 and a_j = 1). Each such inversion contributes to the LNDS being less than c1 + c2. Reversing a subarray can eliminate some of these inversions.\n\nBut again, how to find the maximum number of inversions that can be eliminated by a single reversal.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original array has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing that subarray would eliminate all inversions within that subarray, and possibly some inversions between the subarray and the rest of the array.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS after reversal can be calculated by considering the positions of the first occurrence of 1 and the last occurrence of 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for any possible reversal, the maximum LNDS can be determined by:\n\n- the number of 1s in the array (which is fixed) plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the reversal that maximizes the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nSimilarly, the same applies for the number of 2s plus the number of 1s after the last 2. But since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the maximum between these two options would be the maximum possible.\n\nSo, the key is to find the maximum possible value of (number of 2s after the last 1 in the modified array) plus the number of 1s.\n\nBut how to compute this for any reversal?\n\nLet me think about the modified array. The last 1 in the modified array could be in the original array, or in the reversed subarray. Similarly, the reversed subarray could contain 1s and 2s, which may change the position of the last 1.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the best possible reversal that maximizes the number of 2s after the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this.\n\nSuppose in the original array, the last 1 is at position L, and the first 2 is at position R. If there are no 2s before 1s, then the maximum is c1 + c2. But if there are some 2s before 1s, then reversing a segment that includes those 2s and 1s can move the last 1 to a position earlier than the first 2, thereby increasing the number of 2s after it.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nLet me consider that the best way to maximize the number of 2s after the last 1 is to have the last 1 in the modified array as far to the left as possible, and the 2s as far to the right as possible.\n\nSo, for example, if there is a segment that has some 2s followed by some 1s, reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. This would make the last 1 of this segment be the end of the 1s, and the 2s would come after.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible number of 2s after the last 1 in the entire array.\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's say that in the original array, the last occurrence of 1 is at position x. Then, the number of 2s after x is y. The total LNDS would be c1 + y.\n\nIf we reverse a subarray that includes some 2s before x and some 1s after x, then the last occurrence of 1 in the modified array could be shifted to the right (or left?), depending on the reversal.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the maximum number of 2s after the last 1 is equal to the total number of 2s minus the number of 2s that are before the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nSo, to maximize this, we need to minimize the number of 2s before the last 1 in the modified array.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the modified array. The last 1 could be in the original array, or in the reversed subarray.\n\nSuppose we choose to reverse a subarray [l, r]. Let's think about the modified array. The last 1 in the modified array can be:\n\n- the original last 1, if the reversed subarray does not contain any 1s after it.\n\n- or the last 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\nSimilarly, the first 2 in the modified array could be the original first 2, or the first 2 in the reversed subarray.\n\nBut this seems complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative idea: Let's precompute for all possible positions i and j, the number of 1s before i and the number of 2s after j. Then, when reversing a subarray [l, r], the last 1 in the modified array could be the maximum between the original last 1 before l, the last 1 in the reversed subarray, and the last 1 after r. Similarly for the first 2.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the best possible scenario. The optimal reversal would be one that allows the last 1 in the modified array to be as far to the left as possible, and the first 2 to be as far to the right as possible. This way, the number of 2s after the last 1 is maximized.\n\nTo find this, perhaps we can find the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s by reversing a subarray that contains some 2s followed by some 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the original maximum LNDS.\n\n2. Find the best possible reversal that increases this maximum.\n\nSo, the original maximum is max(c1, c2, c1 + num_2s_after_last_1, c2 + num_1s_after_last_2).\n\nBut how to find the best reversal?\n\nLet me think about the following. Suppose we have a segment of the array that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which can potentially increase the number of 2s after the last 1 in the array.\n\nSo, for example, consider the original array has a prefix of some 1s, then some 2s, then some 1s, then some 2s. Reversing the middle part (the 2s followed by 1s) would merge the 1s and 2s into a longer sequence.\n\nSo, to find the best such segment, perhaps we can find all possible positions where there is a 2 followed by a 1, and compute the gain in the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet's precompute for each position i, the number of 1s up to i (prefix_ones[i]) and the number of 2s from i onwards (suffix_twos[i]).\n\nThen, for any segment [l, r], when reversed, the number of 1s in the reversed segment is the number of 1s in the original segment. Similarly for 2s. But how does this affect the overall count of 2s after the last 1?\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: when you reverse a segment [l, r], the last 1 in the entire array could be either:\n\n- the last 1 in the original array that is before l.\n\n- the last 1 in the reversed segment.\n\n- the last 1 in the original array that is after r.\n\nSimilarly for the first 2.\n\nBut this seems too complex.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the example given:\n\nIn the first example, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS is 3. But after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], with LNDS 4. So the gain comes from merging the 2 and 1 in positions 2 and 3 into 1 and 2.\n\nThis suggests that the best reversal is to find a segment where there are some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that segment turns them into 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nSo, the maximum gain would be the maximum number of 2s and 1s in such a segment.\n\nLet me define for each position i, the number of 2s before i and the number of 1s after i. Then, for a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s, the gain is (number of 2s in the segment) + (number of 1s in the segment).\n\nWait, but how does this contribute to the overall LNDS? For example, if the original array has a segment of x 2s followed by y 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into y 1s followed by x 2s. This would allow these y 1s to be part of the 1s before the 2s, and the x 2s to be part of the 2s after the 1s. So, the contribution to the LNDS would be (y + x), but only if these 1s and 2s are connected to the rest of the array.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, the maximum possible LNDS is the original maximum plus the maximum (number of 2s in a segment of 2s followed by 1s) + (number of 1s in that segment) minus the overlap with existing 1s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire array. Let's say that there are some 1s before the segment, some 2s in the segment, then some 1s in the segment, then some 2s after the segment. Reversing the segment would make the 1s come first, then the 2s. This would allow the 1s in the segment to be added to the existing 1s before the segment, and the 2s in the segment to be added to the existing 2s after the segment. Thus, the total number of 2s after the last 1 would be (existing_2s_after_segment + number_of_2s_in_segment).\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet's precompute:\n\nprefix_ones[i]: the number of 1s in the array up to index i (exclusive? inclusive? Let's decide.)\n\nsuffix_twos[i]: the number of 2s from index i onwards.\n\nThen, for any segment [l, r], which contains x 2s and y 1s, and is such that in the original array, the segment starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s (so that reversing it would turn it into 1s followed by 2s).\n\nThen, after reversing, the number of 2s after the last 1 in the entire array would be:\n\n(number of 2s after r) + (number of 2s in the segment) + (number of 1s in the segment) ? No, wait. Because the last 1 in the modified array would be the last 1 in the reversed segment (which is the original first 1 in the segment), and the 2s in the segment are after that. Plus the existing 2s after r.\n\nBut also, the existing 1s before l would contribute to the count of 1s, and the existing 2s before l would be before the reversed segment, which now contains 1s followed by 2s. So, the 2s in the original segment are now after the 1s in the segment. But the 2s before l may be before the 1s in the reversed segment, which would create a problem.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach: the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are not preceded by any 1s in the modified array. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which is the same as the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the array. Let me call this value S.\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize S after reversing a subarray.\n\nNow, how can reversing a subarray affect S?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's say the last 1 in the original array is at position L. The number of 2s after L is T. So, S_original = c1 + T.\n\nAfter reversing a subarray, the new last 1 could be at a different position. Let's say that after reversing, the new last 1 is at position M. Then, the number of 2s after M is U. So, S_new = c1 + U.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible U.\n\nHow to find U for any reversal?\n\nLet me think about the reversed subarray [l, r]. The new array is the original array with the subarray [l, r] reversed.\n\nThe new last 1 in the array is the maximum between:\n\n- the original last 1 before l.\n\n- the last 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\n- the original last 1 after r.\n\nSimilarly, the new last 1 is the maximum of these three.\n\nSo, to compute U, which is the number of 2s after the new last 1, we need to know where this new last 1 is.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nCase 1: the new last 1 is the original last 1 before l. Then, U is the number of 2s after this position in the original array, because the reversed subarray and the part after r may have 2s that are after this position.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think of the following:\n\nFor each possible reversal [l, r], we can compute the new S as follows:\n\nnew_S = c1 + (number of 2s in the entire array that are after the new last 1).\n\nTo compute this, we need to determine the new last 1 in the modified array.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for all possible [l, r]?\n\nAn alternative idea: the new last 1 is the maximum between the original last 1 in the array (excluding the reversed subarray), and the last 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, not sure. Let me think.\n\nThe reversed subarray is [l, r], and after reversal, the elements in this subarray are reversed. So, the last 1 in this subarray is the original first 1 in the subarray (since the reversed subarray starts with the original last element of the subarray).\n\nBut this depends on the original content of the subarray.\n\nAlternatively, let's define for any subarray [l, r]:\n\noriginal_subarray = a[l..r]\n\nreversed_subarray = a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]\n\nThe last 1 in the reversed_subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original_subarray, when scanned from right to left.\n\nWait, no. The reversed subarray is the original subarray reversed. So, the first element of the reversed subarray is a[r], the second is a[r-1], ..., the last is a[l].\n\nSo, the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray when scanned from left to right (since in the reversed subarray, this would be the last element of the reversed subarray).\n\nNo, that's not correct. Let me think: suppose the original subarray is [2, 1, 2]. Reversed, it becomes [2, 1, 2] -> [2,1,2] reversed is [2, 1, 2]? No, wait, [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]? No, original is [a, b, c], reversed is [c, b, a]. So, original subarray [2,1,2] becomes [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]? No! Wait, original subarray is [2,1,2], so reversed is [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]? No, the original is [2,1,2], reversed would be [2,1,2] -> no, wait, no. Original is [2, 1, 2]. Reversed is [2, 1, 2] → no, wait, no. Wait, the original is a list of elements [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]. Reversed, it becomes [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l].\n\nSo for example, if the original subarray is [2,1,2], reversed is [2,1,2]? No, wait, the original is [2,1,2], reversed is [2,1,2]? No! No, it should be [2, 1, 2] reversed is [2, 1, 2]? Wait, no! Wait, the original is [a, b, c], reversed is [c, b, a]. So if the original subarray is [2,1,2], then the reversed subarray is [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]? No! Wait, no. The original is [2,1,2], so reversed would be [2,1,2] → no, that's not right. Wait, original elements are 2, 1, 2. Reversed, it's 2, 1, 2 → no, that's the same as original. Oh right, because it's symmetric. So if the original subarray is [2,1,2], reversing it gives the same array. So the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the same as in the original subarray.\n\nBut in general, the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray (when scanning from the end to the start). Or wait, in the reversed subarray, the elements are [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]. The last 1 in this reversed subarray is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray when scanned from the end to the beginning (i.e., from position r to l). Because in the reversed subarray, the first element is a_r, then a_{r-1}, etc. So the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray, which corresponds to the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray when scanned from the end to the beginning.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps for each subarray [l, r], we can precompute the number of 1s and 2s, and also the positions of the first 1 and last 1 in the original subarray, and similarly for the reversed subarray.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAnother idea: For any subarray [l, r], when reversed, it contributes some number of 1s and 2s. The new last 1 in the entire array could be:\n\n- the original last 1 before l.\n\n- the last 1 in the reversed subarray.\n\n- the original last 1 after r.\n\nSo, the maximum of these three.\n\nTo compute this, we need to know:\n\n- the original last 1 before l: let's say it is pos1.\n\n- the last 1 in the reversed subarray: let's say it is pos2.\n\n- the original last 1 after r: pos3.\n\nThen, the new last 1 is max(pos1, pos2, pos3).\n\nBut how to compute pos2 for any [l, r]?\n\npos2 is the position of the last 1 in the reversed subarray. Which is the position of the first 1 in the original subarray when scanned from right to left.\n\nWait, the reversed subarray is [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]. The last 1 in this reversed subarray is the last occurrence of 1 in this reversed subarray. Which is equivalent to the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray when scanned from right to left (i.e., from position r to l). So, if the original subarray has a 1 at position i (between l and r), then in the reversed subarray, it appears at position (r - i + l) ? Not sure. But the position in the original array is not important, just the existence of 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\nBut for the purpose of determining the last 1 in the reversed subarray, we need to know if there are any 1s in the reversed subarray, and where their last occurrence is.\n\nBut this seems difficult to compute for all possible [l, r].\n\nPerhaps, for each possible [l, r], we can precompute:\n\n- the number of 1s in the subarray: cnt_1.\n\n- the number of 2s in the subarray: cnt_2.\n\n- the first occurrence of 1 in the subarray when scanned from the right (i.e., the last occurrence of 1 in the original subarray).\n\nWait, if we have the original subarray, the last occurrence of 1 in the original subarray is the position where the last 1 appears. When reversed, this becomes the first occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray. And since the reversed subarray is [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l], the first occurrence of 1 in this reversed subarray is the first 1 in the reversed subarray, which corresponds to the last occurrence of 1 in the original subarray.\n\nSo, the last 1 in the reversed subarray is the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed subarray",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s.

The LNDS for such sequences can be maximized by ensuring as many 1s as possible are followed by 2s.\n2. **Key Insight**: Reversing a subarray that starts with 2s and ends with 1s can convert it into a segment of 1s followed by 2s, which contributes positively to the LNDS.\n3. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Use prefix arrays to count the number of 1s up to each position and suffix arrays to count the number of 2s from each position onwards.\n4. **Iterate Over All Possible Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, calculate the potential increase in LNDS by considering how reversing it affects the positions of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix_ones[i] = number of ones in a[0..i-1]\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix_twos[i] = number of twos in a[i..n-1]\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i + 1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_lnds = 0\n    \n    # Original case\n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = suffix_twos[0]\n    # Compute original lnds\n    # Find the last occurrence of 1\n    last_one = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            last_one = i\n    if last_one == -1:\n        max_lnds = total_ones\n    else:\n        twos_after_last_one = suffix_twos[last_one + 1]\n        max_lnds = total_ones + twos_after_last_one\n    \n    # Now consider all possible reversals\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Compute the effect of reversing [l, r]\n            # We need to find the new last one in the array after reversal\n            # To do this, we need to know:\n            # 1. the original last one before l\n            # 2. the last one in the reversed subarray\n            # 3. the original last one after r\n            \n            # original last one before l\n            pre_last_one = -1\n            for i in range(l):\n                if a[i] == 1:\n                    pre_last_one = i\n            \n            # original last one after r\n            post_last_one = -1\n            for i in range(r + 1, n):\n                if a[i] == 1:\n                    post_last_one = i\n            \n            # last one in the reversed subarray\n            # which is the first occurrence of 1 in the original subarray when scanned from right to left\n            rev_sub_last_one = -1\n            for i in range(r, l - 1, -1):\n                if a[i] == 1:\n                    rev_sub_last_one = i\n                    break\n            \n            new_last_one = -1\n            if pre_last_one != -1:\n                new_last_one = pre_last_one\n            if rev_sub_last_one != -1:\n                if new_last_one == -1 or rev_sub_last_one > new_last_one:\n                    new_last_one = rev_sub_last_one\n            if post_last_one != -1:\n                if new_last_one == -1 or post_last_one > new_last_one:\n                    new_last_one = post_last_one\n            \n            if new_last_one == -1:\n                # all are 2s\n                current = total_ones\n            else:\n                twos_after_new_last = suffix_twos[new_last_one + 1]\n                current = total_ones + twos_after_new_last\n            \n            if current > max_lnds:\n                max_lnds = current\n    \n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help quickly determine the number of 1s up to any position and the number of 2s from any position onwards.\n2. **Original LNDS Calculation**: We first compute the LNDS for the original array without any reversal.\n3. **Iterating Over Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, we determine the effect of reversing it on the positions of 1s and 2s.
