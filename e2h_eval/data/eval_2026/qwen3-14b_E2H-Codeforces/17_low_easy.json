He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings, but they could be either prefixes or suffixes). My job is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that matches these assignments.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of some possible s. But since there are multiple possibilities, how can I check which assignments are valid?\n\nLet me think. The correct approach would be to find the actual string s, then check which of the input strings are its prefixes and which are suffixes. But how do I find s?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists at least one s. So perhaps the way to find s is by looking for the unique string that has all the given prefixes and suffixes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the full string s must have all the proper prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Wait, no. Because the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, if we have both of these, then the full string s can be determined by combining the first n-1 characters (prefix) and the last n-1 characters (suffix). But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the longest prefix is P (length n-1) and the longest suffix is S (length n-1). Then, the full string s must be P + last character of S. Wait, because the prefix is length n-1, and the suffix is length n-1. The first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 characters is S. So, the first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 characters is S. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of P must be equal to the last n-2 characters of S. Because the first n-2 characters of P are the first n-2 of s, and the last n-2 of S are the same. So, the overlapping part must be the same.\n\nSo, the full string s can be constructed by taking the longest prefix (length n-1) and adding the last character of the longest suffix (length n-1). But wait, the longest suffix is of length n-1. So, the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. However, this is only possible if the first n-2 characters of the prefix and the last n-2 characters of the suffix match. Because the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, the first n-2 characters of the prefix (s[0..n-3]) must be equal to the last n-2 characters of the suffix (s[2..n-1-1] = s[2..n-2]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=5. The longest prefix is of length 4. Let's say the prefix is \"abab\", and the longest suffix is \"baba\". Then, the full string s would be the prefix (abab) plus the last character of the suffix (a), making ababa. Let's see: the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\" which is s[1..4] (since s is length 5). So the full string is ababa. Then the prefix of length 4 is abab, and the suffix of length 4 is baba. Indeed, the first four letters are abab and the last four are baba. The overlapping part is the first three letters of the prefix (aba) and the last three letters of the suffix (aba) — they match.\n\nSo, the idea is that for the full string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches these assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) can help us reconstruct the original string `s`. By combining the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix, we can form a candidate string `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: Once we have a candidate string `s`, we check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Using the validated string `s`, we determine whether each input string is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each pair of candidates for the longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Construct possible s\n        s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Check if all strings are prefixes or suffixes of s\n        valid = True\n        for st in strings:\n            if not (st == s[:len(st)] or st == s[-len(st):]):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now assign P/S based on s\n            result = []\n            for st in strings:\n                if st == s[:len(st)]:\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Constructing Candidate String**: By combining the longest prefix candidate and the last character of the longest suffix candidate, we form a potential string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: The candidate string `s` is validated by checking if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n5. **Result Construction**: Once a valid string `s` is found, each input string is classified as a prefix or suffix, and the result is printed as a string of 'P' and 'S'.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for the original string `s` and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
