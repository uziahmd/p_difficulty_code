He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given. The input gives us all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s. But we don't know which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes. Our job is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible s that fits this assignment.\n\nThe key here is that for the correct assignment, there must be a string s such that all the P's in the assignment are prefixes of s, and all the S's are suffixes of s. Also, since there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, we need to make sure that for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix, but that might not be the case. Wait no, the problem says that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for example, for n=5, there are 2 strings of length 1, 2 of length 2, etc., up to length 4. But each of these is either a prefix or a suffix. However, for the original string s, there is exactly one prefix of each length (from 1 to n-1), and similarly exactly one suffix of each length. Therefore, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings given, but only one of them can be the prefix (the actual one) and the other must be the suffix. Or maybe not? Wait, no. Because for example, for a string like \"aaa\", the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\" and the suffix of length 2 is also \"aa\". So in this case, the same string appears as both a prefix and a suffix. So in the input, for that case, there would be two entries of \"aa\" for length 2. So when processing, for each length, there are two strings, but they might be the same. So for each length, the actual prefix and suffix could be same (if the string is made of same letters), but in that case, the input will have two same strings for that length.\n\nBut how do I find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nThe approach here is to find a possible s that is consistent with the given strings. Once we have such an s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given. So for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. But since there are two strings of length n-1, one of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix. Wait, but the original string's prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So these two are different unless the entire string is made of same characters.\n\nSo perhaps the way to find s is to consider that the correct s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 (which is one of the input strings) and the suffix of length n-1 (another input string) must overlap correctly. For example, if the prefix of length n-1 is p, and the suffix of length n-1 is s, then the original string s must be p + last character, and also the first character of s must be the first character of the suffix. Wait, maybe not. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the original string is s of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the original string s must be equal to the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character. Also, the suffix of length n-1 is the prefix of length n-1 with the first character removed and the last character added. Wait, no. Let me take an example: suppose the original string is \"ababa\" (length 5). The prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". So the original string is \"ababa\" = \"abab\" + 'a', and \"baba\" is the suffix. So the original string is the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character, which is the last character of the suffix of length n-1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying a valid string `s` that is consistent with the given prefixes and suffixes, then classifying each input string accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` (of length `n-1`) must be among the given strings. We can use these to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix and suffix, we can infer the original string `s`. Specifically, the original string can be formed by taking the longest prefix and appending the last character from the longest suffix.\n3. **Classify Each String**: Once we have the original string `s`, we can check each input string to see if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s` and classify them accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each pair as prefix and suffix to find possible s\n    possible_s = None\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Try to build s\n            # The original s should be prefix_candidate + last_char\n            # where last_char is the last character of suffix_candidate\n            # Also, the first character of the suffix_candidate should be the second character of the prefix_candidate\n            # Wait, the suffix_candidate is s[1..n-1], so its first character is s[1]\n            # The prefix_candidate is s[0..n-2], so its last character is s[n-2]\n            # The original s is prefix_candidate + last_char, which is s[0..n-2] + s[n-1]\n            # The suffix_candidate is s[1..n-1], so its first character is s[1], which should be the second character of prefix_candidate\n            # So check if the first character of the suffix_candidate matches the second character of the prefix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate[-1]:\n                # Construct possible s\n                possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of possible_s\n                if possible_s[-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n                    break\n        if possible_s:\n            break\n    \n    # Now, for each string in the input, check if it's a prefix or suffix of possible_s\n    result = []\n    for s in strings:\n        is_prefix = possible_s.startswith(s)\n        is_suffix = possible_s.endswith(s)\n        if is_prefix and is_suffix:\n            # Need to decide based on the original problem's note\n            # For example, in the case where the same string is both prefix and suffix\n            # But since there are exactly two strings of each length, and for each length, one is prefix and one is suffix\n            # But how to choose?
