He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments. Our job is to find any valid assignment of P and S to the input strings.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to reconstruct the original string s. Because once we have s, we can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix. But how do we find s?\n\nLet's think: The original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix is of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. Also, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings given. But one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes. So for the original string s, all possible prefixes (length 1 to n-1) and all possible suffixes (same lengths) are present in the input. But the input doesn't tell us which is which. So our job is to assign each of these 2n-2 strings as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists a string s that satisfies all the assignments.\n\nSo the approach is to find a way to determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes, such that when we combine them, they form a consistent s.\n\nHow can we find s? Well, the original string s must have the property that:\n\n- All the prefixes assigned as P must be actual prefixes of s.\n- All the suffixes assigned as S must be actual suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do we find s? One idea is that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in a way that allows us to reconstruct s.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a candidate for the longest prefix (let's say it's a string of length n-1). Then the original string s would be that prefix plus one character. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) would be the original string's last n-1 characters. So combining these two, perhaps we can find s.\n\nBut since we don't know which of the input strings are the longest prefix or suffix, maybe we can try all possibilities. However, since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be feasible.\n\nLet me think. The key idea here is that the original string s must have the following properties:\n\n- The longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the original string s must be of length n. Therefore, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must overlap in such a way that their combination gives s.\n\nFor example, suppose the longest prefix is P (length n-1), and the longest suffix is S (length n-1). Then, the original string s must be P + c, where c is the last character. Also, since S is a suffix of s, then S must be equal to the last n-1 characters of s, which is the last n-1 characters of P + c. That is, S must be equal to the substring P[1:] + c. Therefore, S must be equal to P[1:] + c. But since P is of length n-1, then P[1:] is of length n-2, and adding c makes it length n-1. So S must be equal to P[1:] + c. Which implies that c is the last character of S. Also, since S is the suffix of length n-1, then the first character of S is s[1], and so on.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original string s must be such that:\n\ns = (longest prefix) + last character.\n\nBut also, the longest suffix is the last n-1 characters of s, which is (longest prefix)[1:] + last character.\n\nTherefore, if we can find a pair of strings (one being the longest prefix, another the longest suffix) such that the longest suffix equals (longest prefix)[1:] + last character, then we can reconstruct s.\n\nBut how do we find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and the longest suffix? Well, the input has exactly two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates. For each of these two, we can assume that one is the longest prefix and the other is the longest suffix. Then check if they",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` by considering the longest prefix and suffix provided in the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The input contains exactly two strings of length `n-1`, which are the longest improper prefixes and suffixes of the original string `s`. We need to check both possibilities (each as a prefix and the other as a suffix) to determine the correct original string `s`.\n\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: For each candidate pair of longest prefix and suffix, check if they can be combined to form a valid string `s`. This is done by ensuring that the suffix matches the substring formed by removing the first character of the prefix and appending the last character of the suffix.\n\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once a valid `s` is found, verify all given strings to check if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n4. **Generate Result**: Based on the validation, assign 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes to each input string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n    \n    # Try each possible combination for the two longest strings\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[i]\n        suffix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[1 - i]\n        \n        # Reconstruct the possible original string s\n        # s should be prefix_candidate + last_char\n        # Also, suffix_candidate should be the last n-1 characters of s\n        # Which is prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n        # So suffix_candidate must equal prefix_candidate[1:] + last_char\n        # Therefore, last_char is suffix_candidate[-1]\n        last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n        s_candidate = prefix_candidate + last_char\n        \n        # Check if suffix_candidate matches the last n-1 chars of s_candidate\n        if s_candidate[-(n-1):] != suffix_candidate:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now, check if all the given strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate\n        # We need to assign P/S to each input string\n        # First, collect all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate\n        prefixes = set()\n        suffixes = set()\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            prefixes.add(s_candidate[:l])\n            suffixes.add(s_candidate[-l:])\n        \n        # Now, for each string in the input, check if it's in prefixes or suffixes\n        # But since there are duplicates, we need to count occurrences\n        # However, the problem says that the input has exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\n        # So we need to assign for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix\n        \n        # Create a list of tuples (string, is_prefix)\n        assignment = []\n        for s in strings:\n            if s in prefixes:\n                assignment.append('P')\n                prefixes.remove(s)\n            elif s in suffixes:\n                assignment.append('S')\n                suffixes.remove(s)\n            else:\n                # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                pass\n        \n        # Check if all are assigned\n        if len(prefixes) == 0 and len(suffixes) == 0:\n            print(''.join(assignment))\n            return\n    \n    # If no valid s found (though problem says it's guaranteed)\n    # But for safety, fallback (should not happen)\n    print(''.join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2 * n - 2)]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Longest Candidates**: The two longest strings (of length `n-1`) are identified.\n3. **Reconstructing String `s`**: For each combination of these longest candidates, the original string `s` is reconstructed by checking if the suffix matches the required substring derived from the prefix.\n4. **Validation**: Once a valid `s` is found, all input strings are checked against the prefixes and suffixes of `s` to determine their classification.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed as a string of 'P' and 'S' based on the validated classifications.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each input string while adhering to the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.",
