He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. But how do we figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The input gives me all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some unknown string s. Each of these strings is either a prefix or a suffix of s. But they are mixed up, and I have to assign each one as P or S such that there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nSo the key here is to find a way to determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. Since the original string s is unique (or not?), but the problem says that it's possible that multiple s could fit, but we just need to find any valid assignment.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For example, in the first sample input, the correct string is ababa. The prefixes of length 1 to 4 are: a, ab, aba, abab. The suffixes are: a, ba, aba, baba. But the input includes all of these, but mixed. So the problem is to assign each of the input strings to be either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how do I find which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes? Well, the main idea is that the original string s must be such that:\n\n- All the prefixes assigned as P must be prefixes of s.\n- All the suffixes assigned as S must be suffixes of s.\n- Also, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be the first n-1 characters of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be the last n-1 characters of s. But since the input has two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix (the first n-1 letters of s) and the other must be the suffix (the last n-1 letters of s). Wait, but for example, if s is \"ababa\", then the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\" and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\".\n\nSo for the case of the longest possible strings (length n-1), there are two of them. Exactly one of them must be the prefix (the first n-1 letters) and the other must be the suffix (the last n-1 letters). But how can we determine which is which?\n\nWait, but if we can find the correct s, then we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, since we don't know s, perhaps we can reconstruct s from the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the correct combination of which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes such that the following conditions hold:\n\n- The set of all prefixes (those marked as P) must be all the prefixes of s.\n- Similarly for the suffixes (marked as S).\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nAnother observation: The original string s must have a prefix of length n-1, which is the first n-1 characters of s. Also, the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. Now, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap. For example, if s is \"ababa\" (length 5), the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". The concatenation of the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 would have overlapping parts. But how does that help?\n\nBut here's an idea: The actual string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1). Let me think. Suppose that the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the original string s must be such that P is the first n-1 letters, and S is the last n-1 letters. Therefore, the first n-2 letters of P must be the same as the last n-2 letters of S. Because the first n-1 letters of s and the last n-1 letters of s overlap in the middle. For example, if s is of length 5, then the first 4 letters (prefix) and the last 4 letters (suffix) must share the 3rd and 4th letters. So the first 4 letters are a b a b, and the last 4 letters are b a b a. The overlapping part is the third and fourth letters of the prefix (a and b) which should be the same as the second and third letters of the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` using the longest possible prefixes and suffixes provided and then validating all other strings against this reconstructed string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) are crucial because they help in reconstructing the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the longest prefix and suffix, we can determine the original string by ensuring that the overlapping parts of the prefix and suffix match.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once the original string is reconstructed, check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of this reconstructed string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of the two candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Reconstruct the original string\n            # The original string should be prefix_candidate + last character of suffix_candidate\n            # Because the prefix of length n-1 is first n-1 characters, and the suffix of length n-1 is last n-1\n            # So the original string is prefix_candidate + (suffix_candidate[-1])\n            # But also, the first n-1 characters of the original string is prefix_candidate\n            # The last n-1 characters is suffix_candidate\n            # Therefore, the original string must be prefix_candidate[0...n-2] + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # But also, the suffix_candidate's first n-2 characters must be the same as the prefix_candidate's last n-2 characters\n            if prefix_candidate[-(len_n_minus_1 - 1):] == suffix_candidate[:len_n_minus_1 - 1]:\n                s_reconstructed = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check if all the strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_reconstructed\n                # For each string in the input, check if it is a prefix or suffix\n                # Then assign P or S accordingly\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s_reconstructed.startswith(s_str)\n                    is_suffix = s_reconstructed.endswith(s_str)\n                    # Since the input contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes, one of them must be true\n                    if is_prefix:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        result.append('S')\n                # Now check if the counts are correct\n                if result.count('P') == n - 1 and result.count('S') == n - 1:\n                    print(''.join(result))\n                    return\n    \n    # If no combination found (though the problem says it is guaranteed), fallback (should not happen)\n    print('P' * (n-1) + 'S' * (n-1))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` which are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: By checking the overlap between the longest prefix and suffix candidates, we reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each string from the input is checked against the reconstructed string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of the longest proper prefixes and suffixes.",
