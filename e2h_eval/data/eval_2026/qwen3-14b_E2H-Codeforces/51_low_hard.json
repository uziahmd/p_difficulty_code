Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is a pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the first two names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host names. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenated string of the first two lines (guest + host) has exactly the same characters as the third line, with the same counts.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. One way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then count the frequency of each character. Then take the third string and count the frequency. If both counts are equal, then output YES, else NO.\n\nYes. But how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, we can use the collections.Counter class for this. Because Counter will count the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string.\n4. Create a Counter for the third line.\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both have the same counts for all characters, then they are considered equal.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, if the combined length of the first two strings is different from the third string's length. Then immediately return NO. Because even if the counts are same, but the total letters are different, that's impossible.\n\nWait, but the Counter comparison would take care of that. Because if the total letters are different, then the counts would differ. For example, if the combined string has length 5 and the third has 6, then the Counters would have different totals. So comparing the Counters directly would handle that.\n\nBut maybe checking the lengths first could be an optimization. But for the problem's constraints (each line up to 100 characters), it's not necessary. But perhaps better to check the lengths first, since it's a quick check. For example, if len(guest + host) != len(pile), then return NO immediately. Otherwise proceed.\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's better to do that. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way the Counters can be equal. So adding that check first could save some processing time, but for small input sizes, it's negligible.\n\nBut for code correctness, perhaps better to check the lengths first. Let me think: For example, if the combined length is 5 and the pile is 5 letters, but the counts don't match. Then the code would return NO. But if the lengths are different, then the code can immediately return NO.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # compare counts\n    from collections import Counter\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict. So comparing two Counters with == would check if all the counts are equal. So that should work.\n\nBut what about the case where the combined string has a certain count, and the pile has the same counts? For example, if the combined is 'AAB' and pile is 'ABA', then Counter would be same. So yes.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see the length. Let me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) ?\n\nWait S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S: that's 10 letters. D E D M O R O Z is 8 letters. Total 18 letters. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: Let's count letters. Well, perhaps the length is same as 10 + 8 = 18. So the code would check the length first. Then compare the counts.\n\nIn the first sample, the code returns YES.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJO",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: Immediately check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, print \"NO\" as it is impossible to form the names with different lengths.\n3. **Character Count Comparison**: Use a character count comparison to check if both the combined names and the pile have the same frequency of each character. This is efficiently done using Python's `collections.Counter` which counts the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency and correctness, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.\n- **Combined Length Check**: Before performing any detailed checks, we first compare the lengths of the combined guest and host names with the pile. This quick check helps in immediately ruling out cases where the lengths do not match.\n- **Character Count Comparison**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If both counters are equal, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, hence we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and character composition requirements, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
