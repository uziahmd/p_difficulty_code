Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's like a conservation of flow.\n2. The source has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that? Also, the given ci values are already the flow amounts for each edge, so we just need to assign directions such that the flow is valid and maximum.\n\nLet me think. Since the original graph is undirected, but the flow is already determined (the ci's are given as part of the max flow), we need to find a direction for each edge that satisfies the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nFirst, considering the flow conservation. For each node except 1 and n, the total inflow equals outflow. For node 1, all edges must be outgoing (since no incoming). For node n, all edges must be incoming (since the sink can't have outgoing edges in a max flow, but maybe that's not necessarily the case? Wait, the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the sink can have outgoing edges, but the flow is such that the total flow into the sink equals the maximum flow. However, in our case, since the flow is already fixed (ci's are given), we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is to think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that for each node except source and sink, the net flow is zero.\n\nSo, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of the flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So the direction assignment must result in a DAG. But how to ensure that?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph with a topological order. For example, if we can arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last, and edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. That would prevent cycles.\n\nBut how to assign directions based on that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as building a directed graph where the direction of each edge is determined by the flow's direction, and the graph is a DAG. But how?\n\nWait, another idea. Let's think about the flow as a directed graph. For the flow to be valid, the net outflow from the source is the total maximum flow, and the net inflow to the sink is the same. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut since the problem says that the given ci's are part of a maximum flow, perhaps the sum of the flows on edges leaving the source must equal the maximum flow, and similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how does that help us assign directions?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network. The given ci's are the flow values on each edge. Now, for each edge, the direction must be such that for any node except 1 and n, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nBut how to model this? For each node, the sum of ci for edges directed into it minus the sum of ci for edges directed out of it must be zero for nodes 2 to n-1. For node 1, the sum of ci for edges directed out of it minus those directed into it is equal to the total flow (which is the value of the max flow). For node n, it's the opposite.\n\nBut how do I find the direction of each edge?\n\nThis seems like a problem of assigning directions to edges such that the flow conservation is satisfied. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of the edges as having a certain direction, and for each node, the sum of flows going out must equal the sum going in (except for source and sink). Let's model this as a system of equations. However, with m variables (each edge direction) and n equations (for each node's balance), but solving this seems computationally heavy for large n and m.\n\nBut given the constraints of the problem, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother observation: since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions such that the graph is acyclic, perhaps we can build a DAG with a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and edges are directed from earlier nodes to later ones. This would automatically satisfy the acyclicity condition.\n\nMoreover, if we can assign directions according to this topological order, then for each node, the inflow and outflow",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies flow conservation conditions for all vertices except the source and sink, and the graph remains acyclic. The solution involves constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using a topological sort approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.\n2. **Topological Sorting**: Use a topological sort to determine an order of vertices such that all edges go from earlier vertices to later vertices in this order. This ensures the graph remains acyclic.\n3. **Flow Assignment**: Based on the topological order, assign directions to edges such that edges point from earlier vertices to later vertices in the topological order. This ensures acyclicity and satisfies the flow conservation constraints implicitly through the structure of the DAG.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Build a DAG with topological order starting from node 1\n    # We can use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for a, b, _ in edges:\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Compute in-degrees for each node\n    for a, b, _ in edges:\n        in_degree[b] += 1\n        in_degree[a] += 1\n    \n    # Since the graph is undirected, we need to build a directed version based on topological sort\n    # However, Kahn's algorithm requires a directed graph.
