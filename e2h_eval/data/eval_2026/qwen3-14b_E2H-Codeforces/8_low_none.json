Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about assigning directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are:\n\n- The flow must be a maximum flow, which implies that the flow conservation holds for all vertices except the source (vertex 1) and sink (vertex n).\n- The directed graph must not have cycles.\n- The source has no incoming edges, and the sink has no outgoing edges (I think? Well, the problem says for vertex 1, no incoming edges. For the sink, maybe it's implied that outgoing edges are allowed, but the flow conservation only applies to intermediate nodes.)\n\nSo the input gives us the flow values for each edge, and we need to assign directions to them. The output is for each edge, whether it's directed as ai→bi (0) or bi→ai (1).\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Since the flow is already determined (the ci's are given), the direction assignment must satisfy the flow conservation. But how?\n\nLet me think: For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows entering must equal the sum leaving. Also, the directed graph must be acyclic. Hmm. So perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds.\n\nWait, but how to assign directions to edges so that the flow is valid. Let's think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) must be zero. But since each edge contributes to either incoming or outgoing, depending on direction.\n\nBut the problem says that the flow is already maximum, so the sum of flows from the source to the sink must be maximum. However, our task is not to compute the maximum flow but to assign directions to edges such that the flow is correct and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to model the flow as a directed graph, ensuring that the flow conservation holds and that the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can think of it as having a topological order. If we can assign directions such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order, then the graph is acyclic. Then, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order and assign directions accordingly.\n\nBut how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen so that the flow conservation holds. But how to find such directions.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the total flow going into v must equal the total flow going out of v. Let's denote for each node, the sum of flows on edges incident to it. But since each edge is directed, for each edge, it contributes to either the outflow or inflow of its endpoints.\n\nLet me think of the flow conservation as follows. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Let's denote that as:\n\nsum_{edges directed out of v} ci = sum_{edges directed into v} ci.\n\nBut since each edge is either directed into or out of v, the total sum of ci for edges incident to v is fixed. Let me call this total_sum[v]. Then, for the flow conservation, the sum of outgoing flows must equal the sum of incoming flows. Which implies that the total_sum[v] must be even? No, wait. Because sum_out = sum_in. So total_sum[v] = sum_out + sum_in = 2 * sum_out. Therefore, total_sum[v] must be even. Wait, but the problem says that a solution exists, so this must be guaranteed by the input. So for each node except source and sink, the sum of all ci's of edges incident to it must be even. Because sum_out equals sum_in, so total_sum[v] must be even.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, perhaps the problem is that the flow conservation is automatically satisfied once we assign directions correctly. But how to find those directions.\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected and the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow. But how?\n\nWait, but the flow is already given. The problem states that the flow is a maximum flow. So the given ci's are the flow values. So the problem reduces to finding a direction for each edge such that:\n\n- For each intermediate node, the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving.\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n- Source has no incoming edges.\n\nSo the challenge is to find such a direction.\n\nNow, considering that the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can perform",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies flow conservation conditions for all intermediate vertices, has no cycles, and the source vertex has no incoming edges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each intermediate vertex (not the source or sink), the sum of flows entering must equal the sum of flows leaving. This implies that the total flow through the edges incident to each intermediate vertex must be even.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic. To ensure this, we can use a topological sorting approach where we process vertices in a specific order and assign edge directions accordingly.\n3. **Topological Order**: We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to determine a topological order of the vertices. This order ensures that all edges go from earlier vertices to later vertices in the order, thus avoiding cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # We need to assign directions such that the directed graph is acyclic\n    # and flow conservation holds for intermediate nodes.\n\n    # First, compute for each node the total flow of its edges\n    total_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        total_flow[a] += c\n        total_flow[b] += c\n\n    # Since the solution exists, we don't need to check for validity.\n\n    # Now, build a directed graph with directions to be determined.\n    # We will perform a DFS to find a topological order, and assign directions accordingly.\n\n    # However, since the graph is undirected, we need to construct a DAG with directions.\n    # We can use a modified DFS to assign directions based on the order of visitation.\n\n    # To avoid cycles, we can assign directions from parent to child in the DFS tree.\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction (ai -> bi), 1 means reversed\n\n    # We'll use a recursive DFS to assign directions\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        visited[u] = True\n        for v, idx in graph[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                # Assign direction from u to v\n                a, b, c = edges[idx]\n                if a == u and b == v:\n                    direction[idx] = 0\n                elif b == u and a == v:\n                    direction[idx] = 1\n                else:\n                    # This should not happen as the graph is undirected and stored correctly\n                    pass\n                dfs(v, u)\n            elif v != parent:\n                # This is a back edge; we need to decide direction\n                # Since we are building a DAG, we can direct it from u to v if u is processed before v\n                # But how to know which one comes first in topological order?\n                # Maybe we need to track the order in which nodes are visited and assign directions based on that\n                pass\n\n    # However, the above approach may not work because we need to ensure flow conservation.\n    # Alternative idea: Treat the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and assign directions such that the flow conservation holds.\n\n    # Another approach is to model this as a directed graph where we can assign directions based on the flow values and topological sort.\n\n    # Let's try to build a DAG by using a topological sort.
