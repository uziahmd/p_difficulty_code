He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nFirst, A has a string of some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have a certain structure. Let me break down the conditions.\n\nFirst, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Because:\n\n- After A and B's steps, there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's. So the final string must have at least one of each.\n\nSo first check: if any of the counts of a, b, c is zero, then it's invalid. So for example, if the string has no 'c's, then it's automatically NO. Or if there are no 'a's, etc. Wait, no. Let me think again. The original string from A is all 'a's. Then B adds 'b's. So the string before adding 'c's has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. So the input string must have all three letters. So if the input string is missing any of them, return NO.\n\nSo first step: check if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If not, output NO.\n\nThen, the next part is checking the counts. Let's think about the counts of a, b, c.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, according to the process:\n\nThe original string (before adding 'c's) has count_a_original = count_a, count_b_original = count_b. Then C adds count_c = either count_a_original or count_b_original. So count_c must be equal to count_a_original or count_b_original.\n\nBut wait, the original string before adding 'c's is the string after B's step. Which is A's original string (all a's) plus B's added b's. So the count_a_original is the original count of a's (say, x), and count_b_original is the count of b's (say, y). Then C adds z c's, where z is equal to x or y. So in the final string, the count_c is z. So the count_c must be equal to x or y. But x is the original count of a's, which is the same as the current count of a's (since no a's were added after that). Similarly for y. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But since the original count of a's is the same as the current count of a's (since no a's were added after A's step), and same for b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but in the final string, the count of a's is the same as the original count from A, because B only added b's and C added c's. Similarly for b's. So the count of a's in the final string is the same as the original count of a's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the condition is count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, we need to make sure that the order of characters is correct. Because the string must consist of a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because:\n\nA's string is all a's. Then B appends b's. Then C appends c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, if the string is 'aabbc', that's okay. But 'ababcc' would not be allowed, since the a's and b's are interleaved.\n\nSo the second condition is that the string is composed of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Check that the string contains at least one a, b, and c. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So that all a's come first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n3. Check that the count of c's is equal to count of a's or count of b's.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, for the first condition, check that the counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nSecond, check the order. How to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*?\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo, perhaps we can iterate through the string and check the transitions.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string is made of three parts:\n\n- All a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, the string can be split into three parts. For example, the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then the next part is all c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked as follows:\n\nCheck that all characters before the first 'b' are 'a's. Then, after the first 'b', all characters before the first 'c' are 'b's. Then, after the first 'c', all are 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. Since 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the string must be in order such that the characters are non-decreasing. But that's not exactly the case. For example, the string 'aabbaacc' would have a's followed by b's followed by c's, but the 'bb' is allowed. However, the string 'abac' would not be allowed, as after the first 'a' and 'b', there's an 'a' again. So the order must be strictly a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, the way to check this is:\n\n- The string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, for example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, perhaps we can check that the string is in the form of a*b*c*.\n\nTo implement this, we can check that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters between the first 'b' and the first 'c' are 'b's.\n\n- All characters after the first 'c' are 'c's.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be divided into three parts. Let's find the index where the first 'b' occurs. Then, check that all characters before that index are 'a's. Then, find the index where the first 'c' occurs. Check that all characters between the first 'b' and first 'c' are 'b's. Then, check that all characters after the first 'c' are 'c's.\n\nBut what if there are no 'b's? Well, in that case, the first condition (checking that there is at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c') would have failed. So we can assume that the string has at least one 'b'.\n\nSimilarly for 'c's.\n\nSo, here's a plan for checking the order:\n\nFind the first occurrence of 'b' in the string. All characters before that must be 'a's. Then, find the first occurrence of 'c' in the string. All characters between the first 'b' and first 'c' must be 'b's. Then, all characters after the first 'c' must be 'c's.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\ns = input string.\n\nCheck that all the a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string is in the order of a's, then b's, then c's. So the string can be split into three parts, and each part consists of only one character.\n\nSo for example, the string can be checked by checking that the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then the next part is all c's.\n\nSo, for example, the code can be written as:\n\nif the string is not composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's, then return NO.\n\nHow to check this?\n\nWe can check that the string is in non-decreasing order of characters. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c', so the string must be in non-decreasing order. Wait, but that's not exactly the case. For example, the string 'aabbc' is in non-decreasing order. But 'aabcc' is also non-decreasing. However, if the string is 'abac', then it's not non-decreasing. But the problem is that the string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the entire string must be in non-decreasing order. Because once you have a 'b', you can't have an 'a' again. Similarly, once you have a 'c', you can't have a 'b' or 'a' again.\n\nSo, the string must be in non-decreasing order. Because the order of the characters is a's first, then b's, then c's. So, the entire string is non-decreasing. So checking that the string is in non-decreasing order would ensure that the order is correct.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. For example, the string 'aabbaacc' is non-decreasing. But that's allowed. Because the a's are first, then b's, then c's. But the string 'aabbaacc' is allowed. So yes, the entire string must be non-decreasing. So checking that the string is non-decreasing is equivalent to checking that the order is correct.\n\nBut how to check that the string is non-decreasing?\n\nIn Python, for each i from 0 to len(s)-2, check that s[i] <= s[i+1]. If any of them is not, then return False.\n\nBut for the problem, this would be a valid check. Because the string must be in order a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the entire string must be non-decreasing.\n\nYes. So, for example, the string 'aabc' is non-decreasing. The string 'abac' is not. So this check would work.\n\nSo combining all the conditions:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Check that the string has at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of them is missing, return NO.\n\n2. Check that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\n3. Check that the count of 'c's is equal to count of 'a's or count of 'b's.\n\nIf all three conditions are satisfied, return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So that's okay. Also, the string is non-decreasing. And all three letters are present. So returns YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The string is not non-decreasing. Because the third character is 'a' which comes after 'b's. So the check for non-decreasing would fail. Hence returns NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. The count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So that's okay. The string is non-decreasing. All three letters are present. So returns YES.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck if the counts of a, b, c are all >=1. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is non-decreasing, but the count of c is not equal to a or b?\n\nLike, for example, 'aaabbbc' → counts are a:3, b:3, c:1. Then count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → counts are a:2, b:2, c:1. So count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nBut the string is non-decreasing and has all three letters. So the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the steps in Python.\n\nFirst, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nThen check if all counts are at least 1.\n\nThen check if the string is non-decreasing.\n\nThen check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut how to check if the string is non-decreasing?\n\nIn Python, for the string s, we can loop through each character and check that each is <= the next.\n\nSo:\n\nfor i in range(len(s)-1):\n\n    if s[i] > s[i+1]:\n\n        return False\n\nBut for the code, we can write this as a helper function.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    check if the string is non-decreasing.\n\n    if not, print \"NO\"\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, let's think about the example where the string is 'aabbcc' (counts a=2, b=2, c=2). Then count_c is equal to a and b. So it's allowed. So returns YES.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. So count_c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abccc'? Then count_c is 3, which is not equal to a (1) or b (1). So returns NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the order check?\n\nFor example, the string 'abba' → but since it has 'b's followed by 'a's, which is not non-decreasing. So the code would catch that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\ncount_a = 3, count_b = 1, count_c=3. All counts >=1.\n\nCheck non-decreasing: 'a','a','a','b','c','c','c' → yes.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b','b','a','c','c'. The check for non-decreasing would fail, since 'b' is followed by 'a' (i=1, s[1] is 'b', s[2] is 'a', which is less than 'b'). So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=1. All counts >=1. String is 'a','a','b','c' → non-decreasing. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So returns YES.\n\nSo the code would handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. Non-decreasing. count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns YES.\n\nCase 2: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. Non-decreasing. count_c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nCase 3: 'ab' → but count_c is 0. So returns NO.\n\nCase 4: 'ac' → count_b is 0. So returns NO.\n\nCase 5: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. count_c is equal to a and b. So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_c is 4, which is equal to a (4) and b (4). So returns YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabccc' → count_a is 4, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nBut the string is non-decreasing, and has all three letters.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbcc' → count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=2. So count_c equals a (2). So returns YES.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, in Python:\n\nRead the string from input.\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen compute counts.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # check non-decreasing\n\n    is_non_decreasing = True\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-1):\n\n        if s[i] > s[i+1]:\n\n            is_non_decreasing = False\n\n            break\n\n    if not is_non_decreasing:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' (non-decreasing, counts a=2, b=2, c=2). So count_c is equal to both a and b. So returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → a=1, b=2, c=3. count_c is 3, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abcc' → a=1, b=1, c=2. count_c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nTesting first input 'aaabccc':\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. All non-zero. Check non-decreasing: yes. count_c equals count_a → YES.\n\nSecond input 'bbacc' → the string is 'b','b','a','c','c'. The check for non-decreasing would find that the third character is 'a' which is less than the previous 'b' → so is_non_decreasing is False → output NO.\n\nThird input 'aabc' → counts are 2,1,1. non-decreasing. count_c is 1 equals count_b (1) → YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → the string is not non-decreasing (the third character is 'b' after 'a'?), no. Wait, 'abba' is a, b, b, a. The third character is 'b', fourth is 'a' → which is less than 'b', so the code would detect that. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → counts a=1, b=3, c=1. So count_c is 1, which equals a's count. So returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. So count_c equals a's count. So returns YES.\n\nBut the string is non-decreasing. So yes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So count_c is 2, which is equal to a and b. So returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'a' → count_b and count_c are zero. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → count_b is zero → returns NO.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be formed by first having some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: Ensure the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Check Non-Decreasing Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's must come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This ensures the correct sequence of appending operations.\n3. **Check Count Conditions**: The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    is_non_decreasing = True\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        if s[i] > s[i + 1]:\n            is_non_decreasing = False\n            break\n    if not is_non_decreasing:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Presence Check**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Non-Decreasing Order Check**: The code iterates through the string to ensure that each character is less than or equal to the next character.
