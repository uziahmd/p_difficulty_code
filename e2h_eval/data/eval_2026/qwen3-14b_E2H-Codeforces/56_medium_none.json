Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that the line segments connecting each pair don't intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible matchings?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point is that any two line segments (from spaceship to base) must not cross each other. So for a given matching, we have to check all pairs of line segments to ensure they don't intersect.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a computational geometry method for that. Let me recall. Two line segments AB and CD intersect if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and similarly for C and D with respect to A and B. Also, need to handle cases where points are colinear but overlapping. But wait, the problem says that no three points are on the same line. Oh, right! Because the input states that no three points are colinear. That simplifies things because any two line segments can't have overlapping parts, except possibly at endpoints. But since the problem says that no two points coincide, so any two line segments can't share an endpoint unless they are connected to the same point, which isn't possible in a perfect matching (since each spaceship and base is used once).\n\nWait, but in the matching, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So each line segment is between a unique spaceship and a unique base. So for two different pairs (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), their line segments can't share endpoints. So when checking if two line segments intersect, we can ignore the case where they share an endpoint. Because in that case, the segments would be connected to the same spaceship or base, but since each is matched once, that's not possible. So for two different pairs, their line segments are between distinct points.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for any two line segments in the matching whether they cross each other. If any pair does, then that matching is invalid.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B are up to 10, but for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So first, if R != B, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo first check if R != B, then output No. Otherwise, generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. For each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments in the matching are non-intersecting. If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut how to generate all possible permutations? Well, if there are R spaceships and R bases, then the number of possible matchings is R! which for R=10 is 3.6 million. Wait 10! is 3,628,800. For R=10, that's manageable? Well, for each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments. How many pairs? For R=10, each matching has R line segments. The number of pairs is R*(R-1)/2. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, check if they intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, the checking would be O(R^2) operations. For 10! permutations, that's about 3.6 million * 45 = around 160 million operations. That's acceptable for Python? Maybe. But perhaps there's a smarter way. However, given that R is small (up to 10), it's manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nElse:\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. For example, if there are R spaceships and R bases, each permutation represents a possible assignment where the i-th spaceship is assigned to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose we have R spaceships and R bases. Each permutation is a way to assign each spaceship to a unique base. So for example, if the spaceships are S = [s1, s2, s3], and bases B = [b1, b2, b3], then a permutation (like [b2, b1, b3]) would mean s1 is assigned to b2, s2 to b1, s3 to b3. So for each permutation of the bases, we can generate the matching.\n\nBut how to generate all possible permutations? Well, the number of permutations is R! and for each, we can check if the matching is valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of spaceships to bases):\n\n   For each pair of line segments in the matching (i.e., for each pair of (s_i, b_perm[i]) and (s_j, b_perm[j]) where i < j):\n\n      Check if the two line segments intersect.\n\n   If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid. Else, it's valid. Once a valid permutation is found, return Yes.\n\nIf none of the permutations are valid, return No.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic, including the line segment intersection check.\n\nSo next, implement the line segment intersection check.\n\nHow to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\n- Check if the two segments AB and CD intersect by checking the orientations of the points.\n\nThe orientation of three points p, q, r is determined by the cross product of vectors (q-p) and (r-p). The value can be positive, negative, or zero. But since the input ensures that no three points are colinear, we don't have to handle the zero case here.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD:\n\nCompute orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D. If the orientations are different, then the segments may intersect. Similarly compute orientation of C, D, A and C, D, B. If they are different, then the segments may intersect. If both conditions are met, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut wait, this is the case when the segments cross each other. However, there's also the case where one segment's endpoint lies on the other segment. But according to the problem statement, since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if a point C lies on AB, then the three points A, B, C would be colinear. Which is not allowed. So in our case, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, not if one's endpoint lies on the other.\n\nTherefore, the line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if the orientations (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and orientations (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different.\n\nSo the code for checking whether two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    # returns the orientation of A, B, C\n    # positive if counter-clockwise, negative if clockwise, zero if colinear\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A,B,C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A,B,D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C,D,A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C,D,B)\n    # if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the segments is entirely contained within the other? But given the problem's constraints, that's not possible. Because if AB and CD are such that C is on AB, then the three points A,B,C would be colinear, which is prohibited. Therefore, the above condition should be sufficient.\n\nSo the function segments_intersect returns True if the two segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments in the matching. If any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, print No.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation corresponds to a possible assignment of the R spaceships to the B bases, but since R=B, it's a permutation of the bases).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   For each pair of indices i < j:\n\n      Check if the line segment between spaceship i and base perm[i] intersects with the line segment between spaceship j and base perm[j].\n\n   If any such pair exists, break and try the next permutation.\n\nIf any permutation passes all checks, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is for the bases. For example, suppose the spaceships are stored in a list called rebels, and the bases in a list called bases. Then, for a permutation p (which is a list of indices of bases?), or perhaps the permutation is a list of the bases in some order. Wait, the code needs to generate all possible assignments of each spaceship to a unique base. So, for example, if we have R = 3, and the bases are [b1, b2, b3], then each permutation of the bases would represent a possible assignment. For example, the permutation [b2, b1, b3] would mean that the first spaceship is assigned to b2, the second to b1, the third to b3.\n\nBut how to generate permutations of the bases. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for example, for the list bases, itertools.permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings. So each permutation is a tuple of the bases in a certain order. Then, for the i-th spaceship (rebels[i]), we assign it to permutation[i].\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input for the first example is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen the bases are:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the rebels are [ (0,0), (2,0), (3,1) ]\n\nthe bases are [ (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) ]\n\nIn the sample explanation, connecting them in order would work. So the first rebel is connected to first base, second to second, third to third. So the permutation would be the same as the original order of the bases.\n\nSo generating all permutations of the bases, and for each permutation, check if the matching is valid.\n\nBut in Python, the itertools.permutations function returns all possible orderings of the bases. So for the bases list, each permutation is a possible assignment.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for the bases, each permutation is a possible way to assign each spaceship to a base. For example, if the permutation is (base_0, base_1, base_2), then spaceship 0 is assigned to base_0, etc. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code would generate all permutations of the bases, and for each permutation, check if all the line segments between rebels[i] and perm[i] are non-intersecting.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R lines of rebel coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation:\n\n   For all pairs i < j:\n\n      check if the segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\n   If any pair intersects, break and try next permutation.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the problem is that for permutations, the code may take time. For R=10, 10! is 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, checking the intersection. So for each permutation, 45 checks.\n\nBut for Python, even with that, it's manageable. Let's think: 3.6 million * 45 is 162 million operations. Each operation is a few calculations. But Python is not the fastest, but for small R (like up to 10), it's acceptable. Let's see. For R=10, perhaps the code would run in acceptable time.\n\nBut what about for R=10, the worst case where all permutations are checked. But given that the constraints are small, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the ccw function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut note that in the code, the rebels and bases are lists of tuples. For example, rebels = [ (x1, y1), ... ] and bases = [ (x1, y1), ... ].\n\nNow, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(bases):\n\n   For each i in 0..R-1:\n\n      get the rebel point as rebels[i]\n\n      get the base point as perm[i]\n\n   Now, for all pairs i < j, check if the segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    # A and B are endpoints of first segment, C and D of second\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nThen, in the main code:\n\nRead input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line R and B, then R lines of xi yi for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. But the actual input for the code is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. But the sample input shows that the first example is a single test case. But the code should process one test case per input.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains R and B. Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, for example, for the first sample input, the input would be:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich would be read as:\n\nRead R=3, B=3.\n\nThen read 3 lines for rebels, then 3 for bases.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin, split into lines.\n\nBut the code may have to read multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says nothing about multiple test cases. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. Looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, which seems to be for two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but the actual problem is to process a single test case. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line R and B, then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's just a way to represent the input. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is the first test case. The second example's input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWhich is the second test case. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So the code is supposed to process a single test case. But perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases. However, the code must read from stdin, and output the correct answer for that input.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, process one test case, and output Yes or No.\n\nSo the code will read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line as R and B.\n\nThen read R lines for the rebels' coordinates.\n\nThen read B lines for the bases' coordinates.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read input\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    # The first line is R and B\n\n    R, B = map(int, lines[0].split())\n\n    if R != B:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        return\n\n    rebels = []\n\n    for i in range(1, R+1):\n\n        x, y = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n\n    bases = []\n\n    for i in range(R+1, R+1 + B):\n\n        x, y = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n\n        # For this permutation, check all pairs of segments\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(R):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n                # Get the four points: rebels[i], perm[i], rebels[j], perm[j]\n\n                A = rebels[i]\n\n                B = perm[i]\n\n                C = rebels[j]\n\n                D = perm[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n                    valid = False\n\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if valid:\n\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the 'permutations' function generates all possible orderings of the bases. However, the bases are stored as a list of tuples. But when generating permutations, each element is a tuple. So when we check perm[i], it's the base assigned to the i-th rebel.\n\nBut the code for the sample input would generate all possible permutations of the bases. For example, for the first sample input, one of the permutations is the original order of the bases, which is a valid matching.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, we check all pairs of segments. If any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nBut what about the time? For R=10, permutations would be 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs. For each pair, the segments_intersect function is called.\n\nBut in Python, this might be slow. However, given that R is up to 10, and that 10! is manageable for small cases, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize. For example, if during the checking of pairs, we can break early. For example, in the code above, for each permutation, the code loops over i from 0 to R-1, and for each i, loops j from i+1 to R-1. For each pair (i,j), check if the segments intersect. If any pair does, mark as invalid and break.\n\nBut in the code above, for each i, the inner loop is j from i+1 to R-1. For each j, check the pair (i,j). If any of these checks returns True (segments intersect), then the permutation is invalid. So, once a pair is found, we break out of the loops and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input would work. Let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the permutation where the bases are in the same order, the matching is:\n\nrebel 0 to base 0: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nrebel 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nrebel 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck all pairs of segments:\n\nCheck between (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3): Do they intersect?\n\nLet me compute the ccw values.\n\nFor AB: A=(0,0), B=(-2,1). C is (2,0), D is (0,3).\n\nCheck AB and CD.\n\nccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2; C.y - A.y = 0 - 0 = 0. \n\nB.y - A.y is 1 - 0 = 1. C.x - A.x is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo ccw1 is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nccw2 = ccw(A,B,D) where D is (0,3).\n\nC is D here. So:\n\nB.x - A.x is -2, C.y - A.y is 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1, C.x - A.x is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6.\n\nSo ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6. Their product is positive, so the first condition (ccw1 * ccw2 <0) is false. So segments AB and CD do not intersect.\n\nSimilarly, check other pairs. So for this permutation, perhaps no intersections. Hence, the code would return Yes.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the sample says that it is possible, so the code would find at least one permutation.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWait, R=2 and B=1. So R != B, hence output is No. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the second input is '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1' which is R=2, B=1. So the code would output No immediately.\n\nSo the code handles that case.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Rebels at (0,0) and (1,1). Bases at (0,1) and (1,0). Then, the possible permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,1), (1,0)] → connect (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These two segments are vertical and horizontal, but they cross? Let me see. The first segment is from (0,0) to (0,1), which is vertical. The second is from (1,1) to (1,0), vertical. They don't intersect. So this permutation is valid. So output Yes.\n\nAnother permutation is [(1,0), (0,1)]. The segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These are horizontal lines. They don't cross. So again valid.\n\nSo code would return Yes.\n\nAnother case where the segments cross. For example, rebels at (0,0), (2,2). Bases at (0,2), (2,0). If we assign the first rebel to (0,2) and the second to (2,0), then the segments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). No intersection. But if we assign the first rebel to (2,0) and the second to (0,2), then the segments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These two segments cross each other. So the code would check for this permutation. The code would detect that the segments intersect, and thus this permutation is invalid. However, there's another permutation that is valid, so the code would output Yes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this code.\n\nBut there's a possible mistake in the code: when reading the input. Let's think:\n\nThe code reads lines as:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, the first line is R and B.\n\nThen, the next R lines are rebels. Then the next B lines are bases.\n\nBut for example, in the first sample input, after the first line, there are R=3 lines for rebels, then B=3 lines for bases. So lines[0] is R and B, lines[1], lines[2], lines[3] are the rebels, then lines[4], lines[5], lines[6] are the bases.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nfor i in range(1, R+1):\n\n    read lines[i]\n\nBut if R is 3, then lines[1], lines[2], lines[3] are the rebels. Then, for bases:\n\nrange(R+1, R+1 + B) → R+1 is 4, and R+1 + B is 4 + 3 = 7. So lines[4], lines[5], lines[6].\n\nYes, correct.\n\nNow, the code for reading the input.\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple lines, but the code reads them correctly?\n\nAnother possible error is in the permutations. For example, the bases are stored as a list of tuples. When generating permutations, each permutation is a tuple of the bases. So, for example, if the bases are [(x1,y1), (x2,y2)], then permutations would generate all orderings of those tuples.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut what about the order of the points? For example, AB and CD can be checked in any order, since the function checks both orientations.\n\nYes, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nBut in the code, for the first sample input, the code would generate all permutations. One of them is the original order of the bases, which is valid.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: R=1 and B=1. Then, there's only one possible permutation. So check if the line segment between the one rebel and one base. Since there's only one segment, no intersections. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2. Rebels at (0,0), (1,0). Bases at (0,1), (1,1). Assigning (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0) to (1,1): segments are vertical, no intersection. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case where two segments cross. For example, rebels are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (2,0), (0,2). Assigning (0,0) to (2,0) and (2,2) to (0,2). The two segments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These two segments cross each other. So this permutation is invalid. However, the other permutation would be (0,0) to (0,2) and (2,2) to (2,0). Those are vertical lines, no intersection. So the code would find that permutation and output Yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, permutations are generated as tuples of the elements. So the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code uses the 'permutations' function from itertools. For R=10, this may take time, but for the constraints given, it's acceptable.\n\n- The code may have a problem with the order of the points in the segments_intersect function. But according to the logic, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: the function segments_intersect returns True if the two segments intersect. So for each pair of segments in the permutation, if any pair returns True, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, the 'segments_intersect' function is called with A, B, C, D. Where AB is the first segment, CD is the second. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the line segments connecting each pair of matched points do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying the non-intersection condition for each permutation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, immediately output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any pair of line segments (connecting a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect using computational geometry principles.\n4. **Validation**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting line segments, output \"Yes\". If no valid permutation is found, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    if not lines:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    R, B = map(int, lines[0].split())\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    rebels = []\n    for i in range(1, R + 1):\n        x, y = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n    bases = []\n    for i in range(R + 1, R + 1 + B):\n        x, y = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check for Validity**: If the number of spaceships and bases differ, output \"No\" immediately.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n4. **Checking Intersections**: For each permutation, check every pair of line segments to ensure they do not intersect using the cross product method (ccw function) to determine orientation and intersection.\n5. **Output Result**: If any valid permutation is found where all line segments do not intersect, print \"Yes\". If no valid permutation is found after checking all possibilities, print \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutation generation and geometric checks to determine the solution.",
