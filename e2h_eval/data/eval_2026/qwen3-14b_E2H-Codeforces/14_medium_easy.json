    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nWait, the key here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when you pass a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1, but sometimes more (like when passing 25, which adds two 5s). So for example, when n increases from 4 to 5, the count jumps from 0 to 1. But when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s).\n\nBut this means that for some m values, there might be multiple n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. However, there's a possibility that there are no such n's. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but according to the sample input, when m is 1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) that give exactly one trailing zero. Wait, why? Let me check:\n\nFor 5! = 120 (1 zero), 6! = 720 (1), 7! = 5040 (1), etc. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Then 10! has two zeros. So the count for m=1 is five numbers.\n\nBut how do I find for a given m, what are the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I think is to first find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there are other numbers that also give m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose that for some m, the numbers of trailing zeros increases by more than 1. For example, when n is 24, the count is 4 (floor(24/5) = 4, floor(24/25) = 0). Then 25 gives 6 (floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, total 6). So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. So for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe can think that for a given m, there exists some n_low and n_high such that for all n in [n_low, n_high], f(n) = m. But how to find these ranges?\n\nBut how to find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nAn approach is to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there's a certain range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nAnother way: For a given m, the possible n's must lie between some lower and upper bounds. For example, the minimal n that gives m trailing zeros is found by binary search. Then, once we find that n, we can check if the next numbers (n+1, etc.) also have m trailing zeros. However, since the function f(n) is non-decreasing, once it increases beyond m, there are no more n's.\n\nWait, but for example, if the minimal n that gives m is x, then the maximum n that gives m is x + k, where k is such that adding k to x doesn't increase the count. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for any n, the number of trailing zeros increases when n crosses a multiple of 5. So, the number of possible n's for a given m is either 0, 1, or 5? Or perhaps another number?\n\nWait, for example, the sample input m=1. The numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. So that's 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nBecause when n is 5, the count is 1. Then for n=6, the count remains 1. Similarly for 7,8,9. Then for 10, the count becomes 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the length of the range is 5. But why?\n\nBecause between 5 and 9, the next multiple of 5 is 10. So adding 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, each step increases n by 1, but the count of zeros increases only when you hit a multiple of 5. So for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is same.\n\nBut how to find for a given m, what's the range of n's?\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, there is a range of n's where f(n) = m. The length of this range depends on how many times the count increases when passing through multiples of 5.\n\nBut how to find this range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for a given m, there exists some n such that f(n) = m. Then, the maximum n for which f(n) = m is the largest n where f(n) = m. So the possible numbers are from the first occurrence of m to the last occurrence of m.\n\nBut how to find the first and last occurrence?\n\nLet me think about using binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then, the numbers between the first occurrence and the second occurrence minus one would be the ones with exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low. Then find the smallest n such that f(n) = m+1. Let's call this high. Then, the numbers from low to high-1 would all have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut wait, what if there is no n with f(n) = m? Then, the answer is zero.\n\nSo how to find low and high?\n\nBut how to find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Well, that's a bit tricky because the function f(n) is not strictly increasing. For example, for n=24, f(n) is 4, and for n=25, it's 6. So, there is no n for which f(n) is 5.\n\nSo, for a given m, we can check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then the numbers are from low to high-1, where low is the first occurrence, high is the first occurrence of m+1.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this n_min.\n\n2. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call this n_min_next.\n\n3. Then, the numbers between n_min and n_min_next -1 are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is (n_min_next - n_min).\n\nBut how to find n_min and n_min_next?\n\nBut how to find n_min? Because f(n) is non-decreasing. So, for example, for m, we can use binary search to find the first occurrence where f(n) = m. However, since the function may not have any value equal to m, we need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use binary search to find the lower bound and upper bound.\n\nWait, here's an approach for finding the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n for which f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, for the given m, we can perform a binary search to find the first n where f(n) = m. But perhaps that's complicated. Alternatively, we can find the lower and upper bounds for the possible n's.\n\nWait, for example, the number of trailing zeros for n is given by the function count_zeros(n) = sum_{i=1}^k floor(n/(5^i)).\n\nSo, the count_zeros(n) is a non-decreasing function. So, for a given m, the possible n's that satisfy count_zeros(n) = m form a contiguous interval. So, if there exists such n's, then they are all between some lower and upper bound.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the lower and upper bounds of this interval.\n\nTo find the lower bound, we can find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. To find the upper bound, we can find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m+1, and subtract 1.\n\nBut how to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m, and check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this value 'low'. Then, check if count_zeros(low) is m. If it is, then that's the starting point. Otherwise, there is no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this 'high'. Then, the numbers from low to high-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThis can be done via binary search. Because count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing. So for example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is the lower bound of the possible n's.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor a given m, perform binary search to find the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, perform another binary search to find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1. Then the numbers between n_low and n_high -1 are the valid n's.\n\nThe count of such numbers is (n_high - n_low). But wait, if the count_zeros(n_high -1) is exactly m, then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are all valid.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nFind n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= 1. The minimal is 5.\n\nCheck count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes.\n\nThen find n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= 2. The minimal is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1) are valid. That's 5 numbers, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nFind n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >=5. Let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So n_low is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6 which is larger than 5. So there is no solution. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Implement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n2. For a given m, find n_low via binary search where count_zeros(n_low) >= m. Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Find n_high via binary search where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n4. The numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are the valid n's. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nLet's think about the binary search for n_low.\n\nThe lower bound for n is 0, upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So for m zeros, n must be at least 5*m. Wait, no. Let's see. For example, m=1, n=5. 5*1=5. So that's correct. For m=2, n=10. But 10 is 5*2. However, 25 has 6 zeros. So for m=6, the minimal n is 25. Which is 5*5. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But for cases where m is large, like m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the actual n would be something like 5e5, but maybe even higher? Let me think. For example, count_zeros(5*m) would be sum_{i=1}^k floor(5m / 5^i) = sum_{i=1}^k m / 5^{i-1} }, which is m/5 + m/25 + m/125 + ... which is less than m. So 5*m is not sufficient. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search needs to be higher.\n\nWait, for example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=1, 5*1=5. So that's correct. For m=2, the minimal n is 10, which is 5*2. For m=5, the minimal n is 25. Wait, count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=5, the minimal n is 25? But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So perhaps my previous approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? But that's not correct. Let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. So for n=24, count is 4. n=25: 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, there is no n where count_zeros(n) is 5. Hence, for m=5, there are no solutions.\n\nSo the binary search for n_low (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m) would be 25 for m=5. Then, since count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5, the answer is zero.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nBut how to choose the upper bound for binary search?\n\nThe maximum possible value of n for which count_zeros(n) can be m is 5*m. But wait, for example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. So 5*m is 30, which is higher than 25. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for any m, the count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(5m) is floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... = m + floor(m/5) + floor(m/25) + ... which is greater than or equal to m. So yes. Therefore, for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is acceptable for binary search.\n\nSo, the binary search for n_low would be between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that computes the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) >= m. This can be done via binary search.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n- The answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nSo, for example, when m=1, n_low is 5, n_high is 10. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nThen, the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search.\n\nFor example, for the lower bound:\n\nleft = 0, right = 5*m.\n\nInitialize answer as something.\n\nBut for binary search, the function is to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSo, the binary search code would be:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * target\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            left = mid +1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\nWait, but for example, for target m, the function returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we get that, we check if count_zeros(n_low) == target. If not, then there is no solution.\n\nSo, for example, for m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) = 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5, so no solution.\n\nSo, the code for the problem would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nif m is 0, but according to the input constraints m is >=1.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut what if m is very large? Like 1e5. Let's see.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1.\n\nCase 2: m=5, which has no solution.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would be 25, since count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) would be 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So for target 7, find_min_n(7) would be looking for the first n where count_zeros(n)>=7.\n\nWhat is count_zeros(25) = 6, count_zeros(26) is same as 25, ..., count_zeros(29) is 6. At 30, count_zeros(30) is 7 (30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7). So find_min_n(7) is 25? No, no. Wait, the code for find_min_n(7) would search for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7. So for n=25, count is 6, which is less than 7. So the code would move left to mid+1. Eventually, it would find 30 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. So for m=6, n_high is 30. Thus, the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So for m=6, the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut the input is m, and the output is the count and the numbers.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a list of m's? Wait, the example shows that the input is ['1', '5'] and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows that the input is given as a list, perhaps in the context of multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided ['1', '5'], which may be a way to represent multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the code should process a single m. However, the sample input and output shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are handled. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases, but the code is supposed to handle a single m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich probably represents two test cases. For example, for m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers, and for m=5, output is 0. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the original problem is part of a programming competition where the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem description says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is not correctly formatted here, and the actual code should read a single m.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process a single m. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two inputs. That's probably because the sample is for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read a single m.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is for two separate runs. For example, when m is 1, the output is as given, and for m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the code is supposed to process a single m. Therefore, the code should read m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the possible n's as discussed.\n\nPrint the count, then the numbers in order.\n\nNow, coding that.\n\nBut let's code the functions.\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, the find_min_n function.\n\nBut for the code, the find_min_n function can be implemented as a helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for large m (like 1e5), the binary search is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m.\n\nThen:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    left =0\n    right =5 * target\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            left = mid +1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\nThen:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would compute n_low as 5, n_high as 10. So the list is range(5,10) which is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(n_low, n_high) is from n_low to n_high-1. So yes.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would take O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if m is 1e5, and the find_min_n(m) returns a value that is 5e5? Well, the code would handle that.\n\nNow, let's test for m=5.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5). Let's compute that.\n\ntarget=5.\n\nleft starts at 0, right=5*5=25.\n\nInitially, left=0, right=25.\n\nmid is 12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). 2 <5 → left=13.\n\nmid=(13+25)//2=19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3, 19//25=0). Still <5 → left=20.\n\nmid= (20+25)/2=22. count_zeros(22) is 4 (22//5=4). <5 → left=23.\n\nmid=23+25//2=24 → mid=24. count_zeros(24)=4 <5 → left=25.\n\nNow left=right=25. Exit loop. Return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) → find the first n with count >=6.\n\nLet's compute for n=25: count is 6. So the code would return 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 → yes.\n\nThen find n_high = find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\ntarget=7.\n\nleft=0, right=5*7=35.\n\nInitially, mid=17. count_zeros(17)=3 <7 → left=18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2=26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 6 <7 → left=27.\n\nmid= (27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → total 7. So >=7. So right=31.\n\nNow, left=27, right=31. mid= (27+31)//2=29. count_zeros(29) is 5+1=6 <7 → left=30.\n\nmid= (30+31)/2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So right=30. Now left=30, right=30. Return 30.\n\nSo n_high=30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in Python, when m is 1, the code outputs len(res) as 5, then the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers, but the code returns them in order.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut the code needs to read m from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nNow, considering that for m=0, but according to the input constraints, m is at least 1.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can handle m=0 as well.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in Python, the input is read via input().strip().\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * target\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            left = mid +1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but the sample input for m=1 outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, the first print is len(res) which is 5, then the next line is the numbers. So the output would be:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nBut the sample output is written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is the same as the code's output.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which probably represents two test cases. However, the code handles one test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read a single m.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first input is '1', and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5 → output is 0.\n\nBut what about when m=6, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut the code for m=6 would output 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, what about when m=0? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are zero? Well, the problem says positive integers n. So n starts from 1.\n\nBut the code returns numbers starting from n_low, which is >=1.\n\nBut for m=1, n_low is 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_low is find_min_n(2). Let's compute.\n\ntarget=2.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 10.\n\nInitially, left=0, right=10.\n\nmid=5 → count_zeros(5)=1 <2 → left=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8 → count_zeros(8) is 1 <2 → left=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 → 9. count_zeros(9)=1 <2 → left=10. Now left=right=10. return 10.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2 → yes.\n\nn_high = find_min_n(3). Let's compute that.\n\ntarget=3.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 15.\n\nLet me think:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So the minimal n is 15?\n\nWait, for n=14: count_zeros(14) is 2 (14//5=2). So the first n where count_zeros >=3 is 15. So n_high=15. So the numbers are from 10 to 14 → 5 numbers (10,11,12,13,14). Which is correct. Because 10! has 2 zeros, 11! also 2, etc., until 15! which has 3.\n\nSo the code would output 5 numbers. So for m=2, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=3. The numbers would be from 15 to 19 (since 15! has 3 zeros, 19! also has 3 zeros. 20! has 4 zeros. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code should be written.\n\nBut in Python, when m is 1, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers. But the sample output for the first case is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code prints len(res) (which is 5) then the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written as per the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem says that the output should first print k (the number of values), then print the k integers in increasing order. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. The first line is 5, the second line is the numbers. Which is exactly what the code does.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for the first case is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is what the code produces.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are generally more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the range of values $ n $ that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps efficiently narrow down the possible values of $ n $ where the count of trailing zeros meets the required value.\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: By finding the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $ (denoted as $ n_{\\text{low}} $) and the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m+1 $ (denoted as $ n_{\\text{high}} $), we can determine the range of valid $ n $ values as $ [n_{\\text{low}}, n_{\\text{high}} - 1] $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * target\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\nm = int(input())\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    res = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible values of $ n $.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: \n   - Read the input value $ m $.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the smallest $ n $ (denoted $ n_{\\text{low}} $) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $.\n   - Check if $ n_{\\text{low}} $ indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, print 0.\n   - If valid, determine the upper bound $ n_{\\text{high}} $ using `find_min_n` for $ m+1 $.\n   - The valid range of $ n $ values is from $ n_{\\text{low}} $ to $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
