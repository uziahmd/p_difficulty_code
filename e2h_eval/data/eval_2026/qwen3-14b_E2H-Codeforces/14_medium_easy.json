He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10).\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe approach I think is to first find the minimum n that gives exactly m trailing zeros. Then check if there are other numbers that also give m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, the sample shows that for m=1, there are 5 numbers. But maybe for some m's, there are no solutions. Like if m is 5, perhaps there's a range of numbers that produce exactly 5 zeros?\n\nWait, let's think about how the trailing zeros count increases. For example, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But when you reach multiples of 25, it increases by two, etc. So the count is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, the possible n's that produce exactly m zeros would be a consecutive range of numbers. But how long is that range?\n\nWait, for example, when m=1, the count increases from 0 to 1 at n=5. Then for n=5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. Then at n=10, the count becomes 2. So the numbers 5-9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the length of the range is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. But for numbers that are not multiples of 5, the count remains the same. So the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros would be a range of numbers between some lower bound and upper bound. However, when there's a number that adds more than one zero (like 25), then the next numbers after that may not have the same count.\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: count is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0 → total 2). Then n=11, 12, 13, 14: same count. At n=15, count is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0). So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers again. So same pattern.\n\nBut what about when m is 5? Let's see. Let's compute the count for various numbers.\n\nLet me think. Let's find the n where the count is 5.\n\nFor example, let's compute count for 20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → total 4. Not enough. 25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → total 6. So between 20 and 25, the count increases from 4 to 6. So when does the count reach 5?\n\nWell, for n=24: 24/5 is 4, 24/25 is 0. So total 4. Then n=25 gives 6. So there's no n for which the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is zero. So in this case, there are no numbers. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nAh, so that's why the sample input for m=5 gives output 0. Because there's no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists any n such that count_zeros(n) = m, and if so, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Then check if there's a range of numbers starting from low where count_zeros remains m. The maximum n for which count_zeros(n) = m would be low + k, where k is some number. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the possible n's are in a range. But how to find that range?\n\nBut how do I find if there's any n that gives m zeros?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's where count_zeros(n) = m. Since the count_zeros function is non-decreasing, for a given m, there can be 0 or 1 or multiple numbers.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, for a given m, we can find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where count_zeros(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but how to find the range?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then the next numbers will have count_zeros(n) either equal to m or higher. But since when you increment n by 1, the count_zeros can increase by 0 or 1 (if n is a multiple of 5). Wait, no. For example, if n is 25, then count_zeros(25) is 6 (5+1). So when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2. So the count_zeros function can jump by more than 1.\n\nThis suggests that for some m, there is no n that gives exactly m. For example, in the case of m=5, because between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), there's a jump of 2. So m=5 is skipped.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there is such an n. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find the maximum n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then the numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive are all valid.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nAlternatively, once we find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m, then the next numbers up to the next number that increases the count would be part of the solution. But how to find that next number?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum n for which count_zeros(n) = m is the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1. The first n is 5. The next count is 2, which occurs at n=10. So the max n is 10-1=9. So the range is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for m=2, the first n is 10. The next count is 3 at n=15. So max n is 14. So numbers from 10 to 14: 5 numbers.\n\nBut for m=6, the first n is 25. The next count is 7, which occurs at n=25+ something. Let's compute count_zeros(25) = 6. count_zeros(26) is 6, ..., count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So the max n is 29. So the numbers from 25 to 29: 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what about m=6. Let's see. Let's compute count_zeros(25) = 6. Then 25,26,27,28,29: 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo this seems to suggest that when there exists a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause when the count increases by 1, the numbers between the previous step and the current step are 5 numbers. But when the count increases by more than 1, then there's a gap. For example, when m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the question is: for a given m, if there exists at least one n that gives exactly m zeros, then the number of such n's is 5? Or maybe sometimes less?\n\nWait, let's think of m=3. Let's find the first n where count_zeros(n) = 3.\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0). So the first n is 15. Then the next count is 4 at n=20. So the max n is 19. So numbers 15-19: 5 numbers. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=4. First n is 20. Next count is 5 at n=25. But wait, count_zeros(25) is 6. So between n=20 and n=25, the count increases from 4 (for 20) to 6 (for 25). So what's the count for 24? 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0 → total 4. So the count for 20 to 24 is 4. So for m=4, the numbers are 20-24 (5 numbers). So again 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that when there is a solution, there are exactly 5 numbers. Except when the count jumps by more than 1. But how?\n\nWait, in the case where the count increases by 2, like when m=5. There's no solution. So the answer is zero. But when the count increases by 1, the numbers between the previous and next steps are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find whether m is present in the count_zeros sequence. If it is, then the answer is 5 numbers. But wait, what about when the count increases by 1, but the next step is not 5 numbers? Let's think of m=0. Well, m starts from 1. So maybe not.\n\nWait, what about for m=6. As before, the count for 25 is 6. Then the next count is 7 when n reaches 25+5=30? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6. count_zeros(26) is same as 25, since 26 is not divisible by 5. Similarly for 27, 28, 29. Then 30 is divisible by 5. So count_zeros(30) = 30/5 + 30/25 + ... = 6 + 1 = 7. So the numbers 25-29 are 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nSo this suggests that whenever there exists a solution, the number of solutions is 5. But why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros function increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but not a multiple of 25. For example, when n is 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. Each of these adds 1 to the count. So the numbers between 5 and 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Between 10 and 14: 5 numbers. Between 15 and 19: 5 numbers. Etc. So each time, the count increases by 1, and the next count increases by 1 again. But when there's a multiple of 25, like 25, the count increases by 2. So between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), there's a jump of 2. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that for a given m, if there exists an n such that count_zeros(n) = m, then there are exactly 5 such numbers. Unless the count increases by more than 1, which would leave some m's without solutions.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this n_min.\n\n   But how to find that? Well, perhaps using binary search. Because the count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing.\n\n   Wait, but how to check if m exists. Because for example, if m is 5, then there is no n such that count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nUse binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there is no solution. If yes, then check the next numbers. But according to our previous analysis, if there is a solution, then there are exactly 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but how to confirm that?\n\nOnce we find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m, then the next numbers would be n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, and then n+5 would have count_zeros(n+5) = m+1? Or not?\n\nFor example, take n=5. count_zeros(5) = 1. Then n+5 is 10, which has count_zeros(10) = 2. So yes. So for the first n, the next 4 numbers would also have the same count. So the total of 5 numbers.\n\nBut why is that? Because adding 1 to n, unless it's a multiple of 5, the count_zeros doesn't change. So the first occurrence of m is at n_min, and the next occurrence is until the next multiple of 5. Which would be n_min + 4, and then n_min +5 is a multiple of 5, which increases the count by 1.\n\nBut this depends on whether n_min is a multiple of 5. Wait, for example, if n_min is 25. Then count_zeros(25) is 6. Then n=25,26,27,28,29: all have count_zeros 6. Then n=30, which is a multiple of 5, and count_zeros increases by 2 (since 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0. So total 6+1=7. So the count increases by 1 from 6 to 7. So the next step is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 are 5 numbers.\n\nSo regardless of whether n_min is a multiple of 5 or not, the numbers from n_min to n_min +4 will have the same count_zeros.\n\nBut why? Because the next multiple of 5 is n_min + (5 - (n_min mod 5))? Wait, for example, if n_min is 5, then the next multiple of 5 is 10. So between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers. Similarly, if n_min is 25, then next multiple of 5 is 30, and the numbers from 25 to 29 are 5 numbers. If n_min is 6 (which is not a multiple of 5), then the next multiple of 5 is 10. So numbers from 6 to 9 (4 numbers?), but wait, 6,7,8,9: 4 numbers. But according to the earlier example, when m=1, n_min is 5, and the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers. So in that case, the count_zeros for 5 is 1, and for 6,7,8,9 is 1. So 5 numbers.\n\nWait, in the case where n_min is not a multiple of 5, but the count_zeros is m. How can that happen?\n\nFor example, let's say m=2. The first n where count_zeros is 2 is 10. Which is a multiple of 5. But suppose m=3. The first n is 15. Also a multiple of 5. So maybe the first occurrence of m is always a multiple of 5? Because the count_zeros increases when you reach a multiple of 5. So for example, when m=1, the first occurrence is 5. For m=2, first occurrence is 10. For m=3, first occurrence is 15. For m=4, first occurrence is 20. For m=5, no occurrence. For m=6, first occurrence is 25. So yes, the first occurrence of m is a multiple of 5. So the first occurrence is a multiple of 5. Thus, the numbers from that multiple of 5 up to that multiple plus 4 (i.e., 5 numbers) will have the same count_zeros.\n\nBut why? Because the count_zeros increases when you reach the next multiple of 5. So the next multiple is n_min +5. So between n_min and n_min +4, the count_zeros remains the same.\n\nSo if the first occurrence is a multiple of 5, then the numbers from n_min to n_min +4 will have the same count_zeros. Thus, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the conclusion is: for a given m, if there exists at least one n with count_zeros(n) = m, then the number of such n is exactly 5. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut wait, let's test for m=6. The first occurrence is 25. Then numbers 25,26,27,28,29: 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nAnother example: m=7. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1 → total 7). So the first occurrence is 30. Then numbers 30,31,32,33,34: 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo how can I check if m is present?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is m. If not, then there is no solution. If yes, then the answer is 5 numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nWe can use binary search for that.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nImplement a helper function to count the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(n) == m. If not, output 0. Else, output the 5 numbers from n to n+4.\n\nBut wait, what if the count_zeros(n) is m, but the next numbers (n+1, etc.) also have the same count? Well, according to our previous reasoning, they do. So the code can generate the five numbers.\n\nBut let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1.\n\nBinary search for the smallest n with count_zeros(n) >=1. That would be 5. Check count_zeros(5) is 1. So output 5,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSample input m=5. Binary search finds the smallest n with count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\nFor example, let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5, so output is zero. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The minimal n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So output 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search?\n\nThe binary search needs to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. The lower bound can be 0, upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, the number of trailing zeros for 5*m is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms). So the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps even a higher value. But for m up to 1e5, 5*m is manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would be over that range.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is zero, but the problem says m is >=1.\n\nElse:\n\nDefine a function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(n) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, output 5 numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more than 5 numbers? For example, in the case where the next multiple of 5 is further away?\n\nNo, because the next multiple of 5 is n+5, which would add 1 to the count_zeros. So the numbers from n to n+4 would be the ones with count_zeros(n) =m.\n\nBut how can I be sure that n+4 is the last one with count_zeros(n) =m?\n\nBecause when you reach n+5, which is a multiple of 5, count_zeros increases by 1 (or more?).\n\nWait, for example, n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then n+5 is 30. count_zeros(30) is 7 (as before). So the count increases by 1. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (5 numbers) have count 6.\n\nAnother example, n is 24. count_zeros(24) is 4. Then n+1 is 25, which has count 6. So the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there is no solution.\n\nSo the code would work as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, for a given m, perform binary search between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nBut what's the correct high?\n\nWell, for example, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) =m is at least m*5. Wait, no. For example, m=1, the minimal n is 5. Which is 5*1. For m=2, 10. For m=3, 15. For m=4, 20. For m=5, 25 (but count_zeros(25) is 6). So the minimal n for m=5 is not found. So the high can be 5*m. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25, which is less than 5*6=30.\n\nSo setting high to 5*m is acceptable. Because for any m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >=m is <=5*m.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause count_zeros(5*m) is equal to 5*m//5 + 5*m//25 + ... = m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is >=m. So the binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSo the code for binary search:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5*m\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n        high = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(low) ==m. If not, output 0. Else, output the 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, for example, if m=6, low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if there are more than 5 numbers? For example, if the next multiple of 5 is not adding to the count. But according to the previous reasoning, it's not possible.\n\nBut let's think of a case where the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when you reach the next multiple of 5. So the code would generate 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the next multiple of 5 adds more than 1 to the count? For example, when n is 25. Then the next multiple of 5 is 30. count_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So the difference is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: n= 125. count_zeros(125) is 31 (125//5=25, 125//25=5, 125//125=1 → 25+5+1=31). Then, count_zeros(126) is same as 125. ... up to 129. Then count_zeros(130) is 130//5=26, 130//25=5, 130//125=1 → 26+5+1=32. So the difference is 1. So the numbers from 125 to 129 are 5 numbers. So code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is >=1. So no need to handle.\n\nCase 2: m=1. Output 5 numbers.\n\nCase 3: m=5. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Output 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nAnother case: m=7. The minimal n is 30. count_zeros(30) is 7. So output 30-34.\n\nBut let's check count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. Yes.\n\nAnother case: m=25. Let's compute the minimal n. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → 24). count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4 → 25. So the minimal n is 105. So the numbers 105-109. So output 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about count_zeros(105) is 25?\n\nYes. So code would output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=24. The minimal n is 100. Because count_zeros(100) is 24. Then numbers 100-104. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a list, for example, ['1', '5'].\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nBut in the example input, it's given as ['1', '5']? Wait, that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is:\n\nInput\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe the actual input is a single integer m. But the example shows two different inputs. Oh, perhaps the problem is a multi-test case scenario. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the example shows that for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is showing two different test cases. But the user is to read from stdin, which is a single line containing m.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So in the code, the input is read as a single integer m.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list, which is perhaps a formatting error.\n\nBut assuming that the actual input is a single integer m. So the code should read m as input.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], but that's perhaps a mistake. So the code should read m as an integer from stdin.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead m from input. For example, m = int(input().strip())\n\nThen proceed with the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen perform binary search.\n\nOnce found the low, check if count_zeros(low) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, output 5 followed by the numbers low, low+1, ..., low+4.\n\nBut what if there are more than 5 numbers? According to our reasoning, no. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=6, low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the code outputs 25,26,27,28,29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the next number after low+4 has count_zeros equal to m?\n\nNo, because low is the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) >=m. So for the next number (low+5), the count_zeros is higher than m. Because when you reach the next multiple of 5, which is low + (5 - (low %5 )) ?\n\nBut since low is a multiple of 5 (as per our previous examples?), perhaps not. Wait, in the case where m=6, low is 25, which is a multiple of 5. So adding 5 gives 30, which is also a multiple of 5. So count_zeros(30) is 7.\n\nSo for the numbers from low to low+4, the count_zeros is m. For low+5, it's m+1.\n\nBut why is low a multiple of 5?\n\nBecause count_zeros increases when n is a multiple of 5. So the first occurrence of m is when n is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nWell, suppose that the minimal n where count_zeros(n) =m is not a multiple of 5. For example, say n=6. Then count_zeros(6) is 1. Which is same as count_zeros(5). So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) =1 is 5, not 6. So the minimal n is always a multiple of 5.\n\nThus, the first occurrence of m is a multiple of 5. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    # Now check if low is the correct value\n    if count_zeros(low) == m:\n        return [low + i for i in range(5)]\n    else:\n        return []\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    res = find_n(m)\n    print(len(res))\n    if len(res) >0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code for find_n(1) returns [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut what if the code returns more than 5 numbers? For example, if for some m, the count_zeros(n) is m for more than 5 numbers. But according to the reasoning, that's not possible.\n\nBut let's think: suppose that m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when you reach a multiple of 5, but there are more than 5 numbers between the first occurrence and the next. How?\n\nFor example, suppose that the first occurrence is 5, and the next is 10. Between 5 and 9, there are 5 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the next multiple of 5 is 5+5=10, and the count_zeros(10) is m+1. So the numbers from 5 to 9 are 5 numbers.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, find_n(5) returns empty list.\n\nNow, in code, the find_n function returns the list of numbers. Then the main function prints len(res) and then the numbers.\n\nBut the sample input for m=1 outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code for main() would print len(res) (5), then print the numbers. But the sample output shows that the first line is 5, and the second line is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code's output is correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where the list is empty? For example, m=5. Then len(res) is zero. So the code prints 0, and nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second case is m=5, output is '0'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the list has more than 5 elements? Well, according to our reasoning, that's not possible.\n\nBut what if m is such that the count_zeros(n) increases by 1, but the next multiple of 5 is not adding 1? For example, when the next multiple of 5 is 25. But in that case, the code would have already handled it.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. The code would find low as 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then the numbers are 100-104. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about count_zeros(104) is 24?\n\nYes. Because 104//5 is 20, 104//25 is 4, 104//125 is 0. So 20+4=24.\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4 → 25. So yes, the numbers 100-104 are 5 numbers.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, what about when m is 0? But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1, so the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut the code for the function find_n(m) may have high as 5*m, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 500,000. The binary search would run in log2(5e5) steps, which is around 19 steps. Each step computes count_zeros(mid), which is O(log mid) steps. So overall, the code is efficient.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. Also, for the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0. When m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the code for main() must read m from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n    low =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of `n` values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`.\n3. **Validation Check**: After finding the smallest such `n`, check if the count of trailing zeros is exactly `m`. If not, there are no valid numbers. If it is, then there will be exactly 5 consecutive numbers starting from this `n` that have exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    if count_zeros(low) == m:\n        return [low + i for i in range(5)]\n    else:\n        return []\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    res = find_n(m)\n    print(len(res))\n    if len(res) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is used to find the smallest number `n` where the count of trailing zeros is at least `m`. This is efficient and reduces the search space significantly.\n3. **Validation and Result Construction**: After finding the smallest `n`, we check if it indeed gives exactly `m` trailing zeros. If it does, the result consists of the next 5 consecutive numbers starting from `n`, as each of these will have the same number of trailing zeros before the next multiple of 5 increases the count.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of numbers using binary search and mathematical insights into trailing zeros in factorials.",
