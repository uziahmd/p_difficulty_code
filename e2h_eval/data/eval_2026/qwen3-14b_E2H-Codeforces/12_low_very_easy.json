The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the clockwise direction and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's take the example given. First input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How much time? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. From 3 to 4 to 1 to 2: that's 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time to move from the current position to the next task's house, moving clockwise. And accumulate all these times.\n\nBut how to compute the time between two houses?\n\nLet's think: suppose current position is at 'current' and the next task is at 'next'. The number of steps needed is (next - current) mod n? Wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would be (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's see. The distance from 3 to 2 clockwise is 3 steps (3→4→1→2). Which is (2 - 3) mod 4? Well, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes, the formula would be (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) % n, but since in Python mod can return negative values, maybe better to compute it as (next - current) if next >= current else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current + n) % n. Wait, because (next - current) could be negative, adding n and then mod n would give the correct positive value.\n\nWait, for example, current is 3, next is 2. (2 - 3) = -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. If current is 2 and next is 3, (3-2) = 1, mod 4 is 1. Correct. So the formula for steps between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (next - current) % n would give the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, what if the next is same as current? Then the steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the steps needed to get from current to a_i, which is (a_i - current) % n. But wait, no. Because for example, if current is 1 and a_i is 3, then (3-1) is 2 steps. Which is correct. If current is 3 and a_i is 2, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\n   - Add that to the total time.\n\n   - Update current to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the steps between them is zero. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent = 1\n\nfor each a in the list of tasks:\n\n    delta = (a - current) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current = a\n\nreturn total_time\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key is to calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks in a clockwise direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, as given in the problem statement.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task.\n3. **Clockwise Movement Calculation**: Use modulo arithmetic to determine the shortest path in a clockwise direction. If moving directly from the current house to the target house is not possible in a straight line (due to the circular arrangement), wrap around using modulo operations.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_house in a:\n    delta = (next_house - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = next_house\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the number of steps needed to move from the current house to the target house using `(next_house - current) % n`. This ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the time for each move, update the current position to the target house of the current task.\n- **Summing Time**: Accumulate the total time taken for all movements and print the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time with a linear pass through the list of tasks, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks.",
