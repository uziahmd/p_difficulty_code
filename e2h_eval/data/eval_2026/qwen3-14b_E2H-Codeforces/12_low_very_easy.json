The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between current_pos and a_i depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But if the next a_i is 3, then no steps needed. If it's 4, then 1 step.\n\nSo the distance between current_pos and target is (target - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if target is larger than current_pos, then moving clockwise would be target - current_pos steps. But if target is smaller, then it's (n - current_pos + target) steps. So the total steps between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). But wait, that's equivalent to (target - current) % n? No, because if target is less than current, then (target - current) is negative, but mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, if current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) mod n. But since we are moving clockwise, that's the correct way to compute steps.\n\nBut wait, when current is 3 and target is 2, the steps are 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So yes, (target - current + n) % n gives the correct steps. So for each step from current to target, the time is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Or equivalently (target - current) % n, but since in Python modulo can return negative values, maybe better to compute as (target - current + n) % n. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, target=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula (target - current) % n would work here. Wait, but in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, right? Yes. So in Python, (target - current) % n would give the correct number of steps. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there). Then for each task in the list a_1 to a_m, compute the distance from current to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current to a_i.\n\nWait, but the tasks have to be done in order. So for example, if the tasks are [3, 2, 3], then:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Add 2 to total. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. So add 3. Now total is 5. Current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the first example.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3 and the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is 1. Total is 1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: distance 1. Total 2. Current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: distance",
