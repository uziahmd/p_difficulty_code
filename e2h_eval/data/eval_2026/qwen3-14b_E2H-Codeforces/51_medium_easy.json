Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is a pile of letters found in the morning. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the first two names. That means the combined letters of the guest and host must exactly match the letters in the pile, in any order. So, no extra letters, and no missing letters.\n\nHmm, right. So the approach would be to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nSo for example, if the guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAUS\", then combined they have certain letters. The pile must have exactly those letters, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHow to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter can count the frequency of each character in a string.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for the combined string and a Counter for the pile.\n4. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but how about if the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length? For example, if guest + host has 10 letters, but the pile has 11. Then obviously it's impossible. So checking the lengths first could be a quick way to return NO.\n\nBut even if the lengths are same, the counts might not match. So the steps would be:\n\nCheck if the combined length of guest and host equals the length of the pile. If not, output NO. Else, check if the Counter of combined guest+host equals Counter of pile.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin. The input is three lines. So:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nIf len(combined) != len(pile), then print 'NO'.\n\nElse, check if the Counter(combined) == Counter(pile). If yes, print 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nFirst case:\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined length: len('SANTACLAUS') + len('DEDMOROZ') ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) — wait, let me count:\n\nS (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), C (6), L (7), A (8), U (9), S (10). Yes, 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. So combined length is 18.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' — let me count the letters. Well, the sample says it's correct. So the code would check that the counts match.\n\nAnother example: second input is guest 'PAPAINOEL', host 'JOULUPUKKI', pile 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nCombined guest + host: 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI'.\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → 9 letters?\n\nWait, 'PAPAINOEL' is 9 letters? Let me count:\n\nP A P A I N O E L → yes, 9 letters.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J O U L U P U K K I → 10 letters. So combined length is 19.\n\nThe pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut the sample says that there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would compare the counts and find that they are not equal, hence output NO.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nWhat if the guest and host are empty? But according to the input description, all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the combined string and pile have same length but different characters. Like guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → yes. But if pile is 'AA', then no.\n\nSo the code would correctly return no.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict. So comparing two Counters with == should check if all counts are equal. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about if the combined string has a character that's not in the pile? Then the Counter would have that key, but the pile's Counter would not. So the comparison would catch that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see the letters. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check if the counts match.\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle it.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL (length 9?), host JOULUPUKKI (length 10?), combined length 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me check the length of the pile. Let me count the letters:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's see:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let me count the letters. Let me count the letters in the pile:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), etc. Well, perhaps the code would find that the counts are different.\n\nBut the code would compare the Counter of the combined guest+host and the pile. So in the sample, the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is three lines, but in the sample input, the first example is given as a list of three elements. But in actual input, each line is read as separate.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about leading or trailing spaces? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the input lines have no whitespace except the newline. So using strip() is safe. Because the input lines may have trailing newlines, but the problem says that the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the .strip() is okay. Wait, but in the input, the lines are read as per input().strip() — but suppose that the input has leading or trailing whitespaces? But according to the problem statement, all lines consist of uppercase letters only, and are not empty. So the input lines do not have any whitespace except the newline. So using input().strip() would be safe, but perhaps even input().strip() is redundant. Because for example, if the input line is 'SANTACLAUS\\n', then input().strip() would remove the newline. However, the problem says that the lines are not empty, so even if the input is read with input().strip(), it's safe.\n\nBut perhaps, in the problem, the input lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces? No, according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of uppercase letters only. So the input lines don't have any whitespaces. Therefore, using input().strip() is safe. However, perhaps the input() function would read the entire line, including the newline, but the problem says that the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So, for example, if the input is 'SANTACLAUS' followed by a newline, then input() would return 'SANTACLAUS' (without the newline). So perhaps using input().strip() is unnecessary, but it's better to use it to avoid any possible leading/trailing whitespaces, even though the problem says there are none.\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? But according to the problem statement, no. So maybe the code can just use input().strip() to be safe.\n\nBut for example, if the input is 'ABC\\n', then input().strip() would return 'ABC', which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the third sample input:\n\nThird input is:\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nSo the combined string is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBABBONATALE has B A B B O N A T A L E → let's count letters:\n\nB: 3, A: 3, O: 1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1 → total length 11?\n\nWait, B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters.\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → let me count letters:\n\nF (1), A (2), T (2), H (2), E (1), R (2), C (1), I (1), S (2), M (1), A (3?), etc. Well, the exact count isn't important. The combined length of guest and host is 11 + len(FATHERCHRISTMAS). Let me count len(FATHERCHRISTMAS):\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS → letters: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → that's 14 letters?\n\nYes. So combined length is 11 + 14 = 25.\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the length. Let me see:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → let's count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut the sample says that there's an extra L. So the code would compare the counts and find that the pile has an extra L.\n\nSo the code would output NO.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo the Python code is as follows:\n\nImporting Counter from collections, then reading the three lines, combining the first two, checking the lengths, and comparing the counters.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the problem says that the input is read from standard input, and output to standard output. So the code is as written.\n\nBut in Python, when you read input with input(), each call reads a line. So for the three lines, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nThen, combine guest and host.\n\nCheck len(combined) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\nElse, check if Counter(combined) equals Counter(pile).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the combined string and pile have the same length but different characters? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"AA\", then len is same but counts differ. So code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nSo this code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names, considering both the count and the total length of the characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Length Check**: Verify if the length of the combined string matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately clear that the pile cannot be rearranged to form the combined names.\n4. **Character Count Check**: Use a character counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined string with that of the pile. If both counters match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, ensuring that any leading or trailing whitespace is stripped off.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to form the expected set of characters.\n- **Length Check**: A quick check ensures that the total number of characters in the combined string matches the number of characters in the pile. This step helps in early rejection of impossible cases.\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we efficiently count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counts match exactly, the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, otherwise it cannot.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and the character distribution, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
