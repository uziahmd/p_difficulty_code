Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to compute, after each modification to the string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. And we have to do this efficiently for up to 3000 operations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. So, each time a character (0 or 1) is added to S, we need to check all possible substrings of S and count how many of them correspond to valid Morse code letters. But since each valid Morse code is a string of length 1-4, any substring of S that has length between 1 and 4 and is not one of the four invalid ones contributes to the count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4) corresponds to a unique letter, except those four invalid ones. So, for every substring of S that is of length 1-4, if it's not one of those four invalid strings, then it represents a valid letter. And each such occurrence counts as a separate sequence. However, the question is about the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S. So, for example, if a substring is \"1\", that's one sequence (a single letter). If another substring is \"11\", that's another. Also, overlapping substrings are considered separately. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings \"1\" (positions 1, 2, 3), \"11\" (positions 1-2, 2-3), and \"111\" (positions 1-3) would all be considered. Each of these substrings that are valid contributes to the count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, after each step, counting the number of valid Morse code substrings in S. Because each valid substring represents exactly one letter, and each such occurrence is counted as a separate sequence. So, the answer is the total number of valid substrings of lengths 1-4 in S.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each step, S grows by one character. So after m steps, S is of length m. For each step, we need to process the new character and update the count.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be, after each addition, to check all possible substrings ending at the current position. Since the maximum length of a valid substring is 4, for each new character added, we can look back up to 4 positions and check if the substring formed is valid.\n\nFor example, when adding the i-th character (so S is length i), we can check all substrings ending at i with lengths 1 to 4. For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), we check if the substring starting at i - l + 1 to i is valid. If so, we add 1 to the total count.\n\nBut how do we check if a substring is valid? Well, the invalid substrings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So for each substring of length 1-4, we need to check if it's one of these four. If not, then it's valid.\n\nWait, but the valid ones are all the possible 1-4 length binary strings except those four. So for a given substring, we can generate its string, check if it's in the forbidden set. If not, then it's valid.\n\nSo the forbidden set is {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\nTherefore, for each new character added to S, we can check for all possible substrings ending at the current position, of length 1-4, and count how many of them are valid.\n\nBut how do we do that efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the steps. Let's say after each addition, the current string is S. For each new character added, we can check for substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 ending at the current position. However, for each of these lengths, we need to ensure that the starting index is >= 0.\n\nFor example, when the current length is i (after i steps), then for each l in 1..4:\n\nstart = i - l\n\nif start >= 0, then the substring from start to i-1 (assuming zero-based) is of length l. Wait, maybe I need to think about indexes properly.\n\nLet me think: suppose S is built incrementally. After each step, the length is len(S) = current_length. So when adding the k-th character (k starts from 1 to m), the string is of length k. So for each k, when we add the new character, we can check for all possible substrings ending at position k (assuming 1-based?), but perhaps easier to think in terms of zero-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's think for each new character added, the current string is S = previous_S + new_char. Now, for the new character, the new possible substrings that end at the end of S are those of length 1, 2, 3, 4. So, for example, if the current length is n, then for each l in 1 to 4, check if there's a substring of length l ending at position n. That would be the substring starting at position n - l + 1 (if n - l + 1 >= 0).\n\nSo for each new character added, we can check up to four possible substrings (for l=1 to 4). For each of these substrings, check if they are in the forbidden list. If not, then add 1 to the total count.\n\nBut how to track the total count over time?\n\nWe can maintain a variable total that accumulates the count. For each step, when adding a new character, we check for all possible substrings ending at the current position (i.e., the new character's position) of lengths 1-4. For each such substring, if it's valid, we add 1 to the total.\n\nBut how do we check if the substring is valid?\n\nWe can generate the substring as a string, and check if it's in the forbidden set. For example, for l=1, the substring is the last character. For l=2, the last two characters, etc.\n\nBut for each step, we need to generate these substrings. Let's see. For example, if the current string is '111', then for the third step (when the string is length 3):\n\nCheck l=1: substring is '1' → valid.\n\nl=2: substring is '11' → valid.\n\nl=3: substring is '111' → valid.\n\nl=4: not possible, since length is 3.\n\nSo for each step, the number of possible substrings to check is min(4, current_length). For each of these, check if they are in the forbidden set.\n\nSo, for each step, the maximum number of checks is 4. Since m is up to 3000, the total number of operations is 4*3000 = 12,000, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the forbidden set as a set of strings.\n\n- Initialize S as an empty string.\n\n- Initialize total = 0.\n\n- For each step, append the new character to S.\n\n- Then, for l in 1 to 4:\n\n   if the length of S is >= l:\n\n      substring = last l characters of S.\n\n      if substring not in forbidden set:\n\n          total += 1\n\n- Then, output total mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because each step adds new substrings. However, the problem is that when you add a new character, you can have multiple new substrings that end at the new position. However, the previous substrings are already accounted for in previous steps. For example, when the string is '11', then the first step (after first '1') adds 1. The second step adds '1' again, and then checks l=1 (the second '1') and l=2 (the '11'). So the total becomes 1 (from first step) + 1 (second step's l=1) + 1 (second step's l=2) = 3. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nInput is 3 steps, each appending '1'.\n\nAfter first step, S is '1'. Check l=1 → valid. Total is 1.\n\nAfter second step, S is '11'. Check l=1 (the second '1') → valid. Check l=2 (the entire string) → valid. So total increases by 2, making total 3.\n\nAfter third step, S is '111'. Check l=1 (third '1') → valid. Check l=2 (last two '1's) → valid. Check l=3 (entire string) → valid. So add 3 → total becomes 3 + 3 = 6? But according to the first sample, the output after third step is 7.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Because in the first sample, the output after three steps is 7. But according to this approach, the total would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So there's a discrepancy here. What's wrong?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the total is not just the sum of the new substrings added in each step. Because each step adds new substrings, but the total is the sum of all valid substrings in the entire string. So, for example, in the first step, the total is 1. In the second step, the total is 2 (from the new substrings) plus the previous total (1) minus any substrings that were already counted? No, no. Because when you add a new character, the previous substrings are still present. So the total is the sum of all valid substrings in the current string. So my initial approach of adding the new substrings for each step is not sufficient because the previous steps' substrings are already counted. Wait, no. Wait, for example, in the first step, the total is 1. Then, in the second step, the string is longer. The new substrings are the ones ending at position 2 (the new character). But the previous substrings (like the first '1') are still part of the string. So the total is the previous total plus the new substrings added by the new character. But that's only true if the previous steps' counts are already accounted for. So the approach is to, for each step, compute the number of valid substrings in the current string, and output that. But how to compute that efficiently?\n\nBut if we do the approach of, for each step, adding the number of new valid substrings that end at the current position, then the total would accumulate correctly. Because each time, when you add a new character, all the new substrings that end at this position are added. For example, in the first step, the total is 1. In the second step, the new substrings are the l=1 (second '1') and l=2 (the two '1's). So adding 2 → total is 1 + 2 = 3. In the third step, the new substrings are l=1 (third '1'), l=2 (last two '1's), l=3 (all three '1's). So adding 3 → total is 3 + 3 = 6. But according to the first sample, the answer is 7. So this suggests that this approach is missing something.\n\nWait, the first sample's output after three steps is 7. But according to this approach, the total would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me think about the first sample. The string is \"111\".\n\nAll possible substrings of length 1-4:\n\nLength 1: positions 1, 2, 3 → three substrings.\n\nLength 2: positions 1-2, 2-3 → two substrings.\n\nLength 3: positions 1-3 → one substring.\n\nTotal of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 substrings. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, the sample says after three steps, the output is 7. How?\n\nWait the sample input is 3 steps, each appending '1'. The output is 1, 3, 7. So after the third step, the answer is 7. But according to the above calculation, there are 6 substrings. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Each such substring is considered as a separate sequence. However, different substrings can represent the same letter. But the problem counts them as separate sequences. For example, in the sample explanation, \"TT\" (which is \"11\") is considered as a separate sequence from \"M\" (also \"11\"). So each occurrence of a valid substring is counted once, regardless of whether it's the same Morse code as another substring. Therefore, the total is the number of valid substrings in S, not the number of unique Morse code representations.\n\nSo in the first sample, the string is \"111\". Let's list all valid substrings:\n\nAll possible substrings of length 1-3 (since length 4 is longer than the string).\n\nEach of these substrings is of length 1, 2, or 3. Are any of them in the forbidden set?\n\nForbidden set is {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\nSo none of the substrings in the sample are in the forbidden set. Therefore, all possible substrings are valid. How many are there?\n\nThe number of substrings of length 1: 3.\n\nLength 2: 2.\n\nLength 3: 1.\n\nTotal is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But the sample output says 7. Wait, this is a contradiction. So where is the error?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, after appending three '1's, the answer is 7. The sample explanation lists 7 sequences:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nWait, how many substrings are there here? Let's count:\n\nEach of the following substrings:\n\n\"1\" (positions 1) → T.\n\n\"1\" (position 2) → T.\n\n\"1\" (position 3) → T.\n\n\"11\" (positions 1-2) → M.\n\n\"11\" (positions 2-3) → M.\n\n\"111\" (positions 1-3) → O.\n\n\"111\" (positions 1-3) is also considered once. Wait, but that's only 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 substrings. But the sample explanation lists 7 sequences. How?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the sample explanation says:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. But how many substrings are there?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a substring. For example, \"TT\" is the substring \"11\" (positions 1-2 or 2-3?), but in the sample explanation, the \"TT\" is considered as a sequence of two letters. However, the actual substrings that correspond to \"TT\" would be the substring \"11\" (since each T is \"1\"). So the count for the number of valid substrings is 3 (for length 1) + 2 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) = 6. But the sample explanation says 7. What's going on here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, the problem statement says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So, each such sequence is a concatenation of letters, each of which is represented by a substring. But the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the question is not about the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split the string into valid Morse code letters. Wait, that would be a completely different problem. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is not counting the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to parse the string into sequences of letters. For example, for the string \"111\", the possible sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (the first '1')\n\n- \"T\" (the second '1')\n\n- \"T\" (the third '1')\n\n- \"M\" (the first two '1's)\n\n- \"M\" (the last two '1's)\n\n- \"O\" (the entire three '1's)\n\n- \"TT\" (the first 'T' and the second 'T')\n\n- \"TM\" (the first 'T' and the second two '1's)\n\n- \"MT\" (the first two '1's and the third 'T')\n\n- \"TTT\" (three Ts)\n\nBut that would be more than 7. However, the sample explanation lists 7 sequences. So this suggests that the problem is not about the number of valid substrings, but the number of valid sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting some substring of S into Morse code letters.\n\nBut that seems very different. How can that be?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nAh! So each such sequence is a sequence of letters, where the concatenation of their Morse codes is a substring of S. So for example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the Morse code \"11\", which is a substring of S. So the count includes all possible sequences of letters whose combined Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut that's a different problem. For example, the substring \"11\" can be parsed as a single letter (M), or as two letters (T and T). So each of these would be counted as separate sequences.\n\nSo the problem is not counting the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split substrings of S into valid Morse code letters, considering all possible splits.\n\nThis changes everything. Oh no! That's a completely different problem. So my initial understanding was wrong.\n\nSo for example, the sample input S is \"111\". The valid substrings are all possible substrings of lengths 1-3 (since length 4 is not possible). Each of these substrings can be split into sequences of letters. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as:\n\n- One letter (M).\n\n- Two letters (T and T).\n\nSo each of these splits counts as a separate sequence. Thus, for each valid substring, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the total answer is the sum over all substrings of S (of length 1-4) of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nThis makes the problem much more complex.\n\nSo the problem requires us to compute, for each step, the total number of such sequences across all substrings of S.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, the string is \"111\". Let's consider all substrings and their possible splits:\n\nSubstrings of length 1:\n\nEach of the three '1's. Each can be split as one letter. So 3 sequences.\n\nSubstrings of length 2:\n\nThere are two substrings, each is \"11\".\n\nEach can be split as:\n\n- One letter (M): 1 way.\n\n- Or two letters (T and T): 1 way.\n\nSo for each of the two substrings, 2 ways. Total 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSubstrings of length 3:\n\nOne substring \"111\".\n\nPossible splits:\n\n- One letter (O): 1 way.\n\n- Split into \"1\" and \"11\": T followed by M → 1 way.\n\n- Split into \"11\" and \"1\": M followed by T → 1 way.\n\n- Split into \"1\", \"1\", \"1\": TTT → 1 way.\n\nSo total of 4 ways.\n\nSo overall, the total is 3 (from length 1) + 4 (from length 2) + 4 (from length 3) = 11. But the sample says the answer is 7. So this is conflicting. Clearly, my understanding is still incorrect.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that after three steps, the answer is 7. Let me re-examine the sample explanation.\n\nSample explanation:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\nThat's 7 sequences. How does this relate to the substrings?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a way of parsing a substring of S into Morse code letters. For example:\n\n- \"T\" is a single-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"1\".\n\n- \"M\" is a single-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"11\".\n\n- \"O\" is a single-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"111\".\n\n- \"TT\" is a two-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"11\" (split into two Ts).\n\n- \"TM\" is a two-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"111\" (split into T and M).\n\n- \"MT\" is a two-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"111\" (split into M and T).\n\n- \"TTT\" is a three-letter sequence, corresponding to the substring \"111\" (split into three Ts).\n\nSo the total number of sequences is 7. This suggests that the problem is not counting all possible ways to split all substrings, but rather counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring. But that can't be, since the sample explanation includes multiple sequences that correspond to the same substring. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into \"M\" or \"TT\", which are two different sequences. So the count should be 2 for this substring. But according to the sample explanation, the count for \"11\" is 2 (M and TT) but the sample counts them as two entries.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7. Let's count how many sequences are there:\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\nEach of the seven sequences corresponds to a different way of parsing a substring. For example:\n\n- T (from \"1\") → 1.\n\n- M (from \"11\") → 1.\n\n- O (from \"111\") → 1.\n\n- TT (from \"11\") → 1.\n\n- TM (from \"111\") → 1.\n\n- MT (from \"111\") → 1.\n\n- TTT (from \"111\") → 1.\n\nTotal of 7 sequences. So the count is the number of distinct sequences of letters, not the number of ways to split substrings. But that doesn't make sense either, since the same sequence could be formed by different substrings.\n\nBut in this case, all the sequences are unique. However, this seems to contradict the idea that the problem counts the number of ways to split substrings into letters. So what is the actual problem statement saying?\n\nRe-reading the problem statement:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh! The key is that each sequence of letters is represented by a substring. So, for example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\". However, the same sequence can be represented by other substrings (but in this case, there is only one substring \"11\").\n\nBut the problem says to count all such sequences. So if there are multiple substrings that represent the same sequence, they are counted once? Or multiple times?\n\nThe sample explanation lists all possible sequences that are represented by any substring. For example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (which occurs twice in the string \"111\"). However, in the sample explanation, it's counted once. But according to the sample output, the answer is 7, which suggests that the count is the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be represented by any substring.\n\nBut this would be a different problem. However, this contradicts the note in the problem statement. Let's read the note again:\n\n\"In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\"\n\nThe note lists \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" — seven sequences. So each of these is a distinct sequence of letters. So the problem is counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any substring of S. However, this seems to ignore the multiplicity of how many times a particular sequence can be formed by different substrings. For example, the sequence \"T\" is formed by three different substrings (each single '1'), but in the sample explanation, it's counted once.\n\nBut the sample output is 7, which is the number of distinct sequences, not the number of ways to split substrings. However, this seems to conflict with the problem statement's wording. The problem says, \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So if a sequence can be represented by more than one substring, it's still counted once. However, this would make the problem very different from the initial approach.\n\nBut this seems unlikely, because the sample explanation lists the sequences as individual entries, implying that each is counted once regardless of how many substrings represent it. However, this interpretation would make the sample answer 7, which matches the first sample. However, how to compute this?\n\nBut this would be a completely different problem. For example, the first sample would require us to find all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. Each such sequence is counted once, even if it can be formed in multiple ways.\n\nBut this seems very difficult to compute. How can we track all possible sequences that can be formed by any substring of S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is misinterpreted, and the original understanding was correct. Let me recheck the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the answer is 7. According to the original approach (counting all valid substrings), the count would be 6. But the sample says 7. So clearly, the original approach was wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem counts the number of ways to parse the entire string into sequences of letters. But that also doesn't fit the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is counting the number of valid Morse code substrings, but including all possible ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters. For example, for the string \"111\", the number of ways to parse it into letters is:\n\n- 1 way (O).\n\n- 2 ways (M + T, T + M).\n\n- 3 ways (T + T + T).\n\nTotal 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Plus the ways to parse substrings. But this seems to not match the sample.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to count all possible ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters, and for each such split, count it as a sequence. But the sample explanation shows that this is not the case, since the sample includes sequences from different substrings.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me re-examine the problem statement once more.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nYour task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nThe key phrase is \"represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence is a sequence of letters whose concatenated Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nFor example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\", which is present in S. Similarly, the sequence \"TM\" is represented by the substring \"111\" (since T is \"1\" and M is \"11\", concatenated as \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\").\n\nSo each sequence of letters corresponds to a unique Morse code string (the concatenation of their Morse codes), which must be a substring of S.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct sequences of letters such that their concatenated Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut how do we compute this? Because the number of possible sequences can be very large, but the problem requires us to count them, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHowever, this interpretation would mean that the sample explanation's answer of 7 is correct. For example, the sequences are:\n\n- T (code \"1\").\n\n- M (code \"11\").\n\n- O (code \"111\").\n\n- TT (code \"11\").\n\n- TM (code \"111\").\n\n- MT (code \"111\").\n\n- TTT (code \"111\").\n\nThese are 7 distinct sequences. Note that sequences like \"TT\" and \"M\" both have the same code \"11\", but they are different sequences. So the count is based on the sequence of letters, not the code. Hence, the problem is to count all possible sequences of letters such that their concatenated Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut this seems extremely challenging, as it requires tracking all possible sequences of letters whose Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the problem differently. For each substring of S (of length 1-4), we need to find all possible ways to split it into valid Morse code letters, and for each such split, record the sequence of letters. Then, the total number of distinct sequences is the answer.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy, especially for large m (up to 3000). However, given that m is small (3000), and each step appends one character, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming.\n\nBut even then, how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet's think of the problem as counting the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of S into valid Morse code letters.\n\nTo do this, we can maintain a set of all such sequences. For each new character added to S, we look at all possible substrings ending at the new position (of lengths 1-4), and for each such substring, generate all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing it into valid Morse code letters, and add them to the set. Finally, the size of the set is the answer.\n\nBut for m=3000, and each step processing up to 4 substrings, each of which may have multiple ways to parse, this might be feasible.\n\nHowever, generating all possible sequences for each substring might be expensive. But given that the maximum length of a substring is 4, and the number of valid Morse code letters per position is limited, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to parse a substring of length up to 4 into valid letters.\n\nFor example, for a substring of length 1, it can be parsed as one letter (if valid), contributing one sequence.\n\nFor a substring of length 2, it can be parsed as:\n\n- one letter (if the entire substring is valid).\n\n- or two letters (if the first character is valid and the second character is valid).\n\nSo for each substring, we can generate all possible sequences by recursively splitting it into valid parts.\n\nThis sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem, where for each position in the substring, we track all possible sequences that can be formed up to that position.\n\nBut since the maximum length of the substring is 4, this can be handled with memoization or precomputed tables.\n\nLet's think about how to generate all possible sequences for a given Morse code string (the substring of S). For example, for the substring \"11\":\n\nPossible parses:\n\n- One letter (M).\n\n- Two letters (T and T).\n\nSo the sequences are [\"M\", \"TT\"].\n\nFor the substring \"111\", possible parses:\n\n- One letter (O).\n\n- Split after 1: T + parse \"11\" → T + [M, TT] → TM, TTT.\n\n- Split after 2: parse \"11\" (M) + T → MT.\n\n- Split after 1 and 2: T + T + T → TTT.\n\nSo the sequences are: O, TM, TTT, MT, TTT. Wait, but TTT appears twice. However, since we're counting distinct sequences, duplicates are only counted once.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sequences are O, TM, MT, TTT.\n\nSo the sequences generated from \"111\" are 4 distinct sequences.\n\nSo for each substring, we can generate all possible sequences of letters that can be parsed from it, and add them to a global set. The size of this set is the answer after each step.\n\nBut for m=3000, and each step adding up to 4 substrings, each of which may generate up to several sequences, this might be feasible.\n\nBut how to generate the sequences for each substring?\n\nLet's define a function that takes a Morse code string (of length up to 4), and returns all possible sequences of letters that can be parsed from it.\n\nFor example, for the string \"11\", the function returns [\"M\", \"TT\"].\n\nBut how to implement this function efficiently?\n\nWe can use dynamic programming. For a given string s, the possible sequences can be generated by checking all possible splits:\n\nFor each position i in s (from 1 to len(s)), if the first i characters form a valid Morse code, then recursively find all sequences for the remaining part of the string and prepend the corresponding letter to each of those sequences.\n\nAdditionally, if the entire string is valid, then add the corresponding letter as a single-element sequence.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 4, this recursion is manageable.\n\nLet's precompute the mapping from valid Morse code strings to their corresponding letters. Wait, but the problem says that each valid Morse code string (except the four invalid ones) corresponds to a distinct letter. So for each valid string, there is exactly one letter. So, for example, \"1\" corresponds to T, \"11\" to M, \"111\" to O, etc.\n\nBut we don't need to know the actual letters; we just need to know that each valid string maps to a unique letter. So for our purposes, the actual letter is irrelevant, as long as we can generate the sequence of letters as a string (e.g., \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", etc.).\n\nBut how to map the Morse code string to the letter? Well, the problem says that the four invalid strings are excluded. So for any valid string (not in the forbidden set), there is exactly one letter.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of generating the sequences, we don't need to know the actual letter; we just need to treat each valid Morse code string as representing a unique letter. So for example, the string \"11\" represents one unique letter (say, M), and the sequence \"TT\" represents two letters (T and T), which are two separate letters. \n\nBut the problem requires counting the sequences of letters, not the Morse codes. So for each valid Morse code string, it represents one letter, and any split into smaller valid Morse code strings represents a sequence of letters.\n\nBut since the actual letters are not important, we can treat each valid Morse code string as a unique identifier for a letter. For example, the string \"1\" represents letter A, \"11\" represents B, etc. But for our problem, we don't need to know what the letters are, just that each valid Morse code string maps to a unique letter, and sequences of letters are determined by the way the Morse code string is split into valid parts.\n\nBut for the purpose of generating the sequences, we can represent each valid Morse code string as a unique token (like a string), and the sequences are the concatenation of these tokens. For example, the string \"11\" can be split into the token \"11\" (representing one letter) or into \"1\" and \"1\" (two letters). So the sequences would be [\"11\", \"1 1\"], but since the actual letters are unique, the sequences are \"M\" and \"TT\".\n\nBut to generate the sequences, we need to know what the letters are. However, since the problem states that each valid Morse code string corresponds to exactly one letter, and the four invalid ones are excluded, we can assume that each valid string corresponds to a unique letter. But without knowing the actual mapping, how can we generate the sequences of letters?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because the actual letters are not provided, and the problem's note says that the conversion table can be found elsewhere. But for solving the problem, we don't need to know the actual letters. We just need to know that each valid string corresponds to a unique letter, and that different splits of the same Morse code string into valid parts generate different sequences",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a string `S` in Morse code after each modification.
