    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Wait, the constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y, and y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ y. Similarly, y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. So the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is up to B, y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C. So in any valid triplet (x, y, z), x ≤ y ≤ z. \n\nFor a triangle with sides x ≤ y ≤ z, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because z is the largest side. If that holds, then the other inequalities (like x + z > y, which is always true since z ≥ y and x ≥ 1) will automatically hold. So the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already implied by the ranges, since x ≤ B ≤ y and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z),\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nSo how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z in their ranges and check if x + y > z. But given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, this would be O(B * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)) which is way too slow. For example, if all ranges are 5e5, then it's (5e5)^3 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, note that for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. Also, since z has to be ≥ y (because y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, no. Wait, since y can be up to C, and z starts at C. So for a fixed x and y, z must satisfy:\n\nmax(y, C) ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1)\n\nBut since y ≥ B and C ≥ B, and since y can be up to C. For example, if y is in [B, C], then since z ≥ C, which is ≥ y (since y ≤ C). So for a given x and y, the lower bound of z is C (since z must be ≥ C) and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). But for the z to exist, the lower bound must be ≤ upper bound. So for each x and y, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if C ≤ x + y - 1.\n\nSo the problem can be broken down into:\n\nTotal = sum_{x in [A..B]} sum_{y in [B..C]} [number of z in [C..D] where z < x + y]\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe key idea is that for each x and y, compute the count of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1). The count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total is the sum over x and y of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider the variables x and y. Let me note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So for each x and y, the value of x + y can vary. Let me think about the possible values of s = x + y. Then, for each s, the minimal z is C and maximal is min(D, s-1). So the count for a given s is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if s-1 >= C. Which can be rewritten as:\n\nif s > C: then the count is min(D, s-1) - C + 1.\n\nBut if s <= C, then there's no z that satisfies z >= C and z < s. So the count is zero.\n\nSo for each x and y, if x + y > C, then the number of z's is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). Else zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing over all x and y (with x in [A,B], y in [B,C]) the value of (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) when x + y > C.\n\nSo how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me split the sum into two parts: for x and y such that x + y - 1 >= C, and for those where x + y -1 < C. The latter contribute zero.\n\nSo the total is sum_{x,y} [max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)].\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me denote s = x + y. For each x and y, s ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). But since x can be as low as A and y as low as B, the minimum s is A + B. The maximum s is B + C.\n\nNow, for each s, we can compute the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to s. Then, for each such s, compute the contribution to the total.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let me first compute for each possible s, the number of (x,y) pairs where x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], and x + y = s. Then, for each such s, compute the contribution for each pair as follows:\n\nIf s <= C: contribution is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nthe contribution for each pair is (min(D, s -1) - C + 1) = (min(D, s-1) - C + 1).\n\nBut since for all pairs with the same s, the contribution is the same, we can compute the number of pairs for that s multiplied by the contribution.\n\nSo the total becomes:\n\nsum_{s} [count_pairs(s) * contribution(s)]\n\nwhere contribution(s) is:\n\nif s <= C: 0\n\nelse:\n\nif s - 1 >= D: (D - C + 1)\n\nelse: (s - 1 - C + 1) = s - C\n\nSo contribution(s) = max(0, min(D, s -1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, s - C)) )\n\nBut how to compute count_pairs(s) for each s?\n\nSo the problem now is to compute for each s, how many pairs (x, y) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem of counting the number of pairs (x, y) in ranges that sum to s. How can this be done efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible s values. The minimum possible s is A + B, and the maximum is B + C.\n\nFor each s in [A+B, B+C], we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y = s.\n\nLet me fix x. For each x in [A, B], y must be s - x. And y must be in [B, C]. So for a given x, y is determined as s - x, and we need to check if it's within [B, C].\n\nAlternatively, for each s, the number of pairs is the number of x in [A, B] such that (s - x) is in [B, C].\n\nWhich is equivalent to x in [A, B], and B ≤ s - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\ns - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nAdditionally, x must be between A and B.\n\nSo x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo for each s, the count_pairs(s) is the number of x in [A, B] that lie in [s - C, s - B].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all s?\n\nWell, for each s, the lower bound for x is L = max(A, s - C), and upper bound is U = min(B, s - B). Then the count is max(0, U - L + 1).\n\nSo for each s, the count_pairs(s) can be computed as max(0, U - L + 1), where U = min(B, s - B), L = max(A, s - C).\n\nBut how do I compute this for all s efficiently?\n\nBut considering that s ranges from s_min = A + B to s_max = B + C. The number of possible s is O(B + C - A - B + 1) = O(C - A + 1). Which for 5e5 is manageable if we can compute each s in O(1) time.\n\nBut if we loop through each s in s_min to s_max, and for each compute the count_pairs(s), then multiply by the contribution, then the total time would be O((B + C - A + 1)) which is acceptable for 5e5.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of s_max? Since B and C can be up to 5e5, s_max can be up to 1e6. So looping through s from A+B to B+C is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over s from s_min = A + B to s_max = B + C.\n\nFor each s:\n\nCompute L = max(A, s - C)\n\nCompute U = min(B, s - B)\n\nIf U < L: then count_pairs(s) = 0\n\nElse: count_pairs(s) = U - L + 1\n\nThen, compute contribution(s):\n\nif s <= C → contribution is 0\n\nelse:\n\nif (s - 1) >= D → contribution = D - C + 1\n\nelse → contribution = (s - 1) - C + 1 = s - C\n\nSo the contribution is max(0, min(D - C + 1, s - C)) ?\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\ncontribution is (min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) if s - 1 >= C, else 0.\n\nSo when s -1 >= C → s >= C + 1 → s >= C+1.\n\nSo for s >= C + 1:\n\nthe contribution is min(D, s - 1) - C + 1.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nif s - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (s - 1 - C + 1) = s - C.\n\nSo for s >= C+1, contribution is min(D - C + 1, s - C).\n\nBut for s >= C+1, s - C can be up to (B + C) - C = B. But D can be larger or smaller than s-1.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each s, the contribution is:\n\nif s <= C: 0\n\nelse:\n\ncontribution = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) → which is same as:\n\ncontribution = max(0, min(D - C + 1, s - C)) )\n\nSo the total is sum over all s (count_pairs(s) * contribution(s)).\n\nSo this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5. So s can be 3,4,5.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nU = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\ncount_pairs = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\ncontribution: s=3, which is equal to C=3. So s is not greater than C. So contribution is 0. So contribution is 0. So total += 1*0 = 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nU = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2-1 +1 = 2.\n\ncontribution: s=4 > C=3. So compute min(D, s-1) = min(4, 3) = 3. So contribution is 3 -3 +1 = 1. So 2 * 1 = 2 added.\n\ns=5:\n\nL = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nU = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2-2 +1 = 1.\n\ncontribution: s=5 >3. s-1=4. min(4, 4) is 4. 4-3 +1= 2. So 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nTotal sum is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 1 2 2 5 → output 3.\n\nLet me check.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4. So s=3,4.\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1,1)=1.\n\nU = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\ncount_pairs = 1.\n\ncontribution: s=3. C=2. s > C. So contribution is min(5, 3-1) - 2 +1 → min(5, 2) is 2. 2-2+1=1. So 1 * 1 = 1.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4-2)= max(1,2)=2.\n\nU = min(2, 4-2)= min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 1.\n\ncontribution: s=4>2. s-1=3. min(5,3)=3. 3-2 +1=2. So 1*2=2. Total is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\ns ranges from 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6 to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So only s=1e6.\n\nFor s=1e6:\n\nL = max(5e5, s - C) → s - C = 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So L is 5e5.\n\nU = min(B=5e5, s - B = 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5). So U=5e5.\n\ncount_pairs = 5e5 -5e5 +1 = 1.\n\ncontribution: s=1e6. C=5e5. s > C. s-1 = 999999. D is 5e5. So min(5e5, 999999) is 5e5. So contribution is 5e5 -5e5 +1 = 1. So total is 1*1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   compute L = max(A, s - C)\n\n   compute U = min(B, s - B)\n\n   if U < L: continue (count_pairs is 0)\n\n   count_pairs = U - L + 1\n\n   if s <= C:\n\n       contribution = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       if (s -1) >= D:\n\n           contribution = D - C + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           contribution = (s - 1) - C + 1 = s - C\n\n   total += count_pairs * contribution\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the contribution part, perhaps we can compute it as:\n\nif s <= C:\n\n    contrib = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    lower_z = C\n\n    upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\n    if upper_z < lower_z:\n\n        contrib = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        contrib = upper_z - lower_z + 1\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\ncontrib = max(0, min(D, s -1) - C + 1)\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nif s <= C:\n\n    contrib = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    upper = min(D, s - 1)\n\n    if upper < C:\n\n        contrib = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        contrib = upper - C + 1\n\nBut since s > C, then s -1 >= C? No. For example, s could be C+1. Then s-1 = C. So upper_z is C. So upper >= C. So in that case, contrib is C - C + 1 = 1.\n\nSo in code, for s > C:\n\nupper_z = min(D, s-1)\n\ncontrib = max(0, upper_z - C + 1)\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ncontrib = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut since s > C, then s-1 >= C? No. For example, if s = C, then s is not > C. So in the code, when s > C, then s-1 >= C - 1. But since s > C, s can be C + 1, then s-1 is C. So yes, upper_z is at least C.\n\nWait, when s > C, then s-1 >= C?\n\nYes. Because s > C implies s-1 >= C (since s is integer). For example, if C is 3, s is 4, s-1 is 3. So yes. So for s > C, s-1 >= C. Therefore, upper_z is min(D, s-1) which is >= C. Therefore, contrib is upper_z - C + 1.\n\nSo in code, for s > C:\n\ncontrib = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfor each s in s_min ... s_max:\n\n    compute L and U for x.\n\n    count_pairs = ... \n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        contrib = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\n        contrib = upper_z - C + 1\n\n    total += count_pairs * contrib\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nNow, considering that the ranges can be up to 5e5, and s ranges up to 1e6, this loop is acceptable.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, how to handle this?\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input. For each test case.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the first line contains four integers. But in the example input, there are three lines, each being a separate test case. However, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as four integers. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. But the example shows multiple lines. Oh, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases in the example, but the actual problem expects a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers... So the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is four integers. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers... So the code should process one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, but that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. But in the actual programming problem, the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut looking at the note in the problem statement, the sample input is given as three lines, but perhaps the actual code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines. That's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is '1 2 3 4', and the output is 4. So the code should read one line of input. However, in the sample input given in the problem statement, there are three lines, which suggests that the code needs to process multiple test cases. But that's conflicting with the problem description.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). So perhaps the input is multiple test cases, each given in a line. For example, the sample input shows three lines, each being a separate test case. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps that's a mistake. Or perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple lines for illustration, but the actual code should process a single line.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the original problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. But perhaps the problem is from a contest where the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But given that the sample input includes multiple lines, perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nBut that would imply that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is shown with multiple lines, but the actual code should process one line. However, in the sample input, the user probably intended that the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the code is required to process multiple test cases, each given in a separate line.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input shows three lines, and the output shows three lines, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process each line as a test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So this is conflicting. However, in the sample input, the first line is '1 2 3 4', which is one test case, but the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given with multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line. But this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code needs to process multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, each line being a test case.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, the problem says in the note that in the first example, the input is '1 2 3 4', and output is 4. So perhaps the code should process one test case. However, the sample input in the problem shows three lines. Maybe that's just a formatting error. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line.\n\nBut the original problem's input says that the first line contains four integers. Therefore, the code should read one line of input. However, the sample shows multiple lines. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple lines, each line being a test case. Therefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines, split each into A, B, C, D, compute the answer for each, and print each answer on a separate line.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is four integers. However, in practice, the code should process multiple lines. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases, each given in a line.\n\nTherefore, the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nNow, proceeding with the code.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the approach discussed.\n\nBut what about when B is less than C? Wait, according to the input constraints, A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B can be equal to C. For example, in the second sample input, B=2, C=2.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    # compute L and U for x in [A, B], y in [B, C], x + y = s.\n\n    # L = max(A, s - C)\n\n    # U = min(B, s - B)\n\n    L = max(A, s - C)\n\n    U = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if U < L:\n\n        count_pairs = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count_pairs = U - L + 1\n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        contrib = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n\n        contrib = upper_z - C + 1\n\n    total += count_pairs * contrib\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut let's test this code for the sample input 1 2 3 4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3: L = max(1, 3-3)=1, U=min(2, 3-2)=1. count_pairs=1. s=3 is equal to C=3, so contrib=0. total remains 0.\n\ns=4: L = max(1, 4-3)=1. U = min(2, 4-2)=2. count_pairs=2. s=4 > C=3. upper_z = min(4, 4-1=3) → 3. contrib = 3-3 +1=1. 2*1=2 added. total is 2.\n\ns=5: L = max(1, 5-3=2) → 2. U = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. count_pairs=1. upper_z = min(4, 5-1=4) →4. contrib=4-3+1=2. total += 1*2 → total is 4. Correct.\n\nSo code works for first sample.\n\nAnother sample: 1 2 2 5. s ranges from 3 to 4.\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3 - 2) = 1. U = min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. count_pairs=1. s=3 > C=2. upper_z is min(5, 3-1=2). contrib = 2 - 2 +1 =1. total += 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 2=2). U = min(2, 4-2=2). count_pairs=1. contrib: upper_z = min(5, 4-1=3). contrib = 3 -2 +1= 2. total += 1*2 → 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: A=B=C=D=500000.\n\ns_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. s_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. So s=1e6.\n\nL = max(500000, 1e6 - 500000) → max(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5.\n\nU = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5. count_pairs = 1.\n\ns=1e6 > C=5e5. upper_z = min(5e5, 1e6 -1) → min(5e5, 999999) → 5e5. contrib = 5e5 - 5e5 +1 = 1. total = 1. Correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: A=B=C=D=1. Then:\n\ns ranges from 2 (1+1) to 1+1=2. s=2.\n\nL = max(1, 2 - 1=1) → 1. U = min(1, 2 - 1=1). count_pairs=1.\n\ns=2 > C=1. upper_z = min(1, 2-1=1). contrib = 1 - 1 +1 =1. total is 1. Which is correct: (1,1,1) is the only triangle. Correct.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2. So possible x=1, y can be 1 or 2. z can be 2.\n\nCheck for each (x,y):\n\nx=1, y=1: need z >= 2 and z < 1+1=2. So z must be >=2 and <2 → no solution.\n\nx=1, y=2: z must be >=2 and < 1+2=3. So z can be 2. So one solution.\n\nSo total is 1. Let's see what the code does.\n\ns ranges from 1+1=2 to 1+2=3.\n\ns=2:\n\nL = max(1, 2 - 2) = max(1, 0) =1. U = min(1, 2 - 1=1). count_pairs=1. s=2 equals C=2 → contrib 0. So nothing added.\n\ns=3:\n\nL = max(1, 3-2=1). U = min(1, 3-1=2) → 1. count_pairs=1. s=3>2. upper_z = min(2, 3-1=2). contrib = 2-2 +1 =1. total += 1 → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=3, C=3, D=5.\n\nPossible x ranges from 2 to 3. y ranges from 3 to 3. So x can be 2 or 3, y is 3.\n\nFor x=2, y=3: z must be between 3 and 5, and z < 2+3=5 → z can be 3,4. So two options.\n\nFor x=3, y=3: z must be between 3 and 5, and z < 3+3=6. So z can be 3,4,5 → 3 options.\n\nTotal is 2 +3=5.\n\nLet's compute via the code.\n\ns ranges from 2+3=5 to 3+3=6.\n\ns=5:\n\nL = max(2, 5 -3=2) → 2. U = min(3, 5-3=2) → 2. count_pairs=1. s=5>3 (C=3). upper_z = min(5,5-1=4). contrib is 4-3 +1=2. So 1*2=2 added.\n\ns=6:\n\nL = max(2, 6-3=3). U = min(3, 6-3=3). count_pairs=1. contrib is min(5, 6-1=5) →5. 5-3+1=3. So 1*3=3. total is 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about the case when s_max is very large? For example, B and C are 5e5. Then s_max is 1e6. So the loop runs from 1e6 to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut for the worst case, when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then s ranges from 1+5e5 to 5e5 +5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs for 5e5 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nIn Python, loops up to 1e6 are acceptable.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead each line from stdin, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nFor each line, compute the total as per the above approach.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            L = max(A, s - C)\n            U = min(B, s - B)\n            if U < L:\n                count_pairs = 0\n            else:\n                count_pairs = U - L + 1\n            if s <= C:\n                contrib = 0\n            else:\n                upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n                contrib = upper_z - C + 1\n            total += count_pairs * contrib\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the case where upper_z - C + 1 is negative? No, because when s > C, then upper_z is min(D, s-1), which is >= C. So upper_z - C +1 is at least 1 (when upper_z = C).\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nBut for the case where D is smaller than C, but that's not possible since C ≤ D per input constraints.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is that for a triangle with sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the triangle inequality requires $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D$, we can deduce that $x$ ranges from $A$ to $B$, $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$, and $z$ ranges from $C$ to $D$.\n2. **Sum Ranges**: For each possible sum $s = x + y$, we determine the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy $z < s$ and $C \\leq z \\leq D$.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating over all possible sums $s$ from $A + B$ to $B + C$, we calculate the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs for each sum and the corresponding valid $z$ values efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            L = max(A, s - C)\n            U = min(B, s - B)\n            if U < L:\n                count_pairs = 0\n            else:\n                count_pairs = U - L + 1\n            if s <= C:\n                contrib = 0\n            else:\n                upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n                contrib = upper_z - C + 1\n            total += count_pairs * contrib\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each containing four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each line, it calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums $s = x + y$.\n3. **Valid Pairs Calculation**: For each sum $s$, it determines the valid range of $x$ values and counts the corresponding valid $(x, y)$ pairs.\n4. **Contribution Calculation**: For each valid sum $s$, it calculates how many valid $z$ values exist such that $C \\leq z < s$ and adds the contribution to the total count of valid triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid ranges and leverages mathematical insights to avoid brute-force checking, ensuring optimal performance even for large input values.",
