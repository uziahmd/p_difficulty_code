The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nFrom the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k more new vertices connected to them. And this process is done at least once. Wait, the step says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" So the process involves multiple layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's take an example. For k=4, the minimal snowflake is shown. Let's see:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion: connect it to k=4 nodes. Now total is 1 + 4 = 5 nodes. But then, the step says that each vertex connected to only one other (the 4 new ones) must be connected to k new nodes. So each of those 4 nodes gets 4 new children. So adding 4*4 = 16 nodes. Total now is 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction steps.\n\nWait the example input includes 13 as a yes. Let me think again. Let me try to model the possible numbers of vertices.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The snowflake is a tree, since each step adds new nodes connected to existing ones. Also, the structure is like a k-ary tree but with some constraints.\n\nLet me try to model the number of nodes. The construction process can be thought of as building layers. The first layer is the root. Then, the second layer is the k children of the root. Then, each node in the second layer must have k children (third layer). Then, perhaps, this can be done again, adding another layer. But the process requires that each time a node has only one connection (i.e., is a leaf), we add k children. But the step is done at least once. So the minimal case would be when we have two layers. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step of adding k nodes to each leaf (the first layer) is done once. So the minimal snowflake is when we have the root (1), then k children (layer 1), then each of those has k children (layer 2). So total nodes is 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k². But for k>1, the minimal possible n is when k=2 and layers are 2 steps. So 1+2+4=7. But the sample input has n=6 as no. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=6, the output is NO. Let's see why. Suppose k=2. Then the minimal would be 1+2+4=7. So 6 is not possible. What if there's another way?\n\nWait maybe the construction allows for different numbers of layers. For example, maybe the process can stop after adding the first layer (but the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once). So the initial step (adding k children) is the first part. Then, the step of adding k children to each leaf (which are the nodes in the first layer) must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k². So for k=2, the minimal is 7. So for n=6, it's impossible.\n\nBut the sample input says for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see. For example, if k=3 and layers are 2 steps. 1 +3 +3²=13. Yes! So that's why n=13 is YES. So that's the case.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in the form 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1, and k ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because the construction process may have more layers. Let me re-express the structure.\n\nThe construction starts with 1 node. Then, each time you add layers. The first layer (after the root) is k nodes. Then, each node in the previous layer (which was a leaf) is expanded by adding k children. So the number of nodes is:\n\nAfter 0 layers (only root): 1.\n\nAfter 1 layer: 1 + k.\n\nAfter 2 layers: 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid \"snowflake\" graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, starting with one node and expanding in layers where each leaf node from the previous layer gets `k` new children, with `k > 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Snowflake Construction**:\n   - The snowflake starts with one vertex.\n   - Then, it adds `k` nodes connected to the root.\n   - Each leaf node (from the previous step) then gets `k` new children.\n   - This expansion must happen **at least once** after the initial step.\n\n2. **Structure of Vertices**:\n   - After `m` expansions (layers), the total number of vertices is:\n     $$\n     n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\dots + k^m\n     $$\n   - This is a geometric series: $ n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - `k > 1`\n   - `m ≥ 1` (since the expansion must be done at least once)\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\nFor each test case with a number `n`, we need to check if there exists any integer `k > 1` and `m ≥ 1` such that:\n$$\nn = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to checking for each possible base `k` whether `n` fits into this formula for some `m`.\n\nHowever, since `n` can be as large as $10^{18}$, we need an efficient way to iterate through all possible values of `k` and `m` without brute-forcing all combinations.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Algorithm:\n\n- For each `n`:\n  - Try all possible values of `k` from 2 up to a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 60, since $2^{60} > 10^{18}$).\n  - For each `k`, use binary search to find the largest `m` such that the sum $S = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\leq n$.\n  - If `S == n`, then it's possible to form the snowflake.\n\n---\n\n### Python Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    # Try all k from 2 to 60\n    for k in range(2, 61):\n        m = 1\n        total = 1 + k\n        while True:\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n            # Compute next level\n            total += k * (k ** m)\n            m += 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        if is_snowflake_possible(n):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `is_snowflake_possible(n)` checks for all values of `k` from 2 to 60 (since higher values won’t yield a sum less than $10^{18}$).\n- For each `k`, it builds the snowflake layer-by-layer until the sum exceeds `n`.\n- If at any point the sum equals `n`, it returns `True`.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases Handled:\n\n- `n = 1`: Only one node. No expansion was performed, so not valid.\n- `n = 2`, `3`, `6`: Not enough nodes to form even the minimal structure (minimum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 for k=2).\n\n---\n\n### Complexity:\n\n- For each test case, the loop over `k` runs up to 60 times.\n- For each `k`, the inner loop runs in logarithmic time relative to `n`.\n- Since `t` is up to $10^4$, the solution is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n\nThis approach ensures correctness and efficiency for large inputs up to $10^{18}$, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements.",
