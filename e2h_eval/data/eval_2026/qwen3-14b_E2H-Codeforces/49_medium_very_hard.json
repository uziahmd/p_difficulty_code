They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values provided for each edge (road). So, each road between two lawns has a GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two lawns. Our task is to find possible values for each lawn or determine that it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the constraints. For each edge between u and v, we have that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. But there's a relationship between GCD and LCM: the product of GCD and LCM equals the product of the two numbers. So, g * l = a_u * a_v. Also, since GCD divides both a_u and a_v, then a_u must be a multiple of g, and similarly for a_v. Let me think.\n\nSo for each edge, the two numbers a_u and a_v must satisfy that their GCD is g and LCM is l. But how can I model this?\n\nLet me consider that for each pair (u, v), a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Because if they had a common divisor, that would be part of the GCD. Then, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g*x*y. Because LCM(a_u, a_v) = (a_u * a_v)/GCD(a_u, a_v) = (g^2 x y)/g = g x y. So, according to the problem, this LCM must equal l. Therefore, g * x * y = l. Which implies that x * y = l / g. Also, since x and y are coprime, the product x*y must be equal to l/g, and x and y must be coprime. So, for each edge, l must be divisible by g. Otherwise, there's no solution. Wait, that's an important check. So first, for every edge, if l % g != 0, then it's impossible. Because otherwise, the LCM would not be possible. So that's the first thing to check.\n\nSo, step one: for each input edge, check if l is divisible by g. If not, output NO.\n\nBut even if that's true, there's more. For example, in the case where the same node is connected through different edges with conflicting constraints.\n\nSo, how do I model the relationships between the nodes? It seems like a graph problem where each edge imposes constraints on the values of the nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by the product of some factors along the edges. But how?\n\nLet me think of each node's value as being a multiple of the GCD of its edges. But since the GCD is fixed per edge, maybe we can model the relationships between the nodes as variables that are connected via multiplicative factors.\n\nAnother approach: for each connected component in the graph, the values of the nodes are determined up to some constraints. For example, if we have a tree structure, we can assign values starting from a root node. But if there's a cycle, the constraints must be consistent.\n\nWait, but how to handle the variables. Let me think again. For each edge between u and v, we know that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g. Let's denote k = l/g. So x * y = k, and gcd(x,y) = 1. Therefore, x and y are coprime divisors of k, such that their product is k. Which means that x and y are coprime pairs whose product is k. So, for example, if k is 6, then possible pairs are (1,6) and (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But since x and y are coprime, any pair of coprime numbers whose product is k.\n\nBut how do I choose which pair to take for each edge? Because this choice affects the values of the nodes.\n\nThis seems like a graph where each edge requires that the ratio between the two nodes' values is determined by some factors. However, since the nodes are connected, the assignments must be consistent across the entire component.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge between u and v, the a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. Moreover, the product a_u * a_v = g*l. So, for each edge, a_u and a_v are two numbers that multiply to g*l, and their GCD is g. Which implies that they are g multiplied by two coprime numbers whose product is l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, the two nodes must have values that are multiples of g, and their product is g*l. Also, the GCD of the two is exactly g.\n\nBut how can I model this? Maybe using a Union-Find structure with some constraints? Or perhaps building a graph where each node has a value that is determined relative to others.\n\nAnother idea: For each connected component, assign a base value to a node and propagate the constraints. For example, if we pick a root node and assign it a value, then for each edge, we can compute the value of the adjacent node based on the known value. However, this may not work directly because the relationships are not linear. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have a node u connected to v via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, a_u and a_v must be such that:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g, and lcm(a_u, a_v) = l. Which implies that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime, and x * y = l/g. So, given that, for the edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is (x/y) or (y/x), depending on which way we go.\n\nBut since x and y are coprime, and their product is fixed, once we choose x and y, the values are determined. However, the problem is that when you have multiple edges connected to a node, the choices for x and y must be consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, we can model the nodes as variables that are connected by equations. For example, for each edge between u and v, we have that a_u / a_v = (x/y) where x * y = k (k = l/g), and x and y are coprime. But since x and y are coprime, and their product is k, then x is a divisor of k, and y is k/x. So for each edge, the possible options are to assign a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = k. However, this introduces a problem: for each edge, there are multiple possibilities, and these choices must be consistent across the entire component.\n\nBut how can we choose the right x and y for each edge?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by a factor relative to another node. For example, if we have a chain of edges, each with their own constraints, we can assign values in a way that satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet me think of building a graph where each node's value is determined relative to another. For example, suppose I have a tree structure. Let me pick a root node and assign it a value. Then, for each edge, I can compute the value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value and the constraints of the edge.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose I have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Let's say I assign a value to u, then compute the value of v.\n\nWe have that a_u * a_v = g * l. So, if a_u is known, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. However, this must also satisfy that gcd(a_u, a_v) = g. Let's see.\n\nLet me check this. Suppose a_u is assigned, then a_v is (g*l)/a_u. Then, the GCD of a_u and a_v is supposed to be g. Let's verify:\n\ngcd(a_u, (g*l)/a_u) ?\n\nBut since a_u is a multiple of g (since the GCD is g), let me write a_u = g * x. Then a_v = (g*l)/(g*x) ) = l/(x). But earlier, we had that x * y = l/g, so y = (l/g)/x. Then, a_v = g * y. So substituting, a_v = g * (l/(g x)) ) = l/(x). Wait, but l = g * k, where k = l/g. So, l = g*k. Then, a_v = (g * k)/x. But since x * y = k, and a_v = g * y. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, if a_u is set to g * x, then a_v is set to g * y, where x*y = k. So, the product a_u * a_v is g^2 * x y = g^2 * k = g^2 * (l/g) = g*l. Which matches the required condition.\n\nBut the problem is that when you assign a value to a node, the other node's value is determined, but how do you ensure that the GCD is exactly g? Because if a_u and a_v are set as above, then their GCD is g.\n\nWait, let's check that. Let's take a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime. Then, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g * gcd(x, y) = g * 1 = g. So yes, this satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the key is that for each edge, once you assign a value to one of the nodes, the other is determined. However, the problem is that when you have cycles in the graph, the assignments must be consistent. For example, if you have a cycle, the product of the ratios around the cycle must be 1, otherwise, there's a contradiction.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- For each connected component, build a graph and assign variables based on the constraints. This is similar to a bipartition problem, but with multiplicative constraints.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of each node's value as being a product of some factors. Let's say that for each node u, we can represent its value as a_u = g_u * x_u, where g_u is some value derived from the edges. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, considering that for each edge, the product a_u * a_v = g * l (for that edge). But since each edge has its own g and l, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a system of equations where for each edge between u and v, a_u * a_v = g * l (for that edge). But this is not sufficient, because the GCD must be exactly g. However, if we can ensure that the product is correct and that the GCD is g, then the problem is solved.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Well, if for each edge, the product is correct, and the GCD is g, then the LCM will automatically be l, since LCM(a_u,a_v) = (a_u * a_v)/GCD(a_u,a_v) = (g*l)/g = l. So, if the product is g*l and the GCD is g, then the LCM is l. Therefore, the problem reduces to ensuring that for each edge, the product of a_u and a_v is equal to g*l, and that the GCD of a_u and a_v is exactly g. However, checking the GCD is tricky. But perhaps if we can model the variables such that the GCD is exactly g, then the product condition is sufficient.\n\nBut how to model that? Let's think again about the earlier approach where a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime. Then, the product a_u * a_v = g^2 x y = g * l. Since l = g * k, then x y = k. So, the product of x and y is k. And since x and y are coprime, they must be a pair of coprime divisors of k whose product is k.\n\nBut this suggests that for each edge, the variables x and y are coprime and their product is k. So, for the edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is (x/y) or (y/x), depending on which direction we take. However, since x and y are coprime, their ratio is determined by the choice of x and y.\n\nBut how to model this in a graph? For example, in a connected component, if we assign x for one node, then the other nodes' x's can be determined based on the edges. However, the problem is that for each edge, x and y are determined by the product k = l/g, and their coprimality.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of building a graph where each node's value is represented as a product of factors. For example, if we model the variables as a_u = g_u * something. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by a factor relative to another node. For example, in a tree, we can assign a value to the root, and then for each edge, compute the value of the adjacent node based on the current node's value and the edge's constraints. However, the problem is that for each edge, the value of the adjacent node depends on the current node's value, but the exact relation depends on the x and y for that edge.\n\nBut how can I choose x and y for each edge? Because there are multiple possibilities, but the choice must be consistent across the entire component.\n\nWait, but for each edge, once I fix the value of one node, the other is determined. For example, suppose I have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. If I assign a_u, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. However, this assignment must also satisfy that the GCD of a_u and a_v is exactly g. How can I ensure that?\n\nBut if a_u is chosen such that it is a multiple of g, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u will also be a multiple of g. Let me see:\n\nIf a_u is a multiple of g, then let a_u = g * x. Then, a_v = (g*l) / (g x) ) = l/(x). Now, l is the LCM of a_u and a_v, which is given. Also, since l must be divisible by g (as per earlier check), let's say l = g * k. Then, a_v = (g * k) / x. But since a_u and a_v must have a GCD of g, then the GCD of (g x, g * (k/x)) ) must be g. Let's compute that:\n\ngcd(gx, g*(k/x)) = g * gcd(x, k/x).\n\nBut since x * y = k (from earlier steps), where y is k/x. Wait, earlier we said that x * y = k. But k = l/g. So, x * y = l/g. And since x and y are coprime, then x must divide k and y must be k/x. So, in this case, for the a_v to be g * y, then y must be k/x. Which implies that x divides k. Therefore, for the assignment to be valid, a_u must be a multiple of g, and x must divide k (which is l/g). Also, since x and y are coprime, then x and k/x must be coprime. Which implies that x must be a divisor of k, and that x and k/x are coprime. Which is only possible if x is a divisor of k, and x is square-free? Or perhaps that k must be square-free?\n\nNo, not necessarily. For example, if k is 6, then x can be 2 and y=3, which are coprime. Or x=3 and y=2. But if k is 4, then x can be 1 and y=4 (coprime), or x=4 and y=1. But if x is 2, then y is 2, which are not coprime. So, in that case, x must be a divisor of k, and x and y = k/x must be coprime. Which implies that x must be a divisor of k and that x and k/x are coprime. Which implies that x must be a product of some subset of the prime factors of k, and y is the product of the remaining primes. Therefore, for x and y to be coprime, k must be square-free? No, because if k is 6 (which is square-free), then x can be 2 and y=3. But if k is 12, then x can be 3 and y=4 (coprime). So k doesn't have to be square-free. So the key is that x divides k, and x and k/x are coprime. So, for a given k, the possible x's are the divisors of k that are coprime with k/x. Which is equivalent to saying that x is a divisor of k, and that x is square-free? Not sure.\n\nBut regardless, for the purposes of solving the problem, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor each connected component, assign a value to one of the nodes (say, the root) and then propagate the constraints through the edges. However, the problem is that the assignment for the root must be such that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to choose the root's value?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the example of a single edge between u and v. The GCD is g, LCM is l. We can choose a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x*y = l/g and x and y are coprime. For example, x could be 1, y could be l/g. So, a_u = g and a_v = g * (l/g) = l. Then, the GCD of g and l is g, which is correct. But wait, the GCD of g and l is g only if l is a multiple of g. Which is already checked earlier. So, in this case, the assignment is possible. So, for a single edge, the answer is always possible as long as l is divisible by g.\n\nBut what if there's a cycle? For example, three nodes connected in a triangle. Each edge has some constraints. How to check consistency?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph with constraints on the product of variables. For example, for each edge between u and v, a_u * a_v = C_uv (where C_uv is g * l for that edge). Then, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a set of values for the nodes such that for every edge, the product of the two nodes is equal to C_uv.\n\nBut this is similar to a system of equations where each equation is a_u * a_v = C_uv. How to solve such a system?\n\nThis is a well-known problem. For example, if the graph is a tree, we can assign a value to the root and compute the rest. However, for cycles, we need to check if the product around the cycle is consistent.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a cycle u1 - u2 - u3 - u1. The product equations would be:\n\na1 * a2 = C12\n\na2 * a3 = C23\n\na3 * a1 = C31\n\nMultiplying all three equations gives (a1 a2 a3)^2 = C12 * C23 * C31. Therefore, the product of the three C's must be a perfect square. Otherwise, there's no solution. If it is a perfect square, then the product of the three C's is (a1 a2 a3)^2, so a1 a2 a3 is the square root of that product. Then, we can assign values accordingly.\n\nBut this is under the assumption that the system of equations a_u * a_v = C_uv is solvable. However, our problem is not just that. Because even if this system is solvable, we also have to ensure that the GCD of the nodes on each edge is exactly the given g. Which adds another layer of constraints.\n\nBut perhaps, if we can solve the system of equations a_u * a_v = C_uv, and then check that the GCD of each pair is exactly the given g, then we can have a solution. However, solving this system is non-trivial.\n\nBut let's think: for each edge, the product of the nodes is fixed. Then, the GCD of the nodes is g. So, for any two nodes connected by an edge, their product is g*l, and their GCD is g. Which implies that their LCM is l. Which is what we want.\n\nSo, perhaps solving the system of equations a_u * a_v = C_uv (where C_uv = g * l for that edge) is necessary and sufficient. But why?\n\nBecause once the product is fixed, and the GCD is g, then the LCM is l. But how can we ensure that the GCD is exactly g?\n\nWait, suppose that for two nodes u and v connected by an edge, their product is C_uv = g * l. Then, their GCD is d. Then, the LCM is (a_u * a_v)/d = (g*l)/d. But according to the problem statement, the LCM should be l. Therefore, (g*l)/d = l → d = g. Therefore, the GCD of a_u and a_v must be g. Hence, solving the system of equations a_u * a_v = C_uv (C_uv = g*l) is necessary and sufficient for the problem. Because if the product is correct, then the GCD must be exactly g.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight! So, the problem reduces to solving the system of equations a_u * a_v = C_uv for each edge. Once that system is solved, the GCD will automatically be g, because of the above reasoning. Therefore, our problem becomes: find a set of values a_1, ..., a_n such that for every edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = C_uv. If such a set exists, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nThis simplifies the problem. Now, the problem is to find values a_i such that for every edge (u, v), a_u * a_v equals the product of the given GCD and LCM for that edge. And if that's possible, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each edge, check if LCM % GCD != 0. If so, output NO.\n\n   Because C_uv = GCD * LCM. But if LCM is not divisible by GCD, then C_uv would not be an integer? Wait, no. Wait, GCD and LCM are given as integers. But for any two numbers, LCM(a,b) is divisible by GCD(a,b). So if the problem says that the original map had numbers with GCD and LCM on the edges, then in reality, the LCM must be divisible by GCD. However, the problem statement says that the input may have invalid data. So, for example, if the input has an edge with GCD=2 and LCM=3, which is impossible, then the answer is NO.\n\n   So, first, for each edge, we check if LCM % GCD != 0. If yes, output NO.\n\n2. Else, for each edge, compute C_uv = GCD * LCM.\n\n3. Now, the problem is to find values a_i such that for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = C_uv.\n\nNow, how to solve this system of equations?\n\nThis is similar to a graph where each edge imposes a constraint that the product of two variables is a certain value. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a bipartition, but with multiplicative constraints. For example, in a tree, we can assign a value to a root node and then compute the values of other nodes based on the constraints.\n\nLet me think of building a graph and performing BFS or DFS to assign values.\n\nLet's assume that the graph is connected. For each connected component, we can assign the values independently.\n\nFor example, pick a root node and assign a value to it. Then, for each adjacent node, compute its value based on the edge's C_uv. However, the problem is that the value of the root node is arbitrary except for the constraints imposed by the edges. But how to choose it?\n\nWait, suppose we have a tree. Let's pick a root node and assign a value of 1. Then, for each child, the value is C_uv / a_root. But then, when we proceed further, the values are determined. However, this may not work if there are cycles, but in a tree, there are no cycles, so this assignment is possible. However, the problem is that the value of the root could be arbitrary, but we need to find at least one valid assignment.\n\nBut here's the catch: the product of the variables around a cycle must be consistent. For example, consider a cycle u-v-w-u. The equations are:\n\na_u * a_v = C1\n\na_v * a_w = C2\n\na_w * a_u = C3\n\nMultiply all three equations: (a_u a_v a_w)^2 = C1*C2*C3 → so C1*C2*C3 must be a perfect square. Otherwise, there is no solution.\n\nIf it is a perfect square, then we can assign a_u a_v a_w = sqrt(C1*C2*C3). But how to find individual values?\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Check if the product of C_uv along any cycle is a perfect square. If not, no solution.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive if done naively. However, perhaps during BFS/DFS traversal, we can track the product constraints and detect inconsistencies.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS/DFS, for each node, we can assign a value relative to the root. For example, assign a value to the root, then for each neighbor, assign their value as C_uv / a_root. Then, when we reach a node that has already been visited, we check if the existing value matches the new value derived from the current path.\n\nBut how to choose the root's value? Because if the root's value is arbitrary, then perhaps there are multiple possibilities. However, the root's value must be such that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but the root's value is arbitrary except for the constraints imposed by the edges. However, the product of the values along the edges must be compatible.\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose we have a cycle u-v-w-u. The equations are:\n\na_u * a_v = C1\n\na_v * a_w = C2\n\na_w * a_u = C3\n\nWe can assign a_u = x, then a_v = C1/x, a_w = C2/(a_v) = C2 * x / C1. Then, substituting into the third equation:\n\na_w * a_u = [C2 * x / C1 ] * x = C2 x² / C1 = C3 → x² = C3 * C1 / C2 → x = sqrt( C3 * C1 / C2 )\n\nSo, for x to exist, the expression under the square root must be a perfect square. Therefore, the product C1*C2*C3 must be a square, because:\n\nC1*C2*C3 = C1 * C2 * C3. From the above equation, x² = C1*C3 / C2 → x² * C2 = C1*C3 → x² * C2 * C2 = C1*C3*C2 → (x*C2)^2 = C1*C2*C3. Therefore, the product C1*C2*C3 must be a square.\n\nSo, the condition for consistency is that the product of C_uv along any cycle must be a square. If this is not the case, then there is no solution.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS, assigning values to nodes as follows:\n\n   - When visiting a node for the first time, assign a value (relative to the root's value).\n\n   - When encountering a node that has already been visited, check if the existing value is consistent with the current path's calculation.\n\nBut how to manage the relative values?\n\nLet me think of this as building a system where each node has a value that is the product of some factors. For example, for each node u, we can store a variable 'value[u]' such that for any edge (u, v), value[u] * value[v] = C_uv.\n\nTo assign these values, we can use a BFS approach:\n\nInitialize a dictionary or array to store the value of each node. Initially, all values are None.\n\nPick a starting node (say, node 0), and assign it a value. However, the problem is that the value can be any non-zero value, but we need to choose one that allows all constraints to be satisfied. However, since the product of values along a cycle must be a square, perhaps we can choose any initial value and then check for consistency.\n\nWait, but how to choose the initial value? For example, if the component is a single node with no edges, then any value is acceptable (but since there are no constraints, the value can be anything. However, the problem says that the original numbers were at least 1. So, for isolated nodes, we can assign them any value ≥1. But how to choose that in the code? Well, for the problem, we can assign 1 to isolated nodes.)\n\nBut for components with edges, the value of the root can be chosen arbitrarily, but during the BFS, the other nodes' values are determined based on the root's value. However, when we encounter a cycle, the root's value must satisfy certain conditions. Therefore, perhaps during the BFS, we can assign the root's value as 1, and then check if the constraints are satisfied. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nBut wait, how can the root's value affect the constraints? Let's think again. Suppose during BFS, we assign the root a value of 1, and then compute other nodes' values based on the edges. If during this process, we reach a node that was already visited, and the computed value does not match the stored value, then there's a contradiction. However, the root's value may be arbitrary. For example, in the cycle example, the root's value must be sqrt( ... ), which may not be an integer. Therefore, choosing an arbitrary value for the root may not work.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of choosing an arbitrary value for the root may not work, and instead, we need to find a value for the root that makes all constraints satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, we can model the problem with logarithms. Taking logs, the equations become log(a_u) + log(a_v) = log(C_uv). However, since we are dealing with integers, this approach may not be helpful.\n\nAnother idea: For each connected component, the variables can be represented as a product of some base value and a ratio. For example, for each node u, a_u = k * r_u, where k is a constant for the component. Then, for any edge (u, v), we have:\n\nk * r_u * k * r_v = C_uv → k² * r_u r_v = C_uv → r_u r_v = C_uv / k².\n\nBut this seems to complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, think of the variables as being in a group under multiplication. For each connected component, the variables are determined up to a multiplicative constant. For example, if we have a tree, the values are determined up to a constant. For example, if we assign a_u = x, then a_v = C_uv / x, a_w = C_vw / a_v = C_vw * x / C_uv, etc. So, the entire component's values are determined in terms of x. However, if there is a cycle, then x must satisfy a certain equation.\n\nSo, for a connected component, the values are determined up to a choice of x. However, for the values to be integers, x must be chosen such that all the values computed are integers.\n\nBut how to find such an x?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps the problem can be approached by first building the system of equations, and then finding x such that all the values are integers. However, this might not be feasible computationally.\n\nBut given that the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can find x as the square root of the product of C_uv along some cycle. However, this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's try to assign the values as follows:\n\nFor each connected component, perform a BFS, and for each node, store the ratio of its value to the root's value. Let's call this ratio 'r_u'. Then, for any edge (u, v), we have a_u * a_v = C_uv. Since a_u = r_u * a_root, and a_v = r_v * a_root, then:\n\n(r_u * a_root) * (r_v * a_root) = C_uv → r_u * r_v * a_root² = C_uv → a_root² = C_uv / (r_u * r_v)\n\nBut during BFS, we can assign r_u and r_v in such a way that for each edge (u, v), r_u * r_v = C_uv / a_root². However, since a_root is a variable, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each node, we can track the product of the C_uv along the path from the root to the node. For example, for a tree, the value of a node can be expressed as (product of C_uv along the path) divided by the product of the values of the previous nodes. This is getting too abstract.\n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Suppose we have a tree with nodes A connected to B connected to C. The edges are AB with C_AB = 6, BC with C_BC = 10.\n\nAssume A is the root. Assign a_A = x. Then, a_B = 6 / x. Then, a_C = 10 / a_B = 10x / 6 = 5x/3. Now, for a_C to be an integer, x must be a multiple of 3. So, choosing x = 3, we get a_C = 5. Then, a_B = 6/3 = 2. So the values are 3, 2, 5. These satisfy the constraints: 3*2=6, 2*5=10.\n\nBut what if there's a cycle? For example, a triangle A-B-C-A with edges AB:6, BC:10, CA:15. The product of C's is 6*10*15=900, which is 30². So, the square root is 30. So, the product of a_A*a_B*a_C must be 30. \n\nLet me try to assign values. Assume a_A = x. Then, a_B = 6/x. a_C = 10/a_B = 10x/6 = 5x/3. Then, from the third edge, a_C * a_A = 15 → (5x/3) * x = 15 → 5x²/3 = 15 → x² = 9 → x = 3 or -3. Since the numbers are positive, x=3. Then, a_A=3, a_B=2, a_C=5. Which satisfies all constraints: 3*2=6, 2*5=10, 5*3=15. So it works.\n\nSo, in this case, the value of x (the root's value) is determined by the constraints. Thus, for connected components with cycles, the value of the root is uniquely determined (up to sign, but since all values must be positive, only positive roots are considered).\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node and perform BFS/DFS.\n\n- During traversal, assign values to nodes based on the root's value.\n\n- When a cycle is encountered, derive an equation for the root's value and check if it's a perfect square.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe idea is to track for each node, the product of the C_uv along the path from the root to it. Let me explain.\n\nLet me define for each node u, a value 'prod[u]' which represents the product of the C_uv along the path from the root to u. Then, the value of a_u can be expressed as sqrt( (prod[u]) / (prod[prev_node] / C_prev) ) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, during BFS, we can keep track of the product of the C_uv along the path from the root to u. Let me think:\n\nIf the root is u0, and during traversal, we visit u0's neighbor v. The edge between u0 and v has C_uv. Then, for the value of u0 * value of v = C_uv. So, value of v = C_uv / value of u0.\n\nSimilarly, for a node w connected to v via an edge with C_vw, value of w = C_vw / value of v = C_vw * value of u0 / C_uv.\n\nSo, the value of w is (",
