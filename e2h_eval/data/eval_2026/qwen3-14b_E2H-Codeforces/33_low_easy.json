You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements. Oh right, and the replacements can be done in any order, but each replacement uses one element from s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. To maximize the number, I should replace the leftmost digits as high as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. For example, if I have a number like 1024 and s is 010, then the best is to replace the first 1 with 1 (no change?), wait no. Wait the s is '010', which is digits 0, 1, 0. So the example input is a=1024 and s=010. Then the output is 1124. Oh right, because they replaced the second digit (0) with 1. But why not use the 0? Because replacing the first digit (1) with 0 would make it worse. So the idea is to find for each position in a, whether there's a digit in s that is larger than the current digit, and replace it with the largest possible.\n\nBut how to do that optimally? Well, the strategy would be:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. Because we want to use the largest digits first.\n2. Then, iterate through each digit of a from left to right. For each digit, if there's a digit in s that's larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s, and remove that digit from s. Otherwise, skip.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently check for the largest possible digit in s that's larger than the current digit. Because if we sort s in descending order, then for each position, we can check if the first element in s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace and remove that element. Otherwise, move on.\n\nYes. Because once sorted, the largest digits are first. So for each position in a, we check if the largest available digit in s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace and take that digit. Else, leave it as is.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Convert the number a into a list of characters (digits), so we can modify them.\n- Sort the s digits in descending order.\n- Iterate over each digit in a:\n   - For the current digit, check if the first element in s is larger than current digit.\n   - If yes, replace the current digit with that s element, and remove the first element from s.\n   - Else, do nothing.\n- After processing all digits, combine the list into a string and output.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple digits in s that could be used? For example, if the current digit is 3, and s has 5,4,2. Then using 5 is better than 4, so we take the largest possible.\n\nSo by sorting s in descending order, we can greedily take the largest possible digit for each position.\n\nYes. So the algorithm seems correct.\n\nLet me test the example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\na is '1024', s is '010'.\n\ns sorted in descending order is ['1', '0', '0'].\n\nThen, process each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. The first element of s is '1', which is equal. So no replacement. So we leave it as is. Then, the next digit is '0'. The first element of s is '1', which is larger. So replace '0' with '1', and remove that '1' from s. Now s is ['0', '0']. Next digits are '2' and '4'. For '2', the first element of s is '0', which is smaller. So no replacement. For '4', same. So the final number is 1124. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is the second input: a is '987', s is '1234567'. So sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nCheck each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. The first element of s is 7, which is smaller. So no replacement. Next digit is '8', same as before. Then '7' which is equal to the first element of s (7). So replace? Well, since the current digit is 7 and the s's first element is 7. If we replace, it's same. But maybe we can use it. Wait, but replacing with same digit would not improve",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the value of a given integer `a` by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits `s`, ensuring that each digit in `s` is used at most once. The key insight is to replace digits from left to right, using the largest available digit in `s` whenever it provides an improvement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: First, sort the sequence `s` in descending order. This allows us to always consider the largest available digit first.\n2. **Greedy Replacement**: Iterate through each digit of the number `a` from left to right. For each digit, if the largest available digit in `s` is greater than the current digit, replace the current digit with that larger digit and remove it from `s`.\n3. **Construct Result**: After processing all digits, construct the resulting number from the modified digits.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number by making the most significant changes first, leveraging the greedy algorithm's efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    a = list(input[0])\n    s = list(input[1])\n    \n    # Sort s in descending order\n    s.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Iterate through each digit of a\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if s and s[0] > a[i]:\n            a[i] = s[0]\n            s.pop(0)\n    \n    print(''.join(a))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as two strings: one representing the number `a` and the other representing the sequence `s`.\n- **Sorting `s`**: Sorting `s` in descending order ensures that we can always access the largest available digit efficiently.\n- **Greedy Digit Replacement**: By iterating through each digit of `a` from left to right, we check if the largest available digit in `s` can improve the current digit. If so, we perform the replacement and remove that digit from `s`.\n- **Output**: Finally, the modified digits of `a` are joined into a string and printed, ensuring the result has no leading zeros as required.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input in linear time relative to the lengths of `a` and `s`, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
