    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to do this modulo some mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which is quite big. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Let's see. The total number of permutation pairs where p is lex smaller than q is (total permutations choose 2), since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. But here, we have to consider only those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For each permutation, we can compute its inversion count. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, we check if inv(p) > inv(q). The sum over all such pairs is our answer.\n\nBut for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big to iterate through. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo maybe we can find for each possible inversion count i, the number of permutations with that count, then compute the sum over all pairs (i, j) where i > j and there exists p and q with inv(p)=i, inv(q)=j, and p is lex smaller than q.\n\nBut even that seems challenging. Because for each i and j, how do we know how many (p, q) pairs exist where p is lex smaller than q, inv(p)=i, inv(q)=j?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q), and sum them up. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Since the problem requires considering p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps we can find the total number of such pairs by considering all possible pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and then subtract those pairs where inv(p) <= inv(q). Wait, but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, since for all unordered pairs {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p != q is 2 * (total_permutations choose 2). But we're only interested in the ones where p < q lex. So the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations -1 )) / 2. But again, how to compute the number of those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nWait, but for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of the following is true: p < q lex or q < p lex. So if we can compute the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then the answer would be the number of those pairs where p < q lex. But how?\n\nWait, suppose that for all unordered pairs {p, q}, inv(p) != inv(q). Then the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). But when inv(p) = inv(q), they contribute nothing. However, in reality, there can be pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [ (total_pairs) - same_inv_pairs ] / 2. Where total_pairs is (total_permutations choose 2), and same_inv_pairs is the number of pairs {p, q} where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut how does that help us? Because we need to find the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Which would be equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will have the property that the first is lex smaller than the second. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is lex ordered, then the total number of such ordered pairs is exactly half of the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), assuming that inv(p) != inv(q). Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 0.5? No, because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) holds. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the total number of such unordered pairs, because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So the number of such ordered pairs is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q} multiplied by 1/2. Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will satisfy p < q. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the desired set. But if inv(p) > inv(q), then the unordered pair contributes exactly one to the desired count (either (p, q) if p < q, or (q, p) if q < p, but in that case, inv(q) < inv(p), so (q, p) would not satisfy inv(q) > inv(p)). Wait, no. Let me rephrase.\n\nSuppose we have two permutations p and q. If inv(p) > inv(q), then in the unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q lex. So for the entire problem, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) satisfies p < q. But only one of them can be in the set where p < q. So the count is exactly the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q}.\n\nWait, but if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the unordered pair, either (p < q) and inv(p) > inv(q), or (q < p) and inv(q) < inv(p). So in the first case, it contributes to the count. In the second case, it's not. But the unordered pair is counted once in the total of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q}. So the number of such ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q} minus the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} and q < p. Which seems confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think of all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). For each such pair, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of such ordered pairs is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} multiplied by 1/2. No, that can't be. Because each unordered pair contributes exactly once to the total of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. So if you have an unordered pair {p, q}, then exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the ordered pairs where p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q} and p < q. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T = (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. Let's denote this as T. Now, among all these ordered pairs, some have inv(p) > inv(q), some have inv(p) < inv(q), and some have inv(p) = inv(q). Let's call the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) as A, and the number where inv(p) < inv(q) as B. Since for any pair (p, q) where p < q, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or equal. Then, A + B + C = T, where C is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So, for each such pair, if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the ordered pair (p, q) where p < q, it contributes to A if p < q, otherwise to B. Wait, no. Suppose inv(p) > inv(q). Then, if p < q, then (p, q) is counted in A. If q < p, then (q, p) is counted in B, since in that case, inv(q) < inv(p) (because inv(p) > inv(q)), but in the ordered pair (q, p), we have q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). So in this case, the pair {p, q} contributes to A if p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), or to B if q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Which is the same as saying that for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1. So the total A + B equals the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q). But since A and B are symmetric except for the inversion count, we can say that A = B + (number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) - inv(q) > inv(p))? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So in the ordered pairs, if p < q, then (p, q) contributes to A. If q < p, then (q, p) contributes to B (since in that case, inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p, which would mean inv(q) < inv(p) → inv(q) < inv(p) → the pair (q, p) has inv(q) < inv(p), which is B's count. So for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1. Similarly, for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1. So the total A + B is equal to the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) != inv(q). And since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of A or B is increased by 1, then A and B are equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q plus the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Wait, but how can we relate A and B?\n\nAlternatively, since for every unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. Let’s say that the number of such unordered pairs is X. Then, A (the number of ordered pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) is equal to the number of these X pairs where p < q. Similarly, B (the number of ordered pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)) is equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. But how?\n\nBut since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, then the number of such pairs where p < q is exactly X' = X. But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose X is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q). Then, for each of these X pairs, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of these X pairs where p < q. Similarly, the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) is equal to the number of X pairs where q < p. But since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X. Wait, no. Because for each of the X pairs {p, q}, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. But for that particular ordered pair, if it's (p, q) and p < q, then inv(p) > inv(q) → contributes to A. If it's (q, p) and q < p, then inv(q) < inv(p) → contributes to B. So for each of the X pairs {p, q}, exactly one of A or B is increased by 1. Therefore, A + B = X + Y, where Y is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q). But since X and Y are the same as the number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) and inv(p) < inv(q), respectively, and since X = Y (because for each unordered pair with inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding one with inv(q) > inv(p)), then X = Y. Therefore, A + B = X + Y = 2X. But since X = Y, then A + B = 2X. However, since for each of the X pairs, exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1, then A + B = X + Y = X + X = 2X. But since X is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), and Y is the same as the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) (which is the same as X), then A + B = 2X.\n\nBut then, how does that help us? Well, the answer we need is A, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). But since A and B are related by symmetry. Let me think: For all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. So the difference between A and B depends on the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, and the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), if p < q, then it contributes to A. If q < p, then it contributes to B. Similarly, for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), if p < q, it contributes to B (since inv(p) < inv(q)), and if q < p, it contributes to A. Wait, no. For example, if {p, q} has inv(p) < inv(q), and p < q, then the ordered pair (p, q) has inv(p) < inv(q), so it contributes to B. If q < p, then the ordered pair (q, p) has inv(q) > inv(p), and since q < p, this would contribute to A. So for each such unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented by 1. Therefore, the total A and B are both equal to the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, plus the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and q < p. Which seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find A. Let's consider that for all unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of A or B is incremented. But the total number of such pairs is T' = total_pairs - same_inv_pairs, where same_inv_pairs is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). Then, since A + B = T', and A - B = ?\n\nIf we could find that A - B = something, then we could solve for A.\n\nBut what is A - B? Let's think. For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), if p < q, it contributes +1 to A. If q < p, it contributes +1 to B. For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) < inv(q), if p < q, it contributes +1 to B. If q < p, it contributes +1 to A. So overall, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), the contribution to A - B is +1 if p < q, -1 if q < p. Similarly for the other case. But combining both cases:\n\nFor each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), the contribution to A - B is (if p < q, +1; else -1).\n\nFor each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q), the contribution to A - B is (if p < q, -1; else +1).\n\nBut since inv(p) < inv(q) is equivalent to inv(q) > inv(p), which is the same as the first case. So combining both, the contribution to A - B for all unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q) is:\n\nfor each such pair, if p < q, then if inv(p) > inv(q), +1, else -1. If q < p, then if inv(p) > inv(q), -1, else +1. Which seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, note that A - B = sum_{all ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q} [inv(p) > inv(q) ? 1 : -1]. \n\nBut how can we compute this sum?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for all ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q, the difference between the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and those where inv(p) < inv(q) is equal to A - B. But how to compute this?\n\nBut perhaps we can find that A - B = total_diff, where total_diff is the sum over all permutations p of (number of permutations q where q > p lex and inv(p) > inv(q)) minus the number of permutations q where q > p lex and inv(p) < inv(q)).\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it as follows: the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q is T. Among them, A is the number where inv(p) > inv(q), B is the number where inv(p) < inv(q), and C is the number where inv(p) = inv(q). Then, A + B + C = T. Also, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (A + B') / 2, where B' is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of the problem in terms of generating the inversion counts for all permutations and then using that data to compute the required answer.\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote that for each possible inversion count k, we have a count of permutations with that inversion count, say cnt[k]. Then, the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to sum_{i < j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]. Because for each i < j, each permutation with inversion count i and each permutation with inversion count j contributes to the total. But wait, no. Because if i < j, then inv(p) = i < j = inv(q), so the pair {p, q} contributes to the count of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). So the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]. Which is equal to (sum_{i} cnt[i]^2 - sum_{i} cnt[i]) / 2 + sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} ??? Not sure. Alternatively, the total number of unordered pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1)) / 2. The number of unordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is sum_{k} (cnt[k] * (cnt[k] - 1)) / 2. So the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q) is total_pairs - same_inv_pairs. And the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inv_pairs - same_inv_pairs) ) / 2 + ... no, wait. Because for all unordered pairs where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly half have inv(p) > inv(q), and the other half have inv(p) < inv(q). So the number of such pairs is (total_pairs - same_inv_pairs) / 2. Because for each unordered pair with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So the total number is (total_pairs - same_inv_pairs) / 2.\n\nSo the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is (total_pairs - same_inv_pairs) / 2. But earlier we thought that this number is X, and that the answer A (number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) is equal to X. But that can't be right, because X is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), and each of these contributes exactly one ordered pair (p, q) or (q, p) to the ordered pairs where p < q. So the answer A is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is not necessarily X, but depends on the relation between p and q.\n\nSo this line of thinking seems stuck. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of generating all possible inversion counts for permutations of size n. For each permutation p, compute its inversion count. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, check whether inv(p) > inv(q). The total of these is the answer.\n\nBut for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big to handle directly. So we need to find a way to calculate this without enumerating all permutations.\n\nSo perhaps we can find for each permutation p, the number of permutations q such that q > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p). Then, the answer is the sum over all p of this count.\n\nBut again, for n=500, it's impossible to iterate through all p.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the lex order and inversion count are independent properties, perhaps we can find for each possible inversion count i, the number of permutations with that count, and also find for each inversion count i, the number of permutations with inversion count j that are lex greater than a given permutation with inversion count i. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: For any two permutations p and q, if p is lex smaller than q, then the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of such pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). But how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can find for each possible inversion count i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j. Then, the answer is the sum over all i > j of this count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for all i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j. Then, sum over all i > j.\n\nThe question now becomes, how to compute this value for all i and j.\n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j.\n\nLet me think: For a fixed i and j, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q lex. Which is equal to (count_i * count_j - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p = q. But since p and q are different permutations, same_count is zero. So for i != j, the number of pairs where p < q is (count_i * count_j) / 2 if i and j are such that the pairs (p, q) and (q, p) are both considered. But this is only true if for all p with inv(p) = i and q with inv(q) = j, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Which is true for distinct permutations.\n\nBut this is only true if for any p with inv(p) = i and q with inv(q) = j, p and q are distinct. Which they are, since p and q are permutations. So for i != j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is (count_i * count_j) / 2. But wait, if i and j are different, then for each pair (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to (count_i * count_j) / 2 if i != j. But this is only if for all p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, the number of pairs where p < q is exactly half of count_i * count_j.\n\nBut is this true? Suppose i and j are arbitrary. For example, take i = j. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p and q have the same inversion count, the number of pairs where p < q is (count_i choose 2). But when i != j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j and p < q is (count_i * count_j) / 2. Because for each pair (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions, and p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is count_i * count_j. And since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two ordered pairs is counted in the p < q condition, the number of ordered pairs where p < q is (count_i * count_j) / 2.\n\nBut this is only true if for all permutations p with inv(p) = i and q with inv(q) = j, p and q are distinct. Which they are, since p and q are different permutations. So, for i != j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is (count_i * count_j) / 2.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight! If that's true, then the answer is simply sum over all i > j of (count_i * count_j) / 2. Because for each i > j, the pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q lex contribute to the answer. And since i > j, the number of such pairs is (count_i * count_j) / 2.\n\nBut why is this true? Because for any pair (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, and i != j, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of pairs where p < q is exactly half of count_i * count_j. And since i > j, we need to add this to the answer only when i > j. So the answer is sum_{i > j} (count_i * count_j) / 2.\n\nWait, but this would imply that the answer is (sum_{i > j} count_i * count_j) / 2. But sum_{i > j} count_i * count_j is equal to (total^2 - sum count_i^2) / 2. Because sum_{i != j} count_i * count_j = (sum count_i)^2 - sum count_i^2. And sum_{i > j} count_i * count_j = [ (sum count_i)^2 - sum count_i^2 ] / 2. So the answer would be [ (sum count_i)^2 - sum count_i^2 ] / 4. But wait, no. Because the sum_{i > j} count_i * count_j is equal to (sum count_i * sum count_j - sum count_i^2 ) / 2. And since sum count_i is total_permutations (which is n! ), then sum_{i > j} count_i * count_j = ( (n! )^2 - sum count_i^2 ) / 2. Then, the answer would be this divided by 2, since for each i > j, we take (count_i * count_j)/2. So the answer would be [ ( (n! )^2 - sum count_i^2 ) / 2 ] / 2 = (n! )^2 - sum count_i^2 ) / 4 ?\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=4, the answer is 17. Let's check this formula.\n\nFor n=4, the total number of permutations is 24. The sum count_i^2 would be sum over all possible inversion counts of (count_i)^2.\n\nLet me compute the inversion counts for permutations of size 4. The number of permutations of 4 elements with k inversions is known. For example, for n=4, the inversion counts are as follows:\n\nThe maximum number of inversions is 6 (for [4,3,2,1]).\n\nThe number of permutations for each inversion count:\n\nk=0: 1 (identity)\nk=1: 1 (only [1,2,3,4] with one inversion? No, no. Wait, the inversion count for [1,2,3,4] is zero. For k=1, there are 3 permutations: [1,2,4,3], [1,3,2,4], [2,1,3,4]. So count_1 is 3.\n\nBut I think for n=4, the inversion counts and their frequencies are:\n\nLet me look up the inversion numbers for n=4. Alternatively, I can compute them.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the fact that the number of permutations of n elements with k inversions is given by the Mahonian numbers. For n=4, the Mahonian numbers are:\n\nk | count\n0 | 1\n1 | 3\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 5\n5 | 3\n6 | 1\n\nSo sum count_i^2 is 1^2 + 3^2 +5^2 +6^2 +5^2 +3^2 +1^2 = 1 +9 +25 +36 +25 +9 +1 = 106.\n\nThen, (n! )^2 is 24^2 = 576.\n\nSo according to the formula, the answer would be (576 - 106)/4 = 470 /4 = 117.5. Which is not possible, as the sample output is 17. Clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo there must be a mistake in the assumption that the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is (count_i * count_j)/2 for all i != j. This can't be correct. So where is the error?\n\nAh! The mistake is that the assumption that for any i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j, and p < q is (count_i * count_j)/2 is not valid. Because for some i and j, there may be more pairs where p < q than others. For example, if i is larger than j, but the number of permutations with i inversions that are lex smaller than permutations with j inversions may not be uniform.\n\nThis suggests that the previous reasoning is wrong. So back to square one.\n\nLet's think again. How can we compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nLet me think about generating all possible pairs of permutations and counting them. But for n=500, that's impossible. So perhaps we need to find a way to compute for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p. Then, the answer is the sum of this over all p.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this seems impossible unless we find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother observation: For a given permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p is (total_permutations - 1 - rank_p), where rank_p is the number of permutations lex smaller than p. But how does this help?\n\nBut how to relate this to the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p)?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires knowing, for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p). But again, for large n, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's precompute for all possible inversion counts, the number of permutations with that count, and also the number of permutations with that count that are lex smaller than permutations with other counts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the lex order and the inversion count. For example, the identity permutation has zero inversions and is lex smallest. The reverse permutation has maximum inversions and is lex largest. But in general, there's",
