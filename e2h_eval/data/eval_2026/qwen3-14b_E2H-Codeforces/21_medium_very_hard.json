The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because even chests can be paired with odd keys, and odd chests can be paired with even keys. So, let me break it down:\n\nLet's say:\n- even_chests = number of a_i that are even\n- odd_chests = n - even_chests\n- even_keys = number of b_j that are even\n- odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\nThen, the answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each even chest, we can use an odd key. But if there are more even chests than odd keys, then the maximum possible is the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other part.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the plan. Now, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, for the input, we can read n and m, then the list a, then the list b.\n\nFor counting even and odd in a:\n\neven_chests = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chests = n - even_chests\n\nSimilarly for the keys:\n\neven_keys = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_keys = m - even_keys\n\nThen the answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nWait, but what about the case where there are more keys than needed? Like, if there are 5 even chests and 3 odd keys. Then, the min is 3. So that's correct.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nLet me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → let's see:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests is 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20 → 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys is 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys is 1 (7).\n\nSo min(3, 1) → 1. Then min(2, 3) → 2. Total 3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1, a is 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_chests is 5, odd_chests 0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other term is min(0, even_keys which is 0). So total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: 1 chest with 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 → all even. So even_keys is 4. So for even_chests (1) and odd_keys (0) → min(1,0)=0. For odd_chests (0) and even_keys (4) → min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, code-wise, the problem is straightforward. We need to process the input, count the even and odd numbers in a and b.\n\nBut wait, for very large n and m (like 1e5), but in Python, using list comprehensions and sum is efficient enough. Because even for 1e5 elements, it's O(n) time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the a list as integers.\n\nThen read the b list as integers.\n\nCompute even_chests = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chests = n - even_chests\n\neven_keys = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_keys = m - even_keys\n\nresult = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → even_chests is 3 (14,6,2). odd_chests is 2.\n\nb: 8,4,7,20 → even_keys is 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys is 1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. Sum 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is 2,4,6,8,10 → even_chests=5. odd_chests=0. b is [5], even_keys=0, odd_keys=1. min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. a is [10] even. b is [20,30,40,50] even. even_keys=4. odd_keys=0. min(1,0)=0. min(0,4)=0. Total 0.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge cases: What if there are zero even chests or zero odd keys?\n\nLike, if all chests are even and all keys are even. Then the answer is zero.\n\nAnother case: chests have some even and some odd, but keys are all even. Then, the even chests can't be paired (since keys are even, and even + even is even). But the odd chests can be paired with even keys. So min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are more keys than needed. Like, even_chests is 2, odd_keys is 5. So min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n\nRead input from stdin. The input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first line is n and m, then the second line is a's numbers, third line is b's numbers.\n\nIn Python, we can read them as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute even_chests and even_keys.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nOnce we have those counts, compute the result as explained.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCompute even_chests = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\neven_keys = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_keys = m - even_keys\n\nodd_chests = n - even_chests\n\nans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code. Let's test with the examples.\n\nThe sample inputs are given as:\n\nFirst input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20 → which gives 3 as output.\n\nSecond input:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5 → output 1.\n\nThird input:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50 → output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, code-wise, that's straightforward. Let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for very large numbers, but since the code is O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for 1e5 elements.\n\nYes. So the code is efficient.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nRead the input lines, compute the counts, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest +=1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key +=1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps the for loop is better, but in Python, sum( ... ) is efficient.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps:\n\neven_chest = sum( x % 2 == 0 for x in a )\n\nWait, because x%2 ==0 returns True (1) or False (0), so sum adds 1 for each True.\n\nYes. So that's even shorter.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nprint( min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key) )\n\nWait, but in Python, for very large input, using list comprehensions may be more efficient than for loops. But for code brevity, the sum with generator expressions is better.\n\nBut in code submission, perhaps it's better to use the sum approach.\n\nBut in code, the code would be:\n\nBut for the code to be efficient, even for 1e5 elements, it's okay.\n\nSo the code is as above. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where a chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This requires analyzing the parity (even or odd) of the numbers on the chests and keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Parity Condition**: A chest with an even number can be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. Thus, we need to count how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Values**: For both the chests and keys, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Optimal Pairing**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: Using generator expressions, we count how many numbers are even in both the chests and keys. The counts of odd values are derived by subtracting the even counts from the total number of chests or keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: The result is calculated by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and adding it to the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures optimal pairing based on the parity condition.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, ensuring optimal use of available resources with a time complexity of O(n + m), which is efficient for large inputs up to 100,000 elements.",
