On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem is, given a sequence of 1s and 2s, choose any interval [l, r], reverse that part, and then find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new sequence.\n\nFirst, let me think about the original LNDS. For example, if the original array is already non-decreasing, then reversing any subarray would not help. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut since we can reverse any subarray, how can that help us? Well, reversing a subarray can potentially fix some parts of the array. For instance, if there's a dip in the sequence, reversing a part that contains that dip might make it better.\n\nBut considering that the elements are only 1 and 2, maybe there's a clever way to compute the best possible scenario.\n\nLet me think about the optimal scenario. The maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1, or something like that. Wait, no. For example, in an array like [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2), but after reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the key is to find a reversal that maximizes the number of 1s followed by 2s, possibly merging some parts.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAn approach could be to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each, and take the maximum. However, with n up to 2000, that would be O(n^2) possibilities. For each of these, computing LNDS would take O(n) time. So overall O(n^3) time. For n=2000, that's 8e10 operations, which is way too slow. That's not feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. Or maybe the maximum number of 1s and 2s arranged in non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, the LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are not before any 1. Wait, no. Actually, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Or maybe the maximum possible is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but only if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it depends on how many 2s come before 1s.\n\nAlternatively, for any array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such inversion (a 2 followed by a 1) is a place where the sequence breaks. But that's probably not directly helpful.\n\nBut since we can reverse any subarray, perhaps the optimal way is to find a way to merge as many 1s as possible followed by 2s. Let me think about the structure of the array.\n\nSuppose the original array has some 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements in a non-decreasing sequence. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are not preceded by any 1s. Wait, no. Let's think of the array as a sequence of 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in a way that all 1s come before 2s. So, for example, if there are x 1s and y 2s, the maximum possible is x + y (if the array is non-decreasing). If the array is [1,2,1,2], then the maximum is 3 (like 1,2,2), but if you reverse [2,3], you get [1,1,2,2], which is 4.\n\nSo the idea is that by reversing a subarray, we can possibly merge",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s. The goal is to reverse any subarray such that the resulting sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence.\n2. **Key Insight**: Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the optimal LNDS can be achieved by maximizing the number of 1s followed by 2s. Reversing a subarray can help merge segments of 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing order.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the number of 1s up to each position and the number of 2s from each position onwards. This helps in efficiently calculating the maximum possible LNDS after reversing any subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix counts of 2s\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i + 1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    \n    # Consider all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Reverse a[l..r]\n            # Compute the number of 1s before l, 2s after r, and the number of 1s in [l..r] and 2s in [l..r]\n            # The new sequence will have:\n            # all 1s before l, then the reversed segment, then all 2s after r\n            # but the reversed segment could be 1s followed by 2s\n            # So the total is:\n            # prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in reversed segment) + (number of 2s in reversed segment) + suffix_twos[r + 1]\n            # Wait, no.

These arrays help in quickly determining the counts of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray `[l, r]`, we consider reversing it. By reversing, we can potentially merge segments of 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing order.\n3. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: For each subarray reversal, we calculate the potential LNDS by combining the counts of 1s before `l`, the counts of 1s and 2s in the reversed subarray, and the counts of 2s after `r`.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently compute the maximum possible LNDS after any subarray reversal, leveraging precomputed counts for quick calculations.",
