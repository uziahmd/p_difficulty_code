String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: we can modify the string through certain operations, and the final character g must be obtainable from the string via these modifications.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what conditions the original string must satisfy so that after some modifications, the resulting string ends up with exactly one character g. Let's break down the modification process.\n\nThe modification operation is replacing the last two characters with one character. The replacement rule is: if the two are both 0s, replace with 1; else, replace with 0. For example, if you have \"00\", it becomes \"1\"; \"01\" becomes \"0\", etc. Each modification reduces the length of the string by one. So, starting with a string of length L (which is n + m), after k modifications, the length becomes L - k. The process stops when the length is 1, because you can't modify further. Wait, but the problem says that the string can be modified any number of times (possibly zero) as long as each operation is applied on a string of length at least two. So, the end result is a single character. So, for the string s to be beautiful, after applying some number of modifications (possibly zero), the final character must be equal to g.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string s is beautiful if we can obtain character g from it with some number of modifications. So, the original string s must be such that after performing some sequence of modifications (until it's reduced to one character), that character is g. So the problem is to count all possible strings with exactly n zeros and m ones that can be reduced to g through this process.\n\nSo, the key is to find for each possible string (with n zeros and m ones) whether it can be reduced to g. Then, sum the count of such strings.\n\nBut how do we determine whether a given string can be reduced to g? Let's think about the process of reduction. Each modification reduces the length by 1. So, starting with length l = n + m, we need to perform exactly (l - 1) operations to get down to 1 character. Because each operation reduces the length by 1, and the initial length is l. So, regardless of the path, the final character depends on the entire sequence of operations. However, perhaps the final character depends only on the initial string's structure, not on the order of operations. Wait, maybe there's some invariant here. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the string is \"00\". One modification gives \"1\". If the string is \"01\", modifying gives \"0\". What if the string is longer? Let's take \"000\". How would the modifications proceed? Let's see:\n\nOption 1: first modify the last two 0s to 1. The string becomes \"01\". Then modify again to get 0. So the final result is 0.\n\nOption 2: Is there another way? Well, the initial string is \"000\". The first modification can only be done on the last two characters. So, no alternative. So the result is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"010\". Let's see:\n\nModify last two characters (1 and 0) → replace with 0. So the string becomes \"00\". Then modify again to get 1. So the final result is 1.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other way? No, since the order of operations is forced once the string is being modified. Because each step reduces the last two characters. So the order of operations is fixed. Wait, no. Wait, the modification operation is replacing the two last characters. So, each time, the operation is applied to the last two characters. Therefore, the order of operations is fixed. For example, for a string of length l, the first operation replaces the last two, resulting in a string of length l-1, then again the last two, etc. So the final result is uniquely determined by the initial string. Thus, for any string, the final character after all possible modifications is uniquely determined. Therefore, the problem reduces to: count the number of strings with exactly n zeros and m ones, such that their final character after all possible reductions is equal to g.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to: find the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s, such that the result of reducing them as per the modification rules is g.\n\nNow, the key is to find what the final character depends on. Let's think recursively. Let's model the process of reduction. Let's consider the function f(s) which returns the final character after all reductions.\n\nFor a string of length 1, f(s) is just the character itself.\n\nFor a string of length ≥2, f(s) is f(s'), where s' is the string after replacing the last two characters with the appropriate value. So, for example, if the last two characters are '00', they become '1'; otherwise, they become '0'.\n\nBut this seems like a recursive process. However, for a string of length l, the final result depends on the entire string. But perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of 1s or 0s, or something similar. Let's think about the operation as a binary operation. Each time we combine the last two characters into one. Let's think about the value of the entire string as a function that can be computed recursively.\n\nLet me think of the process as building a binary tree. Each operation combines two elements into one. But perhaps the final result depends on the number of 1s and 0s, but with some weight based on the number of operations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as equivalent to evaluating a certain expression. For example, combining the last two characters as follows: if they are both 0, then 1; else 0. This is similar to a logical XOR, but not exactly. Let me check:\n\nIf the two bits are 0 and 0 → 1. Which is 0 XOR 0 = 0, but here it's 1. So not XOR. What about AND? 0 AND 0 is 0. Not matching. What about OR? 0 OR 0 is 0. Also not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the operation as the negation of the AND. For two bits a and b, the result is 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0. Which is equivalent to (a & b) == 0. So, the result is 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0. So, the operation is equivalent to (a & b) ^ 1? Wait:\n\nFor a=0, b=0: 0&0=0, ^1 gives 1. Correct.\n\nFor a=0, b=1: 0&1=0, ^1 gives 1. But according to the operation, replacing two characters with 0 if they are not both 0. So in this case, the result is 0. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that when you replace two characters, the new character is 1 if they are both 0, else 0. So for a=0, b=1, the result is 0. But (a & b) ^ 1 would be (0) ^1 = 1, which is not the same. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operation can be represented as (a + b) mod 2? Let's see:\n\nFor 0 and 0: sum is 0, mod 2 is 0. But the result is 1. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think of the entire process as a function of the count of 0s and 1s. But since the order of operations matters, but in our case, the order is fixed (always combining the last two), perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s or 0s, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as equivalent to the following: the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me try some examples. Take the first sample input: n=1, m=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nLet's process \"01\". The length is 2. Apply one operation. The last two are 0 and 1. They are not both 0, so replace with 0. So the result is 0. Which matches the first sample's g=0. So this string is counted. Similarly for \"10\", same result. Hence the answer is 2.\n\nIn the third sample, input is 1 1 1. The two possible strings reduce to 0, so the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: let's take the string \"00\". The result is 1. So for n=2, m=0, and g=1, the answer would be 1.\n\nWhat about \"000\"? Let's process it:\n\nOriginal string is \"000\". First, combine last two 0s into 1. Now the string is \"01\". Then combine those two into 0. Final result is 0.\n\nSo for n=3, m=0, the result is 0. So, for this case, if g is 0, the count is 1.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the number of 0s. For a string consisting of all 0s, what's the result?\n\nLet's see for k 0s:\n\nk=1 → 0.\n\nk=2 → 1.\n\nk=3 → combine last two into 1, then combine with the first 0: 0 and 1 → replace with 0. So result is 0.\n\nk=4: combine last two into 1, then the string is 001. Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now the string is 00. Combine into 1. So result is 1.\n\nSo for k 0s, the result alternates between 0 and 1 based on the parity of k. Wait:\n\nk=1 → 0 → parity 1: odd → 0.\n\nk=2 → 1 → even → 1.\n\nk=3 → 0 → odd → 0.\n\nk=4 → 1 → even → 1.\n\nYes! So for a string of all 0s, the final result is 1 if the number of 0s is even, and 0 if odd. Interesting.\n\nSimilarly, what about a string of all 1s? Let's see:\n\nk=1 → 1.\n\nk=2: combine two 1s. Since they are not both 0, replace with 0. So result is 0.\n\nk=3: combine last two 1s into 0. Now the string is 10. Combine into 0. So result is 0.\n\nk=4: combine two 1s into 0. Now string is 110 → combine last two (1 and 0) into 0 → string is 10 → combine into 0. So result is 0.\n\nSo for any k ≥ 2, the result is 0. Only when k=1, it's 1.\n\nSo, for strings with all 1s, the result is 1 if the count is 1, else 0.\n\nHmm. So the result seems to depend on the number of 0s and 1s, but how?\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a function that can be modeled with some kind of parity or count. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string s. The final result is determined by combining the last two characters, then proceeding with the resulting string.\n\nLet me think about the final result as a function of the number of 0s and 1s, but perhaps with some parity conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the string. Or maybe the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nBut looking at the first example: \"01\" has one 0 and one 1. The result is 0. The number of 0s is 1 (odd), and the number of 1s is 1 (odd). So maybe not.\n\nAnother example: \"00\" has two 0s. The result is 1. The number of 0s is even. The number of 1s is 0, even.\n\nAnother example: \"000\" (three 0s) gives 0. The number of 0s is odd.\n\nSo for all 0s, the result is 1 if the count is even, 0 if odd. So it's the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nBut what about when there are 1s?\n\nTake \"010\" (n=2, m=1). Let's process it:\n\nOriginal string is 0 1 0. Length 3. First, combine last two (1 and 0) → 0. Now the string is 0 0. Combine into 1. So final result is 1.\n\nThe number of 0s is 2 (even), but the result is 1. So this seems to fit the previous pattern. But wait, the total number of 0s is even. So according to the previous idea, the result would be 1. Which is correct here.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\" (from the second sample input). Let's process it:\n\nOriginal string is 0 0 1 1. Let's process step by step.\n\nFirst, combine last two (1 and 1) → replace with 0. Now the string is 0 0 0. Then combine last two 0s → 1. Now the string is 0 1. Combine into 0. So final result is 0. Which matches the sample where g is 0, so this string is counted. But according to the earlier idea, the number of 0s is 2 (original n=2), which is even. So the result would be 1? But in reality, the result here is 0. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm. So the earlier hypothesis was incorrect. So what's going on here?\n\nLet me re-calculate the processing for \"0011\".\n\nOriginal string: 0,0,1,1. Length 4.\n\nStep 1: combine last two (1 and 1) → replace with 0. New string: 0,0,0. Length 3.\n\nStep 2: combine last two (0 and 0) → replace with 1. New string: 0,1. Length 2.\n\nStep 3: combine (0 and 1) → replace with 0. Final result 0.\n\nSo the result is 0. The number of 0s in the original string was 2 (even), but the result is 0. So the earlier idea that the result depends on the parity of the number of 0s is not correct.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct way to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the entire process as a binary operation that can be represented as a function of the number of 0s and 1s, but perhaps considering the parity of the number of operations or something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a binary tree, where each node represents a combination of two characters. The root of the tree is the final result. But how to model this for arbitrary strings.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the entire process as a series of operations that effectively compute a certain value based on the count of 0s and 1s. Let me think about the process as equivalent to computing the XOR of the counts of 0s and 1s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the operation as follows: each time two characters are replaced by a new one. Let's think of the value of the entire string as a function that can be calculated recursively. Let's denote the value of a string s as V(s).\n\nIf s has length 1: V(s) is the character itself (0 or 1).\n\nElse: V(s) = V(s'), where s' is the string obtained by replacing the last two characters with the result of their operation.\n\nSo, for example, if the last two characters are a and b:\n\nif a == '0' and b == '0', then new character is '1'.\n\nelse, new character is '0'.\n\nSo, the value of the entire string depends on the value of the string after combining the last two characters. Let's try to find a recurrence relation for V(s).\n\nBut how to model this for arbitrary strings. Perhaps we can find that the final value depends on the number of 0s and 1s in the string, but with some parity conditions.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the number of 0s and 1s. Let's denote the total number of 0s as z and 1s as o. The total length is l = z + o.\n\nBut how does combining two characters affect the counts? Let's think about combining two characters:\n\nCase 1: the two are both 0s. Then they are replaced by a 1. So the number of 0s decreases by 2, and the number of 1s increases by 1.\n\nCase 2: the two are not both 0s. Then they are replaced by a 0. So the number of 0s decreases by 1 (since one of the two is 0 or both are 1s?), wait no. Let's think:\n\nOriginal two characters can be:\n\n- 0 and 0 → replaced by 1 → 0s decrease by 2, 1s increase by 1.\n\n- 0 and 1 → replaced by 0 → 0s decrease by 1 (since one 0 and one 1 are removed, and a 0 is added. So net change: 0s: (original count) -1 (removed one 0) +1 (added one 0) → no change. 1s: (original count) -1 (removed one 1).\n\n- 1 and 1 → replaced by 0 → 0s increase by 1, 1s decrease by 2.\n\nSo, the operation affects the counts depending on the two characters being combined.\n\nBut since the operation is always applied to the last two characters, the order of combining depends on the string. However, the final result may depend on the entire sequence of operations. But this seems complicated to model.\n\nAlternative idea: think of the entire process as a binary operation that is associative? Probably not. But perhaps the final result can be determined by some property of the initial string.\n\nLet me think of the process as a series of operations that ultimately reduce the entire string to a single bit. Let me think of this as a function that can be represented as a certain formula based on the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nAnother observation: each operation reduces the number of characters by one. So, after l-1 operations, we get a single character. Let's think of the entire process as a series of operations that can be represented as a binary tree. Each operation is a node combining two children. The root is the final value.\n\nBut how to model this for arbitrary strings. It's unclear.\n\nAlternative approach: think recursively. Let's suppose that for a string with z zeros and o ones, the final value is determined by some function f(z, o). Let's try to find a recurrence for f(z, o).\n\nBut how to find this recurrence. Let's think about the first operation: combining the last two characters. However, the last two characters could be any combination, depending on the string. But since the problem is about counting all possible strings with given z and o, perhaps we need to find for each possible (z, o) what the final value would be, regardless of the arrangement of the characters.\n\nWait, but the arrangement of the characters affects the result. For example, the string \"0011\" and \"0101\" might have different results. However, the problem requires us to count all strings with exactly z zeros and o ones that, when reduced, give g. So, for a given z and o, how many of the possible permutations of these zeros and ones will reduce to g?\n\nBut this seems very complex. However, perhaps there's a way to find for a given z and o, what is the possible final value, regardless of the arrangement. For example, perhaps the final value depends only on z and o, and not on the order of the characters. If that's the case, then the problem becomes manageable.\n\nBut is that true? Let's test with examples.\n\nTake two different strings with the same z and o:\n\nExample 1: z=2, o=2. Let's take \"0011\" and \"0101\".\n\nFor \"0011\": as before, the result is 0.\n\nFor \"0101\":\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nOriginal string: 0,1,0,1.\n\nStep 1: combine last two (0 and 1) → replace with 0. String becomes 0,1,0.\n\nStep 2: combine last two (1 and 0) → replace with 0. String becomes 0,0.\n\nStep 3: combine to 1. Final result is 1.\n\nSo, different results for same z and o. Hence, the final result depends on the arrangement of the characters, not just the counts. Thus, the function f(z, o) is not sufficient. Therefore, the problem is more complex.\n\nThis implies that the number of valid strings depends on the number of ways to arrange the 0s and 1s such that their reduction leads to g. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternative idea: think of the reduction process as a binary operation that can be modeled using a certain property, like the parity of the number of 1s or something else. Let's think again about the example where z=2 and o=2, and the result can be either 0 or 1, depending on the string.\n\nSo, for some arrangements, the result is 0, others 1. Hence, we need to find for given z and o, how many permutations of the characters lead to a final result of g.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the process of reduction. Each operation reduces the length by one. The final result depends on the order in which the operations are performed. However, in our case, the operations are always applied to the last two characters. So the order of operations is fixed once the string is given. So, the final result depends on the entire sequence of characters and how the operations are applied step by step.\n\nThis seems very hard to model directly for arbitrary strings. However, perhaps there's a way to find a recurrence relation based on the number of zeros and ones.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a string with z zeros and o ones. Let's consider the last two characters. Depending on what they are, the operation will replace them with a new character, and then the problem reduces to a smaller string. However, since the order of the characters matters, this approach would require knowing the exact arrangement of the characters, which is not feasible for large z and o.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, where dp[z][o] represents the number of ways to arrange z zeros and o ones such that the final result is 0, and similarly for dp'[z][o] for final result 1. Then, the answer for given n, m, g would be dp[n][m] if g is 0, or dp'[n][m] if g is 1.\n\nBut how to compute dp[z][o] and dp'[z][o]?\n\nLet's think about how to build dp[z][o]. For a string with z zeros and o ones, the final result depends on the last two characters. Let's think of the possible cases for the last two characters:\n\nCase 1: both are 0s. Then, they are replaced by 1. The new string has z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. The final result for the new string is determined by dp'[z-2][o+1] (if we want the final result to be 0) or dp[z-2][o+1] (if we want the final result to be 1)? Wait, no. The replacement of the last two 0s with a 1 creates a new string with z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. However, the rest of the string (the first part) is arbitrary. But the problem is that the replacement changes the entire string, and the new string's final result depends on its own arrangement. However, the way to model this is by considering that the number of ways to have a final result of 0 for the original string is equal to the number of ways to arrange the string such that, after replacing the last two 0s with 1, the resulting string has a final result of 0. But how to compute that?\n\nThis seems tricky, but perhaps we can model it with the following recurrence:\n\ndp[z][o] = number of strings with z zeros and o ones that reduce to 0.\n\nSimilarly for dp1[z][o] = number of strings that reduce to 1.\n\nThe base cases are:\n\n- if z + o == 1: then dp[z][o] is 1 if the character is 0, else 0. Similarly for dp1.\n\nFor general cases, when z + o >= 2:\n\nWe need to consider all possible ways the last two characters can be arranged, and compute accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that the last two characters can be any pair, and for each possibility, we have to calculate how many strings have that pair and then multiply by the number of ways the remaining part can be arranged to produce the desired result.\n\nLet me think. For a string of length l = z + o >= 2, the last two characters can be:\n\n- 0 and 0: number of such possibilities is C(z, 2) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the remaining z-2 zeros and o ones, and then the replacement of these two zeros with a 1, leading to a new string with z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. However, the remaining part of the string (before the last two characters) can be any arrangement of (z-2) zeros and o ones. But since the last two are fixed as 0 and 0, the total number of such strings is (number of ways to arrange (z-2) zeros and o ones) * (number of ways to choose the last two as zeros).\n\nWait, but the total number of ways to have the last two characters be 0 and 0 is (number of ways to choose the first (l-2) characters as (z-2) zeros and o ones, and the last two as 0 and 0). But the first (l-2) characters can be any arrangement of (z-2) zeros and o ones, and the last two are fixed as zeros. However, the number of ways to choose the last two as zeros is (number of ways to select positions for the zeros and ones such that the last two are zeros). This is equivalent to choosing (z-2) zeros in the first (l-2) positions, and the last two are zeros. The number of such arrangements is C((z-2 + o), (z-2)) ) * 1 (since the last two are fixed as zeros). However, this is only possible if z >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other cases.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps we can model this with the following approach:\n\nThe number of strings with z zeros and o ones that reduce to 0 is equal to the sum over all possible ways the last two characters can be combined, multiplied by the corresponding contribution from the new state.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor dp[z][o], the number of strings that reduce to 0, we can consider the possible cases for the last two characters:\n\nCase 1: last two are 0 and 0. Then, after replacement, they become 1. So, the new string has z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. The final result of this new string must be 0. So, the number of such strings is (number of ways to have the last two be 0 and 0) * dp'[z-2][o+1], where dp'[...] is the number of ways for the new string to reduce to 0. Wait, no. Wait, the replacement creates a new string with z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. The final result of this new string is determined by its own reduction. So, the number of ways for the original string to reduce to 0 is equal to the number of ways to arrange the original string such that after combining the last two 0s into a 1, the resulting string reduces to 0. So, for this case, it's the number of original strings that have last two 0s multiplied by the number of ways the new string reduces to 0. However, the new string's reduction depends on its own arrangement. But the new string has z-2 zeros and o+1 ones, and the number of ways it reduces to 0 is dp[z-2][o+1].\n\nWait, no. The new string is formed by replacing the last two 0s with a 1. The new string's arrangement is the first (l-2) characters (which were arranged as (z-2) zeros and o ones) followed by the new character (1). But how does this affect the new string's arrangement? The new string has (z-2) zeros and (o+1) ones. However, the way the first (l-2) characters are arranged may vary, but the new character is added at the end. However, the way the reduction proceeds depends on the entire arrangement of the new string. So, for the original string, the number of ways to have the last two be 0s and then the new string reduce to 0 is equal to the number of ways to choose the first (l-2) characters (which can be any arrangement of (z-2) zeros and o ones) multiplied by the number of ways the new string (with (z-2) zeros and o+1 ones) reduces to 0. However, the new string is not just the first (l-2) characters plus the new 1 — but the entire arrangement of the new string is the first part plus the new character. But since the first part is arbitrary, and the new character is added at the end, the number of such new strings is the same as the number of ways to arrange (z-2) zeros and (o+1) ones, which is C((z-2 + o + 1), (z-2))? No, that's not correct. The new string has (z-2) zeros and (o + 1) ones. The number of such arrangements is C((z-2 + o + 1), (z-2)) ). However, the original string's count for this case is the number of ways to arrange the original string with last two 0s multiplied by the number of ways the new string reduces to 0. But how?\n\nThis seems too vague. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as follows: for a given string, the final result depends on the entire sequence of operations. However, when we combine the last two characters, the rest of the string remains the same. So, the number of ways to have the original string reduce to 0 is equal to the sum over all possible ways the last two characters can be combined, multiplied by the number of ways the resulting string reduces to 0.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a string of z zeros and o ones, the number of ways it reduces to 0 is:\n\ndp[z][o] = (number of ways to have last two as 00) * dp'[z-2][o+1] + (number of ways to have last two as 01 or 10) * dp'[z-1][o] + (number of ways to have last two as 11) * dp'[z+1][o-2]\n\nWait, no. Because when combining the last two, the resulting character is either 1 (for 00) or 0 (for others) or 0 (for 11). Wait, the replacement for two 1s is 0. So, for the last two being 11, the replacement is 0. So, the new string would have z+1 zeros (because replacing two 1s with a 0 adds one zero) and o-2 ones. Wait, no. Original string has z zeros and o ones. Last two are 1s. Replacing them with a 0: the new string has z + 1 zeros (since we added one 0) and o - 2 ones (since we removed two 1s). So yes.\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways to have the last two characters be certain combinations.\n\nLet me think of the number of ways to have the last two characters be 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nBut the total number of ways to arrange the string is C(z + o, z).\n\nThe number of ways to have the last two characters be 00 is equal to the number of ways to choose the first (z + o - 2) characters to contain (z - 2) zeros and o ones, and the last two are zeros. That is, if z >= 2, then the number is C( (z-2 + o), z-2 ), which is equal to C(z + o - 2, z - 2).\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to have the last two characters be 11 is C(z + o - 2, z) if o >= 2.\n\nThe number of ways to have the last two characters be 01 or 10 is equal to the total number of ways to have the last two characters be 0 and 1 in any order, which is 2 * [number of ways to have the first (z + o - 2) characters contain (z - 1) zeros and (o - 1) ones]. Because the last two characters are 0 and 1, which can be in two orders. So the count is 2 * C( (z + o - 2), z - 1 ), provided that z >= 1 and o >= 1.\n\nSo putting this together, the recurrence relations for dp[z][o] and dp1[z][o] (where dp[z][o] is the number of strings with z zeros and o ones that reduce to 0) would be:\n\nIf z + o == 1:\n   dp[z][o] = 1 if the character is 0, else 0.\n   dp1[z][o] = 1 if the character is 1, else 0.\n\nElse:\n   dp[z][o] = (ways_00 * dp1[z-2][o+1]) + (ways_01_10 * dp[z-1][o]) + (ways_11 * dp[z+1][o-2])\n\nWait, no. Because when the last two are 00, they are replaced with a 1. So the new string has z-2 zeros and o+1 ones. The final result of this new string must be 0. So the contribution to dp[z][o] is the number of ways to have the last two be 00 multiplied by the number of ways the new string reduces to 0 (which is dp[z-2][o+1]? Or dp1? Wait, no. The new string has z-2 zeros and o+1 ones, and we want its final result to be 0. So the number of ways for the new string to reduce to 0 is dp[z-2][o+1]. But the new string is formed by replacing the last two 0s with a 1. However, the rest of the string is arbitrary. So the number of ways for the original string to contribute to dp[z][o] is the number of ways to have the last two be 00 multiplied by the number of ways the new string reduces to 0.\n\nSimilarly, if the last two are 01 or 10, they are replaced with 0. The new string has z-1 zeros and o ones (because replacing a 0 and a 1 with a 0: zeros count is (original zeros) - 1 (since one 0 was removed) + 1 (added 0) → same as original. Ones count is original o - 1 (one 1 removed)). So the new string has z-1 + 0 (wait, original zeros is z, and the two last characters are 0 and 1. So removing one 0 and one 1, adding a 0. So zeros count is z -1 + 1 = z. Ones count is o - 1. So the new string has z zeros and o-1 ones. So the contribution is ways_01_10 multiplied by dp[z][o-1] (since the new string has z zeros and o-1 ones, and we want it to reduce to 0).\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal string has z zeros and o ones. Last two are 0 and 1 (in any order). Replacing them with a 0. So the new string has:\n\nNumber of zeros: original zeros minus 1 (for the 0 removed) plus 1 (the new 0 added) → z - 1 + 1 = z.\n\nNumber of ones: original o minus 1 (the 1 removed) → o - 1.\n\nSo the new string has z zeros and o-1 ones. So the contribution to dp[z][",
