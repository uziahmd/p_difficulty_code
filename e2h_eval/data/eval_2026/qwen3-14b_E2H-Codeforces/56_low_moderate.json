Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning R Rebel spaceships to B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. But there's an additional constraint: any two straight paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship) must not intersect in the 2D plane. Also, it's given that no two points coincide and no three points are colinear. So, the task is to determine if such a perfect matching exists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what conditions make two line segments not intersect. Since all the points are in general position (no three colinear), any two line segments between different pairs of points will either cross each other or not. But how do I check that for all possible pairs in a matching?\n\nWait, but the problem says that any two paths (from base to spaceship) must not intersect. So, for a given perfect matching, all the line segments between matched pairs must be non-intersecting.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists a perfect matching between the R spaceships and B bases such that all the edges (segments) in the matching are non-crossing.\n\nBut since R and B can be up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings is manageable. For example, when R=B=10, the number of possible perfect matchings is 10! = 3,628,800. But even for R=B=10, that's around 3.6 million possibilities. For each of these possibilities, I need to check if all the line segments between the matched pairs don't cross each other.\n\nBut wait, how do I check if two line segments cross each other? Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, the line segments are between (spaceship, base) pairs. For each pair of edges (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), I need to check if they cross each other. How to do that?\n\nI remember that two line segments AB and CD intersect if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and similarly for C, D, A and C, D, B. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about overlapping lines or colinear points.\n\nAlternatively, there's a standard computational geometry approach to check if two line segments intersect. Let me recall the steps.\n\nFirst, check if the bounding boxes of the two segments overlap. If not, they can't intersect. Then, check the orientation of the four points.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute whether two line segments AB and CD intersect. The standard approach is to use the orientation method. Let me think about the code for that.\n\nThe orientation function returns 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, then for any two segments, if they intersect, they must do so at a point that's not on any of the endpoints. Wait, but in our case, the endpoints are all distinct. So, the line segments can't share an endpoint (since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa). Therefore, the segments can't share endpoints. So, any intersection between two segments would be a proper crossing (not at endpoints).\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD, they cross if:\n\n- The orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D, and\n- The orientation of C, D, A is different from the orientation of C, D, B.\n\nThis is the standard way to check for intersection between two line segments.\n\nSo, for each possible perfect matching, I need to check all pairs of edges in the matching and ensure that none of them cross each other.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Wait, but R and B must be equal for a perfect matching. Oh right, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which implies that R must equal B. Wait, looking back at the input description:\n\nThe first line has R and B. So, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. But the input constraints allow R and B to be up to 10. However, if R != B, then there's no perfect matching. But according to the problem statement, the input may have R != B, but in that case, the answer is automatically No. Because a perfect matching requires that R = B. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So yes, that requires R = B. Therefore, in the code, the first check should be whether R != B, in which case output",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two line segments connecting matched pairs intersect. The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings and verifying the non-intersecting condition for each.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, ensure that the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B).
