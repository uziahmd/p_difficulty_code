The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to calculate the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to find all possible subsets of towns (with towers built) that allow such a configuration. Then, since each subset has probability (1/2)^n, the total probability would be (number of valid subsets) * (1/2)^n.\n\nThe main challenge is figuring out how many valid subsets there are.\n\nLet me think about the conditions for a subset of towers to be valid. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower must cover it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nLet me consider what the coverage implies. For a tower at position i with power p, it covers cities from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, the problem says |c - i| < p. So that's equivalent to c being in (i - p + 1, i + p - 1)? Wait, no. Let's see: |c - i| < p → c is in (i - p, i + p). But since c is an integer, it's the interval [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. Because for example, if p=2, then |c - i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, i+1. So the range is from i - p + 1 to i + p -1, inclusive. So the length is 2p - 1.\n\nBut the key is that when we set the signal powers, each town must be covered exactly once. Also, the towers can't cover town 0 or n+1. So for any tower, its coverage can't reach beyond the ends. For example, a tower at position i can't have a power p such that i - p + 1 ≤ 0. Because that would mean town 0 is covered. Similarly, i + p - 1 ≥ n+1 would mean town n+1 is covered. So for any tower at position i, the maximum possible p is such that i - p + 1 > 0 and i + p - 1 < n+1. Wait, but maybe the tower can have a p that covers up to i + p -1 = n, but not n+1. So for town 0 to not be covered, the tower's coverage must not include 0. So for a tower at i, the minimal p is 1, but if p is 1, then it covers i-0 to i+0? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nIf p is 1, then |c - i| < 1 → c must be i. So the tower at i with p=1 covers only itself. So for that case, town 0 is not covered. Similarly, if a tower is at position 1, then if p is 2, then |c - 1| < 2 → c can be 0, 1, 2. But that would include town 0. Which is not allowed. Therefore, any tower at position i must have p such that i - p + 1 > 0 → p < i. And also, i + p - 1 < n+1 → p < n+1 - i. So the maximum p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 -i). But since the p can be any integer between 1 and that maximum. However, when choosing p, we have to make sure that the coverage doesn't reach the ends.\n\nBut how do we model the valid configurations of towers?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as tiling the line from 1 to n with intervals such that each interval is covered exactly once, and the intervals are determined by the towers. Each tower's coverage is an interval centered at its position, and the intervals must not overlap except on the edges (but each town is covered exactly once). Wait, but the coverage can overlap, but each town must be covered exactly once. That suggests that the coverage intervals must form a partition of the towns 1..n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid tower configurations must form a structure where each tower's coverage is non-overlapping with others except possibly at the edges. But how?\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input where n=2, the valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can have power 1, covering themselves. So town 1 is covered by tower 1, town 2 by tower 2. That works. Another",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a valid configuration of signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Coverage Constraints**: Each tower at position `i` can have a signal power `p` such that it covers towns from `i - p + 1` to `i + p - 1`. For towns 0 and n+1 to be uncovered, the maximum possible signal power for a tower at position `i` is constrained by its distance from the ends (i.e., `min(i, n + 1 - i)`).\n\n2. **Valid Tower Configurations**: A valid configuration of towers must allow for a partitioning of towns 1 to n into non-overlapping intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. This can be modeled using dynamic programming where we track the number of valid configurations up to each position.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation is derived based on whether a tower is placed at position `i` or not:\n   - If a tower is placed at `i`, it can cover up to `i` (with power 1), so `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.\n   - If a tower is placed at `i-1`, it can cover up to `i` (with power 2), so `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo `998244353`, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n    \n    result = dp[n]\n    inv = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = (result * inv) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The base cases are initialized as `dp[0] = 1` (no towns to cover) and `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to cover one town).\n- **Recurrence Relation**: For each position `i`, the number of valid configurations is the sum of configurations where a tower is placed at `i` (extending from `dp[i-1]`) and configurations where a tower is placed at `i-1` (extending from `dp[i-2]`).\n- **Modular Inverse**: The final result is adjusted by multiplying with the modular inverse of `2^n` to convert the count of valid configurations into the required probability under modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, adhering to the constraints and providing the correct result within the required time complexity.",
