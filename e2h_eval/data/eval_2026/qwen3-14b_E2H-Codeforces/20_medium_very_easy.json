For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem seems a bit complex at first glance, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. The maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of valid c_s configurations that achieve this.\n\nWait, but how do the c_s values influence the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset? Let's think about it.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be determined by the constraints imposed by all the c_s. For example, each string in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, the problem is similar to building a trie where each node (binary string) has a capacity c_s, and the total number of strings in the multiset can't exceed the minimum capacities along their paths.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths. For instance, if you have a string of length n, then all its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) must have their c_s values >= the number of times they are used as a prefix in the multiset.\n\nThis feels like a problem related to the inclusion-exclusion principle or some kind of tree structure with constraints. But perhaps there's a way to model this as a tree and find the maximum possible number of elements in the multiset given the c_s's.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. So, if we imagine the multiset as a collection of n-length strings, then for each such string, all its prefixes (from length 1 to n) have their counts increased by one. Therefore, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of strings we can select such that all these constraints are satisfied. Our goal is to count the number of c_s configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum for given c_s's?\n\nLet me think of it as a flow problem. Each node (prefix) has a capacity, and the total number of strings is constrained by the capacities of all the prefixes they pass through. However, since each string contributes to all its prefixes, the problem resembles a hierarchical constraint system.\n\nAn important observation here is that the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root (the empty string?) to the leaves (the full n-length strings). Wait, but the root isn't considered here. Let me think again.\n\nEach string of length n has exactly n prefixes: length 1, 2, ..., n. For example, the string '010' (n=3) has prefixes '0', '01', '010'. The constraints are that for each of these prefixes, the number of strings in the multiset that have them as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nSo, the problem of finding the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is equivalent to finding the maximum number of n-length strings such that for every prefix s of any string in the multiset, the count of strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis seems similar to a problem where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and each string is a path from the root to a leaf (the n-length string). The maximum number of such paths is constrained by the capacities of the nodes along the path. \n\nIn such a scenario, the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum capacity along the path multiplied by the number of paths that can be routed through that node. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string, and each node has two children (appending a 0 or 1). The leaves are the strings of length n. Each node has a capacity c_s. The problem is to select as many leaves as possible such that for each node, the number of selected leaves that pass through it (i.e., have it as a prefix) is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where we need to find the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under the capacity constraints of each node. How can we compute this maximum?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, the maximum number of strings is the sum over all nodes of the minimum capacity of their path, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum value of (c_s) for all prefixes of the same string. Wait, but each string contributes 1 to all its prefixes. So, for a given set of c_s's, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all possible constraints. \n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a trie structure. For each node, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each child node can only take up to the capacity of their parent. So, perhaps the maximum possible number of strings is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the path from the root to each leaf. But since each leaf's path is unique, the total number of strings would be the sum over all leaves of the minimum capacity along their path, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, no. Because if you have a node with capacity c, then the number of strings passing through it cannot exceed c. But each string passes through multiple nodes. So, the problem is similar to a flow network where each node has a capacity, and the flow is the number of strings passing through it. However, since each string passes through all nodes on its path, the constraints are that for each node, the sum of flows through it (i.e., the number of strings passing through it) is ≤ c_s. But the flow is the same for all nodes along a single path.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to choosing a set of leaves (strings of length n) such that for each node, the number of selected leaves that have it as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum possible size of such a set is what we want to compute for given c_s's.\n\nNow, how can we find this maximum? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths from the root to leaves, with each node having a capacity. This is known as the \"edge capacity\" problem, but here the capacity is per node. \n\nIn this case, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. But how?\n\nLet me think of the trie as a tree. Each node can have a capacity. For each node, the number of paths passing through it is equal to the number of paths in its subtree. But the capacity of the node limits how many paths can pass through it. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach. For example, we can process the nodes in order of increasing depth (i.e., from the root down to the leaves). For each node, we can determine how many paths can pass through it, which is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, but that might not be directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, for each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is limited by its capacity. But since each path that goes through this node must also go through its children. So, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to the leaf. However, since there are multiple paths, perhaps the maximum number of paths is the sum over all nodes of the capacities, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each node, the number of paths that pass through it is the sum of the number of paths in its left and right subtrees. However, this number cannot exceed the capacity of the node. So, the maximum number of paths that can be selected is determined by the capacities of the nodes. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths that can be selected such that for each node, the number of paths going through it is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis is a classic problem. The solution is to perform a post-order traversal of the trie, and for each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, but perhaps the correct way is that for each node, the maximum number of paths that can be routed through it is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model this as follows. For each node, the number of paths that can pass through it is limited by its capacity. However, each path that goes through this node must go through one of its children. So, the maximum number of paths that can pass through this node is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum number of paths that can pass through each of its children. \n\nBut how does this work? Let's take an example. Suppose a node has capacity 3. Its left child can have 2 paths, and the right child can have 2 paths. Then, the sum of the children's capacities is 4. But the node's capacity is 3, so the maximum number of paths through this node is 3. So, the node can pass through 3 paths, which would mean that the left and right children can contribute up to 3 paths. But how?\n\nThis seems like a standard problem. The maximum number of paths that can be routed through the tree is determined by the capacities of the nodes. For each node, the number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum of its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. However, this approach may not account for the hierarchy properly.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each node, the number of paths that can be routed through it is the minimum of its capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Because, if the sum of the children's capacities is less than the node's capacity, then the node can't have more than that. Otherwise, the node can have as much as its capacity allows. \n\nSo, for the entire tree, the maximum number of paths is the value computed at the root node. \n\nIf this is correct, then the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is equal to the value computed by this method. \n\nLet me test this idea with the example given in the problem statement. \n\nIn the example where n=2, the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} is considered. The c_s values are given. Let's compute the maximum possible size. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the maximum possible size is 4. However, in the example given, the multiset has 4 elements. But according to the sample input where n=1, k=42, f=2, the output is 3. \n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think again. \n\nAssuming that for a given set of c_s's, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the following recursive formula:\n\nFor each node (binary string s), let m(s) be the maximum number of strings that can be selected in the subtree rooted at s. Then:\n\nm(s) = min( c_s, 2 * m(s0) + 2 * m(s1) ? No, wait. For a node s of length l, its children are s0 and s1 (length l+1). The number of paths that can go through s is the sum of the paths that can go through its children. But since each path that goes through s must go through exactly one of its children. \n\nWait, for example, if s is a node of length l, then the maximum number of paths that can pass through s is the sum of the maximum paths through its children. However, this sum cannot exceed c_s. So:\n\nm(s) = min( c_s, m(left_child) + m(right_child) )\n\nBut wait, for the leaves (nodes of length n), their children are none. So, for a leaf node, the maximum number of paths through it is 1 (since it's the end of the path). But wait, no. For a leaf node (length n), the maximum number of paths through it is 1, because each path is exactly the leaf itself. So, the m(s) for a leaf node is 1. However, the capacity c_s must be ≥ the number of paths through it. So, if the capacity is zero, then no paths can be selected through this node, hence the maximum for this node is zero.\n\nWait, but how does this fit into the formula. Let me think recursively. \n\nFor a leaf node (depth n), the maximum number of paths that can be selected through it is 1 if c_s ≥ 1, else 0. But according to the formula above, m(s) = min(c_s, m(left_child) + m(right_child)). But since it's a leaf, it has no children. So perhaps the base case is that for a leaf node, m(s) = min(c_s, 1), since the maximum number of paths through it is 1 (the path that ends at this node), but constrained by c_s. \n\nBut for non-leaf nodes, their m(s) is min(c_s, m(left) + m(right)), where left and right are the children (s followed by 0 and 1, respectively). \n\nSo, for the entire tree, the root node (empty string) would have m(root) as the maximum number of paths. \n\nLet me test this with the first example from the note. \n\nIn the first example, n=1. So, the root (empty string) has two children: '0' and '1' (both leaves). \n\nSuppose for the case where c_0 = 0 and c_1 = 2. Then, for the leaves '0' and '1':\n\nm('0') = min(0, 1) = 0. Because the leaf can't have any paths through it. For '1', m('1') = min(2, 1) = 1. \n\nThen, the root node's m is min(c_root, m('0') + m('1')). But wait, what is c_root? Oh, the problem says that the c_s's are for all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So, the root is not considered here. Wait, the problem says that the strings s are of length from 1 to n. So, the root (empty string) is not part of the c_s's. Therefore, the root's capacity is not considered. Wait, but the root's prefixes would be the empty string, but the problem says that the constraints are for all s with length from 1 to n. \n\nSo, perhaps the root isn't considered here. Therefore, for the root node (which is not part of the c_s's), but when considering the maximum number of paths, the root's capacity is unbounded. So, the formula would be:\n\nFor the root node (empty string), which has two children, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the m of the children, since there's no capacity constraint on the root. Wait, but the root's capacity isn't part of the c_s's. Therefore, the root's capacity is effectively infinity. \n\nBut how does that fit into our formula? \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is that for each node s (of length l), the m(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of m of its children. However, for nodes of length 0 (the empty string), c_s is not considered, so the m(s) is just the sum of the children's m. \n\nBut the problem states that the constraints are for all s of length from 1 to n. Therefore, the empty string is not part of the c_s's. So, the root node's capacity is not bounded. Therefore, for the root node, m(root) = m(left) + m(right). \n\nSo, in the first example where n=1, the root node's m is m('0') + m('1'). \n\nFor the case where c_0=0 and c_1=2, m('0') is min(0, 1) = 0. m('1') is min(2, 1) = 1. So root's m is 0 + 1 = 1. But the maximum size of the multiset is 1, but the example says that when c_0=0 and c_1=2, the maximum is 2 (the multiset {1, 1} has size 2). Wait, that contradicts. So something's wrong here. \n\nWait, in the first example in the note: for n=1, k=42, f=2. The three valid cases include c_0=0 and c_1=2. The maximum beautiful multiset size is 2. According to our formula, the m(root) would be m('0') + m('1') = 0 + 1 = 1. But the actual maximum is 2. \n\nThis indicates that our formula is incorrect. So, perhaps our understanding is wrong. \n\nLet me re-examine the example. \n\nIn the first example, the multiset {1, 1} has two elements. Each of these elements has '1' as their prefix. The constraints are that for s of length 1 (which are '0' and '1'), the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. \n\nFor '0', the count is 0 (since none of the strings in the multiset start with '0'). For '1', the count is 2, which must be ≤ c_1. In this case, c_1 is 2, which satisfies the condition. \n\nSo, the maximum size is 2. However, according to our previous formula, the m('1') is min(c_1, 1) = 1. Then the root's m is 0 + 1 = 1, which contradicts the actual maximum of 2. \n\nThis suggests that our formula is incorrect. So, what's wrong with our reasoning?\n\nAh, perhaps the formula should be different. For a node s of length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n), the m(s) is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the m of its children. But for the leaves (l = n), their children are nonexistent. So, for leaves, the m(s) is 1 (if c_s ≥ 1) or 0 otherwise. But in the case of the leaf '1' with c_s=2, m(s) is 1. However, the actual number of paths that can pass through '1' is 1 (since each path is exactly '1'). But the count of the number of times '1' is a prefix is 2 (since there are two elements in the multiset). Wait, this is the crux of the problem. \n\nThe formula we were considering computes the maximum number of paths (strings in the multiset) that can be selected such that for each node s, the number of paths passing through s is ≤ c_s. But in the example, the count for '1' is 2, which is allowed because c_1 is 2. However, according to our formula, m('1') is 1, but the actual number of paths passing through '1' is 2. \n\nSo clearly, our formula is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that our initial approach is wrong. What's the correct way to model this?\n\nLet me think again. For a given node s (a prefix of length l), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at s. For example, if s is '1', then all strings in the multiset that start with '1' will have '1' as a prefix. So, the count is the number of such strings. \n\nTherefore, for the node s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree of s. Thus, for the entire multiset, the count for s is the number of strings in the subtree of s. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of leaves (strings of length n) such that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. \n\nThe maximum possible number of leaves that can be selected is the maximum possible such that this condition holds for all nodes. \n\nSo, how do we compute this maximum? \n\nThis is similar to the problem of selecting as many leaves as possible, subject to constraints that for each node, the number of selected leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a tree with constraints on the number of selected leaves in each subtree. \n\nThe way to maximize the number of leaves is to ensure that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is as large as possible, but not exceeding c_s. \n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the tree. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum numbers of leaves in the left and right subtrees. \n\nWait, but this seems like the same formula as before. But why did it fail in the earlier example?\n\nLet me re-calculate that example. \n\nIn the example where n=1, the tree has the root (empty string) with two children: '0' and '1', which are leaves. \n\nFor the leaves, the maximum number of leaves in their subtree is 1 (since they are leaves themselves). However, the constraint for the node '1' is c_1 = 2. So, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_1, ...). But since it's a leaf, its subtree contains only itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1. However, in the example, we can select two leaves of '1', which would violate the constraint for node '1' because the count would be 2, which is larger than c_1 = 2? No, wait, the count is exactly 2, which is allowed. \n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the count must not exceed c_s. So if c_s is 2, then selecting two leaves in the subtree of '1' is allowed. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. For a leaf node s (say, '1'), the number of leaves in its subtree is exactly the number of leaves selected that are equal to s. Since the subtree of s is just the node itself, the count is 1 if we select that leaf once, 2 if we select it twice. But the constraint for s is that this count must be ≤ c_s. \n\nSo, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is c_s. However, since the subtree of s can contain at most one leaf (itself), the maximum number of leaves in the subtree is min(c_s, 1). \n\nBut in the example, when c_1 is 2, this min is 1. But in reality, we can select two leaves of '1', which would have count 2 for the node '1'. \n\nThis contradiction shows that the model is incorrect. \n\nWait, this suggests that the model is not considering that the same leaf can be counted multiple times in the multiset. Oh! Wait, the multiset is a multiset. That is, the same string can appear multiple times. \n\nOh! Oh right! The problem says that the multiset is a multiset of binary strings of length exactly n. So, the same string can be included multiple times. \n\nAh, that changes everything. \n\nSo, for example, the multiset {1, 1} has two strings. Both have '1' as their prefix. So the count for '1' is 2. \n\nThus, the problem is not about selecting a subset of leaves (each appearing once), but about selecting a multiset of leaves, possibly with repetitions, such that for every node s, the number of times a string in the multiset has s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis is a completely different problem. \n\nSo, the previous approach of considering the number of leaves in the subtree was incorrect because it assumed that each leaf is selected once. Now, the problem allows multiple selections of the same leaf. \n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the maximum number of strings (possibly repeated) in the multiset, such that for every node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis is equivalent to the following: for each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. \n\nBut since the same string can be chosen multiple times, the problem is to find the maximum total number of strings (counted with multiplicity) that can be selected under these constraints. \n\nThis is now a problem of maximizing the total number of strings, given that for each node s, the number of strings in its subtree is ≤ c_s. \n\nHow to model this?\n\nLet me think of it as a tree where each node has a capacity c_s, and the total number of strings in the subtree of s is the sum of the counts of all strings in the multiset that are in the subtree of s. \n\nEach string is a path from the root to a leaf. The count for the multiset is the number of times each leaf is selected. \n\nThe constraints are that for each node s, the sum of the counts of all leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. \n\nThe goal is to maximize the total sum of counts (the size of the multiset).\n\nThis is a classic problem of maximizing the sum of variables (counts of leaves) under constraints that for each node s, the sum of variables in its subtree is ≤ c_s. \n\nHow can we find the maximum total sum?\n\nLet me think of this as a linear programming problem. However, since all variables are non-negative integers, but we need the maximum sum. \n\nBut since the problem is to find the maximum possible sum, it's equivalent to finding for each node s, the minimum between the sum of capacities of its children and its own capacity. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach. For each node, the maximum number of strings that can be in its subtree is limited by its capacity. However, the capacity of the parent node is also a constraint. \n\nFor example, consider a node s with two children, left and right. The maximum number of strings in the subtree of s is min( c_s, max_left + max_right ), where max_left is the maximum number of strings in the left subtree, and similarly for max_right. \n\nBut what's the maximum number of strings in the left subtree? Well, it's the capacity of the left node, because each string in the left subtree is also in the subtree of s. \n\nWait, no. For the left child of s, say l, the maximum number of strings in its subtree is limited by c_l. However, those strings are also in the subtree of s. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the subtree of s is the sum of the maximum number of strings in the left and right subtrees, but this sum must be ≤ c_s. \n\nSo, the maximum number of strings in the subtree of s is min( c_s, max_left + max_right ), where max_left is the maximum number of strings in the left subtree, and similarly for max_right. \n\nFor leaves, the maximum number of strings in their subtree is c_s. Because the subtree of a leaf is just itself. So, you can choose as many copies of that leaf as possible, but limited by c_s. \n\nSo, for a leaf node, the maximum number of strings in its subtree is c_s. \n\nFor non-leaf nodes, it's min( c_s, max_left + max_right ). \n\nThis makes sense. Let's test this with the earlier example. \n\nExample where n=1, c_0=0, c_1=2. \n\nThe root is not part of the c_s's, so its capacity is effectively infinity. The root has two children: '0' and '1', which are leaves. \n\nFor the leaf '0', the maximum number of strings in its subtree is c_0 = 0. \n\nFor the leaf '1', the maximum is c_1 = 2. \n\nThen, the root's maximum is min( infinity, 0 + 2 ) = 2. Which matches the example. \n\nYes! So this formula seems to work. \n\nAnother example: the first example in the problem's note. \n\nLet me think about it. \n\nSo, the maximum number of strings is computed as follows: \n\nFor each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, compute the maximum number of strings in the subtree. \n\nFor leaves, it's their c_s. For internal nodes, it's the min between their c_s and the sum of the maxima of their children. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nSo, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by this calculation. \n\nNow, the problem requires us to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (for each binary string s of length 1 to n) such that this maximum value equals exactly f. \n\nBut how do we compute this? \n\nThe approach is to find all possible assignments of c_s (each c_s can be between 0 and k, inclusive) such that the maximum value computed as described is exactly f. \n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, the number of binary strings s of length 1 to n is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable for certain approaches. \n\nBut for each assignment of c_s, we need to compute the maximum size. However, with n up to 15 and k up to 2e5, this seems computationally challenging. \n\nBut the problem requires counting the number of assignments where the maximum is exactly f. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nFor each possible assignment of c_s values (each c_s ∈ [0, k]), compute the value of the maximum size (call it M). We need to count the number of assignments where M = f. \n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently. \n\nBut with n up to 15, the total number of nodes is up to 2^16 - 2 ≈ 65k. However, even for that, enumerating all possible assignments is impossible because each node has k+1 choices, which is way too big. \n\nThus, we need a smarter approach. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. The maximum value M is determined by the c_s values, and the way they propagate up the tree. \n\nLet's denote that for each node, the value of the maximum number of strings in its subtree is m(s). As discussed earlier, for leaves, m(s) = c_s. For internal nodes, m(s) = min( c_s, m(left) + m(right) ). \n\nThe overall maximum size is m(root), where root is the empty string (but since it's not part of the c_s, its m is the sum of its children's m, but since the root's capacity is unlimited, m(root) = m(left) + m(right). \n\nWait, for the root node (which is not part of the c_s), the formula for m(root) is the sum of the m of its children. Because the root's capacity is not constrained. \n\nSo, the overall M is the value computed for the root node. \n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s (for all s of length 1..n) such that M equals exactly f. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the value m(s) depends on its c_s and the m values of its children. \n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem, but the dependencies are complex. \n\nHowever, since the tree is a binary tree of depth n, we can model this with dynamic programming. \n\nBut perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of the constraints that each node's m(s) must be such that m(s) = min( c_s, m(left) + m(right) ). \n\nBut since the m(s) for internal nodes depends on their children, we need to find for each node s, the possible values of m(s), and how they relate to the c_s and their children's m values. \n\nBut given that the problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s that result in M = f, perhaps we can model this with DP for each node, tracking the possible m(s) values and the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's values. \n\nThis seems feasible for small n. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a hierarchy. For a node of depth d (where depth is the length of the string), its children are of depth d+1. The leaves are at depth n. \n\nFor each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's parameters such that the m(s) for this node is a certain value. \n\nLet's define for a node s at depth d, the function dp[s][v] = number of ways to assign c_s and the children's parameters such that m(s) = v. \n\nFor the leaves (d = n), since m(s) = c_s. So, the possible values of v for a leaf are 0 ≤ v ≤ k. And the number of ways for a leaf to have m(s) = v is 1 if v ≤ k (since c_s can be set to v), but wait, no. Because for a leaf, m(s) = c_s. So, for a leaf, the number of ways to have m(s) = v is 1 if v is between 0 and k. Because c_s can be exactly v. \n\nWait, yes. For a leaf node, the value of m(s) is exactly c_s. So, the number of ways to have m(s) = v is 1 (choose c_s = v) if 0 ≤ v ≤ k. \n\nFor internal nodes (d < n), the value of m(s) is min( c_s, m_left + m_right ), where m_left and m_right are the m values of the children. \n\nSo, for an internal node, the value of m(s) can be anything between 0 and the minimum between c_s and (m_left + m_right). But since c_s can be chosen freely between 0 and k, we need to consider all possibilities. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nFor an internal node s, given that the left child has m_left and the right child has m_right, the possible m(s) is min( c_s, m_left + m_right ). \n\nBut since c_s can be any value between 0 and k, we can choose c_s such that m(s) is either m_left + m_right (if c_s ≥ m_left + m_right) or any value up to c_s (but since we are taking min, m(s) will be c_s if c_s ≤ m_left + m_right). \n\nBut for the purpose of counting the number of ways, we can think of the following: for a given pair of m_left and m_right, the value of m(s) can be any value up to min( m_left + m_right, k ), or any value between 0 and k. \n\nWait, no. For a given m_left and m_right, the sum is S = m_left + m_right. Then, m(s) = min( c_s, S ). So, to get m(s) = v, there are two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: v ≤ S. Then, we can choose c_s ≥ v. However, if we choose c_s ≥ v, then m(s) = v only if v ≤ S and c_s ≥ v. But also, if c_s is greater than S, then m(s) is S. So, this case is not directly applicable. \n\nWait, no. If m_left and m_right are fixed, then the sum S = m_left + m_right. For the internal node, the value of m(s) is min( c_s, S ). So, the possible values of m(s) can be:\n\n- Any value between 0 and min(S, k), if we choose c_s to be exactly that value. Or, if we choose c_s ≥ S, then m(s) is S. \n\nThus, for a given pair of m_left and m_right (sum S), the possible m(s) can be any value v where v ≤ min(S, k), and also S if S ≤ k. \n\nBut how to count the number of ways for a given internal node to have m(s) = v. \n\nLet me think. \n\nFor a given internal node, given that the left child has m_left and the right has m_right, then S = m_left + m_right. \n\nThe value of m(s) is min(c_s, S). \n\nWe want to count the number of ways to choose c_s (between 0 and k) such that min(c_s, S) = v. \n\nLet's see:\n\nmin(c_s, S) = v implies that:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s ≥ v and S ≥ v and (if c_s < S then min(c_s, S) = c_s = v → c_s =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string prefix such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) on a binary tree structure where each node represents a binary string prefix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Treat each binary string as a node in a binary tree. Each node at depth `d` has two children representing appending '0' and '1'.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to compute the number of valid configurations for each node. For leaves (strings of length `n`), the value is directly determined by their `c_s`. For internal nodes, the value is derived from their children's DP values.\n3. **Constraints Propagation**: For each node, calculate the number of valid configurations considering the constraints from its children and the given `k` limit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    f = int(data[2])\n    \n    # We need to build the tree structure and compute the number of ways\n    # using memoization with DP for each node\n    \n    # The number of nodes is sum_{i=1}^n 2^i = 2^(n+1) - 2\n    # But since n can be up to 15, we can represent each node by its depth and position\n    \n    # However, for memoization, we need to process the tree in a bottom-up way\n    # So we can precompute for all depths from n down to 1\n    \n    # For each depth d, we can have 2^d nodes\n    # For each node, we can represent it by its depth and an identifier (like index)\n    # But since the tree is full, we can process it recursively\n    \n    # Let's use memoization with depth and the possible values of m_left and m_right\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(depth, left_val, right_val):\n        # depth is the current depth (from 1 to n)\n        # For leaves (depth == n), m(s) is c_s, which can be any value between 0 and k\n        # But here, left_val and right_val are not used for leaves\n        if depth == n:\n            # For a leaf node, the number of ways to have m(s) = v is 1 if 0 <= v <= k\n            # But here, we are considering the case when the node is a leaf, and the value is v\n            # However, the function parameters are left_val and right_val, which are not relevant\n            # So this function is actually not correct.

The key insight is that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. By recursively computing the number of valid configurations for each node and combining them, we can determine the total number of ways to achieve the desired maximum size `f`. The provided code is a placeholder and would need further optimization and detailed implementation to handle all edge cases efficiently.",
