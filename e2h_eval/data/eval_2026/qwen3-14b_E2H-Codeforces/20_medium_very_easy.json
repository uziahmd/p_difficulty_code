For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The task is to calculate the number of ways to choose the c_s values for all binary strings of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what conditions the c_s values must satisfy for the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f. \n\nLet me think about the constraints for a beautiful multiset. For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of exactly n-length binary strings. \n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset depends on the choices of c_s. Our goal is to count the number of c_s configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model this. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s values. For example, if we have a certain set of c_s values, the maximum possible size of the multiset would be the minimum over some constraints. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints of all prefixes. For instance, for each string in the multiset (which is of length n), it contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, for the multiset to be beautiful, for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s. \n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset would be the largest possible number of n-length strings we can include without violating any of these constraints. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: find all possible c_s configurations where the maximum possible number of n-length strings that can be placed in the multiset (without violating any c_s constraints) is exactly f. Then, count the number of such configurations.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Let's think about the maximum possible size of the multiset given the c_s values. How is that determined?\n\nThis seems like a problem related to the constraints of a trie structure. Each node in the trie represents a binary string (prefix). For each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that pass through it (i.e., have s as a prefix) is limited by c_s. \n\nFor example, the root node (empty string?) but here the strings are of length from 1 to n. Wait, no. The problem says that for every binary string s with length from 1 to n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. \n\nBut the multiset contains only strings of length exactly n. So each such string contributes to all its prefixes. For example, the string '01' of length 2 contributes to the prefixes '0' (length 1) and '01' (length 2). \n\nSo, the problem of choosing the maximum number of n-length strings such that for every prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. \n\nThis sounds similar to a flow problem or a problem where we need to find the maximum number of elements under certain constraints. However, since the constraints are hierarchical (a longer prefix is a child of a shorter one), perhaps there's a way to model this with some kind of constraints that can be calculated recursively.\n\nLet me think of this as a tree. Each node is a binary string. The root could be considered as the empty string, but since our problem starts with strings of length 1 up to n, perhaps the tree is built for all prefixes. For each node (string s), its children are s followed by a 0 or 1. \n\nNow, for each node, the number of strings in the multiset that pass through it (i.e., have s as a prefix) is the sum of the counts of all descendants in the trie. But how does that relate to the constraints?\n\nWait, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is constrained by all the prefixes. For example, the root (if we consider the empty string) would have a constraint that the total number of strings in the multiset is <= c_{empty}. But in the problem statement, the constraints are for all strings s of length 1 to n. So the empty string isn't considered here. Wait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not part of the constraints. \n\nSo for example, the root's children are the strings of length 1. Each of those has their own constraints. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for each node (string s), the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset such that all their prefixes up to s are respected. \n\nBut how to model the maximum possible size of the multiset given the c_s values. Let's think of it as a problem where each node s has a capacity c_s. The capacity of the node s is the maximum number of strings that can pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix). However, the capacity of a parent node must be at least as large as the sum of capacities of its children. Or wait, maybe not. \n\nWait, for example, suppose we have a node s of length l. Each string that passes through s must also pass through its parent (the prefix of length l-1). Therefore, the number of strings passing through s can't exceed the capacity of s, and also the number of strings passing through the parent can't be less than the sum of the capacities of its children. \n\nWait, no. The capacity of the parent is the maximum number of strings that have that parent as a prefix. Each of those strings will also have their children as prefixes. So for example, if a node s has two children, then the number of strings that have s as a prefix is the sum of the number of strings that have each child as a prefix. So for the node s, the sum of the capacities of its children must be <= c_s. \n\nBut this seems like a hierarchical constraint. Therefore, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is determined by the minimum between the capacities of the nodes along the paths. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves in a tree where each node has a capacity. The maximum number of leaves is the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. But in our case, the root is not part of the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a trie of depth n, where each node (s) has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) such that for every node s (of length up to n), the number of leaves that pass through s is <= c_s. \n\nThis is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves in a trie, given that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. \n\nIn this scenario, the maximum possible number of leaves is the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. Wait, but the root isn't part of the constraints. However, the constraints for the nodes of length 1 (the root's children) would affect this. \n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It's similar to the problem where each node has a capacity, and the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves, but adjusted for the hierarchy. \n\nWait, for example, if you have a node s of length l. The number of leaves in its subtree cannot exceed c_s. Also, each of its children's capacities must be such that their subtree counts are <= c_children. \n\nSo the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal capacity along the path from the root (the first level) down to the leaves. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each leaf (string of length n), the path from the root (level 1) to the leaf (level n) has certain capacities. The maximum number of leaves is the sum over all leaves, but each leaf's contribution is limited by the capacities of all the nodes along its path. \n\nThis feels complicated. Maybe we can model it as follows: For each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum c_s along the paths. But how?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for a node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves in each of its children's subtrees). Wait, no. Because each child of s can contribute up to their own max leaves, which is constrained by their c's. However, the total number of leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of leaves from its children. But that sum must be <= c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min( c_s, sum_{children} (max_leaves_in_child_subtree) ). \n\nBut this seems like a dynamic programming approach. However, since the nodes form a tree, we can compute this recursively. However, in our case, the nodes are all possible binary strings of length 1 to n. \n\nBut how do we compute this maximum for the entire tree (i.e., for the root of the trie, which is the empty string, but the constraints don't include the empty string)? Wait, the root here is not part of the constraints. The constraints start from the nodes of length 1. \n\nWait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not considered. So the trie is built for strings of length 1 up to n. \n\nSo for the entire problem, the maximum number of leaves (n-length strings) is determined by the constraints of the nodes along their paths. For example, the root's children (strings of length 1) have their capacities. Each of those can contribute up to their own capacities. However, the sum of the capacities of their children (strings of length 2) must be <= their own capacities. \n\nSo the maximum number of leaves is determined by the capacities in such a way that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s, and this is maximized. \n\nThis seems like a problem where the maximum possible number of leaves is equal to the sum over all nodes of the minimum capacity along the path from the root to that node. Wait, no. That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as for each leaf (n-length string), the path from the root (length 1) to the leaf (length n) has a series of capacities. The maximum number of leaves that can be included is limited by the minimal capacity along each path. But how?\n\nWait, for each leaf, the number of leaves that can be placed in the multiset is constrained by the capacities of all the prefixes of that leaf. For example, if a leaf has a path where one of the prefixes has a capacity of 2, then the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in the multiset is limited by that capacity. \n\nBut this is not straightforward. Let me think of an example. Suppose n=2. The root's children are '0' and '1'. Each of these can have capacities c_0 and c_1. Their children are '00', '01', '10', '11', each with capacities c_00, etc. \n\nThe maximum number of leaves (strings of length 2) is the sum of the number of leaves in each of the children of the root. But each of those children can contribute up to their own capacity. However, the capacity of their parent (root's children) must be >= the sum of their children's contributions. \n\nSo for the root's children:\n\nFor the node '0' (length 1), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01). Similarly for node '1', it's min(c_1, c_10 + c_11). The total maximum number of leaves is the sum of those two minima. \n\nBut how does this generalize for deeper trees? For example, for n=3, each node of length 2 has two children (length 3). The maximum number of leaves under a node of length 2 is min(c_s, sum of children's capacities). Then, for the node of length 1, the maximum is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves of its children). \n\nSo, recursively, for each node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, sum_{children} (max_leaves_of_children)). \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is equal to the value computed for the root of the trie (but the trie's root is not part of the constraints). Wait, but the root here is not considered. Wait, for the entire problem, the root is the empty string, but the constraints start from length 1. So the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max leaves for the root's children (the strings of length 1). \n\nBut each of those children's max leaves is min(c_s, sum of their children's max leaves). \n\nSo, in general, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the following recursive formula:\n\nFor a node s of length l (where 1 ≤ l ≤ n), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is:\n\nIf l == n: then the subtree of s is just the node itself. So the maximum number of leaves is 1 (if we include this string in the multiset). But wait, the capacity of s is c_s. So the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, ...). But since l = n, the node s has no children. So the sum of children's max leaves is zero. So the maximum is min(c_s, 0) = 0? That can't be right. \n\nWait, no. For a node s of length n, the subtree is the node itself. So the number of leaves in the subtree is 1 (the node s itself). However, the constraint is that the number of leaves passing through s (which is 1, if we include s) must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, 1). \n\nAh! Right. So for a node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is:\n\nIf l == n: min(c_s, 1)\n\nElse: min(c_s, sum_{children} (max_leaves_of_children))\n\nBecause each child of s is of length l+1, and their max_leaves_of_children is the maximum number of leaves that can be added under their subtree. Summing those gives the total number of leaves that can be added under s's subtree. However, this sum must not exceed c_s. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of leaves for the entire trie is the sum of the max_leaves for each of the root's children (the nodes of length 1). \n\nBut the root here is the empty string, which isn't part of the constraints. However, the nodes of length 1 are the children of the root. \n\nSo, for the entire problem, the maximum number of leaves (the size of the beautiful multiset) is determined by the above recursive calculation. \n\nNow, our task is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n, such that this maximum number of leaves equals exactly f. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nThe key observation is that the maximum number of leaves (call it M) is determined by the constraints of the c_s values. We need M to be exactly f. \n\nBut how can we compute for a given set of c_s values what M is? \n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the total number of binary strings of lengths 1 to n is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534. Which is manageable for some dynamic programming approach. \n\nBut since we have to compute for all possible assignments of c_s values (each between 0 and k), and count those that lead to exactly f, this seems computationally heavy. However, given that n is small (up to 15), perhaps we can find a way to model this with DP, considering the constraints in a bottom-up manner. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. For each node (binary string s), the value of the maximum leaves under its subtree depends on the c_s and the values of its children. \n\nBut since the nodes form a binary tree, we can process them in order of increasing length. For example, for nodes of length n, compute their contribution based on c_s. Then for nodes of length n-1, compute their contribution based on their children (nodes of length n), and so on, up to the nodes of length 1. \n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute the maximum leaves in its subtree as a function of c_s and the values of its children. \n\nBut since each node's value depends on its children, we can process the nodes in reverse order of length (starting from length n and moving to length 1). \n\nSo, for each node s of length l, the value of max_leaves[s] is:\n\nif l == n: min(c_s, 1)\n\nelse: min(c_s, sum of max_leaves[children of s])\n\nThen, the total maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of max_leaves for all nodes of length 1. \n\nBut for our problem, we need this total to be exactly f. \n\nNow, the question becomes: how many assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) are there such that when we compute the max_leaves for each node according to the above rules, the sum of max_leaves for the length 1 nodes is exactly f. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nThe key idea is that for each node s, the value of max_leaves[s] depends on the c_s and the values of its children. However, the children are processed before the parent (since we process nodes in order of decreasing length). \n\nSo, for each node, we can model the possible values of max_leaves[s], given the constraints on c_s and the possible values of its children. \n\nBut since the nodes are processed in order of length, starting from the deepest (length n), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves[s], and how they contribute to the overall sum. \n\nHowever, given that n is up to 15, and for each node there are 2^l possible nodes (for length l), this seems challenging. \n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each node, the max_leaves[s] can be represented as the minimum between c_s and some value derived from its children. \n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s of length l:\n\nmax_leaves[s] = min(c_s, sum_{children} max_leaves[child])\n\nBut each child of s is of length l+1. \n\nNow, for the nodes of length n, max_leaves[s] = min(c_s, 1). \n\nSo, for each node, the value of max_leaves[s] depends on the value of c_s and the sum of the max_leaves of its children. \n\nBut how can we model this for all possible c_s values? \n\nLet me think of this as follows: For each node, the value of max_leaves[s] can be any integer between 0 and some upper bound. For example, for a node of length l, the upper bound is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. However, since c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, the actual value of max_leaves[s] is the minimum between c_s and that sum. \n\nBut since we're trying to count the number of assignments of c_s that lead to a total sum of f, perhaps we can model this with memoization or dynamic programming, considering for each node the possible ways to choose c_s and the resulting max_leaves[s]. \n\nBut the problem is that the number of nodes is 2^{n+1} - 2, which for n=15 is 65534 nodes. And for each node, we have to track possible values of max_leaves[s]. However, given that for each node, the max_leaves[s] can be up to the sum of its children's max_leaves, which for the root nodes (length 1) could be up to f (since the total is f). \n\nBut even with that, it's unclear how to proceed. \n\nAlternative approach: For the entire tree, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints on the c_s values. We need this maximum to be exactly f. \n\nLet me think about the constraints that must be satisfied for the maximum to be exactly f. \n\nLet me denote that for each node s, the value of max_leaves[s] is m_s. Then, for the entire tree, the sum of m_s for all nodes of length 1 must be exactly f. \n\nBut m_s is determined by the c_s and the children of s. \n\nMoreover, for each node s, the value m_s is min(c_s, sum_{children} m_child). \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nLet me think for each node s, what are the possible values of m_s, given that the children's m_child are known. \n\nFor example, for a node s of length l, if we know the sum of the m_child for its children, then m_s can be any value between 0 and min(k, sum_children), but m_s is min(c_s, sum_children). \n\nWait, but since c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, then for a given sum_children, the value of m_s can be any value between 0 and min(k, sum_children). However, m_s must be exactly min(c_s, sum_children). So for a given sum_children, the value of m_s can be any value between 0 and min(k, sum_children), and for each possible m_s, there are multiple choices of c_s that would result in that m_s. \n\nSpecifically, if sum_children is S, then m_s is min(c_s, S). To have m_s = t, where t <= S, we can choose c_s >= t. But since c_s can't exceed k, the number of choices is:\n\nif t <= S and t <= k: then c_s can be in [t, min(k, S)]. But wait, if sum_children is S, then min(c_s, S) = t. So for this to happen, either:\n\n- c_s >= t and S >= t, and c_s < t + something? No. Let's think again. \n\nIf sum_children is S, then m_s = min(c_s, S). So to have m_s = t, we need:\n\nt = min(c_s, S). \n\nWhich implies that:\n\nif t <= S: then c_s must be >= t (so that min(c_s, S) is t if c_s is between t and S, or S if c_s is larger than S. Wait, no. If c_s is larger than or equal to S, then min(c_s, S) is S. So for m_s to be exactly t, we have two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: t < S. Then, to have m_s = t, we must have c_s >= t and c_s < S. Because if c_s is between t and S-1, then min(c_s, S) is c_s. So to get exactly t, c_s must be t. Or wait, no. \n\nWait, if sum_children is S, then m_s = min(c_s, S). So:\n\nIf c_s >= S → m_s = S.\n\nIf c_s < S → m_s = c_s.\n\nSo, for m_s to be exactly t, we have:\n\nt must be <= S.\n\nIf t < S: then c_s must be exactly t. Because if c_s is greater than t but less than S, then m_s would be c_s, which is larger than t. So to have m_s = t, c_s must be exactly t. \n\nWait, no. For example, if sum_children is 5, and c_s is 3, then m_s is 3. If c_s is 4, then m_s is 4. So to get m_s = t, you can choose c_s = t, provided that t <= S. But if you choose c_s >= t, but less than S, then m_s would be c_s, which could be larger than t. So if you want m_s to be exactly t, you have to choose c_s = t. \n\nWait, but that would require that t is exactly the value of c_s. So for each t <= S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that m_s = t is:\n\nIf t <= S and t <=k: 1 (c_s = t) if t is within [0, k]. Otherwise, zero. \n\nWait, but what if S is larger than k? Then, if we want m_s = t, and t is <=k, then c_s can be any value between t and k. Because min(c_s, S) would be c_s if c_s is <= S. Since S >=k, then for c_s in [t, k], min(c_s, S) = c_s. So for m_s to be exactly t, we need c_s = t. \n\nWait, no. For example, if S is 10 (sum_children) and k is 5. Then, if c_s is 3, then m_s is 3. If c_s is 4, m_s is 4. So to have m_s = t, you have to choose c_s = t. So regardless of whether S is larger than k or not, for m_s to be exactly t, c_s must be exactly t. \n\nWait, but if S is less than k. For example, S is 3, and k is 5. Then, if c_s is 4, then m_s is 3 (since min(4, 3) is 3). So, in this case, m_s is 3, but c_s is 4. So to have m_s = t, where t is 3, we can choose c_s >= t (but not exceeding S). Because if c_s >= t and <= S, then m_s is c_s. Wait, no. If c_s >= t and <= S, then m_s is c_s. So if you want m_s to be t, then c_s must be exactly t. \n\nBut if you have c_s >= S (and S is 3, k is 5), then m_s is S = 3. So in that case, choosing c_s >= S (i.e., >=3) would result in m_s being 3. So for m_s to be exactly 3, you can choose c_s in [3, k]. \n\nAh! This is a crucial point. So the number of ways to choose c_s such that m_s is t depends on the value of sum_children (S) and the value of t. \n\nSo for a given sum_children S, the possible values of m_s can be:\n\n- All integers from 0 up to min(S, k). \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nm_s is min(c_s, S). \n\nWe can choose c_s in [0, k]. \n\nSo for each possible value of t that m_s can take, the number of c_s that result in m_s = t is:\n\nIf t < S: then c_s must be exactly t. Because if c_s is larger than t but less than S, then m_s would be larger than t. So only c_s = t will give m_s = t. \n\nIf t = S: then c_s can be any value in [S, k]. Because min(c_s, S) = S. \n\nSo the number of c_s that result in m_s = t is:\n\nif t < S: 1 (only c_s = t).\n\nif t == S: (k - S + 1) if S <=k else 0. \n\nBut wait, when S >k, then t can't be S. Because m_s can't exceed min(S, k). So in that case, the maximum t is k. \n\nSo, for a given sum_children S, the possible values of t (m_s) are in 0 to min(S, k). \n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. For each node, we can model the possible values of m_s (the max_leaves for that node) and the number of ways to choose c_s that would lead to that m_s, given the sum_children S. \n\nBut since the sum_children S depends on the children of the node, which are processed first, we can build this recursively. \n\nSo, for example, for the nodes of length n, which have no children, their sum_children is 0. So m_s is min(c_s, 1). \n\nWait, earlier analysis said that for a node of length n, the max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). Because the sum of children is zero (no children), so m_s is min(c_s, 0) if the formula was min(c_s, sum_children). But that contradicts with previous analysis. \n\nWait, earlier I thought that for a node of length l, the max_leaves is min(c_s, sum_children). But for l = n, the node has no children. So sum_children is zero. Thus, the formula would give min(c_s, 0). But that can't be right, because the node itself can be included in the multiset. \n\nAh, I see a mistake here. Earlier analysis was incorrect. Let me re-examine the formula. \n\nFor a node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the max_leaves of its children. But for a node of length n, there are no children. So the sum is zero. So the formula would give min(c_s, 0) = 0. Which is wrong, because the node itself is a leaf. \n\nSo there's a mistake in the earlier reasoning. \n\nLet me re-express the correct formula. \n\nThe max_leaves for a node s is the maximum number of leaves that can be included in the multiset under the constraints of s and its children. \n\nIf the node is of length n, then it's a leaf. So including it in the multiset would contribute 1 to the count. However, the constraint is that the number of leaves passing through s (which is 1 if included) must be <= c_s. \n\nSo the maximum number of leaves under s is min(c_s, 1). \n\nBut how does this fit into the formula? \n\nFor a node s of length l, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is:\n\nif l == n: min(c_s, 1)\n\nelse: min(c_s, sum_{children} max_leaves[child])\n\nYes. So for a node of length l < n, the max_leaves is the minimum between c_s and the sum of its children's max_leaves. \n\nFor a node of length n, it's the minimum between c_s and 1. \n\nThis makes sense. \n\nSo, for example, for a node of length n, the max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). \n\nSo, for a node s of length l, the sum_children is the sum of max_leaves of its children. \n\nBut for a node of length l < n, the sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of its children (which are of length l+1). \n\nSo, the formula for the max_leaves is:\n\nmax_leaves[s] = min(c_s, (sum_children if l < n else 1))\n\nThis changes things. \n\nSo, for each node, when processing it, we need to know the sum_children, which is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. \n\nNow, returning to the problem of counting the number of c_s assignments that result in the total sum of the max_leaves for the root's children (nodes of length 1) being exactly f. \n\nLet's think recursively. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the max_leaves for that node is t, given the possible values of sum_children. \n\nBut since the sum_children is determined by the children of the node, which are processed first, we can model this with dynamic programming. \n\nLet me consider that for each node, the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the max_leaves of this node is t, given that the sum_children is S. \n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nFor a node of length l:\n\nIf l == n:\n\nsum_children is irrelevant (since there are no children). The max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). \n\nSo, for this node, the possible values of t (max_leaves) are 0 or 1. \n\nThe number of ways to choose c_s to achieve t is:\n\nif t == 0: c_s can be 0, or any value >= 0 but min(c_s, 1) = 0. Wait, min(c_s, 1) is 0 only when c_s is 0. Because if c_s is 0, then min(0, 1) is 0. If c_s >= 1, then min is 1. \n\nSo for t=0, the number of ways is 1 (choose c_s = 0). \n\nFor t=1, the number of ways is (k - 0) if k >= 1. Wait, no. Because c_s can be any value between 1 and k (since min(c_s, 1) is 1 if c_s >= 1). So the number of ways is (k - 0) if k >= 1? No. Because c_s ranges from 0 to k. So for t=1, c_s must be >=1. The number of possible values is (k - 0) if k >= 1? No. The number is (k - 0) if c_s can be from 1 to k. Which is (k) - 0? No, it's (k - 0) if we count numbers from 1 to k inclusive. The count is k - 0? No, it's k - 0 + 1? No. For example, if k is 4, the numbers from 1 to 4 are 4 values. So the number is (k) - 0? No, it's k (if 0 is excluded). Wait, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So for c_s >= 1 and <=k, the number is k - 1 + 1 = k. \n\nYes. So for t=1, the number of ways is k (if k >=1), otherwise 0. \n\nWait, but if k is zero, then there's no way to choose c_s >=1, so it's zero. \n\nSo for a node of length n, the number of ways to achieve t is:\n\nif t == 0: 1 (choose c_s = 0)\n\nif t == 1: (k >= 1 ? k : 0)\n\nBut this is for a single node of length n. \n\nNow, for a node of length l < n, the sum_children is the sum of the max_leaves of its children. Let's call this sum S. \n\nThen, the max_leaves for this node is min(c_s, S). \n\nAs discussed earlier, for this node, the number of ways to choose c_s to get a particular value of t (the max_leaves) depends on S. \n\nSo for this node, the possible values of t are from 0 to min(S, k). \n\nFor each t in 0..min(S, k), the number of ways to choose c_s is:\n\nif t < S: 1 way (c_s = t)\n\nif t == S: (k - S + 1) ways (c_s can be from S to k, inclusive)\n\nBut only if S <=k. If S >k, then t can't be S. In that case, the maximum possible t is k. \n\nSo for this node, the number of ways to get t is:\n\nif t < S: 1 (if t is in [0, k])\n\nif t == S: (k - S + 1) if S <=k, else 0.\n\nBut how do we model this for the DP?\n\nThe idea is that for each node, we can compute for all possible values of S (the sum_children), the number of ways to assign c_s such that the max_leaves is t, for each possible t. \n\nBut since the sum_children S is determined by the children of the node, which are processed before the node, we can build this recursively. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe'll process the nodes in order of decreasing length. For each node, we compute for all possible values of sum_children S, the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the max_leaves for this node is t, multiplied by the ways for the children. \n\nBut how to represent this. \n\nFor example, consider a node of length l < n. It has two children (since binary strings). For each child, we have computed the possible ways to assign their c_s values and their resulting max_leaves. \n\nThe sum_children S is the sum of the max_leaves of the two children. \n\nSo for each node, the sum_children can vary, and for each possible sum_children, we can calculate the number of ways to achieve a particular t for this node. \n\nBut since the sum_children depends on the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for `c_s` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`.

Nodes are processed from the deepest level (length `n`) up to the root level (length 1).\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: For each level, we compute the number of ways to achieve a certain number of leaves (strings of length `n`) under the constraints of the `c_s` values. This is done using a bottom-up approach.\n3. **Combining Results**: The number of ways to achieve a specific sum of leaves at each level is computed by combining results from lower levels. For each level, the possible sums of leaves are calculated based on the children's contributions.\n4. **Final Calculation**: The result is derived by considering the sum of contributions from the root level (level 1), ensuring the total number of leaves matches the required value `f`.",
