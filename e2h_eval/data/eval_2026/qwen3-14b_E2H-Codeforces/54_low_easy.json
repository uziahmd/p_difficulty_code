Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the angle formed and a. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to calculate the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nLet me think about the regular polygon. In a regular n-gon, each central angle (the angle subtended at the center of the polygon by one side) is 360/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me consider a regular polygon with n sides. Let's pick a vertex v2, and then two other vertices v1 and v3. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is vertex 1, v3 is vertex 3. Then the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. But if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, then the angle would be 45 degrees. Wait, maybe I need to find a general formula for the angle.\n\nLet me think. For a regular polygon, the measure of each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, when we take three vertices, the angle formed at v2 depends on how many edges are between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. Wait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of sides between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2.\n\nWait, suppose we have a regular polygon. Let me fix v2 as a vertex. Let me imagine that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps counter-clockwise. Or perhaps, the number of edges between v1 and v2 along the perimeter, and similarly for v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method to calculate the angle. Let me think of the regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. The vertices are equally spaced around the circle. Suppose I choose three points v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 can be found using the central angles.\n\nLet me think: the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem states that the angle formed by two chords in a circle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the vertices lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Let me think again. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps around the polygon. For example, if the polygon has n vertices, then the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) would be k * (360/n) degrees. Then the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that. But wait, no. Because the angle at v2 would depend on which arc we take.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 is formed by two lines: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The angle between these two lines. Let me think of the arc that is opposite to this angle. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So, the angle at v2 would subtend the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. So, the length of that arc is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k edges along the arc that does not contain v2. Then the arc length is k * (360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle at v2 would be half of this, so (k * 360 / n) / 2 = k * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut how do we find k? Well, since the polygon is regular and convex, the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc must be at least 1 and at most n-2. Because if you take any two distinct vertices, the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 would have some number of steps. But since v1 and v3 are on the sides of the angle,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the possible angles formed by different configurations of vertices and selecting the one that minimizes the absolute difference from `a`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of edges between them. Using the inscribed angle theorem, the angle at a vertex can be determined based on the arc it subtends.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a regular n-gon, the angle formed at vertex `v2` by vertices `v1` and `v3` can be calculated using the formula derived from the inscribed angle theorem. This angle is given by `(k * 180) / n`, where `k` is the number of edges between `v1` and `v3` along the arc that does not contain `v2`.\n3. **Optimal k Selection**: The optimal value of `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between the calculated angle and `a` is found by iterating through possible values of `k` and checking which one gives the closest angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the central angle per side\n    central_angle = 360.0 / n\n    \n    # The angle at v2 is (k * central_angle) / 2, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 not passing through v2\n    # So, for each possible k, compute the angle and find the best one\n    # The possible k ranges from 1 to n-2, since v1 and v3 must be distinct and not the same as v2\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    # We need to find k such that (k * 180.0) / n is as close as possible to a\n    # Because angle = (k * 180.0)/n\n    for k in range(1, n-1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # If there are multiple k's with same diff, choose the smallest one?\n            # Since any solution is acceptable, we can just keep the first one\n            pass\n    \n    # Now, find a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this best_k\n    # For example, choose v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + best_k\n    # But need to make sure that the indices are within 1..n and distinct\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k (mod n?), but need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is exactly best_k steps\n    # For example, in a polygon, if v2 is 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + best_k, but if 2 + best_k exceeds n, wrap around?\n    # Actually, since the polygon is cyclic, we can arrange the vertices such that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is exactly best_k edges.\n    \n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + best_k. However, if 2 + best_k > n, then we need to wrap around.\n    # Wait, no. For example, in n=5, best_k=2: v1 is 2, v3 is 2+2=4. The arc between 2 and 4 not passing through 1 is 2 steps (edges 2-3, 3-4). That's correct.\n    # But if best_k=3, then 2+3=5. The arc between 2 and 5 not passing through 1 would be 3 steps (edges 2-3, 3-4, 4-5). Correct.\n    # However, if best_k is larger than n-2? No, because the loop runs up to n-2, so best_k is at most n-2.\n    \n    # Therefore, the positions can be chosen as follows:\n    # v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 2 + best_k.

The arc between 2 and 5 not passing through 1 is 3 edges (2-3, 3-4, 4-5).\n    # So the triplet is 2, 1, 5. Wait, but the angle is at v2 (which is 1), and v1 is 2, v3 is 5.

But if 2 + best_k exceeds n, then it's okay because the polygon wraps around.\n    \n    # However, when best_k is such that 2 + best_k > n, then the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is actually (best_k) steps. For example, n=5, best_k=3, 2+3=5. The arc from 2 to 5 not passing through 1 is indeed 3 steps.\n    \n    # Thus, the triplet can be (2, 1, 2 + best_k)\n    \n    # However, in some cases, like when best_k is 1, the triplet would be (2, 1, 3), which is valid.\n    \n    # Now, let's compute v3:\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    if v3 > n:\n        # This can't happen since best_k is at most n-2, 2 + (n-2) = n\n        pass\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (the target angle).\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle for each side of the polygon is calculated as `360.0 / n`.\n3. **Finding Optimal k**: Iterate over possible values of `k` (number of steps between vertices) to find the one that results in an angle closest to `a`.\n4. **Output the Triplet**: Once the optimal `k` is found, construct the triplet of vertices such that the angle at the middle vertex is as close as possible to `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the closest possible angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and ensures the solution is both optimal and correct.",
