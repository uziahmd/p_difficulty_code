The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers are valid. Let's think about the conditions required for the signal setup.\n\nSo, for each tower, when you set its power p, it covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, the description says that a tower at i with power p reaches every city c where |c - i| < p. So that's equivalent to c being in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], because |c-i| < p implies that c is between i - (p-1) and i + (p-1), inclusive. For example, if p=2, then cities at i-1, i, i+1 are covered. Wait, no: |c -i| < p → the distance is less than p. So for p=2, the distance can be 0 or 1. So cities i-1, i, i+1 are covered. But the signal power p must be an integer between 1 and n.\n\nBut the key thing is that for each town 1..n, exactly one tower covers it. And towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the towers. How can the towers be arranged such that this is possible?\n\nThis feels similar to some kind of tiling or interval covering problem. Maybe the valid tower configurations are those that can be partitioned into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and the towers are placed in such a way that their coverage doesn't overlap except in certain ways.\n\nWait, but the signal powers can be adjusted. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding configurations where the towers can be arranged in a way that each tower's coverage is non-overlapping except for possibly overlapping regions that are handled by choosing the right power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the valid configurations are those where the towers form a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain range of towns, and these ranges don't overlap except at the edges. For example, if we have towers placed in positions such that each tower's coverage area is exactly the towns between some left and right points, and adjacent towers' coverage areas don't overlap except at the boundaries.\n\nWait, considering that each town must be covered exactly once, perhaps the arrangement of towers must form a set of non-overlapping intervals, each assigned to exactly one tower. But how?\n\nAnother thought: For a tower at position i, if it's responsible for covering some towns, then the maximum reach of that tower must be such that it covers exactly those towns. For instance, suppose there's a tower at position i. To cover some towns, the signal power p must be chosen so that the coverage includes exactly the towns that are assigned to it. Also, the coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the valid configurations are those where the towers are placed in such a way that they can be partitioned into pairs of towers where each pair is adjacent, or something like that. Alternatively, think of the problem as requiring that the towers form a structure where each tower is \"responsible\" for a segment of towns, and these segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nLet me think of the example given. When n=5, towers are built in 2,4,5. Then tower 2 has power 2, which covers towns 1,2,3. Tower 4 has power 1, covering 4. Tower 5 has power 1, covering 5. So each town is covered once. Also, town 0 is not covered by any tower. Town 6 is not covered.\n\nWhat's the pattern here? The tower at 2 covers up to 3, then the next tower at 4 starts covering from 4. So between the towers, there's no overlap. So maybe the towers must be arranged such that each tower is placed in a way that the next tower is at least two positions away. Or perhaps there's some relation between the positions of consecutive towers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as needing to select a subset of towers (positions) such that there exists a way to assign to each tower a range of towns that it covers, with the ranges being non-overlapping and covering all towns. Also, the coverage of each tower must not reach 0 or n+1.\n\nLet me consider the constraints for a tower. Suppose a tower is placed at position i. Its signal power p must be chosen such that:\n\n- It does not cover town 0: So, i - p + 1 > 0 → p < i. Because if p is at least i, then the leftmost town covered would be i - (p-1) = i - p + 1. If p >= i, then i-p+1 <= 0. So for the tower at i, the maximum p is i-1. Similarly, for town n+1, the rightmost town covered is i + p -1. This must be less than n+1. So i + p -1 < n+1 → p < (n+1 -i) +1 → p <= n -i. Therefore, the maximum possible p for a tower at i is min(i-1, n -i). Wait, but the problem allows p to be any integer from 1 to n. However, the constraints here require that the tower's coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1. So for a tower at i, the maximum p is such that p <= i (so that i - p +1 >= 1?), wait no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nThe tower at i must not reach town 0. The coverage of the tower is all towns c with |c - i| < p. So town 0 is at distance i from the tower. So for the tower to not cover town 0, we need i >= p. So p <= i. Similarly, town n+1 is at distance (n+1 - i) from the tower. So for it not to be covered, we need (n+1 - i) >= p → p <= n+1 -i. So the maximum p for the tower is min(i, n+1 -i). But since the signal power can be set to any value between 1 and n, but subject to these constraints, the tower's p can be up to min(i, n+1 -i). However, for the purposes of coverage, the tower's coverage can be adjusted to any size up to that maximum.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem's conditions?\n\nThe key is that the towers must be arranged such that their coverage regions (as chosen by their p) do not overlap except in a way that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps there's a way to model the valid tower configurations as those that form a certain structure. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet's think of dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1 to i). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid tower configurations are those that form a set of positions where each tower is either isolated (like in the example where only tower 2 is present, and p=2) or adjacent to another tower in a way that their coverage doesn't interfere.\n\nAnother observation: For the entire setup to be possible, the towns 1..n must be covered exactly once. That implies that the coverage regions of the towers form a partition of {1..n} into intervals. Each interval is covered by exactly one tower. Moreover, for each such interval [a, b], there must be a tower at some position i in [a, b], such that the signal power p is chosen so that the coverage of i includes [a, b], and does not extend beyond. For example, if the interval is [a, b], then the tower must be placed at i such that i is in [a, b], and the signal power is such that the coverage is exactly [a, b]. How?\n\nFor the coverage of the tower at i to cover exactly [a, b], we need that:\n\n- a = i - p + 1\n- b = i + p - 1\n\nWhich implies that p = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2. Wait, solving for p:\n\nFrom a = i - p + 1 → p = i - a + 1.\n\nFrom b = i + p -1 → p = b - i + 1.\n\nSo combining both equations:\n\ni - a + 1 = b - i + 1 → 2i = a + b → i = (a + b)/2.\n\nSo for the tower to cover exactly [a, b], it must be located at the midpoint of a and b. And the length of the interval (b - a + 1) must be odd, since i must be integer. Wait, no. Because if a and b are such that their sum is even, then i is integer. Otherwise, not. So this suggests that each interval [a, b] must have a midpoint that is an integer, meaning that a and b must be of opposite parity. So the length of the interval is even or odd?\n\nWait, the length of [a, b] is b - a + 1. The midpoint is i = (a + b)/2. For i to be integer, a + b must be even, which implies that a and b have the same parity. So the length is (b - a + 1). Let's see: For example, a=1, b=3: length is 3, midpoint 2. So yes. So for the tower to cover exactly [a, b], the interval must be symmetric around the tower's position. Thus, the tower's position is the center of the interval, and the length is 2p -1, where p is the signal power. So p = (length + 1)/2.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, perhaps the valid tower configurations are those that can be partitioned into intervals where each interval is covered by a tower located exactly at the center of that interval. So each such interval must have an odd length. However, this seems restrictive, but maybe it's the case.\n\nBut then, for example, in the first sample input where n=2, the towers are built in 1 and 2. Then each tower has power 1. So the coverage of tower 1 is [1], and tower 2 is [2]. That works. So each interval is of length 1 (odd). Another example is when n=5, and the towers are at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 covers [1,3], which is length 3 (odd). The tower at 4 covers [4], and the tower at 5 covers [5]. So that's valid.\n\nBut what if there's a tower that covers an interval of even length? For example, suppose there's a tower at position i with power p such that the coverage is [a, b], where the length is even. How can that happen? Let's say the tower is at i=2, p=2. Then the coverage is [1, 3], which is length 3 (odd). Wait, but p=2 gives coverage of |c -2| < 2 → c can be 1, 2, 3. So that's 3 towns. So the length is 3. So the length is always 2p-1. Which is odd. So any coverage area of a tower is an interval of odd length, centered at the tower's position. Thus, for the entire set of towns to be covered exactly once, the configuration of towers must be such that the towns can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towers (positions) such that the positions form a set where each tower is the center of an interval of odd length, and the union of these intervals is exactly {1..n}, and the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a tiling problem. Let me think recursively. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i). How can we compute dp[i]?\n\nFor the last position (i), there are two possibilities:\n\n1. There is no tower at i. Then, the previous positions must form a valid configuration up to i-1. But this is not possible because the coverage of the existing towers must cover up to i. So if there's no tower at i, then there must be some tower before i that covers i. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is based on whether the i-th position is covered by a tower that ends at i, or not. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to tiling with dominoes or other tiles. For example, each tower can be considered as a tile that covers a certain length. Since each tower's coverage is an interval of length 2p-1, which can vary. However, since the tower must be placed in the middle of that interval, the possible ways to cover up to position i could be:\n\n- Place a tower at position i, which covers exactly position i (p=1). Then, the rest of the configuration is up to i-1.\n\n- Or, place a tower at position i - k, which covers from i - k - (p-1) to i -k + (p-1). But since the tower is at position i -k, and the interval must end at i. Let's think: if the tower is at position j, and its coverage ends at i. Then the coverage is [j - (p-1), j + (p-1)] = [a, i]. So j + (p-1) = i. Also, since the tower is at j, p must be such that the coverage starts at a = j - (p-1). But since the coverage is exactly [a, i], which has length i - a + 1 = 2p - 1. Also, since j = a + p - 1, because j = (a + i)/2. So, for the tower at j, the coverage ends at i. Then, the start of the coverage is a = 2j - i. For this to be valid, a must be ≥ 1. Also, the tower must be placed at j, which is part of the subset of towers.\n\nSo, for the recurrence, when considering dp[i], we can look back to positions j where j is such that there is a tower at j, and the coverage ends at i. Then, the number of ways would be dp[j - 1] multiplied by ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] * (ways where there's no tower at i, but it is covered by a previous tower) + ... ?\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, think that for the configuration to be valid, the entire 1..n must be covered by non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower. So each such interval must be of odd length. Therefore, the problem is similar to tiling the line with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile corresponds to a tower placed at its center.\n\nSo, the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of ways to tile the line from 1 to n using tiles of odd lengths, where each tile is placed as a tower at its center. Each tile can be of length 1 (tower at position i, covering just i), 3 (tower at i, covering i-1, i, i+1), etc. However, the tiles must not overlap and must exactly cover the entire line.\n\nThis seems familiar. For example, the number of ways to tile a 1xn board with tiles of size 1, 3, 5, etc. But how?\n\nLet me think of the recurrence for this tiling problem. Let f(n) be the number of ways to tile the first n towns. Then, for the nth town, the last tile could be of length 1 (so the nth town is covered by a tower at n, and the rest is f(n-1)), or length 3 (so the last tile covers n-1, n, n+1? No, wait, the length is 3, which would cover positions i-1, i, i+1. But for the last tile to end at position n, the center must be at position j where j + (p-1) = n. Since p is the length of the tile divided by 2 plus 0.5. For example, for a tile of length 3, the center is at position j, and the tile covers from j-1 to j+1. So to end at position n, the j+1 = n → j = n-1. Then the tile covers positions n-2, n-1, n. But that would mean that the previous part is up to n-3. So the recurrence would be f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + ... ?\n\nWait, more precisely, the last tile can be of length 1 (covers position n, so the previous part is f(n-1)), or length 3 (covers positions n-2, n-1, n; so the previous part is f(n-3)), or length 5 (covers positions n-4, ..., n; so previous part is f(n-5)), etc. So the recurrence would be f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{m} f(n - (2k+1)) }, where 2k+1 is the length of the tile, and m is such that 2k+1 ≤ n.\n\nBut for this to work, the base cases are:\n\nf(0) = 1 (empty tiling)\n\nf(n) = 0 for n < 0.\n\nThen, for example, f(1) = f(0) = 1.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + ... ? Wait, for n=2, the possible tiles are length 1 (so f(1) = 1) and length 3 (which is larger than 2, so no). So f(2) = f(1) = 1? But according to the first example, when n=2, the answer is 1/4. The total number of possible tower configurations is 2^2 =4. The valid ones are those where the towers are built in both 1 and 2. So the number of valid configurations is 1. Which matches f(2) = 1. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, f(2) is f(1) = 1. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The possible tilings are:\n\n- three tiles of length 1: towers at 1,2,3. So 1 way.\n\n- one tile of length 3: tower at 2. So 1 way.\n\nTotal f(3) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut what's the actual count of valid configurations? For n=3, the valid configurations are:\n\n- towers at 1, 2, 3. Then each has power 1. Valid.\n\n- tower at 2. Then set power to 2. Then it covers 1,2,3. Valid.\n\nAre there any others? What about towers at 1 and 3? Then, town 2 is not covered. So invalid. So yes, only two configurations. So f(3) = 2.\n\nNow, for the second example in the note where n=3. The answer is 1/4. The total number of configurations is 2^3 =8. The valid ones are:\n\n- towers at 1,2,3: 1 case.\n\n- tower at 2: 1 case.\n\nTotal 2. So 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the note. So the recurrence seems to hold.\n\nSo the number of valid tower configurations is f(n), where f(n) follows the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... etc. But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nBut wait, the recurrence for f(n) is the same as the Fibonacci sequence, but with steps of 2. Wait, for example:\n\nLet me compute f(n):\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = f(0) = 1\n\nf(2) = f(1) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0)? Wait, no. Wait, for n=5, the possible last tile lengths are 1, 3, 5.\n\nSo for length 1: f(4)\n\nlength 3: f(2)\n\nlength 5: f(0)\n\nso f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5, the answer in the note says that the real answer is 5/32. Let's check. For n=5, the number of valid configurations is 5. The total possible configurations is 2^5 = 32. So 5/32. Which matches the note. So yes, this seems to be correct.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is f(n), which satisfies f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k+1)) }, with base case f(0)=1.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nThis recurrence looks similar to the Fibonacci numbers. Let's see:\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5?\n\nWait, wait, for n=5, the sum is over all possible k where 2k+1 ≤ n. So for 2k+1 ≤5 → k can be 0 (1), 1 (3), 2 (5). So yes. So f(5) = f(5-1) + f(5-3) + f(5-5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3+1+1=5.\n\nBut looking at the recurrence, can we find a simpler way to express it? Let's think about f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nWait for n=3: f(3) = 2, which would be f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Yes.\n\nn=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2+1=3. Which matches.\n\nn=5: f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, this seems to be the case. Wait, what's the pattern here?\n\nIf f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then for n >= 2?\n\nBut for n=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) ? f(1) is 1, f(0) is 1. Sum is 2. But earlier we said f(2) is 1. So that's not matching. So this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, what's happening here. Let's re-examine:\n\nEarlier for n=3, the recurrence was f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1+1=2. But if the recurrence were f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then f(3) would be f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches. For n=4, the original recurrence is f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. And according to f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which also matches. For n=5, the original recurrence is f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. According to f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Which matches. So how is this possible?\n\nAh! Because for n ≥ 1, the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Let me check for n=2. According to the original approach, f(2) = f(1) = 1. According to the new recurrence f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which contradicts. So why did the previous examples match?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-calculate for n=2.\n\nOriginal tiling approach: For n=2, the possible tilings are:\n\nOnly tiles of length 1 (since a tile of length 3 would require positions 0, 1, 2, but 0 is not part of the problem). So the tiling is two tiles of length 1. So f(2) should be 1. But according to the new recurrence f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong. So where is the error?\n\nAh! The error comes from the assumption that the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). How did that come about?\n\nEarlier, for n=3, the original recurrence was f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. But according to the new idea, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. Similarly for n=4, the original recurrence was f(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3, and the new recurrence would be f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches. For n=5, original recurrence was f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, and the new recurrence f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. So why does this happen? Because for n ≥ 3, the original recurrence f(n) = sum_{k} f(n - (2k+1)) } equals f(n-1) + f(n-2). How?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let me assume that for any n ≥ 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Let's see if that holds.\n\nBut for n=2, according to the original approach, f(2) = 1. According to the new recurrence, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is a contradiction. So why does it work for higher n?\n\nAh! Because for n=2, the original recurrence is f(2) = f(1) + f(0) ? No, no. Let me re-express the original recurrence. The original recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k} f(n - (2k + 1)) }, where 2k +1 is the length of the tile. For n=2, the possible tile lengths are 1. Because 2k+1 ≤ 2 → k can be 0 (tile length 1). So f(2) = f(2 - 1) = f(1) = 1. So that's correct. For n=3, possible tile lengths are 1 and 3. So f(3) = f(3-1) + f(3-3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. For n=4, tile lengths can be 1, 3. 3 is 3 ≤4. So f(4) = f(4-1) + f(4-3) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. For n=5, tile lengths 1, 3, 5. So f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nNow, what is the relationship between f(n) and f(n-1) + f(n-2)?\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | ?\n\nFor n=6, the possible tile lengths are 1, 3, 5. So:\n\nf(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nIf the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then for n=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is wrong. But for n ≥3, let's see:\n\nf(3) = 2 = f(2) + f(1) → 1 + 1 = 2 → yes.\n\nf(4) = 3 = f(3) + f(2) → 2 + 1 = 3 → yes.\n\nf(5) = 5 = f(4) + f(3) → 3 + 2 = 5 → yes.\n\nf(6) = 8 = f(5) + f(4) → 5 + 3 = 8 → yes.\n\nSo starting from n=3, the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) holds. But for n=2, it doesn't. So what's the reason?\n\nAh! Because for n ≥ 2, the sum for f(n) is f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nWait for n ≥ 2, the original recurrence can be rewritten as:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ?\n\nHow?\n\nBecause for the original recurrence, when you add up all possible ways to end with a tile of length 1 or longer.\n\nBut for n ≥ 2, the sum over all possible tile lengths is equal to f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For any n ≥ 1, the sum for f(n) is:\n\nsum_{k ≥ 0} f(n - (2k+1)) }, where 2k+1 ≤ n.\n\nBut for n ≥ 2, this sum can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{m ≥ 1} f(n - m) }, where m is odd and m ≤ n.\n\nBut how to relate this to f(n-1) + f(n-2)?\n\nAlternatively, think of f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 2, with f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1. Let's check:\n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) → 1 = 1 + 1 → no. So that's not correct. However, if the initial conditions are f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, and for n ≥ 2, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), then the values would be:\n\nn=0: 1\n\nn=1: 1\n\nn=2: 1+1=2\n\nn=3: 2+1=3\n\nn=4: 3+2=5\n\nn=5: 5+3=8\n\nWhich does not match the earlier computed values. So that's not the case. So what's the correct recurrence?\n\nWait, earlier calculations showed that for n ≥ 3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). But for n=2, it's different. So perhaps the correct recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 2, but with f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, and f(2) = 1. But this would not hold for n=2. So there's inconsistency here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 1, with f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1. Then:\n\nn=0: 1\n\nn=1: 1\n\nn=2: f(1)+f(0) = 1+1=2 → which contradicts the earlier calculation where f(2) = 1.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nBecause earlier analysis for the tiling problem said that f(2) = 1. But according to the recurrence derived from the sum, for n=2, the sum is f(2-1) = f(1) = 1. So that's correct. But how does that fit into the previous pattern where for n≥3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)?\n\nLet me try to find a general formula. Let me compute f(n) for several values:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n...\n\nLooking at this sequence, it's the Fibonacci sequence shifted by some indices. For example, Fibonacci numbers are:\n\nF(0) = 0\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nSo our sequence is:\n\nf(0) = 1 = F(2)\n\nf(1) = 1 = F(2)\n\nf(2) = 1 = F(2)\n\nf(3) = 2 = F(4)\n\nf(4) = 3 = F(5)\n\nf(5) = 5 = F(6)\n\nf(6) = 8 = F(7)\n\nWait, this seems to suggest that for n ≥ 1, f(n) = F(n+1), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0) = 0, F(1)=1, etc. Let's check:\n\nFor n=0: f(0) = 1, F(1) = 1 → yes.\n\nn=1: f(1) = 1 = F(2) = 1 → yes.\n\nn=2: f(2) = 1 = F(3) = 2? No. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait for n=3, f(3) = 2 = F(4) = 3? No. Not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but with different initial conditions. Let me think again.\n\nThe sequence for f(n) is:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n...\n\nThis looks like the Fibonacci sequence starting from index 2, but with f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, and then f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 3. So for n ≥ 3, the recurrence holds. For example:\n\nf(3) = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 → yes.\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 → yes.\n\nf(5) = 3 + 2 = 5 → yes.\n\nSo the recurrence for n ≥ 3 is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). And for n=2, it's 1.\n\nSo the initial conditions are f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1. And for n ≥ 3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the probability that a valid configuration of radio towers exists, we model it using dynamic programming based on tiling logic. The key insight is that each valid configuration corresponds to tiling the interval [1, n] using tiles of odd lengths, where each tile's center is a tower.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n- A valid configuration requires that:\n  - Towns `0` and `n+1` are not covered by any tower.\n  - Each town in `[1, n]` is covered by exactly one tower.\n  \n- This implies that the towns must be partitioned into non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower with an odd length (i.e., the number of towns covered by the tower is `2p - 1`, where `p` is the signal power).\n\n- This leads to a tiling problem: we need to count the number of ways to tile the interval `[1, n]` using tiles of odd lengths, where each tile is represented by a tower at its center.\n\n---\n\n### **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n\nLet `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns (positions `1` through `i`). We derive the recurrence:\n\n- For `i >= 3`, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`\n- Base cases:\n  - `dp[0] = 1` (empty interval)\n  - `dp[1] = 1`\n  - `dp[2] = 1`\n\nThis recurrence comes from the fact that the last tile can either be of length 1 (covering just position `i`) or of length 3 (covering positions `i-2`, `i-1`, and `i`), and so on, which simplifies to the Fibonacci recurrence starting from `dp[2]`.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation:**\n\nThe total number of possible configurations is `2^n`, since each of the `n` towns has a 50% chance of having a tower.\n\nThus, the required probability is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{dp}[n]}{2^n}\n$$\n\nWe compute this modulo `998244353`, using modular inverse to handle division.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code:**\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n_str = input().strip()\n    \n    n = int(n_str)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Precompute dp[i] for i up to n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n\n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power_of_two = pow(2, n, MOD)\n\n    # Compute modular inverse of power_of_two\n    inv_power = pow(power_of_two, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example:**\n\nFor `n = 2`, the number of valid configurations is `1`. The total number of possible configurations is `2^2 = 4`. So the probability is `1/4`, which modulo `998244353` is `748683265`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(n)** space, which is efficient for `n` up to `2 * 10^5`.",
