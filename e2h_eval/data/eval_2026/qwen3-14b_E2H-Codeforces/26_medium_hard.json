    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values that meet the constraints and count those where x + y > z. However, given that the maximum value of D is 5e5, a brute-force approach would be way too slow. We need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The variables are ordered such that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (since B ≤ y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, then x ≤ y ≤ z. So for each valid triplet (x, y, z), we need x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we efficiently count all such triplets?\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem into parts. For each possible x and y, find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Because z has to be at least C, but also less than x + y. But since z must be ≥ C, the valid z's are those in the range [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nWait, but z also needs to be ≥ y, because the original constraints say y ≤ C ≤ z. Wait no: the original constraints are that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So y can be as low as B, but since B ≤ C, y can be up to C. So for example, if B is equal to C, then y is between B and C (so exactly B). But z is between C and D. So for each x and y, the z must be between C and D, and also satisfy z < x + y. But since z must be ≥ C, the lower bound is C and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). However, if x + y - 1 is less than C, then there are no valid z's for that x and y.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], and each y in [B, C], compute the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x + y. Then sum all these counts.\n\nBut even this approach might be O(B * C) which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this efficiently. Let's consider that for each x and y, the valid z's are those between C and min(D, x + y - 1). So the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C.\n\nBut again, iterating over all x and y is O(B*C), which is not feasible for large B and C. So we need to find a way to calculate this sum without checking every possible x and y.\n\nLet me think about the ranges of x and y. Since x is between A and B, and y is between B and C. Let's denote that for a given x and y, the value of x + y can vary. Let's think about the possible values of x + y. For each x and y, the minimum x + y is A + B (since x ≥ A, y ≥ B) and the maximum is B + C (since x ≤ B, y ≤ C).\n\nSo for each possible sum s = x + y, we can find the number of pairs (x, y) that produce that sum. Then for each s, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) if s - 1 >= C. Then multiply that by the number of (x, y) pairs that give sum s and add to the total.\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute for all s in [A+B, B+C], the number of (x,y) pairs with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], and x + y = s. Then, for each s, compute the count of z's as described, and multiply by the number of pairs for that s, and sum all these products.\n\nThis approach could be efficient if we can compute the number of pairs (x, y) for each s quickly.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of pairs (x, y) that sum to s?\n\nLet me think about the ranges of x and y. x can be from A to B. y can be from B to C. So for a given s, the possible x and y must satisfy x + y = s, with x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C].\n\nLet me rephrase this: for each x in [A, B], y must be s - x. And y must be in [B, C]. So for each x, the corresponding y is s - x, and we have to check if it's within [B, C].\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the possible x must satisfy that y = s - x is in [B, C]. So:\n\nB ≤ s - x ≤ C → s - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nBut also, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo combining these two conditions:\n\nx must be in [max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe condition for y is B ≤ s - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\ns - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nBut x must also be in [A, B].\n\nTherefore, x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo the valid x values for a given s are those x that are in [max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)].\n\nBut for this interval to be valid, the lower bound must be ≤ upper bound. Otherwise, there are no x's for this s.\n\nSo the number of x's for a given s is max(0, upper - lower + 1), where upper = min(B, s - B), lower = max(A, s - C).\n\nSo for each s, the count of (x, y) pairs is the number of x's in that interval.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute for each possible s (from s_min = A + B to s_max = B + C), the count of x's as above, then multiply by the number of z's for that s.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe possible s ranges from s_min to s_max. Let's compute for each s in that range the count of (x, y) pairs, then compute the contribution to the total.\n\nBut how many s's are there? Well, s_max - s_min + 1 is up to (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1. Since A can be as small as 1 and C up to 5e5, this could be up to 5e5 steps. For each s, computing the count of x's is O(1), so overall this part is O( (C - A + 1) ) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have that, for each s, the number of z's is:\n\nif s - 1 < C → then no z's. Because z must be ≥ C, and z < s → z can be from C to s-1. If s-1 < C, then no such z exists.\n\nElse, the number of z's is min(D, s-1) - C + 1.\n\nSo for each s, the contribution to the total is count_pairs(s) * count_z(s).\n\nSo putting this all together, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute total = 0\n\nfor s in [s_min, s_max]:\n\n    compute lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n        continue\n\n    count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n    # Now compute count_z for this s\n\n    z_min = C\n\n    z_max_candidate = s - 1\n\n    if z_max_candidate < z_min:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        z_max = min(D, z_max_candidate)\n\n        count_z = z_max - z_min + 1\n\n    total += count_pairs * count_z\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, what about the case when s - 1 is larger than D? Then the count_z is D - C + 1.\n\nSo this seems manageable.\n\nNow, the next thing is to compute all possible s in the range s_min to s_max. But what's the possible range of s?\n\ns_min is A + B (since x is at least A and y is at least B).\n\ns_max is B + C (since x is at most B and y is at most C).\n\nSo the loop runs from s = A + B to s = B + C.\n\nBut how do we handle that?\n\nYes. So for each s in that range, we compute the count_pairs and count_z.\n\nBut what about when s is such that even the minimal z (C) is larger than s-1? For example, if s is small. For instance, if s is such that s-1 < C → then no z's. So in that case, the count_z is zero and contributes nothing.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output is 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5.\n\nSo s can be 3,4,5.\n\nLet's process each s:\n\ns=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) → 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) → 1.\n\ncount_pairs = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\nThen, for count_z:\n\nz_min is 3. z_max_candidate is 3-1=2. Which is less than z_min (3). So count_z is 0. So contribution is 1 * 0 = 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) → 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4 - 2) → min(2, 2) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs is 2-1+1=2.\n\ncount_z: z_max_candidate is 4-1=3. Which is >= C=3. So z_max is min(4,3)=3. count_z = 3-3 +1 = 1. So contribution is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5 - 3) → max(1, 2) → 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 5 - 2) → min(2, 3) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs is 2-2+1=1.\n\ncount_z: z_max_candidate is 5-1=4. Which is >=3. So z_max is min(4,4) =4. count_z is 4-3 +1=2. Contribution is 1*2=2.\n\nTotal is 0 + 2 + 2 =4. Which matches the sample. Great.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' output is 3.\n\nLet me check:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4. So s can be 3 and 4.\n\ns=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1,1) =1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2,1) → 1. count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z: z_max_candidate is 3-1=2. C is 2. So z_max is min(5, 2) =2. count_z is 2-2 +1=1. Contribution is 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4 - 2) = max(1,2) =2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) → 2. count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z: z_max_candidate is 4-1=3. So z ranges from 2 to 3. count_z is 3-2+1=2. Contribution 1*2=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000. Output is 1.\n\ns ranges from 500000 + 500000 = 1e6 to 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. So only s=1e6.\n\nlower_x is max(500000, 1e6 - 500000) → max(5e5, 5e5) →5e5.\n\nupper_x is min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) →5e5. So count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z: z_max_candidate is 1e6 -1 = 999999. C is 5e5. So z ranges from 5e5 to min(5e5, 999999) → 5e5. count_z is 5e5 -5e5 +1=1. So total is 1*1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n   upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n   if lower_x > upper_x: continue\n\n   count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n   z_max_candidate = s - 1\n\n   if z_max_candidate < C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       z_max = min(D, z_max_candidate)\n\n       count_z = z_max - C + 1\n\n   total += count_pairs * count_z\n\nreturn total.\n\nBut wait, in code, how do we loop s from s_min to s_max?\n\nIn Python, for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\nBut for large values, say s_max up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6, this loop would be 1e6 iterations. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut considering that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, then s_max can be up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop will run up to 1e6 times, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where C is larger than s -1. For example, when s is small. Like A=1, B=1, C=5, D=... Then s_min is 2, s_max is 1 + 5 = 6. For s=2, z_max_candidate is 1. Which is less than C=5. So no contribution.\n\nAnother case: when D is less than C. But according to the input constraints, C ≤ D. So no, D is always ≥ C.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is four integers on the first line. Wait, the example shows that the input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps that's just for the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input is the first line contains four integers A, B, C, D. So the code should read one line of input, split into four integers.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, perhaps the sample input shows three separate test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single line of input, which is four integers.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. The sample input shows multiple lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? Wait no, looking at the problem statement again, the sample input shows three test cases, but the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple lines for the purpose of showing different test cases. But in reality, the code should read one line of input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo the code should read a single line of input, which is four integers. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple examples, but the actual code is supposed to process one input line.\n\nBut looking at the sample outputs, the outputs are three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Maybe the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases, each on their own line. However, the problem statement is unclear here.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases, each line being a separate test case. However, the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines, which may be for multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input section says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample input is presented as three separate test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. But how many test cases are there? The problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line of input, and output one line of output. However, the sample input shows three lines, but the sample output shows three lines. Therefore, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem statement. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains four integers. However, perhaps that's a mistake, and the actual code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the problem says that the input consists of T test cases, but here it's not mentioned. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So maybe the sample input is wrong? Or perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple lines, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input shows three lines, and the output shows three lines. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input, the first example's input is \"1 2 3 4\" and output is 4. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one line of input. However, the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is four integers. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple lines, and the output shows multiple lines, I think the code should read multiple test cases, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), and then processing each line.\n\nBut the problem's original input description is ambiguous. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from input, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line of input, but the sample shows multiple lines. It's possible that the sample input is formatted as multiple lines for the purpose of showing multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows three different inputs and outputs. So the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as three lines, and the output is three lines, the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nSo, for the code, the approach is to read all lines from input, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, process as a test case.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line. However, given the sample input and output, I think it's better to process multiple lines.\n\nBut given that the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers, perhaps the code should read only one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's note, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input. So the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code will process each line of input, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print the answer for each.\n\nNow, let's proceed with writing the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from input, for each line:\n\nsplit into A, B, C, D.\n\nThen compute the answer as discussed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    total = 0\n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n        upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n        if lower_x > upper_x:\n            continue\n        count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n        z_max_candidate = s - 1\n        if z_max_candidate < C:\n            continue\n        z_max = min(D, z_max_candidate)\n        count_z = z_max - C + 1\n        total += count_pairs * count_z\n    print(total)\n\nBut wait, what if the line is empty? Probably not, but the code should handle that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is four integers. So each line is a valid input.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input line '1 2 3 4' → output is 4. Which works.\n\nSecond sample input line '1 2 2 5' → output is 3. Which works.\n\nThird sample input line '500000 500000 500000 500000' → output is 1. Which works.\n\nBut what about when B is larger than C? Wait, no, according to the input constraints, A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So B ≤ C. So the code can assume that.\n\nBut in the code, for the upper_x calculation, s - B could be larger than B? For example, if s is large. But since upper_x is min(B, s - B), that's okay.\n\nBut let's take an example where B is 2 and C is 3. So for s = 5, s - B is 5 - 2 = 3. upper_x is min(B=2, 3) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about when s - B is less than A?\n\nLike, say A=1, B=2, C=3. s=3. s - B is 3 - 2 = 1. lower_x is max(A=1, s - C = 3-3=0) → 1. upper_x is min(B=2, 1) → 1. So count_pairs is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when s is such that s - C is larger than B?\n\nFor example, A=1, B=2, C=5. s = 10. Then s - C = 5. upper_x is min(2, 10 - 2 = 8) → 2. lower_x is max(1, 5) → 5. So lower_x (5) > upper_x (2). So no contribution. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing for performance. For D up to 5e5, and s_max up to 1e6, the loop runs 1e6 times. Each iteration is O(1). So for Python, this should be acceptable for the time constraints. Let's see: 1e6 iterations in Python may take some time, but given that the constraints are up to 5e5, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut for the worst case, when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then s_min is 1 + 5e5 = 500001, s_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs 500000 times. Which is manageable.\n\nAnother case: when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. For each s in 500001 to 1e6.\n\nBut for each s, the lower_x is max(1, s - C) = max(1, s - 5e5). Since C is 5e5.\n\ns ranges from 500001 to 1e6.\n\ns - C ranges from 1 to 5e5.\n\nupper_x is min(B=5e5, s - B) = min(5e5, s - 5e5).\n\ns - B is s - 5e5. Since s ranges from 500001 to 1e6, s - B ranges from 1 to 5e5.\n\nSo upper_x is min(5e5, ...) which is s - B.\n\nlower_x is max(1, s - 5e5).\n\nSo for each s, lower_x = s - 5e5 (since s - 5e5 >= 1 for s >= 500001).\n\nupper_x = s - 5e5 (since s - B = s - 5e5, and B is 5e5, so upper_x is min(5e5, s - 5e5). But s can be up to 1e6, so s - 5e5 can be up to 5e5. So upper_x = s - 5e5.\n\nThus, lower_x = upper_x. So count_pairs is 1.\n\nThen for count_z:\n\nz_max_candidate = s - 1.\n\nC is 5e5. So if s - 1 >= 5e5 → which is true since s >= 500001 → s-1 >= 500000. So z_max_candidate is >= C.\n\nz_max is min(D=5e5, s-1). Since D is 5e5, z_max is 5e5.\n\ncount_z is 5e5 - 5e5 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus, for each s, the contribution is 1 * 1 = 1. How many s's are there?\n\ns ranges from 500001 to 1e6. That's 500000 values. So total is 500000. But what's the actual answer?\n\nBut in this case, x can be from 1 to B=5e5. y is from B=5e5 to C=5e5 (so y is 5e5). So x can be from 1 to 5e5, and y is fixed at 5e5. Then z must be between C=5e5 and D=5e5, and z < x + y = x + 5e5.\n\nSince z is 5e5, we need 5e5 < x + 5e5 → x > 0. Which is always true since x ≥ 1. So for each x in 1 to 5e5, there is exactly one z (5e5). So total is 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. Which matches the code's calculation. So the code is correct here.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code should be written in Python. However, for very large inputs, the code may be slow. Let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nBut for the given constraints, the code is O( (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 ) = O(C - A + 1) steps. Which is up to 5e5 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, which simplifies to checking $x + y > z$ for sorted sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we need to efficiently count valid triangles without iterating through all possible combinations due to potential large input sizes.\n2. **Range of Sums**: For each possible sum $s = x + y$, determine the valid range of $x$ and $y$ values that produce this sum.\n3. **Valid Z Values**: For each valid sum $s$, calculate how many valid $z$ values exist such that $C \\leq z \\leq D$ and $z < s$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.split())\n        total = 0\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            z_max_candidate = s - 1\n            if z_max_candidate < C:\n                continue\n            z_max = min(D, z_max_candidate)\n            count_z = z_max - C + 1\n            total += count_pairs * count_z\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each possible sum $s$ of $x$ and $y$, the valid range of $x$ values is determined based on the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B$ and $y \\leq C$.\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each valid sum $s$, the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs is calculated.\n4. **Valid Z Values**: For each valid sum $s$, the number of valid $z$ values is determined by ensuring $z$ lies within the range $[C, D]$ and satisfies $z < s$.\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by iterating over possible sums and using mathematical ranges to count valid values, avoiding brute-force iteration over all possible triplets.\n\nThis method ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently, adhering to the constraints and optimizing the solution using range calculations and mathematical insights.",
