Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides at a vertex. But here, the angle we're looking for is different. Because the problem says that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on its sides. So this is not the interior angle of the polygon. Instead, it's an angle formed by choosing two other vertices.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate this angle. For example, in a regular polygon, if I pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the middle one, then the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Since it's regular, all vertices lie on a circle. The central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees. \n\nNow, when considering the angle at v2, which is formed by connecting v2 to v1 and v3. Let me think about the positions. Suppose that between v2 and v1 there are k edges along the perimeter, and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would depend on the number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, perhaps the key is to find how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. \n\nAlternatively, think about the arc between v1 and v3. Since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends on the arc length between v1 and v3. Let me recall that in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that of an angle subtended at the circumference. \n\nSo, suppose that the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) has k steps (each step is one edge of the polygon). Then the central angle for that arc is k * (360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle would be half that. But wait, how does that relate to the angle at v2?\n\nWait, if v2 is a point on the circumference, then the angle between two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Or is it the other way around? Let me think again. \n\nIn a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. So if I have points A, B, C on the circumference, then angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, no. Wait, angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. The arc that is opposite to this angle is the arc AC that does not pass through B. So the measure of angle ABC is half of that arc's measure.\n\nSo, in our case, the angle at v2 (which is the vertex of the angle) is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let me think: For example, in a regular polygon, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them (without going through v2) is (n-2) steps. Wait, no. Let's take a square. Let's say the vertices are labeled 1,2,3,4 clockwise. If v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be 1 and v3 could be 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't pass through v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4, which is 2 steps. The central angle is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The inscribed angle would be half that, 90 degrees. Which is exactly the angle between the sides of the square. So in that case, the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. Which matches the example given in the note where for n=4, the possible angles are 45 or 90 degrees. Wait, but in the example, when they choose 2 1 3, the angle is at vertex 1. Let me check that example.\n\nIn the second example input, n=4, a=67. The output is 2 1 3. So the angle is at vertex 1. The vertices are 2, 1, 3. So the angle is between points 2 and 3, with vertex at 1. Let's compute the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't pass through 1. Well, the arc between 2 and 3 is just one edge. But the arc that does not pass through 1 would be the longer path. Wait, no. Wait, the arc that is opposite to the angle. So for angle at vertex 1, between points 2 and 3. The arc between 2 and 3 that does not include vertex 1. Since the polygon is a square, the arc between 2 and 3 can be either one edge (length 1) or three edges (length 3). Which one is the one that's considered for the inscribed angle?\n\nThe angle at vertex 1 between 2 and 3. So the arc that is opposite to this angle would be the arc between 2 and 3 that does not pass through 1. Since the polygon is convex and regular, that arc would be the longer arc. For a square, the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't pass through 1 is the arc from 2 to 3 through 4 and 1? No, wait, the arc that doesn't pass through 1. Wait, if the angle is at 1, then the arc between 2 and 3 that does not contain 1 is the arc that goes from 2 to 3 via the other side of the square. Wait, but in a square, the arc between 2 and 3 is just one edge. The arc that doesn't contain 1 is that same edge. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The angle at vertex v2 is formed by two lines: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The arc that is subtended by this angle is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2. So, for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then that arc is the rest of the polygon. Let me take the square example again. Suppose v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 3. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 via 4. That's two edges. The central angle is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees, so the inscribed angle is 90 degrees. Which is correct, since the angle at 2 between 1 and 3 is 90 degrees. But in the square, the interior angle is 90 degrees. So that's the same as the angle here.\n\nBut in the example where the output is 2 1 3, the angle is at vertex 1. So v1 is 2, v2 is 1, v3 is 3. So the angle is between 2 and 3, with vertex at 1. What's the arc between 2 and 3 that does not contain 1? Well, the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't contain 1 is the arc that goes from 2 to 3 through 4. That's one edge. The central angle is 360/4 = 90 degrees. So the inscribed angle is half of that, 45 degrees. Which matches the note's explanation that the angle is 45 degrees. So that's the correct calculation.\n\nSo, the formula for the angle at v2 is (k * (180 / n)) degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Because the arc's central angle is (k * (360/n)), and the inscribed angle is half of that. So the angle at v2 is (k * (360/(n*2))) = k * (180/n). \n\nBut how do we find k? Let's think. For a given triplet v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is opposite to the angle. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is k. How to compute k?\n\nIn a regular n-gon, the number of steps between two vertices along the perimeter can be calculated as the minimal distance, but here we need the longer arc. Wait, no. Because the arc that does not contain v2. So for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 is the rest of the polygon. So the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - 2) steps. Because between v1 and v3, going the other way around the polygon, skipping v2.\n\nBut how to compute this k for any given v1 and v3, given that v2 is between them?\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, if we pick two other vertices v1 and v3 such that when you move clockwise from v1 to v2, then from v2 to v3, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is the arc that goes the other way around the polygon. The number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - (steps between v1 and v3 via v2)). \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for a given v2, the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in a certain way. Let me think of the positions as arranged in a circle. Let's fix v2 as a point. Then, the angle depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2. \n\nSuppose that between v2 and v1, there are i steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are j steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are arranged in order. However, for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3. \n\nAlternatively, think about the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's call that number of edges k. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nBut how to find k? For example, in the square example where the angle is 45 degrees, the arc between v1 and v3 (which are 2 and 3) that does not contain v2 (which is 1) is one edge. So k=1. Then the angle is (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if v2 is vertex 1, and v1 is 2, v3 is 4. Then the arc between 2 and 4 that does not contain 1 is the arc going through 3. That's one edge (from 2 to 3 to 4?), no. Wait, between 2 and 4, the arc that doesn't contain 1 is the arc that goes from 2 to 3 to 4. That's two edges. So k=2. Then the angle would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is the interior angle of the square. So if you take v1=2, v2=1, v3=4, then the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. Which makes sense.\n\nSo, the key is that for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's denote that number of steps as k. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nBut how to find k for any possible triplet?\n\nLet me think: For a given v2, if I select v1 and v3 such that they are m steps away from v2 in opposite directions. Wait, perhaps for a given v2, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is (n - m), where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. \n\nAlternatively, for any two points v1 and v3, the arc between them can be measured in two ways. The shorter arc and the longer arc. But since the polygon is convex and regular, the angle is determined by the arc that does not contain v2. So, given that v2 is between v1 and v3 along one arc, the other arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. \n\nSo, for a given v2, if I pick v1 and v3 such that they are on opposite sides of v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is the longer arc. But how to compute k for that?\n\nLet me consider that for a given v2, the positions of v1 and v3 can be thought of as being in the clockwise direction. Suppose that between v2 and v1 there are i steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are j steps clockwise. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is i + j steps. The arc that does not contain v2 would be n - (i + j) steps. Therefore, k = n - (i + j). \n\nBut then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. Which is ((n - (i + j)) * 180)/n. \n\nBut since the angle is formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that they are not adjacent. Wait, no. For example, in the square example, if v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 3. Then i is 1 (steps from 2 to 1 clockwise?), or maybe I need to think about the positions more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given v2, the angle depends only on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in one direction. For example, if you fix v2, then the angle depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when you go around the polygon in one direction. \n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think about the possible values of the angle. For a regular n-gon, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex are determined by the number of steps between the two other points. For example, if I fix v2, then for any two points v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them along the arc that does not contain v2, the angle is (k * 180)/n. \n\nBut how to find the possible k values. Since the arc that doesn't contain v2 must be at least 2 steps (since v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and each other). Wait, no. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is adjacent to v2 but on the other side. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is (n-2) steps. For example, in a square, n=4. So the arc is 4-2=2 steps, which gives angle 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other? For example, in a pentagon, suppose v2 is some vertex, and v1 and v3 are adjacent. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (n - 2) steps? Or depends on their positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for any valid triplet (v1, v2, v3), the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k, and k can be from 2 to n-2. Because for the angle to be formed, v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and each other. \n\nWait, but in the square example, when v1 and v3 are adjacent, the arc that does not contain v2 is 1 step. For example, if v2 is 1, and v1 is 2, v3 is 3. Then the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't contain 1 is one step. So k=1, which gives angle 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo the possible k values are from 1 to n-2. Because when k=1, the angle is 180/n degrees. When k=n-2, the angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. \n\nBut how to find for a given a, the best k that minimizes the absolute difference between (k * 180)/n and a. Once we find the optimal k, then we can find any triplet that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the integer k (between 1 and n-2) such that |(k * 180)/n - a| is minimized. Then, construct a triplet (v1, v2, v3) that corresponds to that k.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we can choose any triplet that corresponds to that k. For example, for a given k, we can choose v2 as any vertex, and then choose v1 and v3 such that they are k steps apart along the arc not containing v2. Wait, no. Wait, for a given k, the angle is (k * 180)/n. So for any triplet where the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k steps, that angle will be the same.\n\nTherefore, once we find the optimal k, we can choose any v2, and then select v1 and v3 such that they are k steps apart along the arc that doesn't contain v2. \n\nBut how to find the optimal k? Let's think about the formula:\n\nangle = (k * 180)/n \n\nWe need to find k in [1, n-2] such that this is as close as possible to a.\n\nBut how to compute k. Let's rearrange the equation:\n\nWe want to find k such that (k * 180)/n is as close as possible to a. So solving for k:\n\nk ≈ (a * n)/180 \n\nBut since k must be integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute this value and check the nearest integers. \n\nFor example, let's take the sample input where n=4 and a=67. Then:\n\nk ≈ (67 *4)/180 = 268 / 180 ≈ 1.488. So the closest integer is 1. So angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which is what the sample shows. \n\nIn the third sample input, n=4 and a=68. Then (68 *4)/180 = 272/180 ≈ 1.511. So the closest integer is 2. Then angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees, which is what the sample shows. \n\nSo the approach is: compute k_candidate = round( (a * n) / 180 ), then check the floor and ceiling of that value, and find which gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut also, we need to make sure that k_candidate is within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n-2. So after computing the candidate, we need to clamp it to that range.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, then we can construct any triplet that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo now the problem becomes two parts:\n\n1. Find the optimal k.\n2. Generate a triplet (v1, v2, v3) that corresponds to that k.\n\nLet's tackle part 1 first.\n\nTo find the optimal k:\n\nCompute the ideal k as (a * n) / 180. Since k must be an integer, we can check floor(k_ideal), ceil(k_ideal), and maybe k_ideal itself if it is integer. Then among these candidates, select the one that gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut since k must be in [1, n-2], we need to check the candidates and clamp them into the valid range.\n\nFor example, if the ideal k is 0.5, then the candidates are 0 and 1, but since k must be ≥1, we take 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the ideal k is n-1.5, then the candidates are n-1 and n-2 (but n-1 is outside the allowed range, so we take n-2).\n\nOnce we find the best k, we can proceed to generate the triplet.\n\nNow, part 2: generating the triplet.\n\nOnce we have k, how do we choose v1, v2, v3?\n\nLet's pick v2 as vertex 1 (arbitrary choice, since the polygon is regular and symmetric). Then, we need to find v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that does not contain v2 is k steps.\n\nBut how to choose v1 and v3? Let me think: For v2=1, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps. So, for example, if k=1, then the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 step. Which would mean that v1 and v3 are adjacent. But since the arc does not contain v2 (vertex 1), then v1 and v3 must be on the other side of the polygon. For example, in a square (n=4), if v2 is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. That would be vertices 2 and 3. Because the arc between 2 and 3 that doesn't contain 1 is one step. So the triplet would be 2, 1, 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output for the second case.\n\nSo the general approach for generating the triplet is:\n\nPick v2 as 1 (for simplicity). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. Which means that the number of steps between v1 and v3 via v2 is (n - k) steps. \n\nBut how to find v1 and v3?\n\nLet me think: For v2 = 1, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. So, if I choose v1 as 2 (the next vertex clockwise from v2), then v3 would be (v1 + (n - k - 1)) steps away from v1 in the clockwise direction. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. That implies that moving from v1 to v3 clockwise passes through v2. \n\nSo for example, if v2 is 1, and the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps, then the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that when you go from v1 to v3 clockwise, you pass through v2. \n\nLet me think of v1 as being one step before v2 (i.e., vertex n, if v2 is 1). Then, moving clockwise from v1 (n) to v3, passing through v2 (1), and taking (n -k) steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to set v2 as 1, and then set v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + (n -k - 1) mod n? Not sure. Let me think for the example where n=4, k=1. Then n -k = 3 steps. So the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. If v1 is 2, then moving 3 steps clockwise from 2 would be 2 → 3 → 4 → 1. So v3 is 1. But that's v2, which is invalid. Hmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find two vertices v1 and v3 such that the number of steps between them along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So the total steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k) steps. Which would imply that the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps.\n\nSo for example, if v2 is 1, then to find v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. Let me choose v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + (n -k) steps clockwise. But since the arc that contains v2 must be (n -k) steps. Let me take n=4, k=1. Then n -k = 3 steps. So starting at v1=2, moving 3 steps clockwise would reach 2+3=5 mod 4 = 1. Which is v2. But that's not allowed. So v3 can't be v2. So perhaps I need to adjust the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps, which implies that the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k) steps. Therefore, the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that they are separated by (n -k) steps along that arc. Which would require that (n -k) ≥ 2 steps, because v1 and v3 must be distinct. Wait, but for k=1, n-k is 3 steps. Which is allowed. So in this case, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. So for example, if v1 is 2 and v3 is 4. Then the steps from 2 to 4 via v2 (1) is 2 steps (2→1→4?), no. Wait, in a square, the steps from 2 to 4 clockwise is 2 steps (2→3→4). But if the arc that contains v2 (1) is 3 steps, then the path must go through 1. So for example, from 2 to 4 via 1 would be 2 steps (2→1→4?), but that's only 2 steps. Not 3. So I'm confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. Which would mean that the number of edges between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k). So for example, if n=4, k=1, then (n -k) is 3. So the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 must be 3 edges. For example, if v1 is 2 and v3 is 3. The arc from 2 to 3 via v2 (1) would be 2 steps (2→1→3). Which is not 3. So this seems conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps my earlier assumption about the relationship between k and the arc is wrong. Let me re-examine the formula.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the angle is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But perhaps that formula is incorrect. Let me rederive it.\n\nThe central angle for the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (k * 360/n) degrees. The inscribed angle at v2 is half of that, which is (k * 180)/n degrees. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the square example where the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is 1 step (k=1), the angle is 1 * 180 /4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for a given k, the angle is fixed. Now, the question is how to choose v1, v2, v3 for that k.\n\nLet me think of choosing v2 as 1. Then, to have the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 be k steps. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. \n\nBut how to find such v1 and v3. Let's imagine that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k). Which implies that the positions of v1 and v3 are separated by (n -k) steps along that arc. So, for example, if I choose v1 as 2, then v3 would be (2 + (n -k) - 1) mod n ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the arc that contains v2. For example, if v2 is 1, then the arc that contains v2 between v1 and v3 must pass through 1. So, if v1 is 2, then moving clockwise, the arc from 2 to v3 passing through 1 must have (n -k) steps. Let me think for n=4, k=1. Then (n -k) = 3 steps. So the arc from v1 (2) to v3 passing through 1 must be 3 steps. Starting at 2, moving clockwise:\n\nstep 1: 2 → 3\n\nstep 2: 3 →4\n\nstep 3: 4 →1\n\nSo after 3 steps, we reach 1. So v3 is 1. But that's v2, which is not allowed. So this suggests that this approach isn't working. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, because the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k). But since the arc contains v2, which is 1, then v1 and v3 must be on opposite sides of v2. So, for example, if v1 is on one side of v2, and v3 is on the other side. So, the arc between them that contains v2 would have steps that include v2. \n\nLet me think of another approach. For a given k, to find v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that does not contain v2 is k steps. So, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 and v3 are located such that when you go from v1 to v3 along the arc that does not include 1, you have k steps. \n\nLet me imagine that v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k steps clockwise. But that would be the arc that does not include v2 (1) only if k steps is the arc that doesn't pass through 1. \n\nFor example, in n=4, k=1. v1 is 2, v3 is 2 +1 = 3. The arc between 2 and 3 that does not include 1 is one step (from 2 to 3). Which is correct. So the angle at v2 (1) would be 1*180/4=45 degrees. Which is correct. So this seems to work. \n\nSo the approach is: choose v2 as 1, then choose v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 +k. But since the polygon is circular, we need to mod by n. \n\nBut wait, what if 2 +k exceeds n? For example, if n=5, k=3, then 2+3=5, which is valid. If k=4, then 2+4=6 mod 5 is 1, which is v2. Not allowed. So we need to ensure that v3 is not equal to v2.\n\nSo for this approach, the steps are:\n\nSet v2 = 1.\n\nSet v1 = 2.\n\nSet v3 = (v1 + k) mod n. But if this is 0, then it's n. However, if v3 equals v2 (1), then this is invalid. How can that happen?\n\nLet me see: v1 is 2. v3 = 2 +k. If 2 +k = 1 mod n → k = (1 -2) mod n → k = (n-1) mod n. But since k ranges from 1 to n-2, then for n ≥3, n-1 is larger than n-2. So for k up to n-2, 2 +k can't be 1 mod n. Because for example, n=4, k=2. 2+2=4 mod 4 is 0 → 4. Which is allowed. \n\nSo in general, for v2=1, v1=2, and v3=2 +k. But since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, we need to make sure that v3 is in the range 1..n. So:\n\nv3 = (2 + k -1) % n + 1 ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of numbers as 1-based. So adding k steps from v1 (2) would take us to 2 +k. However, if 2 +k exceeds n, we wrap around. For example, if n=5, k=3. 2+3=5, which is valid. If k=4, 2+4=6 → 6 mod 5 = 1. Which is v2. Which is invalid. But since k is up to n-2, for n ≥3, when k is n-2, then 2 + (n-2) = n. Which is valid. So for k in 1 ≤k ≤n-2, v3 is 2 +k if it's ≤n, else wrap around. \n\nBut since 2 +k can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So it's always valid. So v3 = 2 +k. \n\nWait, for example, n=5, k=3: 2+3=5. Valid. For n=5, k=4 would be 2+4=6, but since k can't be 4 (since n-2=3), it's not allowed. So for k in 1..n-2, v3 = 2 +k is in the range 3..n. Which is valid. \n\nSo in this case, the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 +k. \n\nBut what if k=1? Then v3 is 3. So the triplet is 2 1 3, which matches the sample input. \n\nAnother example: for n=4, k=1, triplet is 2 1 3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: for n=4, k=2, then v3 = 2 +2=4. So triplet is 2 1 4. The arc between 2 and 4 that does not contain 1 is 2 steps (2→3→4), which is k=2. The angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct. \n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the triplet can be constructed as follows:\n\nv2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 2 +k. \n\nBut what if the optimal k is not in the range 1 to n-2? Well, earlier steps ensure that k is in that range. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Compute the ideal k as (a * n) / 180.0.\n\n- Check the floor and ceiling of this value, and possibly the integer value if it is exact.\n\n- For each candidate k in {floor(k_ideal), ceil(k_ideal), k_ideal if integer}, check if it's within 1 ≤k ≤n-2. If not, clamp it to the nearest valid value.\n\n- Among all these candidates, find the one that gives the minimal |(k * 180)/n - a|.\n\nOnce the optimal k is found, output the triplet (2, 1, 2 +k).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple optimal k's? For example, if two different k's give the same minimal difference. In that case, any of them can be chosen.\n\nSo, for example, if a is exactly halfway between two possible angles, we can choose either.\n\nOnce the optimal",

The solution involves calculating the optimal angle based on the geometry of the polygon and then constructing the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between these vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex where the angle is formed. This angle can be calculated using the formula derived from the properties of inscribed angles in a circle.\n2. **Optimal k Calculation**: The optimal number of steps `k` between the vertices (along the arc not containing the vertex where the angle is formed) is determined by minimizing the absolute difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`.\n3. **Constructing the Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is found, we construct the vertices such that the angle at vertex 1 is formed by vertices 2 and 2 + k (adjusted for circular indexing).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k value\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    candidates = set()\n    # Check floor, ceil, and the integer part if it's exact\n    for k_candidate in [int(ideal_k), int(ideal_k) + 1, int(ideal_k) - 1]:\n        candidates.add(k_candidate)\n    \n    # Also check the boundaries\n    min_k = 1\n    max_k = n - 2\n    candidates.add(min_k)\n    candidates.add(max_k)\n    \n    best_k = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    for k in candidates:\n        if k < min_k or k > max_k:\n            continue\n        current_angle = (k * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smallest k to ensure consistency\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, generate the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 -= n\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Ideal k Calculation**: The ideal value of `k` is calculated based on the formula derived from the geometric properties of the regular polygon.\n3. **Candidate k Values**: We consider several candidate values for `k` around the ideal value, including the floor, ceiling, and nearby integers, ensuring they are within valid bounds.\n4. **Finding the Best k**: Among the candidate values, we determine the `k` that results in the angle closest to `a`.\n5. **Constructing the Vertices**: Using the optimal `k`, we construct the vertices such that the angle at vertex 1 is formed by vertices 2 and 2 + k, adjusted for circular indexing.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the optimal vertices by leveraging geometric properties and ensures the solution is both correct and efficient.",
