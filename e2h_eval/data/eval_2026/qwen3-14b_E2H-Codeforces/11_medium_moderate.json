A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the input parameters. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs those things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Total lime slices needed is n (since each friend needs one slice). And total salt needed is n * np.\n\nBut the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if the division isn't exact, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So possible toasts from limes is total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the note.\n\nLimes: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80//3 is 26.666... floor 26? But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, what's the calculation here?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, because each toast requires n slices. For the first example, n is 3. So for each toast, 3 slices. So total slices needed for t toasts is 3*t. The total available is 80. So t can be up to 80//3 = 26.666, so 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, what's the note saying?\n\nIn the note, the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, maybe I have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. Therefore, for one toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So total slices available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the first example, c is 10, d is 8. So 10*8=80 slices. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. So the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's not matching. Wait why does the note say that?\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 80 toasts\". But according to my calculation, it's 80//3 = 26. But according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Wait, that suggests that the note's calculation is different. Wait what's going on here.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why 20 /3? Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per friend? Wait, the drink per toast is n * nl. For the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2. But the note says 20 /3 = 6. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait this is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3*3 = 9 ml. The total drink is 4*5=20. So 20//9 is 2. So the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. So why is the note saying that?\n\nWait looking at the note:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait this is confusing. According to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. But why? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, so for one toast, 3 friends * 3ml = 9ml. So 20ml would allow 2 toasts (2*9=18), with 2ml left. But according to the note, it's 20/3=6. So that suggests that perhaps the note is considering per toast per friend, but not multiplying by n. So perhaps the problem statement is different than what I thought.\n\nWait maybe I got the problem statement wrong. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. But according to the note, the drink is 20ml, and they say it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. Which would be nl per toast, not multiplied by n. So perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl ml per friend. But for one toast, the total is nl ml per friend, so total for all friends is n * nl. But the note says that for the first example, the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would suggest that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be nl per toast, not multiplied by n. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait this is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. But the note says that in the first sample, the drink is 20ml, and it's enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would mean that per toast, the total is nl, not multiplied by n. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the note.\n\nIn the first sample input, the parameters are:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is 4*5=20ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3ml = 9ml. So 20ml would allow 2 toasts (2*9=18ml). But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the per toast is 3ml total. Which would be nl per toast, not multiplied by n. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for each toast, the total drink is n * nl. But the note says that in the first sample, the drink is 20ml, which is divided by 3 (nl) to get 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is nl, not multiplied by n. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So perhaps the question is, how many toasts can they make, such that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So for example, if they make t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each requiring nl ml.\n\nBut the total drink available is k*l. So the maximum t is such that n * t * nl <= k*l. So solving for t: t <= (k*l) / (n * nl). So t is the floor of that value.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend has t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. Which must be <= c*d. So t <= (c*d) / n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * np grams. Total is n * t * np. Which must be <= p. So t <= p/(n * np).\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np).\n\nBut in the first example, according to that formula:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3 *3=9. 20//9 = 2. \n\nc*d=10*8=80. 80//3=26. \n\np=100. n*np=3*1=3. 100//3=33. \n\nThe minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the note is considering t * nl <= total drink. Which would be t <= (k*l)/nl. But that would be if the total drink per toast is nl, not multiplied by n. \n\nSo why is the note's explanation different?\n\nLooking back at the note's explanation:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, according to the note, they calculate the drink as 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Then divide by 3 friends to get 2. Which suggests that they computed the maximum number of toasts possible if each friend could have any number, but then divided by the number of friends. But that's not correct. \n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, the correct approach is to calculate for each resource how many toasts can be made, considering that each toast requires all friends to have their share. So the note's explanation is incorrect? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note's explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that they calculated for each resource the maximum possible toasts if each friend could have that amount, and then divided by the number of friends. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, the drink allows for 2 toasts. How does the note arrive at 6?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts that can be made, not per friend. For example, if each toast requires that each friend has their own drink, etc. So for example, if you have 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml per friend, then for each toast, you need 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So for 2 toasts, you need 18 ml. But the note says that the drink allows for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml total. Which would be for one friend. But there are 3 friends. So this is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input first line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' which gives output 2. According to the correct approach, the answer is 2, which matches the sample. But according to the note's explanation, they compute min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which gives the same answer. So how is 6 derived?\n\nIn the note's explanation, the drink is 20ml. They say it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. How is that possible? Well, if each toast requires 3ml of drink. Then 20ml would allow 6 toasts. But how does that relate to the problem?\n\nIf the problem is that each toast requires nl ml for all friends combined, then for the first example, each toast requires 3ml total. Then for 6 toasts, you need 18ml, which is under 20. But then why would that be the case?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl ml. So for a toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. \n\nBut in the note's explanation, they seem to be dividing the total drink by nl, not by n * nl. Which would be the case if the problem was that each toast requires nl ml for all friends combined. So perhaps the problem statement is written incorrectly, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the note's explanation is wrong. But that's not possible. So I need to reconcile this.\n\nLet me think again. The sample input's output is 2. According to the note's explanation, the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So the note's calculation of 6 comes from 20 /3 =6. Which implies that the drink is being divided by nl, not by n * nl. So perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and each friend can make t toasts. So for the total drink, it's t * nl * n. Which is the same as before. But the note's explanation seems to think that the drink is divided by nl to get the total number of toasts possible, then divided by n friends. Which would be the same as (total_drink / nl) /n = total_drink/(n * nl), which is the same as before. So in the first example, total_drink is 20, nl is 3. 20/3 is 6.666, floor is 6. Then divided by n=3, gives 2. Which is the same as min( (20/(3*3)), ... ). So the note's explanation is perhaps a way to explain the same thing. \n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts, but since there are 3 friends, each can make 6/3=2 toasts. Which is the same as calculating (total_drink / (n * nl)) = 20/(3*3) = 2.222, floor to 2. \n\nSo the note's explanation is perhaps a bit misleading, but the actual calculation is that for each resource, you calculate the maximum number of toasts possible, which is (total_resource) divided by the amount needed per toast. And then take the minimum of those numbers. \n\nSo for the drink, the amount needed per toast is n * nl. For the limes, it's n slices per toast. For salt, it's n * np per toast. \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total amount of each resource:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nlime_slices_total = c * d\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nThen:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nmax_toasts_lime = lime_slices_total // n \n\nmax_toasts_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min( max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt )\n\nSo in the first example:\n\ndrink_total = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\nlime_slices_total = 10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_total = 100. n * np =3*1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Which is correct.\n\nIn the note's explanation, they said that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which is (drink_total / nl) = 20/3 =6.666. But then divided by n=3 friends, giving 2. Which is the same as (20// (3 *3 )) = 2. So the note's approach is equivalent to the correct approach. \n\nSo the code needs to compute these three values and take their minimum.\n\nSo the plan for the code is:\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nmax_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min( max_drink, max_lime, max_salt )\n\nPrint result.\n\nNow, let's check the other sample inputs.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nSo the input is n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 100 *10 = 1000.\n\nn * nl = 5 *4=20. 1000//20 = 50.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 1 *19 =19. 19//5 =3 (since 5*3=15, 19-15=4).\n\nsalt_total =90. n * np =5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nso min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird example input:\n\n['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink total is 1e6.\n\nnl=50. n * nl = 10*50=500. 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nlime slices: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. divided by n=10 → 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1. n * np=10 *1=10. 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) → 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as integers. The input is given as a single line, with 8 integers. For example, the first sample input line is \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\".\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nmax_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nmax_lime = lime_total // n \n\nmax_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min( max_drink, max_lime, max_salt )\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to make sure that division is integer division, which in Python is done with // operator.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nBut what if any of the denominators are zero? No, since the problem states that all input numbers are positive integers. So n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np are all >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line, split into 8 integers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe input is given as the first and only line contains the integers. Wait, the sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is a single line. The sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should process a single line of input. For example, the sample input shows three examples, but each is a separate test case. However, the code should read one line from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo in the code, we read one line, split into 8 integers.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the Python code is:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nmax_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nmax_lime = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nmax_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nInput line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\ndrink_total =4*5=20. n * nl =3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\nlime_total=10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_total=100. n * np=3*1=3. 100//3=33. min(2,26,33)=2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input line '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3':\n\ndrink_total = 100*10=1000. 5*4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\nlime_total =1*19=19. 19//5=3.\n\nsalt_total=90. 5*3=15. 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input line: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\ndrink_total=1000*1000=1,000,000. n * nl=10*50=500. 1e6//500=2000.\n\nlime_total=25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt_total=1. n * np=10*1=10. 1//10=0. min(2000, 57, 0) is 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt.
