A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate how much of each resource is available, then determine how many toasts can be made, considering all constraints.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\nFor the drink: total available is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml (since each of the n friends needs nl per toast). Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has a toast. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum t based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total amount of drink is k * l. Each toast requires for all friends: n * nl. Because for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So the maximum t possible from drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). But total_drink is k * l. So yes.\n\nThen for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Because each friend needs a slice. So total slices needed for t toasts is t * n. How many slices do we have? c limes, each cut into d slices. So total slices is c * d. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So total per toast is n * np. So total for t toasts is t * n * np. The available salt is p grams. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nOnce I have these three values (drink_t, lime_t, salt_t), the answer is the minimum of those three. Because all three constraints must be satisfied. Then, the answer is min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t).\n\nWait, but in the example given, the first input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Let's compute each component.\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml (since n=3, nl=3). So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's explanation. Then limes: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (n=3). 80 /3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait wait, the example says that for the first input, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nAh, because the example says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, per toast, n slices are needed. So for 1 toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, looking back at the note. The note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check that. The note says:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, why? Because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, there are n slices needed. So for 1 toast, n slices. So the total number of toasts possible is (c*d) / n. So in the first example, c=10, d=8, n=3. So 10*8 = 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 / 3 = 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait, but why is the limes value 80? Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n*t slices. So the total available is c*d slices. So t_max is (c*d) // n. But in the first example, c*d is 10*8=80. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's not matching. So clearly, I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the note again. The note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts. But according to the logic, that would be the case if each toast requires one slice. So for 80 toasts, you need 80 slices. But with 80 slices, that's exactly one per toast. So why is that the case?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh right! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the per toast requirements. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for each toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). \n\nBut according to the note, in the first example, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be (c*d) = 80. So if the required per toast is 1 slice, then 80 toasts would require 80 slices. Which is exactly the available amount. So that would imply that per toast, each friend needs one slice. But that would mean that per toast, the number of slices needed is 1, not n. Which contradicts the previous understanding.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Let me re-express the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n friends, so n slices. For example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So for t toasts, 3*t slices. \n\nBut in the note, the first example has 10*8=80 slices. The note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that 80 toasts require 80 slices. Which would imply that per toast, only one slice is needed. So where is the confusion here?\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from the drink. Let's check that. The drink is 4 *5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222, which floor to 2. So that's the 6? No, wait the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nWait, the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, that's 20 divided by 3 equals 6.666...? Wait 20 / 3 is about 6.666, but why is it 6 toasts? Because that's the integer division. But that seems to contradict the earlier logic. Because according to the previous reasoning, the drink is sufficient for (k*l) / (n * nl) toasts. Let's compute that for the first example:\n\nk=4, l=5 → 20 ml. n=3, nl=3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, so total per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222... which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. That's a contradiction. So clearly, I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, this is very confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, in the first example, the total drink is 20 ml. The note says it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl (3 ml) per friend, but for one toast, only one friend? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which implies that the 6 is the drink limit, then divided by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. So that suggests that the initial calculation is (total drink) / (nl) = 20 / 3 = 6.666, which is 6, then divided by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. But that seems to indicate that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend has t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. But the note's explanation seems to be that the total drink is 20 ml, and that allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink is divided by (nl) per toast, but that would be per friend. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But 6 toasts would require 6 * n * nl = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. Which is way more than 20. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, perhaps the note is incorrect? No, that's unlikely. Let me re-examine the note. \n\nThe note says: \n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, this is very strange. How can 20ml be enough for 6 toasts? Let me think. If each toast requires 3ml of drink per friend, but each friend makes one toast. Wait, but that would be per toast per friend. So for example, if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the total drink is 20ml, which allows for 6 toasts. So 20 = 6 * nl * n? Or 20 = t * nl * n ?\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. In the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So for t toasts, total drink is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. 9t <= 20. So t can be 2 (9*2=18 ≤ 20), 3 would be 27>20. So maximum t is 2. But according to the note, it's 6. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the note's explanation is wrong, but that's unlikely. So where's the error here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend has t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So that would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But that would imply that the total drink is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t ≤ 20. For t=2, 9*2=18 ≤ 20. For t=6, 9*6=54>20. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, but in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the note is saying that the total drink is enough for 6 toasts per friend? No, that can't be. Because the answer is 2, which is the number of toasts per friend. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is saying that the drink can support 6 toasts in total, not per friend. But then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which would be dividing by the number of friends. That suggests that the 6 is the total number of toasts that can be made, and then each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. \n\nAh! Oh! Oh right! I think I messed up the problem. The problem says that each friend must make the same number of toasts. So the total number of toasts is t multiplied by the number of friends. Or wait, no. Wait, no. Each toast is made by all friends. Like, each toast is a round where everyone drinks. So for example, if they make 2 toasts, each friend makes 2 toasts. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend participates in t toasts. \n\nSo for the drink: each toast requires n * nl ml. For t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would suggest that the total drink is 20ml, and 3 ml per toast. So that would be 20 / 3 = 6.666 toasts. So that would be 6 toasts. But that would imply that per toast, the drink required is 3ml. Which would be nl per toast. But that would imply that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. But that would be for one toast, n * nl ml. \n\nWait, no. If the total drink is 20ml, and each toast requires 3ml (per friend?), then for t toasts, each friend has t * 3ml. Total drink is n * t * 3ml. \n\nSo for 20ml, n * t * 3 ≤ 20. With n=3, that would be 3t*3 =9t ≤20 → t=2. \n\nBut according to the note, they have 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. Then 9 * 6 = 54 > 20. So that can't be. \n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the 6 is the total number of toasts that can be made, and then divided by number of friends to get per person. So that would mean that the drink allows for 6 toasts total, which would be t=6. Then each friend makes 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. \n\nBut that would require that the drink is sufficient for 6 toasts. How?\n\nIf the total drink is 20ml, and the per toast requires (n * nl) = 3 *3 =9 ml. Then 6 toasts would need 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that's impossible. \n\nSo this is very confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the note. Or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend drinks t * nl ml. Total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That would be if the total drink is 20ml and the per toast per friend is 3ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * 3 ml. So total is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t <= 20 → t=2. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. So this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. Let me check the example input and output again. \n\nFirst input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' → output is 2. \n\nLet me compute according to the note's explanation. According to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. The limes allow for 80 toasts. Salt allows for 100 toasts. The answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. \n\nBut why is the drink allowing for 6 toasts? Let's see. If the drink is 4 * 5 = 20 ml. And each toast requires 3 ml (nl=3). So for 6 toasts, 6 * 3 = 18 ml. Which is within 20. But that would be the case if each toast requires 3 ml total, not per friend. \n\nAh! Maybe I got the per toast calculation wrong. Maybe the nl is the total per toast, not per friend. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So per toast, per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. \n\nBut if the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, then that would mean that 6 * n * nl = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. Which is larger than 20. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be strange. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. Let me think differently. \n\nMaybe the problem is that the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. Total for all friends is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the total drink is k * l. So n * t * nl ≤ k * l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nIn the first example, (4 *5 )/(3 *3) = 20 /9 = 2.222, so t=2. Which is the correct output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So how does that fit? \n\nThe note says that the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that they're calculating (k*l) / nl = 20 / 3 = 6.666, which would be 6. So this would be assuming that for each toast, total drink is nl ml. Not per friend. \n\nBut that would be a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666. So if that's the case, then the calculation is (k*l) / nl = 20 /3 = 6.666. Which would be the number of toasts per friend. \n\nBut that would imply that for each toast, the total drink is nl per friend, but for one toast, the total is nl * 1 (for one friend). But that doesn't make sense, since there are n friends. \n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try to see what the actual correct approach is, given that the sample input and output are known.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → output 2.\n\nLet me compute what the correct calculations are for this case.\n\nTotal drink: 4 *5 = 20 ml. \n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So total per toast is 3 *3 =9 ml. \n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is floor(20 /9) = 2. \n\nLimes: 10 limes, 8 slices each. Total slices: 80. Each toast requires 3 slices (one per friend). So maximum toasts is 80 // 3 = 26. \n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast requires 3 * 1 = 3 grams (np=1 per friend, 3 friends). So 100 // 3 = 33. \n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be 6. But according to this calculation, it's 2. So why does the note say that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the note says that the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But that would be if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. Which would be incorrect. So the note is wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which suggests that the drink allows for 6 toasts, then divided by 3 friends to get 2. \n\nBut that would be the case if the 6 is the total number of toasts that can be made, and then divided by the number of friends. Which would imply that the drink allows for 6 toasts total. But according to our calculation, the drink allows for 2 toasts total. \n\nSo why does the note say that the drink allows for 6 toasts? \n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is referring to the number of toasts per friend. \n\nWait, if the drink allows for 6 toasts per friend, then the total drink is 3 *6 *3 = 54 ml. Which is more than 20. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the note may have a mistake in its explanation. For example, perhaps it should say that the drink is enough for 20 / (3 *3) = 2.222 toasts, which is 2. But the note says 20 /3 =6. So maybe it's a typo. \n\nBut regardless, the sample output is 2, which matches the calculation of min(2, 26, 33) = 2. So the correct approach is to calculate the three resources as:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c *d) // n \n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nthen answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nSo for the first example, drink_toasts is 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2. lime_toasts is 80//3=26. salt_toasts is 100//(3*1) = 33. min is 2. Correct.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which is inconsistent with this. So perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is explaining something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts per friend. But that would be 6 * 3 *3 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that can't be. \n\nWell, regardless, the sample output is correct with the above approach. Let's look at the other examples.\n\nSecond example input: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink 100*10 = 1000 ml. nl=4. So per toast, total drink is 5*4=20. So 1000//20=50.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 → slices 19. per toast, 5 slices. 19//5=3.\n\nSalt: p=90, np=3. per toast, 5 *3=15. 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird example input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000 ml. nl=50 → per toast, 10 *50=500. 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nLimes: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575 slices. per toast, 10 slices. 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: p=1 gram. np=1 → per toast, 10 *1 =10. 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems to work for the sample inputs. So the correct way is to compute for each resource the maximum number of toasts possible, then take the minimum of those three.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nRead the input as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if any of these divisions are zero? Like in the third example, salt_toasts is zero. So the min is zero.\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is read from stdin. The input is a single line with the numbers. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo the code should read the line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nSo:\n\nRead the line as input().split(), then map to integers.\n\nThen compute the variables as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if n * nl is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nYes, because the input constraints say that all numbers are positive integers.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20. n * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nLet me test the third example:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink=1,000,000. n * nl = 10 *50 =500. 1e6//500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices = 25 *23=575. 575 // 10 =57.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: if all resources are sufficient for 5 toasts, then output is 5.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available milliliters of drink, total lime slices, and total grams of salt.\n2. **Determine Constraints for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (where `n` is the number of friends and `nl` is the milliliters needed per toast per friend).\n   - **Lime Slices**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available, considering each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires `n * np` grams (where `np` is the grams of salt needed per toast per friend).\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of the three calculated values from the above steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_slices = c * d\nlime_toasts = total_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total milliliters of drink available is calculated as `k * l`. The number of toasts possible with this drink is determined by dividing the total milliliters by the amount required per toast (`n * nl`).\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend), so the number of toasts possible is the total slices divided by `n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total grams of salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, so the number of toasts possible is the total salt divided by `n * np`.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final answer is the minimum value among the toasts possible from each resource, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the limiting factor for the number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring optimal use of the available resources.",
