A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires each friend to have nl milliliters. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. Oh right. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each friend has nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for all friends, total drink per toast is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires n slices (since each friend needs one slice). And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nNow, for each toast, the total required is:\n\ndrink: n * nl per toast.\n\nlime slices: n per toast.\n\nsalt: n * np per toast.\n\nSo, the number of toasts possible is limited by each of these resources. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nSo, for the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast uses n * nl. So max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So max_toasts_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np. So max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the first input:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nTotal drink: 4 *5 =20. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast per friend. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, total drink is 3 *3=9. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But sample says 80 toasts? Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait in the sample explanation, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, the total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast needs n slices (n is 3 friends). So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's conflicting. Wait what's wrong here?\n\nWait no! Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How? Let me check again.\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for the first sample, 3 friends per toast, so 3 slices per toast. So with 80 slices, 80 /3 is 26.666, which would be 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml. Enough for 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3=2.\n\nWait wait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? Because according to the note, the limes are 10 *8 =80 slices. But each toast requires 3 slices (since 3 friends). So 80 slices would allow 80/3 =26.666 toasts. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps the per toast requirement is one slice per friend, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. But for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for the first sample, 3 friends per toast, so 3 slices per toast. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be 80 slices divided by 1 per toast. Which suggests that perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice total, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So the sample explanation must have a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the numbers again. Let me look at the first input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends, c=10 limes, d=8 slices per lime. So total slices is 10 *8 =80. So if each toast requires one slice per friend, then per toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 /3 = 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the per toast is 1 slice, not per friend. So that's a contradiction. What's going on here?\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\".\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs one slice. Therefore, for one toast, the number of slices needed is n (number of friends). So for the first sample, 3 slices per toast. So with 80 slices, 80 /3 is 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the per toast is 1 slice. So why?\n\nAh! Wait maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh, so each friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices are required. So in the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 /3 = 26.666 toasts. But according to the sample explanation, it's 80 toasts. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, but why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? According to the sample explanation, the limes are 10*8=80 slices. So if each toast requires one slice, then 80 toasts. But that would imply that each toast requires one slice total, not per friend. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement may have a different requirement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if per toast requires 1 slice. So there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output. The first input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nThe output is 2.\n\nAccording to the sample explanation, the min of 6, 80, 100 is 6. Then divided by 3 friends gives 2. So the sample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, limes allow 80, salt allows 100. Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\n\nBut why is the drink allowing 6 toasts?\n\nDrink total is 4*5 =20 ml. Each toast requires n * nl =3 *3=9 ml. 20 /9 = 2.222, so floor is 2. But according to the sample explanation, it's 20 /3 =6. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh no! Wait, maybe I got the per toast calculation wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. But the sample explanation says that 20 ml is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which implies that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3 ml per toast for all friends. Which would be possible if nl is per toast, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and they say it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be 3 ml per toast. Which would mean that for each toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl=1 ml per friend. But in the input, nl is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this?\n\nWait the sample input for the first case is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nWhich means n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nThe sample explanation says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, they need 3 ml. So 20/3=6. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs 3 ml per toast. So for 3 friends, that's 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. Which would make 20 /9 = 2.222 toasts, floor to 2. But the sample explanation says 6. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nSo what's the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nMaybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be per toast, not per friend. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be impossible unless n=1.\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in the sample explanation. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. But according to the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and they say it's enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be n * nl =3. Since n is 3, that would mean that nl is 1. But in the input, nl is 3. So this seems to be a contradiction.\n\nWait the sample input for the first case has nl=3. So according to the sample explanation, 20 /3 =6. So that would be 3 ml per toast. Which would mean that the total per toast is 3 ml, which would be nl=3 per toast. But that would mean that each friend gets 1 ml per toast (since 3 friends would need 3 ml total). But the problem says each friend needs nl=3 ml. So this is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the sample explanation is using nl as the total per toast. For example, if the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, then for each toast, total is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml, and it's enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 3 ml per toast. Which would be nl=3 per toast. So that would be per toast, each friend gets 1 ml (since 3 friends * 1 ml =3 ml). Which would imply that the problem statement has a typo and the nl is per toast, not per friend. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement has a mistake. But given that the sample explanation is as such, perhaps the correct approach is to reverse engineer the correct formula from the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample explanation:\n\nDrink is 4*5=20 ml. They say it's enough for 20 /3=6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be nl=3 per toast. Which would imply that the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. But that's conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nBut since the sample explanation is given, perhaps the correct way is to follow that.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual requirements are:\n\nEach toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl * n. But the sample explanation says that the drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement has a mistake in the description, and the actual requirement is that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl, not n * nl. Which is not possible unless n=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. But that would be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nThis is a critical point. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\nThe sample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml, which is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So the denominator is 3, which is nl. So the total per toast is nl.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of toasts based on the drink is (k * l) // nl.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl per toast. So for one toast, n friends would need n * nl. So the total drink is (k*l) divided by (n * nl), floored.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So this suggests that the problem statement is incorrect, or the sample explanation is wrong. But since the sample explanation is part of the problem, I must find out what the correct formula is.\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSample explanation says that the drink is 20 ml, which allows 20/3=6 toasts. Limes allow 80 toasts. Salt allows 100. Min is 6. Then divided by 3 friends gives 2.\n\nSo the answer is min(6, 80, 100) // 3 = 2.\n\nSo the formula used is:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (k*l) // nl\n\nmax_toasts_lime = (c*d) // 1 (since each toast requires 1 slice?)\n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // np.\n\nThen, the answer is min( max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt ) // n ?\n\nWait, but the sample explanation says that the min of 6, 80, 100 is 6, and then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\ntotal_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np )\n\nthen answer is total_toasts // n ?\n\nBut why?\n\nIf that's the case, then the reasoning would be:\n\nEach toast requires for the drink: nl ml per toast (not per friend). So total drink is k*l, which can make (k*l)//nl toasts.\n\nEach toast requires one slice of lime (not per friend). So total slices is c*d, which can make (c*d)//1 toasts.\n\nEach toast requires np grams of salt per toast (not per friend). So total salt is p, which can make p//np toasts.\n\nThen, since each toast is for all friends, the number of toasts possible is the min of these three values. But why divide by n?\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the answer is min(...)/3. So in the first sample, min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption was wrong. Perhaps the problem is that each toast is made by all friends together, and each toast requires per person some resources. But the number of toasts is limited by the total resources divided by the per toast requirements, but then divided by the number of friends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So total for all friends is t * n toasts.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each toast is made by all friends together, so each toast is one round where everyone drinks once. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So for the resources:\n\nDrink: each toast requires n * nl ml. Total for t toasts: n * nl * t. Which must be <= k*l.\n\nLimes: each toast requires n slices. Total for t toasts: n * t slices. Which must be <= c*d.\n\nSalt: each toast requires n * np grams. Total for t toasts: n * np * t. Which must be <= p.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d) / (n)\n\nt <= p/(n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values, floored.\n\nAh! This would explain the sample.\n\nLet me calculate for the first sample:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20.\n\nn * nl =3 *3=9.\n\nt_drink = 20//9 = 2.\n\nc*d =10 *8=80. n=3. 80//3=26.666 → 26.\n\np=100. n * np=3 *1=3. 100//3=33.333 →33.\n\nSo min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, they said that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be 20/3=6. But that would be if the drink calculation was (k*l) / nl, not divided by n * nl. So why is the sample explanation wrong?\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. But according to this new calculation, it's 20/(3*3)=2.222, which is 2. So why does the sample explanation say 6? There's a contradiction.\n\nBut the sample output is 2. Which matches the new calculation. So the sample explanation must have a mistake. Or perhaps the sample explanation is correct but the reasoning is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. But that's unlikely. So what's the correct way?\n\nLet me check the sample explanation again.\n\nSample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nSo according to the sample explanation, the drink allows 6 toasts. Then divided by 3 friends, gives 2. Which is the correct output.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, the drink allows 2 toasts. So why is there this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the total for one toast is nl ml. Which would be possible only if n=1. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct. So how to get the correct formula.\n\nLet me think of the sample input and output.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 2. So the correct formula must yield 2.\n\nIf the formula is min( (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np) ), then for the first sample:\n\n(20) // (3*3) = 20//9=2.\n\n(c*d) is 80, divided by n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\np is 100, divided by (3*1)=3 → 100//3=33. So min is 2. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct formula.\n\nBut why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows 6 toasts? Because according to that, 20/3=6, which would be if the drink per toast is 3 ml. Which would be nl=3 ml per toast. So that would be for one toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl=3 per toast. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl ml per toast. So for 3 friends, that would be 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. Which is not what the sample explanation says.\n\nSo the sample explanation seems to be incorrect, but the actual correct calculation is what I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute for each resource:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nLimes: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toasts_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the code should compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20.\n\nn * nl =3 *3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → total_slices=80. 80//3=26.\n\np=100, n * np=3 *1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, but according to this calculation, it's 2. So why is the sample explanation wrong? Well, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nBut the sample output is correct. So the code should be written according to this logic.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond example input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nLet me parse this as n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = 100 *10 =1000.\n\nn * nl =5 *4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_slices =1 *19=19. 19//5=3 (since 19/5=3.8, floor 3).\n\ntotal_salt: 90 // (5 *3) =90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) → 3. Which is the sample output of 3. Which matches the second sample output.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl =10 *50=500 → 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices: 25 *23=575. 575//10=57.5 → 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n * np =10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the third sample output.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink, limes, salt)\n\nPrint result.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as integers. Split into variables.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe input shows three lines, but the problem says that the input is the first and only line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input description says:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut this is probably a formatting mistake. Probably, the actual input is one line per test case. But the problem says that the input is one line. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual program should read one line of input.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the program should read one line of input. But the sample input shows three lines. But that's probably because the sample input shows three separate test cases. For example, the first sample input is one line, and the output is one line.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps it's a formatting error. For example, the user might have pasted the input as a list of test cases. So the actual code should read one line of input, split into the 8 integers.\n\nSo the code will read a single line, split into the 8 variables.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts.\n\nFor example:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the three values.\n\nBut need to make sure that division is integer division.\n\nSo code:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the first sample input:\n\nInput line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ndrink_total =4*5=20, n * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nlime_total=10*8=80, 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts =100//(3*1)= 33. So min(2,26,33)=2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\ndrink_total=100*10=1000. n * nl=5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\nlime_total=1*19=19 → 19//5=3.\n\nsalt_toasts=90//(5*3)=90//15=6 → min(50,3,6) →3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ndrink_total=1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. n * nl=10 *50=500 → 1e6//500=2000.\n\nlime_total=25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt_toasts =1 // (10 *1) = 0. So min(2000, 57, 0) →0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables, compute the three values, take min, print.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. Like when the salt is not enough for even one toast.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the Python code is:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables, compute the three values, take min and print.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if n * nl is zero? But the problem says all inputs are >=1. So n is >=1, nl >=1. So n * nl >=1. Same for other denominators.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per friend. Therefore, for `n` friends, each toast will require:\n   - `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - `n` slices of lime.\n   - `n * np` grams of salt.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is `p` grams.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available lime slices: `(c * d) // n`.\n   - Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available salt: `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the values calculated from the three resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlimes = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available (`k * l`) is divided by the amount required per toast (`n * nl`) to determine how many full toasts can be made with the available drink.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total lime slices available (`c * d`) are divided by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`) to determine how many full toasts can be made with the available lime slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available (`p`) is divided by the amount required per toast (`n * np`) to determine how many full toasts can be made with the available salt.\n- **Result**: The minimum value from the three calculations gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for that number of toasts.",
