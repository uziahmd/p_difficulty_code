A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate the total amount of drink available. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl for that toast. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, maybe it's (total drink) divided by (per toast drink per friend multiplied by number of friends). So yes.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So maximum toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt, each toast requires np grams per friend, so per toast total is n * np. So maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources are needed for each toast. So the maximum possible is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, let me check the example given. The first input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For example, in the first case, 3 friends, each needs 3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. So total drink is 20. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, wait. Oh wait, no! Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 4*5=20. Then, the example says that it's enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to my previous reasoning, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for 3 friends, each needing 3 ml per toast, that's 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. Then 20 /9 is 2.222... which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, they have 6 toasts. Wait that suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says: the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So that suggests that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So total per toast is nl ml per friend multiplied by number of friends. Wait no, that would be nl * n. But according to the note, 20 /3 is 6. So 3 is the nl value. So 20 divided by 3 gives 6. So that implies that per toast, the total drink required is nl per friend, but multiplied by the number of friends? Or perhaps per toast, each friend uses nl, so per toast, total is n * nl. But in the note, for the first example, the drink is 20. Then the number of toasts is 20/(3) = 6. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would imply that per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the nl is 3. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. Because each of the n friends needs nl for that toast.\n\nBut in the note, the first example says:\n\nthe drink is 4*5=20. It is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait that would imply that per toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be 3 ml per toast. Which would mean that per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the nl is 3. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the nl is 3. So why is it divided by 3?\n\nAh, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, the total drink required is n * nl.\n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink is 20, and they have 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3, but divided by n=3 friends. So that would be per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So perhaps the problem is that the note's calculation is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, each friend uses nl, so total for all friends is n * nl. So for the first example, the total drink is 20. So how many toasts can they make? Let's compute:\n\nTotal drink is 20. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20//9 = 2. So 2 toasts. But according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. Wait that suggests that the drink is 20, and the number of toasts is 6, but then divided by 3? That's confusing.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nthe answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So why is the drink's value 6?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the drink is calculated as (total drink) divided by (nl per toast per friend), and then divided by the number of friends?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-express the note's explanation.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nThey have 4*5 =20 ml of drink. The note says that it is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So why 3?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, the total is n * nl. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total is 3 ml. So that would be n * nl =3? But in the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 *3 =9. So that's not matching.\n\nWait maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, the total is nl ml. So that would be per toast, regardless of the number of friends. That can't be right. Because if there are 3 friends, each needing 3 ml per toast, then per toast, you need 3 *3 =9 ml. But according to the note, the total is 20 divided by 3 equals 6 toasts. So that would be 20 /3 =6. So that would be 3 ml per toast, not per friend.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me recheck the note's explanation.\n\nThe note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. \n\nSo why 3? Because the nl is 3. So the note is saying that per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. Which would be per toast, regardless of the number of friends. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. But in the note, it's 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would suggest that per toast, the total is 3 ml. So that would be nl is 3, but divided by n. So perhaps the problem statement is written differently.\n\nWait perhaps the problem says that per toast, the total is nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for each toast, the total is n * nl ml. But the note says that for the first example, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total is 3 ml. So that would be n * nl =3. But in the first example, n is 3 and nl is 3. 3*3=9, not 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl. So that would be nl per toast for all friends. That would be impossible unless the friends are sharing. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the note. Let me look at the first example's input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the drink is 4 *5=20 ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 friends *3 ml =9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, which is 2. So the maximum possible is 2. But according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for each toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, the total is nl *1, not multiplied by n. That would be strange. But then, in the note, the drink is 20, and per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 ml. Then for 6 toasts, 6 *3 =18 ml. Which is within 20. Then that would fit with the note's explanation.\n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. Because the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast. So if there are 3 friends, each needing 3 ml per toast, then per toast, the total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So why is the note saying that it's 20 /3 =6 toasts?\n\nThis is a critical point. If I get this wrong, the code will be wrong.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nBut the note says that in the first example, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink per toast is 3 ml. So that would be nl per toast, not multiplied by n.\n\nBut that would mean that for each toast, the total drink is nl, not n * nl. Which would be the case if the problem said that per toast, the total is nl for all friends. Which is not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, the total is nl. So that would be per toast, each friend needs nl ml. But that would require that the total per toast is nl, which would imply that the total per toast is nl, regardless of the number of friends. Which makes no sense. Unless the problem statement is written incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So what's going on here?\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation. The note says:\n\nthe drink is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 *8 =80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 /1 =100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2.\n\nWait wait, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. So the min is 6, then divided by 3 gives 2. So why is the drink's value 6?\n\nIf the drink's value is 6, that implies that the drink allows for 6 toasts. But how?\n\nIf the drink is 20, then 20 divided by something equals 6. So 20 / x =6 → x= 20/6 =3.333... So perhaps the drink per toast is 3.333... ml. But how?\n\nLet me think. The note says that the drink is 20 ml. The friends are 3. So the total per toast is something that allows 6 toasts. So 6 toasts would require 6 * x = 20 → x = 20/6 = 3.333... ml per toast. But how does that relate to the parameters?\n\nIn the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. For 6 toasts, each friend would need 6 *3 =18 ml. For 3 friends, total is 3 * 18 =54 ml. But the total drink is only 20. That's impossible. So the note's explanation must have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts is determined by how much each friend can have. So for each toast, each friend has one portion. So the total number of toasts is t. For each friend, they need t * nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl. Which must be ≤ total drink.\n\nSo solving for t: t ≤ (total_drink) / (n * nl)\n\nIn the first example, total_drink is 20. n is 3, nl is 3. So t ≤ 20/(3*3) = 20/9 ≈2.222. So floor is 2. Which is what the note's final answer is. But in the note's explanation, they say that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which is 6, but then they divide by 3 friends to get 2. So this suggests that the initial calculation for drink is (total_drink) / (nl) and then divided by n.\n\nWait, let's see. If the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts, then that would be t =6. But then, for each toast, the total drink needed is n * nl * t. Which would be 3 *3 *6 =54. Which is more than 20. That's impossible. So this suggests that the note's explanation is incorrect. But that's impossible. The note must be correct. So I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. But that's not the total number of toasts. It's the total number of toasts per friend. Or perhaps the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts in total, but since there are 3 friends, the number of toasts each can make is 6 /3 =2. Which would be the final answer. But how does that work?\n\nSo the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts in total. But how is that calculated?\n\nIf the drink allows for 6 toasts total, then for each toast, the total drink needed is 20/6 =3.333... ml. Which is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is calculating the maximum number of toasts per friend. So each friend can make t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. Which must be <= total_drink. So t <= total_drink/(n * nl). \n\nIn the first example, that would be 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so t=2. Which is the answer.\n\nBut in the note's explanation, they calculate the drink as 20 /3 =6, then divide by 3 friends to get 2. So that suggests that the initial calculation is 20 /3 =6 toasts, which is the total number of toasts for all friends combined. But how?\n\nIf the total number of toasts for all friends is t_total, then each friend makes t_total /n toasts. But that would require that t_total is divisible by n. But the note's explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, and then dividing by 3 friends gives 2. So that would imply that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2. But how is 6 calculated?\n\nLet me think: For each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t_total toasts, each friend makes t_total toasts. No, that's not right. If there are t_total toasts, then each friend participates in t_total toasts. So for each toast, all friends are participating. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, the total drink is t * nl. For n friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which must be <= total_drink.\n\nSo solving for t: t <= total_drink / (n * nl).\n\nIn the first example, that would be 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so floor 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nBut according to the note's explanation, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. So that would be t_total =6. Then, each friend makes 6 /n =6/3=2 toasts. So that would be the same result.\n\nSo why is the drink's calculation 20 /3 =6?\n\nBecause the total_drink is equal to t_total * nl * n ?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nt_total is the total number of toasts. Each toast requires n * nl ml of drink. So total_drink >= t_total * n * nl.\n\nBut in the note's explanation, they calculate t_total as 20 /3 =6. Which would mean that t_total * n * nl =6 *3 *3 =54, which is larger than 20. That's not possible.\n\nSo this suggests that the note is using a different approach. How?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is mistaken. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the problem is interpreted.\n\nWait maybe the problem is that each toast is made by one friend. So for each toast, one friend needs nl ml. But that would be a different scenario. Let's try that.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each toast, one friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend can make t toasts. But that would require that the total number of toasts is t *n, because each friend makes t toasts. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the friends are making t toasts in total, and each toast requires that every friend has their own portion. So for each toast, each friend has one portion. So for t toasts, each friend has t portions. So total drink required is n * t * nl.\n\nWhich brings us back to the original calculation.\n\nBut in the note's explanation, they say that the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts in total. So for t=6, the total drink needed is 3 *6 *3 =54, which is larger than 20. So this is impossible. Hence, the note must be wrong. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is explaining that the drink allows for 6 toasts per friend. Which would be t=6, but then total drink is 3 *6 *3 =54. Which is larger than 20. So that's not possible.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look for the correct way to calculate the maximum number of toasts.\n\nThe correct approach must be to find the maximum number of toasts t such that:\n\n- The total drink is >= t * n * nl\n\n- The total lime slices is >= t * n (because each toast requires one slice per friend)\n\n- The total salt is >= t * n * np\n\nSo t is the minimum of (total_drink // (n * nl), total_lime_slices //n, total_salt // (n * np)).\n\nIn the first example:\n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20\n\nn * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices =10 *8=80 → 80//3=26.666 →26.\n\ntotal_salt =100 // (3*1) = 33.333 →33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which is not aligned with this calculation. So why does the note say that?\n\nLooking at the note's explanation:\n\nThey say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But that's probably a mistake. Or perhaps the note is referring to something else.\n\nWait maybe the note is saying that the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts per friend? Which would be t=6, but that would require that each friend makes 6 toasts. So total drink is 3 *6 *3 =54. Which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong and the correct calculation is as I described earlier.\n\nBut according to the sample input and output, the first example's output is 2, which matches the calculation of min(2, 26, 33) =2. So that must be the correct approach.\n\nSo the correct way is to compute for each resource:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes: (c*d) // n\n\nsalt: p // (n * np)\n\nthen take the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ndrink: 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2\n\nlimes: 10*8=80 //3=26\n\nsalt: 100// (3*1)= 33. So min(2,26,33)=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? That must be a mistake in the note's explanation. Or perhaps the note's explanation is using a different approach. For example, maybe the note is considering that the drink is used per toast per friend, but not multiplied by n. Like, for each toast, the total drink is nl. Which would be:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // nl → 20//3 =6.\n\nThen, since there are n friends, the number of toasts each can make is 6//n =6//3=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! That's the key. So the note's explanation is possibly incorrect in the way it explains, but the actual calculation is that for each toast, the total drink required is nl per toast, not multiplied by n. But that's not what the problem says. But that would explain the sample.\n\nWait, but that would be a contradiction with the problem statement. Let me think again.\n\nIf the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast, then for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl. For n friends, total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the note's explanation says that the drink is sufficient for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts, and then dividing by 3 friends gives 2. So that suggests that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2 toasts. So for each friend, 2 toasts, which requires 2 * nl = 6 ml per friend. Total drink is 3 *6 =18 ml. Which is within 20.\n\nSo how is the 6 toasts calculated?\n\nIf the total drink is 20, and the total required for t toasts is n * t * nl =3 * t *3 =9t. So 9t <=20 → t <= 2.222. So t=2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nBut in the note's explanation, they say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would imply that 9 *6 =54 <=20, which is not true. So the note's explanation must be wrong. Or perhaps the note is referring to the total number of toasts per friend. For example, if each friend can make t toasts, then total drink is n * t * nl. So for the first example, t=2, total drink is 3*2*3=18 <=20.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be the total number of toasts for all friends. But that would be 3 *2 =6 toasts. So that's the total number of toasts. So the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts total. Which is correct. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6/3 =2 toasts.\n\nAh! This is the key. So the note is using the total number of toasts (for all friends) as the variable, and then dividing by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nSo the calculation for the drink is (k*l) // (nl) → which is 20//3 =6. This represents the total number of toasts that can be made across all friends. Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, we divide by n. So 6//3 =2.\n\nBut why is the total number of toasts calculated as (k*l) // nl? Because for each toast, the total drink required is nl per toast. But that would be incorrect according to the problem statement.\n\nWait, but if each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, then for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t_total toasts (total for all friends), the total drink is t_total * n * nl. So solving for t_total:\n\nt_total = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nBut in the note's explanation, it's calculated as total_drink // nl = 20//3=6. Which would be t_total =6. Then, the number of toasts per friend is t_total /n =6/3=2.\n\nBut this would imply that the total drink is t_total * nl, which is 6*3=18. Which is indeed less than or equal to 20. But why is this the case?\n\nBecause the total drink required is t_total * nl. Which would imply that for each toast, the total drink is nl. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement may have a different meaning. Perhaps the problem says that for each toast, the total drink required is nl milliliters, not per friend. But that would be a contradiction with the problem statement.\n\nBut if that is the case, then the calculation is as follows:\n\nFor each toast, the total drink needed is nl. So the number of toasts possible is (k*l) // nl. Similarly, for each toast, each friend needs one slice of lime. So the total number of toasts is (c*d) // n. And for salt, per toast, the total is np, so (p // np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers divided by n. Or wait, no.\n\nWait, if the total number of toasts possible is t_total, and each toast requires one slice per friend, then the number of toasts possible is limited by (c*d) // n. Because each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So for t_total toasts, you need t_total *n slices. Which is why the limes are (c*d) // n.\n\nSo the correct calculation would be:\n\ndrink_t = (k*l) // nl\n\nlime_t = (c*d) // n\n\nsalt_t = p // np\n\nthen, the total number of toasts possible is min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t). And since each toast is for all friends, the number of toasts each friend can make is this min value.\n\nBut this would contradict the first example's note. Let's try this:\n\nFor the first example:\n\ndrink_t = 20 //3 =6.\n\nlime_t = 10*8=80 //3=26.\n\nsalt_t= 100//1=100.\n\nso min(6, 26, 100) is 6. So the answer is 6. But the sample output is 2. Which is not matching. So this can't be correct.\n\nBut the sample output is 2. So this approach is wrong.\n\nThus, this suggests that the initial approach was correct, and the note's explanation is wrong. But that's impossible. The note is part of the problem statement, so it must be correct.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 2. So the correct calculation must be that the answer is min( (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) ). Which in the first example gives min(2, 26, 33) =2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? It must be that the note is explaining it in a different way. For example, the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then divides by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but each toast requires that all friends participate, then the number of toasts per friend is 6. But that would require that the total drink is 6 * n * nl =6*3*3=54, which is more than 20. So this is not possible.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So how?\n\nMaybe the note is using the following logic:\n\nEach toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. So the number of toasts possible is total_drink // (n * nl). Which for the first example is 20//9=2. Which is the correct answer. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So why?\n\nPerhaps the note is making a mistake in its explanation, but the correct calculation is as per the initial approach.\n\nIn that case, the code should be written as follows:\n\nCalculate:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo this would give the correct answer for the first sample.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample input:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20\n\nn * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices =10*8=80 →80//3=26.\n\ntotal_salt_toasts =100//(3*1)=33.\n\nmin is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 1000.\n\nn * nl =5 *4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_lime_slices: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. 19//5=3.\n\nsalt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15. 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl =10 *50 =500 → 1,000,000 //500 =2000.\n\nlimes: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nSo the note's explanation must have a mistake in the way it's explained, but the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to compute the three values as described and take the minimum.\n\nNow, the task is to write a Python script that reads the input line, processes the numbers, and outputs the correct result.\n\nThe input is a single line with the numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo, for example, the first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo the code can read the input line, split into integers, and compute the three values.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, and assign to variables:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_lime // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if any of the denominators are zero? No, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np are >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made considering all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices available, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of friends (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Find Minimum**: The answer is the minimum value among the three calculated constraints, as all resources must be sufficient to make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nlime_toasts = total_lime // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. This total is then divided by the product of the number of friends and the milliliters needed per toast per friend to determine how many toasts can be made with the available drink.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is obtained by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. This is divided by the number of friends to determine how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt is divided by the product of the number of friends and the grams of salt needed per toast per friend to determine how many toasts can be made with the available salt.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the three calculated values (drink, lime slices, salt) gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient.",
