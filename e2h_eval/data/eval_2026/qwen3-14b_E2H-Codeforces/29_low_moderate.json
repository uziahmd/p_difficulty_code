Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there are multiple substitution queries applied to a string, and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. Directly applying each substitution step by step would be too slow because each substitution could replace a digit with a long string, leading to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string after substitutions. That's probably not feasible for large cases.\n\nHmm, so what's the alternative? Maybe we can model the substitutions in a way that tracks how each original digit contributes to the final number. Since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can represent the transformations using some kind of dynamic programming or memoization approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: think about each digit in the original string and track how it's transformed through all the substitutions. But since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to process the queries in reverse order. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each query replaces a digit with another string. But if a digit is replaced later, then any prior substitutions for that digit would be overridden. For example, if first we have a substitution for '2' to '00', then later a substitution for '2' to '5', then the later substitution takes precedence.\n\nSo the key is that each digit's replacement depends on the latest substitution for it. So, perhaps we can keep track for each digit (from 0-9) what is the current replacement string. However, when processing the queries, each query replaces the substitution for a particular digit. So, for example, if a query says '2->00', then any occurrence of '2' in the string will be replaced by '00'. But if later there's another query for '2', say '2->5', then all subsequent replacements of '2's will use '5'.\n\nBut the problem is that the substitutions are applied in sequence. So, for example, if we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then a query that replaces '0' with '1', then the original '2's would be replaced by '00's, which would then be replaced by '11's. So the order of processing queries matters. Therefore, each substitution affects the current state of the digits.\n\nBut directly simulating this would be computationally expensive if we do it naively. Because each substitution can cause the string to grow exponentially, especially if substitutions are like replacing a digit with a longer string.\n\nSo, how can we model this efficiently?\n\nLet me think in terms of building a mapping for each digit. Suppose that for each digit d, we have a function that represents what it gets replaced with. But since substitutions can be nested, we need to track the replacement strings in such a way that when we replace a digit, we consider the current mappings of other digits.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's model for each digit d, the current expansion. Initially, each digit d maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say d -> t, we update the mapping for d to be t. However, when expanding, we need to expand each digit in the current mapping recursively. Wait, no. Because when you replace a digit with a string, that string might contain other digits which may themselves be replaced in future queries. So, for example, if we first replace '2' with '00', and then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would be expanded to '00's, which then would be replaced by '11's. But if the queries are processed in order, then during the first substitution, the '2's are replaced with '00's, and then during the second substitution, the '0's are replaced with '1's. So the order of processing the queries is important.\n\nBut how can we model this in a way that allows us to compute the final string without actually expanding it each time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the expansion as a tree, and compute the value modulo 1e9+7 incrementally. Because when we replace a digit with a string, the contribution of that digit to the final number depends on the expansion of that string. However, since the numbers can be very large, we need to compute the modulo as we go.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nWe can represent for each digit d, a value that represents the expansion of d as a number, and also the length of the expansion. Because when digits are concatenated, the value can be calculated using the formula:\n\nvalue = (current_value * 10^length_of_new_part + new_value) mod MOD\n\nBut since the substitution strings can be replaced multiple times, we need to track for each digit d, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle multiple substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly simulating each substitution is infeasible due to potential exponential growth in string length. Instead, we use dynamic programming to track how each digit contributes to the final number, considering all substitutions applied in sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Key Idea\n\nWe maintain two mappings for each digit from '0' to '9':\n\n- `value_map[d]`: the numeric value of the expansion of digit `d` modulo $10^9 + 7$\n- `length_map[d]`: the length (in digits) of the expansion of digit `d`\n\nThese maps are updated dynamically as we process each query. When a substitution `d -> t` is processed, we update `value_map[d]` and `length_map[d]` based on the current values of the digits in `t`.\n\nFor example, if we have a query `2 -> 00`, and `0` is currently mapped to a value `v` and length `l`, then:\n- The new value for `2` becomes `(v * 10^l + v) % MOD`\n- The new length becomes `l + l = 2 * l`\n\nThis allows us to avoid expanding the string directly and instead work with computed values.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Initialize the Maps**:\n   - Initially, each digit maps to itself (`value_map[d] = int(d)` and `length_map[d] = 1`)\n\n2. **Process Queries**:\n   - For each query `d -> t`, update `value_map[d]` and `length_map[d]` based on the current values of digits in `t`\n\n3. **Compute Final Value**:\n   - Traverse the original string `s`, and for each character, use the current `value_map` and `length_map` to accumulate the final result using modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    s = data[0]\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = data[2:2+n]\n\n    # Initialize value and length maps\n    value_map = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length_map = [1] * 10\n\n    for q in queries:\n        if not q:\n            continue\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        digit = int(d)\n        # Compute new value and length for digit\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for c in t:\n            c_int = int(c)\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, length_map[c_int], MOD) + value_map[c_int]) % MOD\n            new_len += length_map[c_int]\n        value_map[digit] = new_val\n        length_map[digit] = new_len\n\n    # Compute the final result\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        c_int = int(c)\n        result = (result * pow(10, length_map[c_int], MOD) + value_map[c_int]) % MOD\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Key Parts\n\n- **Initialization**: Each digit starts by mapping to itself.\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we compute the new value and length of the digit being replaced based on the current mappings of the digits in the replacement string.\n- **Final Computation**: We traverse the original string `s` and use the precomputed mappings to build the final number using modular arithmetic.\n\nThis approach ensures that even with large numbers of queries and long strings, we avoid exponential time complexity by working with precomputed values and lengths.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- Query processing: O(n * L), where L is the average length of the replacement strings.\n- Final string traversal: O(|s|), where |s| is the length of the original string.\n\nThis solution is efficient and suitable for the input constraints.",
