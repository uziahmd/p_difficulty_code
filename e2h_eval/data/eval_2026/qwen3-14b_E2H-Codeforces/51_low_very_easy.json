Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the first two strings are exactly equal to the third string in terms of character counts. For example, if the guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAUSS\", then combining them gives all letters that should be present in the pile. So, the pile must have exactly those letters, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHow to do this in Python?\n\nHmm. So, one way is to concatenate the first two strings, then check if the sorted version of that concatenated string is equal to the sorted version of the third string.\n\nYes. Because sorting both and comparing would ensure that the counts of each character are the same.\n\nFor example:\n\nguest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\nhost = \"DEDMOROZ\"\ncombined = guest + host → \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\npile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\nSorting combined and pile should give the same result.\n\nLet me test with the first example. Let's see:\n\nCombined length should be equal to pile's length. Oh right, because if the lengths are different, then it's automatically impossible. So first check if len(guest) + len(host) equals len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nBut even if lengths are same, the characters may not match.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the sorted concatenated string equals the sorted pile string.\n4. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about uppercase letters? The problem says all lines consist of uppercase Latin letters. So no issues there. So no need to handle case conversion.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile): print NO else check sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile).\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nLengths: guest is 10 letters, host is 8 letters. Total 18. Pile's length is 18? Let's count:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let me count letters. Well, maybe the code will handle that. But the sample output says YES. So the code would check that the sorted combined string equals sorted pile.\n\nAnother example: second input is guest 'PAPAINOEL', host 'JOULUPUKKI', pile 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nLet me check the lengths. Guest is 9 letters, host is 10 letters. Total 19. Pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let me count letters. Let me think:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → maybe the length is 20? Let me count:\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\n\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\nLet me count each character:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), U (3?), L (4?), N (5?), A (6?), P (7?), A (8?), O (9?), I (10?), L (11?), E (12?), L (13?), U (14?), P (15?), U (16?), K (17?), K (18?), I (19?) → so length is 19? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Well, the sample output says that the answer is NO because there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would check that the combined guest and host has a certain count, and the pile has different counts.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nSo the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is three lines. So in Python, we can read them via input().strip() three times. But need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, sometimes, when using input(), there might be trailing newlines",
