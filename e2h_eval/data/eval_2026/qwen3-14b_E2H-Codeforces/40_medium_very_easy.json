The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to return this count modulo a given mod value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required here. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe constraints are n up to 500, which is pretty big. So any brute-force approach that checks all possible pairs of permutations is out of the question. Because for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of mathematical properties and dynamic programming.\n\nLet me consider the total number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q. Since all permutations are considered, for each pair of distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. But since we are considering ordered pairs where p is lex smaller than q, the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations -1 )) / 2. But wait, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is (k*(k-1))/2, where k is the number of permutations (k = n! ). However, this is only the case when considering all unordered pairs. But in our problem, we need to count those pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the inversion counts. For each permutation p, let's denote inv(p) as the number of inversions. Now, for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q, we want to count how many of them have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider all possible pairs (p, q) where p and q are permutations, p < q. Let's denote the total number of such pairs as T. Then, for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). Our target is to find the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nNow, if we can compute the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number where inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number where inv(p) = inv(q) equals T. But since p and q are distinct permutations, and for each pair (p, q) with p < q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) or equal. But how does this help?\n\nBut note that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q and p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if the inversion counts are symmetric. But maybe not. Wait, because the lex order and inversion counts are not directly related.\n\nWait, but perhaps for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) minus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) divided by something? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds if inv(p) != inv(q). But if inv(p) = inv(q), then neither. However, if we consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, then the total number of pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each such pair, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. So the total number of such pairs would be (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs)/2, where same_inversion_pairs is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut in our problem, we are considering ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. So the total number of such pairs is T = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. But for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how can we relate this to the overall counts?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q. Let's denote this as total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. For these pairs, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how to compute that?\n\nBut if we can compute the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then since for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (number of such unordered pairs) multiplied by 1/2? No, because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will satisfy p < q. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for each unordered pair {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of the following holds:\n\n- inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q\n\n- inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q \n\n- inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p \n\n- inv(p) < inv(q) and q < p \n\nBut since for each unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two possibilities (inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q)) holds, unless inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nSo the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such ordered pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2? No, because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2? Well, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1/2. Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the ordered pairs where p < q. So the count of such ordered pairs is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q. Let's denote this as T. Also, let S be the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Then, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how many such pairs are there? For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the ordered pairs where p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by the probability that p < q. But since for each unordered pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, the number of such ordered pairs is exactly half of S. Because for each unordered pair where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in T. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (S) / 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Because S is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q). For each such pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of ordered pairs where p < q. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how many of those are there? It depends on whether p < q or q < p for each pair. However, since the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T, and for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is present in T. Therefore, for all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly half of them will contribute to the count of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) > inv(q)? No, that's not necessarily true. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, it's either p < q or q < p. So, for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs is in T. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs in T with inv(p) > inv(q) is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Which is the same as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. But how can we find this count?\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) equals the total number of ordered pairs where p < q and p != q. Because for each pair (p, q) with p < q and p != q, inv(p) and inv(q) are either greater, less, or equal. So:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nA = number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)\n\nB = number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)\n\nC = number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q)\n\nThen, A + B + C = T, where T = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2.\n\nBut also, for the unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + B', where B' is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but for all unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if we don't consider the lex order. But how?\n\nLet me think about the entire set of permutations. For all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Because for each pair (p, q), either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or they are equal. The total number of pairs (p, q) where p != q is K = n! * (n! - 1). Let’s denote D as the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) = inv(q). Then, the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (K - D)/2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) != inv(q), then exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. So, the total number of unordered pairs with inv(p) > inv(q) is (K - D)/2.\n\nBut how does this relate to A and B?\n\nBecause for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T (the ordered pairs where p < q). Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Similarly, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T where inv(p) < inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Therefore, the number of such ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut how can we find this? Well, the sum of A and B is T - C. Also, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T with inv(p) > inv(q) (i.e., A) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q. Similarly, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) in T with inv(p) < inv(q) (i.e., B) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. But since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + B', where B' is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) in T where inv(q) < inv(p). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is (K - D)/2, and each of these contributes exactly once to either A or B (depending on whether p < q or not). But since the lex order is arbitrary, how can we find how many of these unordered pairs have p < q?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Suppose that for each unordered pair {p, q}, the probability that p < q is 0.5, assuming that all permutations are equally likely and that the lex order is independent of the inversion count. But that's probably not the case. However, perhaps the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Because for each such pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then in the unordered pair, the lex order could be either way. But since the lex order is determined by the actual permutation, and the inversion count is another property, there's no inherent relation between them. However, if we consider that for all unordered pairs {p, q}, exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. But this isn't true. Because the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is T, which is (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) < inv(q) and q < p. But this seems unclear.\n\nBut here's an idea: since the lex order is independent of the inversion count, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then there's a corresponding pair {q, p} where inv(q) < inv(p), and the lex order of p and q is the same as the lex order of q and p but reversed. So, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Unless there's some asymmetry in the lex order and inversion counts.\n\nBut this can't be true. For example, take n=2. The permutations are [1,2] and [2,1]. The inversion counts are 0 and 1 respectively. The total ordered pairs where p < q is 1 (since there's only one pair: ([1,2], [2,1])? No, wait, p < q is lex order. [1,2] is lex smaller than [2,1]. So the pair (p, q) is ([1,2], [2,1]). Now, inv(p) is 0, inv(q) is 1. So in this case, inv(p) < inv(q). So A is zero (no pairs where inv(p) > inv(q)), and B is 1. So in this case, A is not equal to B. So the previous idea is wrong.\n\nSo the symmetry assumption is invalid. Therefore, there's no direct relation between A and B. So this approach might not work.\n\nHmm. So what else can I do?\n\nLet me think again. The problem requires us to compute A, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). How can I compute this?\n\nAlternative approach: For all permutations p and q, compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think about generating functions or dynamic programming.\n\nBut first, I need to find for each possible inversion count, the number of permutations with that inversion count, and then find the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me denote for each i, c[i] as the number of permutations of size n with exactly i inversions. Then, the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the sum over all i > j of (number of permutations with i inversions) * (number of permutations with j inversions) multiplied by the probability that p < q for a permutation p with i inversions and q with j inversions. But this seems difficult to compute, because the lex order between p and q depends on their actual values, not just their inversion counts.\n\nSo even if I know c[i] and c[j], I can't directly compute the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j. Because the lex order depends on the actual permutations, not just their inversion counts.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nWait, but maybe for each pair of permutations p and q with different inversion counts, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p. Because for each pair (p, q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, for the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) equals T, and the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) < inv(q) and q < p. But how can I use this?\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s define X as the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet Y be the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q).\n\nLet Z be the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nWe know that X + Y + Z = T.\n\nAlso, for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let me call this total number as S. Then, S = X + (number of pairs (p, q) where q < p and inv(p) < inv(q)). But since for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, then S = total_pairs_without_equal = (total_permutations^2 - D)/2, where D is the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut also, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + (number of pairs (p, q) where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q)).\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds, then the total number of such pairs is S = (total_permutations^2 - D)/2.\n\nBut also, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + (number of pairs (p, q) where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q)).\n\nBut since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, either p < q or q < p. So the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to X + (the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)). Wait, no. If p and q are such that q < p and inv(p) > inv(q), then this contributes to the count of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q). But since q < p, then in the ordered pairs (q, p), it's part of the Y count (if inv(q) < inv(p)).\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of the following holds:\n\n- p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) → contributes to X\n\n- p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) → contributes to Y\n\n- q < p and inv(p) > inv(q) → contributes to the count of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) → which would be part of Y if we consider (q, p) as (p', q') where p' = q and q' = p.\n\n- q < p and inv(p) < inv(q) → contributes to the count of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) → which would be part of X if we consider (q, p) as (p', q') where p' = q and q' = p.\n\nBut since for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), then:\n\nX + (number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q)) ) = number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) = S = (total_pairs_without_equal)/2.\n\nSimilarly, Y + (number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(p) < inv(q)) ) = same S.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nNote that the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(q) > inv(p) → which is Y. Because swapping p and q, and changing the condition to inv(q) > inv(p) is equivalent to inv(p) < inv(q) in the original pair.\n\nSo, X + Y = S.\n\nBut earlier, we have X + Y + Z = T. Also, S = (K - D)/2, where K = total_permutations^2 - D, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, K = total_permutations^2, and D is the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = inv(q). Then, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q is K - D. And the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (K - D)/2.\n\nSo, X + Y' = (K - D)/2, where Y' is the number of pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q). But Y' is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(q) > inv(p), which is Y. So X + Y = (K - D)/2.\n\nBut from earlier, X + Y + Z = T, where T is (total_permutations * (total_permutations - 1 )) / 2. Which is equal to (K - total_permutations)/2, since K = total_permutations^2. So T = (K - total_permutations)/2.\n\nSo substituting into the previous equation:\n\nX + Y = (K - D)/2.\n\nBut also, T = (K - total_permutations)/2 = X + Y + Z.\n\nSo combining:\n\nX + Y = (K - D)/2 → X + Y = (total_permutations² - D)/2.\n\nBut T is (K - total_permutations)/2 = (total_permutations² - total_permutations)/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nX + Y + Z = (total_permutations² - total_permutations)/2 → which is T.\n\nBut how to find X?\n\nIf I can find Y and Z, then X can be found. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since X + Y = (total_permutations² - D)/2, and X + Y + Z = T = (total_permutations² - total_permutations)/2.\n\nSubtracting the two equations gives Z = T - ( (total_permutations² - D)/2 ) = [ (total_permutations² - total_permutations)/2 ] - [ (total_permutations² - D)/2 ] = [ -total_permutations + D ] / 2.\n\nBut Z is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). How can we compute Z?\n\nWell, for each inversion count i, the number of pairs of permutations with i inversions is c[i]^2. But since we are counting ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then Z is equal to the sum over i of (c[i] choose 2), since for each i, there are c[i] permutations, and the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and same inversion count is c[i] * (c[i] - 1)/2, and each of these pairs contributes exactly once to Z, depending on whether p < q. But since for each such unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is equal to the sum over i of (c[i] * (c[i] - 1 )) / 2. Because for each unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs is in T. Therefore, Z = sum_i (c[i] choose 2).\n\nBut earlier, from the previous equation, Z = (D - total_permutations)/2. So:\n\nsum_i (c[i] choose 2) = (D - total_permutations)/2 → D = 2 * sum_i (c[i] choose 2) + total_permutations.\n\nBut D is the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q). For each i, the number of such pairs is c[i]^2. So D = sum_i c[i]^2. Therefore:\n\nsum_i c[i]^2 = 2 * sum_i (c[i] choose 2) + total_permutations → sum_i c[i]^2 = 2 * sum_i [c[i] (c[i] - 1)/2 ] + total_permutations → sum_i c[i]^2 = sum_i c[i] (c[i] - 1) + total_permutations → sum_i c[i]^2 = sum_i c[i]^2 - sum_i c[i] + total_permutations → 0 = - sum_i c[i] + total_permutations → sum_i c[i] = total_permutations. Which is true, since each permutation has exactly one inversion count, so sum_i c[i] is the total number of permutations, which is n!.\n\nSo this confirms that the formula for Z is correct.\n\nBut back to the main problem. We need to find X. From earlier:\n\nX + Y = (total_permutations² - D)/2 → X + Y = (K - D)/2 where K = total_permutations².\n\nBut also, X + Y + Z = T = (K - total_permutations)/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nX + Y = (K - D)/2 → X + Y = (K - sum_i c[i]^2)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Let me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\nX + Y = (K - D)/2 → X + Y = (K - sum_i c[i]^2)/2.\n\nBut since X + Y + Z = T, and Z = sum_i (c[i] choose 2), then:\n\nX + Y = T - Z → X + Y = T - sum_i (c[i] choose 2).\n\nBut from the previous equation, X + Y = (K - D)/2 = (K - sum_i c[i]^2)/2.\n\nSo:\n\nT - sum_i (c[i] choose 2) = (K - sum_i c[i]^2)/2 → substituting T = (K - total_permutations)/2.\n\nSo:\n\n(K - total_permutations)/2 - sum_i (c[i] choose 2) = (K - sum_i c[i]^2)/2 → multiply both sides by 2:\n\nK - total_permutations - 2 * sum_i (c[i] choose 2) = K - sum_i c[i]^2 → rearrange:\n\n- total_permutations - 2 * sum_i (c[i] choose 2) = - sum_i c[i]^2 → multiply both sides by -1:\n\ntotal_permutations + 2 * sum_i (c[i] choose 2) = sum_i c[i]^2 → sum_i c[i]^2 = total_permutations + 2 * sum_i (c[i] (c[i] - 1)/2) → sum_i c[i]^2 = total_permutations + sum_i c[i] (c[i] - 1) → sum_i c[i]^2 = total_permutations + sum_i c[i]^2 - sum_i c[i] → 0 = total_permutations - sum_i c[i] → sum_i c[i] = total_permutations → which is true. So this confirms that the equations are consistent, but doesn't give us new information.\n\nSo back to the problem: we need to find X.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me recall that X is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut from earlier, X + Y = (K - D)/2 → X + Y = (total_permutations² - sum_i c[i]^2)/2.\n\nBut we also have X + Y + Z = T → X + Y = T - Z.\n\nSo combining:\n\nT - Z = (total_permutations² - sum_i c[i]^2)/2.\n\nWhich we already confirmed.\n\nBut how to get X from this?\n\nWell, perhaps there's another relation. Let me think about the difference between X and Y.\n\nWhat is X - Y?\n\nIf I can find that, then I can solve for X.\n\nLet me consider that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, X is the number of those with inv(p) > inv(q), Y is the number with inv(p) < inv(q). So X - Y = ?\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, think of all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) minus those with inv(p) < inv(q) equals the difference between the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and those where inv(p) < inv(q). But how to find this difference?\n\nMaybe there's a way to model this using the inversion counts and the lex order. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps for each pair of permutations p and q, the probability that p < q is 0.5 if p and q are distinct. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for each pair (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q), the contribution to X is 0.5 if p < q and 0.5 if q < p. But this is not helpful, unless we can find the total number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) and multiply by 0.5. But this would give us X = (total_pairs_with_inv_p_gt_inv_q) * 0.5. But is this true?\n\nYes! Because for every unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in T. So the number of such pairs in X is exactly half of the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q). Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs is in T.\n\nSo, X = (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q)) ) / 2.\n\nBut the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs_without_equal - D)/2, where total_pairs_without_equal is the number of pairs (p",
