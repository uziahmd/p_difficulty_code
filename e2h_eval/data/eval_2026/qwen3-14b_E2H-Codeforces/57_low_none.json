His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but they are not linked to names. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, Vasya's total is at least x, and we need to find the best and worst possible positions he could have.\n\nThe key here is that the participants' total points are sorted in descending order. For the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so he can be as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (so he's as low as possible), but considering that his total is at least x.\n\nWait, no. Wait. Wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total for Vasya could be any value >=x. But when determining the best and worst possible positions, we have to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (each participant has exactly one a and one b, but the pairing is unknown). However, the teacher knows that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's total is >=x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible positions, we have to consider all possible pairings that could exist, and find the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have in those pairings.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible position, we want to assign a_i and b_j to Vasya such that his total is as high as possible. Because higher totals would lead to better positions. But since the other participants' totals are determined by their pairings, we need to arrange the pairings so that Vasya's total is as high as possible, while others are as low as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the other participants' pairings are also part of the problem. Because the way the pairings are done affects the totals of all participants.\n\nBut the problem states that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists some pairing where his total is at least x. Wait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So, the actual pairing must be such that there exists some a_i and b_j (for Vasya) where a_i + b_j >=x. But the problem wants us to find, for all possible valid pairings (where each participant has exactly one a and one b, and there's at least one pairing for Vasya where his total is >=x), what is the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. But the problem is that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are not linked. So, the teacher needs to find the possible best and worst positions Vasya could have, given that there exists a way to pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is at least x. But the teacher has to consider all possible pairings (since the pairing is unknown) and find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have in any of those pairings.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible position, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and other participants' totals are as low as possible. For the worst possible position, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others' totals are as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we find these possibilities?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank. To get the best possible rank, we need to assign to Vasya the maximum possible sum (a_i + b_j) such that it's at least x. Then, arrange other pairings so that as many participants as possible have a higher total than Vasya. Wait, no. Because the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. So that he is first. Or maybe even if there are others with the same total, he can be placed first.\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is as high as possible. Let me think: the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + b_j. But since the problem says that there's at least one pairing where a_i + b_j >=x, but we need to choose",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to determine these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we assume that Vasya's score is maximized. This means we consider the highest possible sum of scores from the first and second tours. If this maximum sum is at least the given minimum score `x`, Vasya can be ranked first.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we consider the scenario where Vasya's score is minimized (but still at least `x`). We then count how many participants can have a higher or equal score than Vasya under this configuration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Best place: maximize Vasya's score\n    # So take max a_i + max b_j\n    max_vasya = max(a) + max(b)\n    if max_vasya < x:\n        # Not possible, but problem says it's guaranteed\n        pass\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Worst place: minimize Vasya's score (but >=x)\n    # We need to find the minimal possible total for Vasya that is >=x\n    # Then count how many participants can have sum >= that value\n    # To do this, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order\n    # Then for each a_i, pair with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet\n    # But this approach may not be optimal.

If this score is at least `x`, Vasya can be ranked first.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: To determine the worst possible rank, we sort the scores from the first tour in ascending order and the scores from the second tour in descending order. By pairing each score from the first tour with the corresponding score from the second tour, we maximize the number of participants who could have a score greater than or equal to `x`. The worst rank is then calculated based on how many participants can achieve this score, ensuring Vasya's rank is as low as possible.",
