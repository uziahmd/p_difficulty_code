He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but why? Let me check:\n\nWait for m=1, the sample says 5! is 120 (one zero), and 6! is 720 (one zero). So 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly one trailing zero. But why? Because when you compute the number of zeros for 5: 5/5 = 1, so 1. For 6, same as 5, since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. Similarly up to 9. Then 10/5 is 2, so 2 zeros. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So that's why there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find those n's efficiently.\n\nBut how do I find them? Let's think about the possible values of n. For a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe more? Wait, let me think. Suppose m is such that there's a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. For example, the sample case m=1 has 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nThe function count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. But how many such n's are there?\n\nWait, for example, if m is 5, what's the possible n's?\n\nLet me calculate. Let's find n such that count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nLet me think. Let's compute count_zeros(24): 24//5 =4, 24//25=0. Total 4. So 24 has 4 zeros. 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1, total 6. So 25 has 6 zeros. Wait, so between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where count_zeros(n) is 5. Therefore, for m=5, there are zero n's. Which would be the second sample input, where m=5 gives output 0.\n\nSo this suggests that for some m's, there are no n's. So how do we find whether there exists any n for a given m?\n\nThe approach is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers have that count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, why 5? Because when there's a jump in the count_zeros function. For example, when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, but not of 25. Let's see.\n\nLet me take m=1. The count_zeros(n) is 1 for n=5,6,7,8,9. So five numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when n increases from 4 to 5, the count increases by 1. Then from 5 to 9, the count remains 1. Then at 10, it increases by 2 (since 10/5=2, and 10/25=0. So 2 zeros. So the count jumps from 1 (for 9) to 2 (for 10). So the numbers between 5 and 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the number of n's is 5.\n\nSo the pattern here is that for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. But how long is that range?\n\nThe count_zeros function increases by 1 for each multiple of 5, but when there",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The approach involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that produce exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: For a given number `n`, the number of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula: `count_zeros(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`.\n3. **Finding Valid Ranges**: For a given `m`, we need to find the range of `n` values such that `count_zeros(n) = m`. This involves finding the smallest and largest `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Some values of `m` might not have any corresponding `n` values. For example, if `m` is between two jumps in the trailing zero count, there might be no valid `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    first = -1\n    last = -1\n\n    # Find the first n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            first = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if first == -1:\n        return []\n\n    low = first\n    high = 5 * m\n    # Find the last n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz == m:\n            last = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # Check if there's a valid range\n    if count_zeros(first) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    # Now check if the next number after last has count_zeros > m\n    if count_zeros(last + 1) != m + 1:\n        # There might be more numbers beyond last\n        # We need to find the upper bound\n        upper = last\n        while True:\n            next_upper = upper + 1\n            if count_zeros(next_upper) == m:\n                upper = next_upper\n            else:\n                break\n        last = upper\n\n    # Now check if the first number is correct\n    if count_zeros(first) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # The numbers from first to last inclusive\n    return list(range(first, last + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by summing the integer divisions of `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc.\n2. **Binary Search for Range**: The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the smallest (`first`) and largest (`last`) values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n3. **Validation and Edge Cases**: After determining the range, the code checks if the found range is valid and ensures that there are no gaps or jumps in the trailing zero count that would invalidate the range.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find all valid `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
