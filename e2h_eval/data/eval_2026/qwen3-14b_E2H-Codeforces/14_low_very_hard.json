He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factorial is divisible by 10, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization. But since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the main idea here is to find all n's where the count of 5s in their factorial equals m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, why? Let's check:\n\nFor n=5: 5/5 = 1 → 1 zero. So yes. Then for 6, same as 5 because adding 6 doesn't add any 5s. Similarly for 7, 8, 9. But when you get to 10, then 10/5 is 2, plus 10/25 is 0. So total 2 zeros. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So that's why those five numbers are valid.\n\nBut how do we find all such n's for a given m?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the possible n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the lower and upper bounds of n that could produce exactly m zeros. For example, for a given m, there's a range of n's that would give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding more numbers to the product can't decrease the number of 5s. So for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more.\n\nWait, but when you cross a multiple of 5, it increases. For example, n=5: f(5)=1, n=6: same, until n=10, which adds another 5 (since 10 is 5*2). So f(10) = 2.\n\nSo the function f(n) is non-decreasing. Therefore, for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros would form a contiguous range. But wait, maybe not. Because sometimes when you have numbers that are multiples of higher powers of 5, like 25, 50, etc. For example, let's take m=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: f(10) = 2 (from 10/5 + 10/25 = 2 + 0 = 2)\nn=11: same as 10, so 2.\nn=14: same.\nn=15: 15/5=3, 15/25=0. Total 3. So for m=2, the n's are from 10 to 14. That's 5 numbers. So again, a contiguous range.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's no n with exactly m zeros? For example, let's say m=5. Let's see:\n\nFind n where f(n)=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0. Total 4. Not enough. n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1. Total 6. So between 20 and 25, the count goes from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n)=5? Or maybe there is?\n\nWait, for n=24: 24/5 is 4, 24/25 is 0. So total 4. For n=25, it's 5+1=6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0. So the output would be 0.\n\nTherefore, for some m's, there are no n's. So the problem requires us to check if there exists any",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If no such integers exist, we should return 0.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because every pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero, and there are usually more 2s than 5s. Hence, the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is given by:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases, so for a given $ m $, all $ n $'s that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros form a contiguous range (if any).\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Find the smallest $ n $** such that $ f(n) = m $. We can use binary search for this.\n2. **Find the largest $ n $** such that $ f(n) = m $. Again, binary search is efficient here.\n3. If such $ n $ exists, the count is the difference between the upper and lower bounds plus one.\n4. If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., the smallest $ n $ with $ f(n) > m $), then the answer is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- Use a helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Use binary search to find the smallest and largest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.\n- Handle edge cases, like when $ m = 0 $, or when no $ n $ satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low if count_trailing_zeros(low) == m else -1\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return low if count_trailing_zeros(low) == m else -1\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if min_n == -1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    if max_n == -1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    result = list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n1\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**Input:**\n```\n5\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n- The binary search runs in $ O(\\log n) $ time.\n- The `count_trailing_zeros` function runs in $ O(\\log_5 n) $ time.\n- Thus, the overall complexity is $ O(\\log n \\cdot \\log n) $, which is efficient even for large values of $ m $ up to $ 10^5 $.",
