Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they're the same. A question mark (?) can pair with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm, the challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. For each position, we have a left boot and a right boot. But since we can choose which left boots pair with which right boots, the problem is about matching them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One approach is to first match the specific colors that are the same. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, maybe we can do the following steps:\n\n1. Match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, if l has a 'c' at position i, and r has a 'c' at position j, then pair them. But we need to do this in a way that maximizes the count. However, since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are already used.\n\nBut how to efficiently find these matches? Maybe using a frequency map for each color. Like, for each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots have that color, and similarly for the right boots. Then, for each color, the minimum of left and right counts would be the number of pairs we can make. But this might not account for overlapping uses, but perhaps it's a starting point.\n\nHowever, this approach might not work directly because the positions matter. Because once we pair a left boot with a right boot, they can't be used again. But maybe we can first process the specific colors and then handle the question marks.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for pairing a left '?' with a right '?', or a left '?' with a right specific color, etc. So, the question marks are flexible.\n\nSo here's an idea: \n\n- First, match all left and right boots that have specific colors and are the same. For example, for each color c (a-z), pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\n- Then, for the remaining question marks on both sides, pair them with each other or with remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how to track which ones have been used?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a bipartite graph where each left boot is connected to the right boots it can pair with, and we want the maximum matching. However, given the constraints (n up to 150,000), standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp are not feasible due to time complexity. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nSo, the key is to find a way to greedily pair the boots in a way that maximizes the count.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with the same specific color. For each color c, collect the list of indices in l and r where the color is c. Then, pair them in order. For example, for color 'a', take the first available left 'a' and pair with first available right 'a'.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Maybe using pointers or sets.\n\nBut for large n, we can't afford to do this naively. So perhaps, we can use dictionaries to map each color to a list of indices. Then, for each color, the number of pairs is min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])). But this is just the theoretical maximum, but we need to actually pair them.\n\nWait, but when you pair a left and right boot, they can't be used again. So, for example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, we can pair 2 of them. So, for each color, we can process them, and pair as many as possible.\n\nOnce those are paired, we can proceed to handle the question marks.\n\nBut then, what about the question marks? Let's think: after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots may have question marks. Also, some left and right boots could have been left unpaired because their specific color had no match.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right question marks. However, there's also the possibility of pairing a left question mark with a right specific color (if that specific color hasn't been fully matched yet), or vice versa.\n\nWait, but maybe the best way is to first pair as many as possible between left and right specific colors, then pair the remaining left question marks with the remaining right question marks. But perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For each color c (excluding ?), collect the positions in left and right where they are present.\n\n- For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, take the first available left c and first available right c, and pair them.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or have specific colors that couldn't be matched), we can pair the left ? with the right ?.\n\nBut wait, maybe some left ? can be paired with right specific colors that have leftovers. For example, suppose there's a left ? and a right 'a' that hasn't been paired yet. We can pair them. Similarly, a right ? can be paired with a left specific color.\n\nSo, the optimal approach may be:\n\nFirst, pair all left and right boots with specific colors that match. Then, pair the remaining left ? with the remaining right specific colors (and vice versa). Then, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of this as two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Match specific colors.\n\nPhase 2: Match question marks with whatever is left.\n\nBut how to implement phase 2?\n\nAnother approach is to first process all the pairs where both are specific colors, then process the pairs where one is ? and the other is specific, then the pairs where both are ?.\n\nBut how to manage the order to maximize the total?\n\nFor example, if there are left ? and right 'a's, pairing them would allow us to use up the 'a's, which otherwise could not be used. Similarly, if there are left 'a's and right ?s, pairing them would use up the left 'a's.\n\nBut how to track which are available?\n\nLet me think of using data structures:\n\nWe can have:\n\n- For left boots: a list of positions where color is not ?, and a list of positions where color is ?.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nBut then, during phase 1, we can pair the left and right boots with same specific color.\n\nOnce that is done, we can collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) that have specific colors and those with ?.\n\nThen, for phase 2, we can pair the left ? with the right specific colors, and vice versa.\n\nBut again, how to manage this.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nWe can create for each color (except ?) a count of how many left and right boots are available. Then, for each color, the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But this is just the initial phase.\n\nBut perhaps the actual implementation needs to track which specific boots are used.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think of using queues for each color. For example, for each color c (not ?), have a queue of left indices and a queue of right indices. Then, for each color c, we can pair as many as possible by taking from the front of both queues. This would be O(n) time.\n\nOnce that is done, we have the remaining left and right boots. Now, for the remaining left and right boots, we can process the ?s.\n\nFor the remaining left ?s and right ?s, we can pair them together. But also, the remaining left ? can be paired with the remaining right specific colors (and vice versa).\n\nSo, for example, if there are remaining right specific colors (say, 'a') that have not been matched yet, and left ?s, then pair them.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Create for each color c (a-z), a list of left indices where l[i] = c.\n\n   Similarly, for each color c (a-z), a list of right indices where r[i] = c.\n\n   Also, create a list of left ? indices and right ? indices.\n\n2. For each color c in a-z:\n\n   - Take the left list and right list for c.\n\n   - Pair as many as possible between them. For each pair, add to the result.\n\n   - For example, for each left index in left_list and right index in right_list, pair them until one of the lists is exhausted.\n\n   - So, for each c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n   - Then, the remaining elements in left_list (if any) are left over and can be considered for phase 2.\n\n   - Similarly for the right_list.\n\n3. After this phase, we have:\n\n   - Some left boots with specific colors that are not paired yet (because there were not enough right boots for their color).\n\n   - Some right boots with specific colors that are not paired yet.\n\n   - Left and right ?s.\n\n4. Now, process the remaining left ?s and right ?s.\n\n   Also, process the remaining left specific colors and right ?s, and vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For the remaining left specific colors, they can only be paired with right ?s. Similarly, for the remaining right specific colors, they can be paired with left ?s.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining ?s can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, here's the approach for phase 2:\n\na. For each remaining left specific color (i.e., those not yet paired), pair them with right ?s. For example, if a left boot is 'a' (not paired yet), and there is a right ? available, pair them.\n\nSimilarly, pair the remaining right specific colors with left ?s.\n\nb. Once that is done, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of using queues again. For example:\n\n- After phase 1, collect all left boots that are not yet paired and have specific colors. Let's call this left_remaining_specific.\n\n- Similarly, collect all right boots that are not yet paired and have specific colors: right_remaining_specific.\n\n- Collect all left ?s not yet paired: left_question.\n\n- Collect all right ?s not yet paired: right_question.\n\nThen, for phase 2:\n\nFirst, pair left_remaining_specific with right_question.\n\nHow? For each left_remaining_specific, we can try to pair with a right_question. Since the left_remaining_specific has a specific color, and the right_question can accept it.\n\nSimilarly, pair right_remaining_specific with left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor left_remaining_specific and right_question:\n\nWe can iterate through the left_remaining_specific and for each, take the first available right_question and pair them.\n\nSimilarly for the right_remaining_specific and left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired in any way (each left ? with a right ?).\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For phase 2:\n\n   a. For each left_remaining_specific (specific color), pair with right_question.\n\n      For example, take the first available left_remaining_specific and first available right_question.\n\n      Repeat until either all left_remaining_specific are paired or all right_question are used.\n\n   b. Do the same for right_remaining_specific and left_question.\n\n   c. Then, pair the remaining left_question and right_question. The number of pairs here is min(len(left_question), len(right_question)).\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nBut perhaps during phase 1, we can track which boots are already used. So, for each boot (left or right), we can have a boolean array indicating whether it's been used.\n\nYes, that's necessary.\n\nSo, the overall plan is:\n\nInitialize two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, during phase 1:\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   Get the list of left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i].\n\n   Get the list of right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i].\n\n   Then, for each pair (left_index, right_index) in zip(left_list, right_list), mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nBut how to collect the left_list and right_list for each color.\n\nWait, perhaps during phase 1, we can process each color and for each, pair as many as possible.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps precompute for each color, the list of indices, and then during phase 1, process them in order, and for each color, pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to manage the order. For example, for color 'a', we can pair as many as possible between left and right, then move on to 'b', etc.\n\nBut in code, perhaps for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   Then, for each pair in zip(left_list, right_list), pair them.\n\nBut this would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not acceptable for n=150,000.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for each color, generating the list of left and right indices would take O(n) time per color, leading to O(26n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each color, the code would have to process the current left and right indices that are not used yet.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternative approach: for each color, precompute a list of indices, and then during phase 1, process them with pointers.\n\nFor example, for each color c, have a pointer into the list of left indices and right indices. Initially, the pointer starts at 0. For each color, we can pair as many as possible between the left and right.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. Wait, perhaps during phase 1, we can process each color, and for each, pair the left and right indices in their respective lists, as long as they are not yet used.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is:\n\nWe can have for each color c, a list of left indices (without considering usage) and a list of right indices (without considering usage). Then, during phase 1, for each color, we can pair as many as possible between the left and right lists, but ensuring that each index is used only once.\n\nBut how to track that. For example, for color 'a', the left list has indices [0, 2, 5], and the right list has [3, 4]. Then, we can pair 0 with 3, 2 with 4, and leave 5 unpaired.\n\nSo, during phase 1, for each color, we can process the left and right lists, and pair them in order.\n\nBut how to track which indices are already used. Well, during phase 1, we can process each color, and for each left and right index in their lists, check if they are not yet used. If they are not used, pair them.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. Because for each color, we need to check all the left and right indices in their lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during phase 1, we can process the colors in a certain order and for each color, pair the left and right indices in their lists, and mark them as used. But how to avoid reprocessing them.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each color c, we can have a list of left indices (precomputed), and a list of right indices (precomputed). Then, during phase 1, for each color c, we can iterate through the left and right lists, and pair them as long as they haven't been used yet.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. For example, for color 'a', the left list is [0, 2, 5], and the right list is [3, 4]. We can have two pointers, left_ptr and right_ptr, starting at 0. Then, while left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list), check if the left index is not used and the right index is not used. If so, pair them and increment both pointers. Else, increment the pointer that points to a used index.\n\nBut this would require checking for each index whether it is used. However, since during phase 1, we are processing each color once, and the used arrays are initially all false, this approach would work.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Another approach is to process each color in order, and for each color, pair as many as possible between the left and right indices, but in a way that once they are paired, they are marked as used and not considered again.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of the following code structure:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False.\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c]\n\n   right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c]\n\n   i = 0  # pointer for left_indices\n\n   j = 0  # pointer for right_indices\n\n   while i < len(left_indices) and j < len(right_indices):\n\n       left_idx = left_indices[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_indices[j]\n\n       if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n           # pair them\n\n           used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n           used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n           add to the result list\n\n           i += 1\n\n           j += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           # move the pointer which is used\n\n           if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n               i += 1\n\n           else:\n\n               j += 1\n\nBut this would not work correctly. Because for example, if the left index is already used, then we need to move i. But how do we know that? Because the left_indices list is precomputed, but some of them may have been used in previous steps.\n\nThis approach would miss some possible pairs. For example, if a left index was used in a previous color's processing, but in the current color's processing, we have to skip it.\n\nBut this approach would process the left and right indices for color c, but only pair them if they are not used. However, this would not be efficient for large n.\n\nAlternatively, during phase 1, for each color c, we can collect the left indices that are not used and have color c, and similarly for the right. Then, pair them in order.\n\nBut how to collect them. For example, during phase 1, for color c:\n\nleft_candidates = [i for i in left_indices if not used_left[i]]\n\nright_candidates = [i for i in right_indices if not used_right[i]]\n\nthen pair them as min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates)).\n\nBut this would require for each color, to generate these candidates. However, for n=150,000 and 26 letters, this would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut even this could be optimized. For example, precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. Then, during phase 1, for each color, process the left and right lists, and pair them as long as they are not used.\n\nBut the problem is that once a left index is used in a previous color's processing, it's not available anymore.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = precomputed_left[c]\n\n    right_list = precomputed_right[c]\n\n    i = 0\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n            # pair them\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            result.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n            i += 1\n\n            j += 1\n\n        elif used_left[left_idx]:\n\n            i += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            j += 1\n\nBut this would work? Let's see. For example, if left_list is [0, 2, 5], and right_list is [3,4], then during the first iteration, i=0, j=0. Check if 0 and 3 are unused. If yes, pair them. Then i=1, j=1. Check 2 and 4. If they are unused, pair. Then i=2, j=2. Now, j is beyond len(right_list), so loop ends. The remaining left indices (5) are not processed here.\n\nBut in this code, for each color, we process the left and right lists in order, and pair them if they are not used. However, this approach may not pair all possible pairs. For example, if a left index is not used, but the right index is used. Then, the code would skip the left index and move to the next.\n\nBut this is okay, since the right index is already used. However, this approach may not be optimal. For example, suppose we have left indices [0, 1] and right indices [0, 1]. Suppose during processing, the code checks left 0 and right 0. They are not used, so paired. Then left 1 and right 1 are paired. All good.\n\nBut if the code checks left 0 and right 1 first. Then, if they are not used, paired. Then left 1 and right 0 are paired. So the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the order, the code would pair as many as possible for that color.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each color, the maximum possible pairs are made. This approach should do that, since for each color, we process all possible pairs between the left and right indices of that color, and pair them in order.\n\nBut this code may not be efficient for large n. However, since the loops are O(n) per color, and there are 26 colors, it's manageable.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, we can proceed to phase 2.\n\nNow, phase 2: process the remaining ?s.\n\nFor this, collect all left indices that are not used and have l[i] == '?', and same for right.\n\nThen, we can pair them with:\n\na) remaining right specific colors (but they have not been paired yet), or\n\nb) remaining left specific colors (but they have not been paired yet), or\n\nc) remaining ?s.\n\nSo, the order here is important. For example, pairing a left ? with a right specific color (which can't be paired with anything else) is better than leaving them for pairing with other ?s.\n\nSo, for phase 2:\n\nFirst, process left ?s and pair them with right specific colors.\n\nThen, process right ?s and pair them with left specific colors.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s with each other.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nCollect all left_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nCollect all right_question = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nAlso, collect all left_remaining_specific = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nCollect all right_remaining_specific = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nNow, for each left in left_question, try to pair with a right_remaining_specific.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in right_question, try to pair with a left_remaining_specific.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nFor example:\n\nTake the left_question list and the right_remaining_specific list.\n\nFor each left in left_question:\n\n   if there is a right in right_remaining_specific that is not used, pair them.\n\nBut how to find that. Well, for the right_remaining_specific list, we can process them in order.\n\nSo, for phase 2a:\n\ni = 0 (pointer for left_question)\n\nj = 0 (pointer for right_remaining_specific)\n\nwhile i < len(left_question) and j < len(right_remaining_specific):\n\n   left_idx = left_question[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_remaining_specific[j]\n\n   if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n       pair them.\n\n       mark used.\n\n       i += 1\n\n       j += 1\n\n   else:\n\n       # move the pointer which is used\n\n       if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n           i += 1\n\n       else:\n\n           j += 1\n\nSimilarly for phase 2b: pair right_question with left_remaining_specific.\n\nThen, phase 2c: pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nBut again, how to collect the remaining left_question and right_question after phase 2a and 2b.\n\nAlternatively, during phase 2a and 2b, we can process the lists in a similar way as phase 1.\n\nBut how to collect the right_remaining_specific and left_remaining_specific.\n\nWait, after phase 1, the right_remaining_specific is all the right indices that are not used and have a specific color (not ?). Similarly for left_remaining_specific.\n\nBut during phase 2a, we can process left_question and right_remaining_specific.\n\nBut how to get right_remaining_specific. Well, perhaps during phase 1, we can precompute for each color, the list of right indices. But after phase 1, the used_right array is updated, so for the right_remaining_specific, we can collect them as follows:\n\nright_remaining_specific = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nBut for n=150,000, this would be O(n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps during phase 2a, we can process the left_question and right_remaining_specific as follows:\n\nFor each left in left_question:\n\n   for each right in right_remaining_specific:\n\n       if not used, pair them.\n\nBut again, this would be O(n^2) in worst case.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to process the right_remaining_specific in a way similar to phase 1.\n\nBut how to collect the right_remaining_specific. For example, during phase 2a, we can have a list of right_remaining_specific, and process them in order, trying to pair with left_question in order.\n\nSo, during phase 2a:\n\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for each left in left_question and right in right_remaining:\n\n   pair them if not used.\n\nBut again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nFor phase 2a, iterate through the left_question and right_remaining, and pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut to do this, perhaps use two pointers.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\ni = 0  # pointer for left_question\n\nj = 0  # pointer for right_remaining\n\nwhile i < len(left_question) and j < len(right_remaining):\n\n    left_idx = left_question[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_remaining[j]\n\n    if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n        # pair them\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n        result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n        i += 1\n\n        j += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # move the pointer that is used\n\n        if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n            i += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            j += 1\n\nThis is similar to phase 1's approach.\n\nBut how to collect left_question and right_remaining.\n\nBut this requires that during phase 2a, we have the left_question and right_remaining lists.\n\nOnce phase 2a is done, we can do phase 2b, which is similar but with left_remaining and right_question.\n\nThen, phase 2c: pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nSo, after phase 2a and 2b, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, for phase 2c, we can pair them in any way, as long as each is used once.\n\nFor example, take the first k elements of left_question and right_question, where k is the minimum of the two lengths.\n\nBut again, using two pointers.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nleft_question_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_question_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\ni = 0\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile i < len(left_question_remaining) and j < len(right_question_remaining):\n\n    left_idx = left_question_remaining[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_question_remaining[j]\n\n    if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n        # pair them\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n        result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n        i += 1\n\n        j += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # move the pointer which is used\n\n        if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n            i += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            j += 1\n\nBut this seems redundant. Because during phase 2a and 2b, we already processed the left_question and right_remaining, but perhaps some left_question are still available, and same for right_question.\n\nBut this approach would pair them.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe overall steps are:\n\n- Precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\n- Phase 1: process each color, pair as much as possible between left and right.\n\n- Collect the remaining left and right indices with specific colors and ?.\n\n- Phase 2a: pair left ? with right specific colors.\n\n- Phase 2b: pair right ? with left specific colors.\n\n- Phase 2c: pair remaining ?s.\n\nNow, the question is, how to collect the lists for phase 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, even generating these lists multiple times is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn = 10\n\nl = \"codeforces\"\n\nr = \"dodivthree\"\n\nSample Output 1 is 5 pairs.\n\nBut how to process this.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly find the pairs.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process as described, and output the pairs.\n\nNow, considering the code structure in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, the code must be efficient. However, in Python, even O(n) operations are acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l string.\n\nRead r string.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False, length n.\n\nPrecompute for each color (a-z), the list of left indices and right indices.\n\nFor example, pre_left = defaultdict(list), pre_right = defaultdict(list).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = l[i]\n\n    pre_left[c].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = r[i]\n\n    pre_right[c].append(i)\n\nThen, phase 1:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = pre_left[c]\n\n    right_list = pre_right[c]\n\n    i = 0\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n            i += 1\n\n            j += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n                i += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                j += 1\n\nWait, but this code would not work as intended. Because, for example, if the left_list is [0, 1], and during phase 1, the first element (0) was already used in a previous color's processing (like, say, for color 'c'), then the code would increment i and move to the next element.\n\nBut in this code, the left_list and right_list are precomputed for each color, which includes all indices for that color, regardless of their usage. Thus, during phase 1, for color 'c', the code may process indices that were already used in previous steps (e.g., if they are part of a different color's processing).\n\nWait, no. For example, if a left index is part of color 'a' and was used in phase 1 for color 'a', then during processing of color 'b', the code would check if it's used. But in this code, the left_list for color 'b' would not contain that index, since the color is 'b'.\n\nAh, right. Because pre_left[c] is the list of indices where the color is c. So, for each color, the code is only processing those indices. So, for example, during phase 1, when processing color 'a', the left_list is all indices with l[i] == 'a'. Those indices are not used for other colors, since they are part of their own color's list.\n\nBut during phase 1, when processing color 'a', the code may pair some of them. Then, when processing color 'b', the left_list for 'b' contains only indices where l[i] == 'b', which are not part of the 'a' list. So, the code would not process them again.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, then collect the left_question and right_question.\n\nBut how?\n\nAfter phase 1, we need to collect the remaining left and right indices with specific colors and ?s.\n\nBut for phase 2a, we need to collect the left_question (those not used and have l[i] == '?'), and the right_remaining_specific (those not used and have r[i] != '?').\n\nSimilarly for phase 2b.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nIn Python, for phase 2a:\n\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, process them with two pointers as before.\n\nSimilarly for phase 2b.\n\nThen, collect left_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_question = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nProcess them.\n\nFinally, collect the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nBut this may be time-consuming for large n. However, since it's done once after phase 1, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nBut for the code, the main steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right.\n\npre_left and pre_right as defaultdict(list) for each color.\n\nThen, process phase 1.\n\nThen, collect left_question, right_remaining, etc.\n\nThen, process phase 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nBut for the phase 1 processing, the code for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\nBut in Python, how to iterate over all lowercase letters.\n\nWe can do:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\nBut for each color, process the left and right lists.\n\nNow, the code for phase 1:\n\nresult = []\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\npre_left = defaultdict(list)\n\npre_right = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_left[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    pre_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = pre_left[c]\n\n    right_list = pre_right[c]\n\n    i = 0\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            result.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n            i += 1\n\n            j += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            if used_left[left_idx]:\n\n                i += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                j += 1\n\nBut wait, this code is not correct. Because for each color c, the left_list and right_list are the precomputed lists for that color. However, during phase 1, the code may have already used some of these indices in previous iterations. For example, suppose during processing of color 'a', some indices were used. Then, during processing of color 'b', the code will check the same left_list (for color 'b') and see if the indices are used.\n\nBut this code is correct. Because for each color, the left_list contains indices where the color is c. So, during phase 1, for each color, the code pairs as many as possible between left and right indices of that color.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, proceed to phase 2.\n\nThen, collect:\n\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if r[i",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors.

This helps in efficiently finding compatible pairs.\n2. **Phase 1 - Specific Color Matching**: For each specific color (from 'a' to 'z'), we try to pair left boots with right boots of the same color. This ensures that we use up all possible specific color matches first.\n3. **Phase 2 - Indefinite Color Matching**: After handling specific colors, we handle the remaining indefinite ('?') colored boots.
