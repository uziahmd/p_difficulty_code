Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constraints: n can be up to 150,000, which means that any O(n²) approach is out of the question. So we need an efficient way to process this.\n\nThe key here is to find compatible pairs. Let's break down the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') can only pair with another specific 'a' or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'.\n\nSo, the plan is to match the boots in a way that maximizes the count. How?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. First, try to pair the specific colors with their matching counterparts. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The minimum of these two would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts, and handle the remaining with the '?'s.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Also, the '?'s can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we should first process the specific colors, then use the '?'s to cover the remaining.\n\nBut how do we manage the '?'s? Let's think:\n\nFor each color c (excluding '?'), we can pair left[c] with right[c]. But after that, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the '?'s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can process all possible pairs where one is a specific color and the other is a '?', but that might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a bipartite graph matching problem, but with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hungarian would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), match as many as possible between left and right. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Then, the remaining right 'a's can't be paired with left 'a's anymore, but they could be matched with '?'s on the left or right.\n\nBut wait, after pairing specific colors, we can have left and right '?'s. Also, the '?'s can be used to match with other '?'s or specific colors.\n\nSo here's a possible plan:\n\nStep 1: Count the number of left and right boots for each color (excluding '?'). For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can pair them. Then, subtract these from the left and right counts. The remaining left and right boots will be those that couldn't be matched with their specific color counterparts.\n\nBut then, after that, we have the remaining left and right boots. These include the '?'s and any leftover specific colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nStep 2: Now, the remaining left and right boots can be matched using the '?'s. How?\n\nEach '?' can be matched with any other boot. So for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n- For each left '?' and right '?', pair them. But how many can we pair?\n\nBut also, the remaining left and right boots may have some specific colors. For example, if there's a left 'a' and a right '?', we can pair them. Similarly, if there's a left '?' and a right 'a', we can pair them. Also, a left '?' and a right '?' can be paired.\n\nSo the idea is to first pair the specific colors with '?'s. But how to maximize the total.\n\nLet me think again. After step 1, we have:\n\nleft_remaining: a dictionary where for each color (including '?'), we have the count of left boots not yet paired.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nNow, the remaining left and right boots can be paired in the following way:\n\nWe can pair left '?' with right non-? (specific colors) and vice versa. Also, pair left non-? with right ? (if the non-? is already in the left_remaining, but that's not possible because step 1 already handled that).\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, for each color c (non-?), we have already paired as many as possible between left and right. So the remaining left and right for color c would be zero if the left and right counts were equal. Otherwise, suppose left has more than right for color c. Then, the remaining left has some c's, but the right has zero. So those left c's can't be paired with right's c's anymore. However, they can be paired with right's '?'.\n\nSo, after step 1, the left and right have some remaining counts. The next step is to pair as much as possible between the remaining left and right boots, considering that '?' can be used as wildcards.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\n- For each color c (non-?), take the left_remaining[c] and pair them with right_remaining['?'].\n\nSimilarly, take right_remaining[c] and pair them with left_remaining['?'].\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nBut since we want maximum pairs, perhaps we can first pair the non-? boots with ?s.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1, for the remaining left and right:\n\n- For each color c (non-?), the number of left_remaining[c] is the number of left boots with color c that are not yet paired. Similarly for right_remaining[c].\n\nWe can pair these left_remaining[c] with right_remaining['?'], and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nWe can first process all non-? colors in left_remaining and see if they can be paired with right_remaining's '?'. For example, for each color c in left_remaining (non-?), the number of left boots with c is l_c. Each of these can be paired with a '?', so we can take min(l_c, right_question_marks) and pair them. Then, subtract that from right_question_marks and l_c.\n\nSimilarly, for the right_remaining's non-? colors, we can pair them with left_question_marks.\n\nBut perhaps the order matters. For example, if we first pair left non-? with right ?, then pair right non-? with left ?, that's better.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nleft_q = number of '?' in left_remaining\n\nright_q = number of '?' in right_remaining\n\nFor the non-? colors in left_remaining:\n\nfor each color c in left_remaining:\n\n   available_left_c = left_remaining[c]\n\n   available_right_q = right_q\n\n   pairs = min(available_left_c, available_right_q)\n\n   add pairs to total\n\n   subtract pairs from available_left_c and available_right_q.\n\nSimilarly, for non-? colors in right_remaining:\n\nfor each color c in right_remaining:\n\n   available_right_c = right_remaining[c]\n\n   available_left_q = left_q\n\n   pairs = min(available_right_c, available_left_q)\n\n   add pairs to total\n\n   subtract pairs from available_right_c and available_left_q.\n\nBut then, after that, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(left_q, right_q).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut how to track the left_remaining and right_remaining. Also, the problem requires that we not only compute the maximum number of pairs, but also output the actual pairs.\n\nHmm, but for the output part, we need to track which indices are paired. That complicates things, because we can't just count, but need to collect the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the initial approach of counting is okay for the maximum number of pairs, but when it comes to generating the actual pairs, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nThis suggests that the approach needs to be modified to track the actual indices.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c (non-?), collect the list of left indices and right indices.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between left and right for that color. For example, for color 'a', take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Then, mark those indices as used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left and right indices (those that weren't paired in step 1) for each color, including '?'.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right, process the non-? colors and pair them with ?s.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used.\n\nThis seems complex, but manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, for the input, we have two strings l and r. Each character represents the color of a left or right boot.\n\nWe need to collect for each color (including '?') the list of indices for left and right boots.\n\nFor example, for left boots, we can have a dictionary where key is the color, value is a list of indices (1-based or 0-based? Well, the output uses 1-based indices).\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can proceed.\n\nStep 1: Pair same-colored non-? boots.\n\nFor each color c in left (excluding '?'), check if c exists in right. For each such c, take the minimum between the number of left and right boots for c, and pair them.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color 'a', left has [1, 2, 3], right has [4, 5]. Then, we can pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5. The third left 'a' is left unpaired.\n\nSo, for each color c (not '?'), we can iterate through the left and right lists, and pair as many as possible.\n\nOnce paired, we need to mark those indices as used, so they are not considered again.\n\nBut to track this, perhaps we can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, which are booleans indicating whether the index is already paired.\n\nBut for large n, this is feasible.\n\nSo, let's think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False, size n.\n\nFor each color c in left (excluding '?'), collect the list of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for right.\n\nFor each color c in the set of all possible colors (excluding '?'):\n\n   left_list = list of left indices with color c.\n\n   right_list = list of right indices with color c.\n\n   for i in 0 to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) -1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\n       add to the result list.\n\nThis will pair as many same-colored boots as possible.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not used yet), we need to pair them using '?'.\n\nNow, for the remaining left boots, some have color '?', others have specific colors. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, we need to pair the remaining left and right boots, considering that '?' can be used as wildcards.\n\nHow to do this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can collect all the left boots not used yet, and separate them into two groups: those with specific colors (non-?) and those with '?'.\n\nSimilarly for the right boots.\n\nFor the specific color left boots (non-?), they can be paired with right '?' boots.\n\nSimilarly, specific color right boots can be paired with left '?' boots.\n\nAdditionally, the '?' boots can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, the approach here is:\n\nCollect:\n\nleft_non_q = list of left indices not used and with color != '?'\n\nleft_q = list of left indices not used and with color == '?'\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q and right_q.\n\nNow, for each left_non_q entry, which has color c, we can pair it with any right_q entry (since the right_q is '?', which can match any color). Similarly for right_non_q entries.\n\nSo, we can process these:\n\nFor each left_non_q element, try to pair it with a right_q element. Once a right_q is used, it can't be used again.\n\nSimilarly, for each right_non_q element, pair it with a left_q element.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Process left_non_q with right_q:\n\n   For each left index in left_non_q, take the first available right_q index and pair them.\n\n   For example, for each left in left_non_q:\n\n       if there are any right_q not used:\n\n           pair left with right_q[0], mark both as used.\n\n           remove the right_q[0] from the list.\n\n2. Similarly, process right_non_q with left_q:\n\n   For each right in right_non_q:\n\n       if there are any left_q not used:\n\n           pair right with left_q[0], mark both as used.\n\n           remove left_q[0] from the list.\n\n3. Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\n   Take min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs. For each i in 0..min-1:\n\n       pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nSo, the order here is important. For example, processing left_non_q with right_q first, then right_non_q with left_q, then the remaining q's.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut how to collect left_non_q and left_q.\n\nOnce the initial pairing is done, for each left index, if not used, check its color. Similarly for right.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to collect these lists efficiently.\n\nOnce the initial step is done, we can loop through all left indices, and for each not used, add to left_non_q or left_q.\n\nSame for right.\n\nOnce these lists are built, proceed as above.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. The left_used and right_used arrays can be used for that.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the actual pairs, not just count them.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nThen, create left_used and right_used arrays of size n, initialized to False.\n\nCreate a list of pairs, initially empty.\n\nFirst, process same-colored non-? pairs.\n\nTo do that, for each color c in 'a' to 'z', we can collect the left and right indices.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i+1)  # assuming 1-based index\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i+1)\n\nWait, but for the initial step, we need to process all colors except '?'. So for each color c in left_color_map (excluding '?'), we can process the same for right_color_map.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to collect all colors for left and right, including '?', but then during the initial pairing, only process non-? colors.\n\nSo, for the first step:\n\nfor c in left_color_map:\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c in right_color_map:\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n            left_used[left_idx-1] = True\n            right_used[right_idx-1] = True\n\nWait, but the left_color_map and right_color_map are built based on the original l and r strings. However, the indices in the lists may not be in order. But for the pairing, it doesn't matter which ones are paired as long as they are compatible.\n\nBut in this approach, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built once, and the lists are stored. However, after pairing, the indices are marked as used, and not considered in later steps.\n\nBut this approach is not correct. Because, for example, if we have multiple colors, and for each color, we pair as much as possible. However, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any pairing, so they contain all the indices for each color. But once some are paired, they are marked as used. However, the code above would process all colors, and for each color, pair as many as possible. However, the code may have overlapping pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, the code for color 'a' pairs left 'a's with right 'a's. Then, when processing color 'b', the left 'b's and right 'b's are processed. But the left_used and right_used arrays prevent the same indices from being used again.\n\nBut in this approach, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any pairing. So, for example, if a left index is in the left_color_map for 'a', and is paired in the first step, it's marked as used, and not considered in further steps. However, the lists in left_color_map and right_color_map contain all the indices for that color, even those that have been used.\n\nThis is a problem. Because, for example, in the code above, when processing color 'a', we take the entire left_list and right_list, which may include indices that have already been used in previous steps. But since we have left_used and right_used arrays, we can check if they are already used. However, in this code, the code would pair the first num_pairs elements, but some of them may have been used already.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_color_map is built before any pairing. So, the left_list contains all left indices with color c. However, during the initial processing, the code may have already marked some of them as used. For example, if a left index was part of a previous color's pairing. But that's not possible, since the code processes each color in sequence. Wait, but the code for the first step is processing each color in left_color_map. However, the left_color_map includes all colors, including those that may have been processed earlier. For example, if a left index is part of color 'a', and then later, when processing color 'b', the code would process the left indices for 'b', which are not yet used. However, during the processing of 'a', the code pairs left 'a's with right 'a's, and marks them as used. So, when processing other colors, the code would not pair those indices again.\n\nBut the problem is that in the code I wrote earlier, for a given color c, the left_list and right_list contain all indices for that color, regardless of whether they have been used. So, when we process color c, the code would pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. However, some of those indices may have already been used in earlier steps.\n\nThis is incorrect. Because the code would pair indices that are already used.\n\nSo, this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: for each color c in left and right, collect the indices, but during the pairing process, only consider those indices that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nPerhaps, during the initial step, for each color c (non-?), we collect the list of left indices and right indices that are not yet used. Then, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nBut for large n, this could be expensive if done naively. However, perhaps for the initial step, we can process each color once, and for each color, collect the unused indices.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is not the best. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe can process the same-colored pairs first, but for each color, collect the indices, and then pair them in a way that they are not yet used.\n\nSo, for each color c (non-?), we can:\n\nleft_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\nright_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\nthen, pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this approach would be O(n * 26) which is acceptable, since 1.5e5 * 26 is 3.9e6 operations.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut for each color, the code would need to loop through all the indices and check if they are not used and have the color c. This would be O(n) per color, which is O(26n) in total.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by pre-building for each color the list of indices, and then during the pairing process, track which indices in the list are still available.\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, for the initial step, let's pre-process for each color c, the list of left and right indices, and then during pairing, track which indices have been used.\n\nSo, for example, for left_color_map, we have for each color c, a list of indices. Then, during the initial pairing, for each color c (non-?), we process the left and right lists, and for each index in the list, check if it's not used. If not, pair them.\n\nBut how to manage that.\n\nLet me think of the code:\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c not in right_color_map:\n        continue\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n    # Now, for each index in left_list and right_list, check if not used.\n    # Pair as much as possible.\n    # Let's have pointers for left and right.\n    # For example, for left_list, iterate through each index, and if not used, try to pair with right_list's next available index.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can process each color c (non-?), and for each left index in left_color_map[c], and each right index in right_color_map[c], pair them as long as they are not used. But this is O(n) per color.\n\nBut perhaps we can use two pointers approach.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor color c:\n\nleft_ptr = 0\n\nright_ptr = 0\n\nwhile left_ptr < len(left_list) and right_ptr < len(right_list):\n\n    left_idx = left_list[left_ptr]\n\n    right_idx = right_list[right_ptr]\n\n    if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n        left_ptr +=1\n\n        right_ptr +=1\n\n    elif left_used[left_idx]:\n\n        left_ptr +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        right_ptr +=1\n\nBut this is not correct, because for example, if left_ptr is pointing to an index that is already used, we need to skip it. However, this approach may not work because the left_list and right_list are ordered in the way they were added (based on the original order of the string), but during the pairing process, some of them may have been used already.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because for each color c, we go through the left and right indices in order, and pair them if they are not used.\n\nBut this would require for each color c, to loop through the left and right lists, and for each index, check if they are used.\n\nBut for large n, this could be O(n) per color, leading to O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce this is done, then the remaining left and right indices are those that are not used, and we proceed to the second step.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nOnce the initial pairing is done, we then need to collect the remaining left and right indices.\n\nSo, after that, the next steps are:\n\nCollect all left indices not used and with color '?', and all left indices not used with color not '?'.\n\nSame for right.\n\nThen, process the left_non_q and right_q, then right_non_q and left_q, then the remaining q's.\n\nBut again, for this, we need to collect those indices.\n\nSo, after the initial step, we can collect:\n\nleft_non_q = []\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i]:\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_non_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_q.append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q and right_q.\n\nThen, for each left_non_q index (which has color c != '?'), we can try to pair it with a right_q index.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nFor example, for each left index in left_non_q:\n\n   if there are any right_q indices not used:\n\n       pair them.\n\nSo, we can have a pointer for right_q, say j=0.\n\nfor i in range(len(left_non_q)):\n\n    left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n\n    if j < len(right_q):\n\n        right_idx = right_q[j]\n\n        if not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n            pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n            j +=1\n\nSimilarly, for the right_non_q:\n\nk = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(right_non_q)):\n\n    right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n\n    if k < len(left_q):\n\n        left_idx = left_q[k]\n\n        if not left_used[left_idx]:\n\n            pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n            k +=1\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nthe number of pairs is min(len(left_q) - k, len(right_q) - j).\n\nWait, but after the previous steps, j and k may have advanced. So, after pairing left_non_q with right_q and right_non_q with left_q, the remaining left_q and right_q are those not used yet.\n\nSo, for the remaining left_q and right_q, we can pair them as follows:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not left_used[i]]\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in right_q if not right_used[i]]\n\nthen, take the first min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nAlternatively, during the previous steps, the j and k variables may have already advanced. For example, after processing left_non_q with right_q, j points to the next available right_q index. Similarly for k.\n\nSo, after that, the remaining right_q is from j onwards. Similarly for left_q.\n\nThus, for the remaining left_q and right_q, we can pair them as:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q) - k, len(right_q) - j )):\n\n    left_idx = left_q[k + i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q[j + i]\n\n    pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut need to ensure that these indices are not used.\n\nBut since during the previous steps, the left_used and right_used arrays are updated, we can assume that the indices in left_q and right_q are not used yet. Because during the processing of left_non_q and right_non_q, the code only pairs them if the indices are not used.\n\nWait, no. The left_q and right_q lists were collected after the initial step. So, during the initial step, the left_used and right_used arrays were marked for the indices that were paired. So, during the collection of left_q and right_q, the indices in left_q are those not used and with color '?'. Similarly for right_q.\n\nSo, during the processing of left_non_q with right_q, the code pairs them. For example, for each left_non_q index, if there is a right_q index not used, we pair them. The code for that is:\n\nj = 0\n\nfor left_idx in left_non_q:\n\n    if j < len(right_q):\n\n        right_idx = right_q[j]\n\n        if not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n            pair them\n\n            mark as used\n\n            j +=1\n\nBut the right_q list was collected after the initial step, so all the indices in right_q are not used. Therefore, the check for right_used is redundant. So, we can safely pair them.\n\nWait, yes. Because during the collection of right_q, we have:\n\nright_q contains indices not used, and with color '?'. So, during the processing of left_non_q with right_q, the right_used for those indices is False.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without checking.\n\nSo, the code for this part would be:\n\nj = 0\n\nfor left_idx in left_non_q:\n\n    if j < len(right_q):\n\n        right_idx = right_q[j]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n        j +=1\n\nSimilarly for the right_non_q and left_q.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q, we can pair them:\n\nstart from j and k (but in the previous steps, j and k may have advanced).\n\nWait, no. The j variable was used for processing left_non_q with right_q. After that, the remaining right_q is from j onwards. Similarly, the k variable was used for processing right_non_q with left_q.\n\nBut after that, the remaining left_q and right_q are:\n\nleft_q_remaining = left_q[k:]\n\nright_q_remaining = right_q[j:]\n\nSo, the number of pairs is min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)).\n\nSo, for i in range( min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)) ):\n\n    left_idx = left_q_remaining[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q_remaining[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    mark as used.\n\nBut again, since the left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining are from the lists that were collected after initial steps, and during the processing of left_non_q and right_non_q, the indices in those lists may have been partially used. Wait, no. Because during the processing of left_non_q with right_q, the code uses j to iterate through the right_q list. So, after that, the right_q_remaining starts at j. However, those indices in right_q[j:] are not used, since during the processing of left_non_q, we only used the first j elements.\n\nSo, the code for pairing the remaining left_q and right_q is:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q) - k, len(right_q) - j )):\n\n    left_idx = left_q[k + i]\n\n    right_idx = right_q[j + i]\n\n    pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut how to get k and j?\n\nActually, during the processing of left_non_q with right_q, j is incremented as we pair them. So after that, the remaining right_q is from j onwards. Similarly, during the processing of right_non_q with left_q, k is incremented as we pair them. So after that, the remaining left_q is from k onwards.\n\nSo, for the final step:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[k:]\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[j:]\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q) )):\n\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( ... )\n\nThus, this would pair as many as possible.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nCreate left_color_map and right_color_map as defaultdict(list), where for each index, we store the color.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c == '?': continue\n\n    if c not in right_color_map: continue\n\n    process the left and right indices for color c.\n\nBut how to process them. For example, for each color c, iterate through the left and right indices and pair them if not used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. For this, the code can be:\n\nfor c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c == '?': continue\n\n    if c not in right_color_map: continue\n\n    left_list = left_color_map[c]\n\n    right_list = right_color_map[c]\n\n    # Now, for each index in left_list and right_list, check if not used.\n\n    # Use two pointers approach.\n\n    i = 0\n\n    j = 0\n\n    while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[j]\n\n        if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n\n            # pair them\n\n            pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n            i +=1\n\n            j +=1\n\n        elif left_used[left_idx]:\n\n            i +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            j +=1\n\nThis way, for each color c, we pair as many as possible between the left and right indices for that color.\n\nOnce this is done, collect the left_non_q, left_q, right_non_q, right_q:\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process left_non_q with right_q:\n\nj = 0\n\nfor left_idx in left_non_q:\n\n    if j < len(right_q):\n\n        right_idx = right_q[j]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n        j +=1\n\nThen, process right_non_q with left_q:\n\nk = 0\n\nfor right_idx in right_non_q:\n\n    if k < len(left_q):\n\n        left_idx = left_q[k]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n        k +=1\n\nFinally, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[k:]\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q[j:]\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q) ) ):\n\n    left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThis seems like a viable approach.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, the sample input has multiple cases. Let's look at the first case:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nThe output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut let's see how the code would process this.\n\nFirst, the left_color_map and right_color_map would be built for each character.\n\nFor l = 'codeforces':\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0: 'c'\n\n1: 'o'\n\n2: 'd'\n\n3: 'e'\n\n4: 'f'\n\n5: 'o'\n\n6: 'r'\n\n7: 'c'\n\n8: 'e'\n\n9: 's'\n\nSimilarly for r = 'dodivthree'.\n\nBut let's not go into details. The code would process same-colored pairs first.\n\nFor example, 'c' appears in left at positions 0,7. In right, 'd', 'o', etc. Let's assume that during the first step, some pairs are made.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left and right boots are processed.\n\nBut regardless, the code should compute the maximum number of pairs.\n\nNow, for the code, the main issue is to collect the pairs correctly.\n\nNow, the code also needs to output the pairs. So, the pairs list is built as described.\n\nNow, for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False]*n.\n\nBuild left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nProcess same-colored pairs.\n\nThen collect the remaining left_non_q, left_q, etc.\n\nThen process the remaining.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, building left_color_map and right_color_map is O(n) time.\n\nBut for the first step, for each color c in left_color_map, which may be up to 26 letters, and for each, process the left and right lists with two pointers.\n\nBut in Python, this should be manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Read the next line?

Wait, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case.
