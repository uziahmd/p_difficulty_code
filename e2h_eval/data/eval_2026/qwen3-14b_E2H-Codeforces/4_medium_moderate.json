The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nThe input is n, then the two sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: Nikephoros's red spots (so his losses) and Polycarpus's red spots (his losses).\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model each round. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then determine who wins.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need an efficient way to calculate the total number of losses for each player without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, and compute how many times each pattern occurs in the total rounds.\n\nLet me think about the sequences. For each round, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[j % k], where k is the length of B. Wait, but for the rounds, each round is sequential. So for round 0, it's A[0], B[0]. Round 1: A[1], B[1]. Round 2: A[2], B[2]. And so on. But since the sequences are cycled, for round t, the moves are A[t mod m] and B[t mod k].\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for each t in 0..n-1, what's the outcome between A[t mod m] and B[t mod k].\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't check each t. So we need to find the number of times each possible pair (a, b) occurs, where a is from A and b is from B, and then compute for each such pair how many times it contributes to a loss for Nikephoros or Polycarpus.\n\nWait, but how do the pairs (a, b) repeat? Because the sequences A and B are periodic. So the combined sequence of (A's move, B's move) would have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = L. So in each L rounds, the pattern of (a, b) pairs repeats.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L. So in each L rounds, the same sequence of (a, b) pairs occurs.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L, and the remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\nFor each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply by total_cycles. Then process the remaining rem rounds separately.\n\nSo first, we need to compute for each possible pair (a, b) in the combined sequence of L rounds, how many times each player loses.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think. For each of the L rounds, we can compute the move of A and B, and determine the outcome. Then count for each of the full cycles.\n\nBut since L can be up to m*k (since LCM(m, k) can be as big as m*k, when m and k are coprime). Since m and k can be up to 1000, then L can be up to 1e6. Which is manageable because 1e6 is acceptable for processing once.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n2. Compute L = LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So need to compute GCD.\n\n3. For each of the L rounds, compute the moves of A and B. For each round t (from 0 to L-1):\n\n   a_t = A[t % m]\n\n   b_t = B[t % k]\n\n   Determine who wins between a_t and b_t.\n\n   For each of these, count how many times Nikephoros loses (add to his count) and how many times Polycarpus loses (add to his count).\n\n4. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L.\n\n   The number of full cycles contributions is (full_cycle_nik, full_cycle_poly) = (count_nik * total_cycles, count_poly * total_cycles).\n\n5. Then, process the remaining rem = n % L rounds (from 0 to rem-1). For each of these, compute the moves and add to the counts.\n\nSo the total counts are full_cycle counts plus the rem counts.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut first, how to compute the LCM and GCD.\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which is fine here. Also, since m and k are positive.\n\nSo:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle cases where a or b is zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3; B is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nLCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for each of the 12 rounds, we compute the moves and count the losses.\n\nThen, n=7. So total_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. rem =7. So we process the first 7 rounds of the 12-round cycle.\n\nBut how to compute for each of the L rounds?\n\nSo, for t in 0 to L-1:\n\na = A[t % m]\n\nb = B[t % k]\n\nThen check the outcome between a and b.\n\nNow, how to determine the outcome between a and b.\n\nLet me think. For each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: draw, no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a pinch (so Polycarpus's count increases by 1).\n\nif b beats a: Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nSo, for example, if a is R and b is S: R beats S, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count is not increased here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So in each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So for each round:\n\nif Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so his count increases by 1).\n\nif Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros gets a spot (so his count increases by 1).\n\nif draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can determine who wins.\n\nSo how to code this?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b, returns who loses (if any).\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, check the outcome.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a is 'R' and b is 'S': Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So add 1 to Polycarpus's count.\n\nif a is 'S' and b is 'R': Nikephoros loses, add 1 to his count.\n\nSo for each (a, b) pair, we can check the following:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is one of the winning combinations for Nikephoros:\n\nthen Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nelse:\n\nNikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo the winning combinations for Nikephoros are:\n\nR beats S\n\nS beats P\n\nP beats R\n\nSo for a given a and b, if (a, b) is one of these three, then Nikephoros wins. Else, if (b, a) is one of these three, then Polycarpus wins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can code this as:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair (a, b), this returns (nik_loss, poly_loss). So for example, if a is R and b is S, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses, so (0, 1). So in that case, Nikephoros's count is not increased, but Polycarpus's is increased by 1.\n\nSo for each of the L rounds, we can compute the (nik, poly) increments.\n\nOnce we have that, for the full cycles, we can multiply by the number of full cycles, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute m, k.\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the L rounds, the (nik, poly) increments. Sum them up as (full_nik, full_poly).\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // L.\n\nrem = n % L.\n\ntotal_nik = full_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = full_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, process each of the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add their (nik, poly) to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nThus, the final answer is (total_nik, total_poly).\n\nNow, how to compute the LCM and GCD.\n\nImplementing that in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute the full cycle counts.\n\nThen process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the helper function for the results.\n\nBut for each t in 0 to L-1:\n\na = A[t % m]\n\nb = B[t % k]\n\nthen compute the result.\n\nBut for L up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM is up to 1e6), this is manageable.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1000, k=1000, LCM is 1000, so L=1000, and the loop runs 1000 times. Which is okay.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport math.\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // compute_gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd exists.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\nThen, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nlcm_val = lcm(m, k) = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\nOnce that's computed, then for each of the LCM rounds, compute the (nik, poly) increments.\n\nNow, code:\n\nfull_nik = 0\n\nfull_poly = 0\n\nfor t in range(lcm_val):\n\n    a = A[t % m]\n\n    b = B[t % k]\n\n    # compute the result for this round\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n        full_poly += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n        full_nik += 1\n\nWait, but this is for the full cycle. So for each of the LCM rounds, the total counts are added.\n\nOnce that is done, then total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\nrem = n % lcm_val\n\nSo the total counts for full cycles is full_nik * total_cycles and full_poly * total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to process each of the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add their counts.\n\nSo:\n\nrem_nik = 0\n\nrem_poly = 0\n\nfor t in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[t % m]\n\n    b = B[t % k]\n\n    ... same as before, adding to rem_nik and rem_poly.\n\nThen total_nik = full_nik * total_cycles + rem_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_poly * total_cycles + rem_poly\n\nSo the code would look something like that.\n\nBut for the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn = 7\n\nA is \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\nlcm(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for each of 12 rounds, compute the counts.\n\nLet me compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the first sample's output is 3 and 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn the example, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S → Nikephoros loses? Wait, according to the note, the first sample's explanation says:\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. Wait, how?\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. Wait, let's think. Nikephoros's move is P (paper), Polycarpus's move is S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So Nikephoros's move is paper, which is beaten by scissors. So Nikephoros loses. So Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in that round, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the code logic, in that case, the code checks if a (Nikephoros's move) beats b (Polycarpus's move). So a is P, b is S. So (a, b) is P vs S. Which is not in the list of Nikephoros's winning conditions. Because Nikephoros's winning conditions are R beats S, S beats P, P beats R. So P vs S: S beats P. So the code would check if (a, b) is one of the winning conditions. Since a is P and b is S, then (a, b) is not in the list. So the else clause is executed. Which is that Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a spot. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in that round, the code adds 1 to full_nik (Nikephoros's count). So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems to correctly capture that.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample.\n\nIn the sample input, the first sample's n is 7, and the code would compute LCM(3,4)=12. So total_cycles = 7//12 = 0. rem is 7. So we process the first 7 rounds of the 12-round cycle.\n\nLet's compute those 7 rounds.\n\nFor t from 0 to 6:\n\nt=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = 'R'\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = 'R' → draw. No change.\n\nt=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = A[1] = 'P'\n\nb = B[1%4] = B[1] = 'S' → P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So full_nik +=1.\n\nt=2:\n\na = A[2%3] = A[2] = 'S'\n\nb = B[2%4] = B[2] = 'P' → S vs P. S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So full_poly +=1.\n\nt=3:\n\na = A[3%3=0] = R.\n\nb = B[3%4=3] = B[3] = 'P'. R vs P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. So full_nik +=1.\n\nt=4:\n\na = A[4%3=1] = P.\n\nb = B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So full_poly +=1.\n\nt=5:\n\na = A[5%3=2] = S.\n\nb = B[5%4=1] = S. S vs S → draw.\n\nt=6:\n\na = A[6%3=0] = R.\n\nb = B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. So full_nik +=1.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the counts are:\n\nfull_nik (from the 7 rounds) is 1 (t=1) + 1 (t=3) + 1 (t=6) → 3.\n\nfull_poly is 1 (t=2) + 1 (t=4) → 2. \n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 and 2. So the code would compute that correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the second sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nEach round, the moves are:\n\nA's move is R (since for any t, t%8 is 0-7, but A is all R's).\n\nB's move is R (since for any t, t%1=0, B[0] is R.\n\nSo all rounds are draws. So the output is 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where n is exactly equal to LCM(m, k). So total_cycles = 1, rem=0. So the code will process the full cycle once.\n\nAnother case: when m=1, k=1. Then LCM is 1. So for each round, check the single pair.\n\nAnother case: when one of the sequences is longer than the other, but LCM is larger.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity is O(L), where L is LCM(m, k). Since m and k are up to 1000, then LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. So for 1e6 operations, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. But in the input, the first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B. However, in the sample input given, the first input is given as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] — but perhaps that's a mistake in formatting. The actual input is:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut in the sample input provided in the problem statement, the input is written as a list of strings. But in reality, the code must read from standard input.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read properly.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the code as follows.\n\nBut first, compute the LCM.\n\nBut in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    lcm_val = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute the counts for one full cycle (lcm_val rounds)\n\n    full_nik = 0\n\n    full_poly = 0\n\n    for t in range(lcm_val):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # check if Nikephoros wins\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n            full_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n            full_nik += 1\n\n    # compute total_cycles and rem\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\n    rem = n % lcm_val\n\n    # compute the total from full cycles\n\n    total_nik = full_nik * total_cycles\n\n    total_poly = full_poly * total_cycles\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for t in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nik += 1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the rem rounds, the code is processing t from 0 to rem-1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if rem is zero? Then the loop doesn't run, which is correct.\n\nBut let's test the code for the first sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo m=3, k=4. LCM is 12. So for the full cycle, the code computes full_nik and full_poly. But in the code, for the first sample, the full_cycles is 0, and rem is 7. Then the code processes the rem rounds (0 to 6) as above.\n\nWhich gives total_nik = 3, total_poly=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=12, which is the LCM. So total_cycles is 1, rem=0. So the code will process the full cycle once. So the code would compute the sum of all the 12 rounds.\n\nBut what if the full cycle has some counts?\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when m and k are 1, and the sequences are R and S. So for each round, the moves are R and S. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. For n=2e9, the code would compute LCM(1,1) =1. So full_nik is 0, full_poly is 1. total_cycles is 2e9, so total_poly is 2e9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in code, for the for loop in the full cycle, t ranges from 0 to lcm_val-1 (which is 0 to 0). So t=0: a is A[0%1] = A[0], which is R. B is B[0%1] = B[0], which is S. So (R vs S) → Nikephoros wins, so full_poly +=1. So full_poly is 1. Then total_cycles = n//1 = 2e9, so total_poly is 2e9 *1, etc.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when m=1, k=1, and A and B are same. Then all rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when n is zero? But the problem says n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother possible case: when rem is zero, but n is large. So code handles that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the function math.gcd is used. However, in Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values. Since m and k are positive, this is okay.\n\nNow, what about when m or k is zero? But according to the problem statement, m and k are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the sample input in the problem is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut in reality, the input is:\n\nFirst line is 7.\n\nSecond line is RPS.\n\nThird line is RSPP.\n\nBut the code reads n, then A, then B.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nBut in Python, when you read input, sometimes there are issues with leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input lines are correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the functions are inside the main() function, but in Python, the code must be written properly.\n\nNow, the code should be written as:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    lcm_val = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\n    full_nik = 0\n\n    full_poly = 0\n\n    for t in range(lcm_val):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            full_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            full_nik += 1\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\n    rem = n % lcm_val\n\n    total_nik = full_nik * total_cycles\n\n    total_poly = full_poly * total_cycles\n\n    for t in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nik += 1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code defines a gcd function inside main, but math.gcd is already available. Also, the code can directly use math.gcd.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm_val = m * k // gcd_val\n\n    full_nik = 0\n\n    full_poly = 0\n\n    for t in range(lcm_val):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            full_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            full_nik += 1\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\n    rem = n % lcm_val\n\n    total_nik = full_nik * total_cycles\n\n    total_poly = full_poly * total_cycles\n\n    for t in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[t % m]\n\n        b = B[t % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nik += 1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nBut need to make sure that math is imported.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample, which outputs 3 2.\n\nAnother test case where n=0 is not possible, since n≥1.\n\nAnother test case: when A and B are both of length 1, and A is 'R', B is 'S'. So for any n, Nikephoros wins every round. So for n=5, output is 0 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) gets pinched after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The solution involves efficiently computing the outcomes over a large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of their strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. We need to determine the number of losses for each player over n rounds without simulating each round individually due to the large possible value of n (up to 2·10^9).\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate this result for the total number of cycles within n rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n   - Calculate the number of full cycles and remaining rounds within the total number of rounds n.\n   - For each full cycle, precompute the number of losses for each player.\n   - Use these precomputed values to determine the total losses for all full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm_val = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    full_nik = 0\n    full_poly = 0\n    \n    for t in range(lcm_val):\n        a = A[t % m]\n        b = B[t % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            full_poly += 1\n        else:\n            full_nik += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n    rem = n % lcm_val\n    \n    total_nik = full_nik * total_cycles\n    total_poly = full_poly * total_cycles\n    \n    for t in range(rem):\n        a = A[t % m]\n        b = B[t % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Cycle Detection**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which the move patterns repeat. This allows us to compute results for one cycle and reuse them.\n- **Efficient Calculation**: By precomputing the number of losses for each player in one full cycle, we can quickly determine the total losses for all full cycles and handle the remaining rounds separately, ensuring the solution is efficient even for very large values of n.\n- **Outcome Determination**: For each round in the cycle, we check the outcome of the moves and update the loss counts accordingly based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nThis approach ensures that we avoid simulating each round individually, making the solution feasible even for the upper constraint of n = 2·10^9.",
