The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The key here is to simulate the rounds efficiently because n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model their moves for each round. Since their sequences repeat cyclically, the moves for each player are determined by their respective sequence indices. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is A of length m, then in round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m]. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B of length k.\n\nBut simulating each round up to n times is impossible for n=2e9. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied over the total rounds.\n\nLet me think: The combined cycle of both players' sequences would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and their move patterns will repeat. So, the entire game's outcome for each cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds can be precomputed. Then, we can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds and multiply the counts by the number of cycles, plus handle the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n2. For each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1, compute who wins (if any) and accumulate the counts.\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n5. Multiply the counts from one cycle by total_cycles, then add the counts from the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute the GCD first.\n\nBut first, let's think about how to compute the number of wins for each player in one cycle. For each round in the cycle, we need to compare the moves of A and B.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\nA's move is A[i % m], B's move is B[i % k].\n\nThen, determine the outcome of this round. For each such round, we can count how many times Nikephoros wins, and how many times Polycarpus wins.\n\nOnce we have these counts per cycle, we can multiply by the number of full cycles. Then, process the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute for each round in the cycle (of length cycle_length) the outcome.\n- Sum the number of wins for each player in the cycle.\n- Multiply by total_cycles.\n- Then, process the first rem rounds of the cycle and add their counts.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the cycle_length. Let's take m and k as lengths of A and B. For example, if A is length 3 and B is length 4, LCM(3,4)=12. So each cycle is 12 rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM? Let's code a helper function for GCD and then LCM.\n\nNow, for the code structure:\n\nRead n, read A, read B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, compute for each of the cycle_length rounds, what's the outcome.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, even if cycle_length is up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, LCM could be up to 1e6?), then for each cycle_length, we can compute the counts once.\n\nWait, m and k are up to 1000. So LCM(m, k) can be up to 1000 * 1000 = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nYes, because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop.\n\nSo for each of the cycle_length rounds, we can compute the moves, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce that's done, multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCalculate the number of full cycles and the remainder.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * nik_in_cycle\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * poly_in_cycle\n\nThen, for the remainder, process the first rem rounds and add to the totals.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between two moves?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two characters (a and b) and returns who wins, if any.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a == b: no one wins.\n\nElse:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R).\n\nSo for a and b:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nif b beats a: Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can check which one wins.\n\nSo, code for that:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. So for each round, the number of spots for Nikephoros is incremented by 1 if he loses, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nSo the helper function returns (nik_spots, poly_spots) for that round.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute that.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nCompute cycle_length.\n\nCompute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the (nik, poly) increments.\n\nSum them all to get total_nik_in_cycle and total_poly_in_cycle.\n\nThen, the full_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nrem = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * total_nik_in_cycle + sum of the first rem rounds' nik increments.\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nSo the problem becomes how to compute the sum for the first rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for the first rem rounds?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix array for the cycle. For example, create an array called prefix_nik and prefix_poly, where prefix_nik[i] is the total nik spots after the first i rounds in the cycle.\n\nThen, for rem rounds, we can take prefix_nik[rem] and prefix_poly[rem].\n\nBut how to build that prefix array?\n\nYes. So, for the cycle_length rounds, we can compute for each round i (from 0 to cycle_length-1), the nik and poly increments, and then compute the prefix sums.\n\nSo, let's proceed:\n\nInitialize a list of nik_in_cycle and poly_in_cycle.\n\nThen, for i in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   nik, poly = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n   add to nik_in_cycle and poly_in_cycle.\n\nThen, compute prefix_nik and prefix_poly arrays, where prefix_nik[i] is the sum of the first i rounds (from 0 to i-1?), depending on how you index.\n\nWait, for example, for the first 0 rounds, sum is 0. For the first 1 round, sum is the first element. So the prefix array can be built as:\n\nprefix_nik = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\nfor i in range(cycle_length):\n\n    prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik_in_cycle[i]\n\nSimilarly for prefix_poly.\n\nThen, for rem rounds, the sum is prefix_nik[rem] and prefix_poly[rem].\n\nSo, with that approach, the code can be written.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nWait, but in the example input given, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWhich seems like the first input is n=7, A is \"RPS\", B is \"RSPP\".\n\nBut the actual input is read as:\n\nFirst line is n, then second line is A, third line is B.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nFirst line is n, then A, then B.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k).\n\nThen compute cycle_length.\n\nNow, how to compute LCM?\n\nImplementing GCD:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\nThen, lcm = a * b // gcd(a, b). But need to make sure that a and b are positive integers. Which they are, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ng = gcd(m, k)\n\ncycle_length = m * k // g\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to compute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the nik and poly increments.\n\nBut for cycle_length up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, m*k is up to 1e6), this is manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, compute the prefix arrays.\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * total_nik_in_cycle + prefix_nik[rem]\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to compute total_nik_in_cycle and total_poly_in_cycle?\n\nWell, during the cycle processing, we can accumulate the total_nik_in_cycle and total_poly_in_cycle as the sum of all the individual rounds in the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, the prefix arrays can be built, and then total_nik_in_cycle is prefix_nik[cycle_length], and same for total_poly_in_cycle.\n\nSo, for example, during the processing of the cycle, we can generate the prefix arrays. Then, the total for one full cycle is prefix_nik[cycle_length], and same for poly.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute the prefix_nik and prefix_poly arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[cycle_length] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[cycle_length] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\nBut wait, the prefix arrays are built for the cycle_length rounds. So for example, prefix_nik has length cycle_length + 1, where prefix_nik[0] = 0, prefix_nik[1] is the first round's nik count, etc.\n\nSo yes, the sum of the entire cycle is prefix_nik[cycle_length].\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code for the helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nThen, check the result.\n\nSo, code for that:\n\nNow, let's think about the helper function. Let's code it inline.\n\nFor each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no points.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's count increases by 0, Poly's by 1?)\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count is increased by 0, and Polycarpus's count is increased by 1. Wait no, the output is the number of red spots on both players. So Nikephoros's red spots are the number of times he lost. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for each round, if Nikephoros loses, his count increases by 1. If Polycarpus loses, his count increases by 1.\n\nSo, for a round where Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus has a spot. So Nikephoros's count is 0 for that round, and Polycarpus's count is 1.\n\nIf the round is a draw, both counts are 0.\n\nSo the helper function returns (nik_spots, poly_spots) for that round.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nif a is R, b is S: Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So (0, 1).\n\nif a is S, b is R: Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1. So (1, 0).\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code, for each round in the cycle, we can compute that.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m, k.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nCompute cycle_length.\n\nThen, for each round in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\ncompute a_move and b_move.\n\nCompute the (nik, poly) for this round.\n\nBuild prefix arrays.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for large cycle_length (up to 1e6), this is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the GCD function.\n\nBut in Python, there is math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay. However, the math.gcd may not be available in some versions? Well, assuming that it's allowed. But for code correctness, perhaps better to implement it.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut for Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. However, for cases where one of the numbers is zero? But m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\nThen:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\ncycle_length = m * k // g\n\nOnce that is done, proceed.\n\nNow, create prefix_nik and prefix_poly.\n\nInitialize prefix_nik = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\nSimilarly for prefix_poly.\n\nThen for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n    prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik\n\n    prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly\n\nOnce that's done, compute full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[cycle_length] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[cycle_length] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\nThen print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo cycle_length is 12.\n\nNow, for each of the 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nLet's check the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are 7.\n\nSo full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem =7.\n\nSo the code would process the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the results are 3 and 2.\n\nLet's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for the first sample.\n\nBut perhaps I should check the code.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds in the cycle:\n\nA's moves: R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R.\n\nB's moves: R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R.\n\nAll rounds are draws. So the total for each cycle is 0 for both. So for n=5, full_cycles=5//8=0, rem=5. So total is 0 and 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nNow, for the first sample.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, the function get_result is part of the code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def get_result(a, b):\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            return (0, 0)\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            return (0, 1)\n\n        else:\n\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    cycle_length = m * k // g\n\n    # Precompute prefix sums for the cycle\n\n    prefix_nik = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        nik, poly = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik\n\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly\n\n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[cycle_length] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[cycle_length] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, the sample input for the first case:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni % m = i%3, i%k = i%4.\n\nLet's compute the moves for each round in the cycle.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = A[0] = 'R'; B[0%4] = B[0] = 'R'. Draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1: A[1%3] = A[1] = 'P'; B[1%4] = B[1] = 'S'. P vs S. S beats P? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nget_result('P', 'S'):\n\na is P, b is S. So according to the rules, S beats P? Or P beats S?\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nrock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nscissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\npaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo if a is P (paper) and b is S (scissors): scissors beats paper. So b wins. So Nikephoros (a) loses, so his count increases by 1. So the result is (1, 0). Because Nikephoros's move is P, which loses to S. So Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for this round, the code returns (1, 0).\n\nBut according to the first sample explanation, in the first round (round 1?), the first round was R-R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses?), but in the sample explanation, the first round is round 1: R-R, then round 2: P vs S, which Nikephoros loses. But according to the code, in the first cycle, the first round (i=0) is R vs R (draw). Then i=1, which is the second round, P vs S.\n\nBut the sample input is n=7 rounds. So the code would process the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut the code's calculation for the first sample:\n\nLet me try to compute the prefix_nik and prefix_poly for the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps I should compute the entire cycle and see.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to run through the code for the first sample.\n\nBut for the first sample, the code's output is 3 2. Let's see.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1). So (1, 0).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Nikephoros wins (so Poly's count increases by 1. So (0, 1).\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (Poly's count increases by 1? Wait, R vs P: P beats R. So Nikephoros's move is R, which loses to P. So he gets a spot. So (1, 0).\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Nikephoros's move is P, which beats R. So Poly gets a spot. (0, 1).\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw. (0, 0).\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros loses. (1, 0).\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds:\n\nNikephoros's count is 1 (round 2) + 1 (round 4) + 1 (round 7) = 3.\n\nPoly's count is 1 (round 3) + 1 (round 5) = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo in the code, when rem is 7, the prefix_nik[7] is 3 and prefix_poly[7] is 2.\n\nSo the code would return 3 and 2.\n\nBut how does the code compute that?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIn the code, for cycle_length=12, the first 7 rounds would be processed.\n\nSo during the for loop for i in 0..11:\n\nLet me compute for each i:\n\ni=0: a=R, b=R → (0,0). prefix_nik[1] = 0, prefix_poly[1] = 0.\n\ni=1: a=P, b=S → (1,0). prefix_nik[2] = 0+1=1. prefix_poly[2] = 0+0=0.\n\ni=2: a=S, b=P → (0,1). prefix_nik[3] = 1+0=1. prefix_poly[3] = 0+1=1.\n\ni=3: a=R (i=3%3=0 → A[0] is R), b=B[3%4=3 → B[3] is P. R vs P: P beats R. So Nikephoros loses → (1, 0). prefix_nik[4] = 1+1=2. prefix_poly[4] = 1+0=1.\n\ni=4: a=i%3=4%3=1 → A[1] is P. B[4%4=0 → B[0] is R. P vs R: P beats R. So Nikephoros wins. So (0,1). prefix_nik[5] = 2+0=2. prefix_poly[5] = 1+1=2.\n\ni=5: a=5%3=2 → A[2] is S. B[5%4=1 → B[1] is S. S vs S → draw. (0,0). prefix_nik[6] = 2+0=2. prefix_poly[6] = 2+0=2.\n\ni=6: a=6%3=0 → R. B[6%4=2 → B[2] is P. R vs P → Nikephoros loses. (1, 0). prefix_nik[7] = 2+1=3. prefix_poly[7] = 2+0=2.\n\nSo for rem=7, prefix_nik[7] is 3, prefix_poly[7] is 2. Which is exactly the sample's answer. So the code would work.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the cycle_length is larger than n? Like in the sample input 2.\n\nNow, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nOther edge cases: when m or k is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when all rounds are draws. Then output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A and B are same sequences. Then, all rounds are draws.\n\nAnother case: when the cycle_length is 1. For example, m=1, k=1. Then cycle_length is 1.\n\nSo code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. For m and k up to 1000, cycle_length is up to 1e6. For each of those, the loop runs 1e6 times. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code can handle it, because the code is O(cycle_length) time, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python. Also, note that in Python, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces, but the problem says that the input is given as strings. So using .strip() is correct.\n\nWait, for example, the input for A and B is given as a string. For example, the second line is the sequence A. So, the code reads it as input().strip(), which removes any leading/trailing whitespace. But the problem says that the input is given as a string of m characters. So that's correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def get_result(a, b):\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            return (0, 0)\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            return (0, 1)\n\n        else:\n\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    cycle_length = m * k // g\n\n    prefix_nik = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        nik, poly = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik\n\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly\n\n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[cycle_length] + prefix_nik[rem]\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[cycle_length] + prefix_poly[rem]\n\n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is 7, then the next lines are RPS and RSPP. So the code reads them correctly.\n\nBut when reading via sys.stdin.readline(), sometimes there might be issues with trailing newlines. But the code uses strip() for A and B, which removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nBut for example, if the input is given as:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen, the first readline() gives '7\\n', then the next readline() gives 'RPS\\n', and the third gives 'RSPP\\n'.\n\nBut using .strip() on them would give '7', 'RPS', 'RSPP' respectively.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput is 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to cycle_length. Then rem is 0, and the code uses full_cycles = 1, rem=0. So total_nik is prefix_nik[cycle_length], etc.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 0? Well, the problem says n ≥ 1.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when n is very large (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The winner of each round gives the loser a pinch, which results in a red spot.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic sequences, the combined sequence of moves will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then use this information to compute results for all rounds efficiently.\n3. **Prefix Sum Arrays**: By precomputing the number of red spots for each player over one full cycle, we can use prefix sums to quickly determine the results for any number of cycles and remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    cycle_length = m * k // g\n    \n    prefix_nik = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n    prefix_poly = [0] * (cycle_length + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        nik, poly = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        prefix_nik[i+1] = prefix_nik[i] + nik\n        prefix_poly[i+1] = prefix_poly[i] + poly\n    \n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * prefix_nik[cycle_length] + prefix_nik[rem]\n    total_poly = full_cycles * prefix_poly[cycle_length] + prefix_poly[rem]\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is calculated to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Result Calculation for One Cycle**: For each round in one full cycle, we determine the outcome (who gets a red spot) and store cumulative results in prefix sum arrays.\n4. **Efficient Computation for Large n**: Using the prefix sums, we compute the total number of red spots for the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds separately, ensuring efficient computation even for very large values of `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to 2·10^9 rounds efficiently by leveraging cycle detection and prefix sums, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
