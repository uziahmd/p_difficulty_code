On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse to maximize this length. Since the array is only composed of 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model this efficiently.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what reversing a subarray does. For example, if the original array has a segment that's decreasing, like 2 followed by 1, reversing that part would make it 1 followed by 2, which is better for non-decreasing sequences.\n\nBut how do I compute the best possible reversal? Trying all possible intervals [l, r] and checking the longest non-decreasing subsequence for each would be O(n^2 * n) time, which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array's properties. The maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s if they are already in order. But when you reverse a subarray, you can potentially merge some parts of the array into longer non-decreasing sequences.\n\nWait, since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is just the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if the entire array is non-decreasing. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, those transitions are bad. Reversing a subarray that contains such transitions could fix them.\n\nLet me think. The original array's longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but actually no. Wait, for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the longest is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], so the longest is 4. So the maximum possible is the entire array if it's non-decreasing. So the idea is to find a reversal that makes as many 1s and 2s as possible in non-decreasing order.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: the optimal reversal is one that merges as many 1s and 2s as possible. For example, if there's a segment of 2s followed by 1s, reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which is good. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array, and then reversing those segments to convert them into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array's structure. Let's consider that the maximum possible length after reversal is the original maximum plus some gain from the reversal. But how?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Suppose there are some positions where a 2 is followed by a 1. Each such occurrence contributes to a break in the non-decreasing sequence. Reversing the subarray that includes these transitions can fix them.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order by reversing a subarray. For example, the original array may have some 1s followed by some 2s, but with some 2s and 1s in between. Reversing a segment that starts with 2 and ends with 1 can turn that into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after any reversal is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of \"bad\" transitions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array as having some regions. For example, the maximum length of the non-decreasing subsequence is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence breaks the sequence. But when you reverse a segment that contains such a transition, you can eliminate that break.\n\nBut how to model that? Let's think: the original array has a certain number of 2-1 transitions. Each such transition contributes a decrease in the maximum length. For example, if there are k such transitions, the maximum length is n - k. Because each such transition reduces the maximum by 1. Then, reversing a segment that contains m such transitions would reduce the number of transitions by m, but maybe adding some others. Wait, this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is made up of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence is a place where the sequence decreases, and thus the maximum length is the total length minus the number of these decreases. For example, in [1,2,1,2], there are two 2-1 transitions (positions 2-3 and 3-4?), no. Wait, the original array is 1,2,1,2. The transitions between elements are 1→2 (good), 2→1 (bad), 1→2 (good). So there is one bad transition. The maximum length is 4 - 1 = 3? But in reality, the maximum is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.) Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct. Because the maximum length isn't directly determined by the number of bad transitions. For example, if the array is [2,1,2,1], there are two bad transitions (2→1 and 2→1), but the maximum non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (like 2,2 or 1,1). However, n is 4, 4-2=2, which matches. Another example: [1,2,1,2], the maximum length is 3 (like 1,2,2) but according to the formula, n is 4, bad transitions is 1, so 4-1=3. Which matches. So maybe that formula works.\n\nSo the maximum length of the non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of bad transitions (where a 2 is followed by a 1). Because each such transition represents a point where the sequence decreases, and thus the maximum length is reduced by 1 for each such occurrence.\n\nIf that's true, then the problem reduces to finding a reversal of a subarray that can reduce the number of bad transitions as much as possible. Because the maximum length after reversal is (n - (original_bad_transitions - delta)), where delta is the number of bad transitions removed minus the number added by the reversal.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the maximum possible delta. Let's think about how reversing a subarray affects the number of bad transitions.\n\nLet me think: when you reverse a subarray [l, r], the original transitions inside the subarray are reversed. Also, the transitions between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1 are modified.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array has elements before l, then the subarray, then elements after r.\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\n... a[l-1], a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r], a[r+1] ...\n\nAfter reversing, it becomes:\n\n... a[l-1], a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l], a[r+1] ...\n\nSo, the transitions that are affected are:\n\n1. Between l-1 and l (if l > 1)\n2. Between r and r+1 (if r < n)\n3. All transitions inside the subarray [l, r].\n\nThe original number of bad transitions inside the subarray is some value, say, original_inside. After reversal, the number of bad transitions inside the subarray will be new_inside. Also, the transitions at the edges (between l-1 and l, and between r and r+1) may change.\n\nSo the total change in bad transitions is:\n\ndelta = (new_inside + new_edges) - (original_inside + original_edges)\n\nWhere original_edges is the number of bad transitions at the edges before reversal, and new_edges is the same after reversal.\n\nSo, the maximum delta we can get is the maximum over all possible [l, r] of (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges).\n\nIf we can compute this delta for each possible [l, r], then the maximum possible value of (original_total_bad - delta) would give us the maximum length. Wait, no. Because original_total_bad is the original number of bad transitions. Then, after reversal, the new_total_bad is original_total_bad - original_inside - original_edges + new_inside + new_edges. So delta_total_bad = (original_total_bad - original_inside - original_edges + new_inside + new_edges) - original_total_bad = (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges). Thus, the new_total_bad is original_total_bad + delta_total_bad.\n\nBut the maximum length is n - new_total_bad. Therefore, to maximize this, we need to minimize new_total_bad. Which is equivalent to maximizing the delta_total_bad (since delta_total_bad is negative if new_total_bad is less than original_total_bad).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum delta_total_bad, which is (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges) for some [l, r], and then the maximum length is (original_total_bad + max_delta) subtracted from n.\n\nWait, original_total_bad is the original number of bad transitions. Then, the new_total_bad is original_total_bad + delta_total_bad. So the maximum length is n - (original_total_bad + delta_total_bad) = (n - original_total_bad) - delta_total_bad.\n\nBut since delta_total_bad can be positive or negative. So to maximize the maximum length, we need to minimize new_total_bad, which is equivalent to making delta_total_bad as negative as possible. So the maximum delta_total_bad is the maximum value of (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges) for all possible [l, r]. Wait, no. Because delta_total_bad is (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges). So if delta_total_bad is negative, then new_total_bad is original_total_bad + delta_total_bad, which is smaller. Therefore, the maximum possible (n - new_total_bad) is achieved when delta_total_bad is as small as possible (most negative). But that's not possible because delta_total_bad can be positive or negative. So perhaps we need to find the maximum value of (original_total_bad + delta_total_bad) is minimized. Which is equivalent to finding the maximum delta_total_bad (the delta_total_bad is the change in the number of bad transitions). Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me rephrase. The original number of bad transitions is B. After reversal, the new number of bad transitions is B + delta. The maximum length is n - (B + delta). To maximize this, we need to minimize B + delta. So the best delta is as small as possible. So the maximum possible value of (n - (B + delta)) is achieved when delta is as small as possible (i.e., as negative as possible).\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the minimum possible delta (the change in the number of bad transitions) over all possible [l, r] reversals. Then the answer is n - (B + delta_min).\n\nBut how do we compute delta for each [l, r]?\n\nLet me think about how to calculate delta for a given [l, r].\n\nOriginal_inside: the number of bad transitions within the subarray [l, r]. For example, for each i from l to r-1, if a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1, then that's a bad transition.\n\nOriginal_edges: the number of bad transitions at the edges of the subarray. That is, if l > 1, check whether a[l-1] is 2 and a[l] is 1. Similarly, if r < n, check whether a[r] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. So original_edges is the sum of these two possibilities.\n\nAfter reversing the subarray [l, r], the new_inside is the number of bad transitions within the reversed subarray. How to compute that?\n\nThe reversed subarray is the original subarray reversed. So the new_inside is the number of bad transitions in the reversed subarray. For example, if the original subarray had elements [a, b, c], then after reversing, it's [c, b, a]. The transitions between elements are now between c and b, and between b and a. So the number of bad transitions in the reversed subarray is the same as the number of bad transitions in the original subarray, but reversed. Wait, no. For example, if the original subarray had transitions that were 2 followed by 1, then after reversing, those transitions would become 1 followed by 2, which is good. So the number of bad transitions inside the reversed subarray depends on the original transitions.\n\nBut calculating this for each [l, r] seems tricky. Let's think: the original_inside is the number of bad transitions in the original subarray. When reversed, the new_inside would be the number of bad transitions in the reversed subarray. Let's think of the original subarray as a sequence of elements. Reversing it would swap the order of elements. For each pair of consecutive elements in the original subarray, their positions are swapped. So, for each original transition between position i and i+1 (within the subarray), the reversed subarray will have a transition between position (r - i) and (r - i + 1). So the original transition was a[i] and a[i+1]. In the reversed subarray, the elements are a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. The transitions between elements in the reversed subarray are between a[r] and a[r-1], a[r-1] and a[r-2], etc. So for each original transition (a[i], a[i+1]) in the original subarray, the reversed subarray will have a transition (a[i+1], a[i]). So the original transition was bad (a[i] = 2, a[i+1] = 1) → the reversed transition is (1, 2) which is good. So each original bad transition in the subarray becomes a good transition in the reversed subarray. Similarly, original good transitions (like 1 followed by 1, 1 followed by 2, 2 followed by 2) would remain as good or become bad? Let's see:\n\nOriginal transition is 1 followed by 2 → good. In reversed, it's 2 followed by 1 → bad. So for each original good transition that was 1→2, it becomes a bad transition. Original transitions that were 2→2 or 1→1 remain the same. Original transitions that were 2→1 (bad) become 1→2 (good). Original transitions that were 1→2 (good) become 2→1 (bad).\n\nSo the number of bad transitions in the reversed subarray is equal to:\n\noriginal_good_1_2_count (number of transitions in the original subarray that were 1→2) + original_bad_count (original transitions that were 2→1) → wait no. Wait, original transitions in the subarray:\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor the original subarray, let’s count:\n\n- c_21: number of 2→1 transitions (original bad transitions)\n- c_12: number of 1→2 transitions (original good transitions)\n- c_11: number of 1→1 transitions\n- c_22: number of 2→2 transitions\n\nThen, after reversing, the transitions inside the subarray would be:\n\nEach original transition 2→1 becomes 1→2 (good), contributing 0 to new_inside (bad transitions).\n\nEach original transition 1→2 becomes 2→1 (bad), contributing 1 to new_inside.\n\nOriginal transitions 1→1 and 2→2 remain as 1→1 and 2→2, contributing 0 to new_inside.\n\nThus, new_inside = c_12.\n\nBecause for each original 1→2 transition, it becomes a bad transition (counted as 1) in the reversed subarray. The original c_21 transitions become good transitions. The other transitions (c_11 and c_22) contribute nothing.\n\nSo the new_inside is equal to the original number of 1→2 transitions in the subarray.\n\nBut how do I compute that for each subarray [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, for the original subarray, the number of bad transitions (original_inside) is c_21. The new_inside is the number of original 1→2 transitions in the subarray. Let's denote that as c_12.\n\nSo delta_inside = new_inside - original_inside = c_12 - c_21.\n\nAdditionally, we have the edges.\n\nOriginal_edges is the number of bad transitions at the edges (before reversal). Let's call this e_old.\n\nAfter reversal, the edges are:\n\n- Between l-1 and l: if l > 1, the original element is a[l-1], and the new element at position l is a[r]. So check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1 → contributes 1 if yes.\n- Between r and r+1: if r < n, the original element at r is a[r], and the new element at r+1 is a[l]. Check if a[r] is 2 and a[l] is 1 → contributes 1 if yes.\n\nLet's call this e_new.\n\nSo the delta_edges = e_new - e_old.\n\nTherefore, the total delta for the reversal is delta_inside + delta_edges = (c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old).\n\nThus, the overall delta for the reversal is (c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old).\n\nOur goal is to find the [l, r] that maximizes this delta (since delta_total_bad = delta_inside + delta_edges, and we want to minimize new_total_bad = B + delta_total_bad → which is equivalent to minimizing delta_total_bad. Wait, no. Because delta_total_bad is (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges) = delta_inside + delta_edges. And the new_total_bad is B + delta_total_bad. So to minimize new_total_bad, we need to find the minimum possible (B + delta_total_bad) → which is equivalent to finding the minimum delta_total_bad. Wait, no: B is fixed. So the new_total_bad = B + delta_total_bad. To minimize this, we need to minimize delta_total_bad. Therefore, the maximum possible value of (n - new_total_bad) is n - (B + delta_total_bad) = (n - B) - delta_total_bad. So to maximize this, we need to minimize delta_total_bad. So the problem becomes: find the minimum possible value of delta_total_bad over all possible [l, r], and then compute (n - B) - delta_total_bad.\n\nWait, but delta_total_bad is (new_inside + new_edges - original_inside - original_edges). Which equals (c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old). So for each [l, r], we need to calculate this value and find the minimum among all possible [l, r].\n\nOnce we find that minimum, the maximum length is (n - B) - (minimum delta_total_bad). Because (n - B) is the original maximum length (since original_length = n - B). And the new length is (n - B) - delta_total_bad. So the maximum possible is when delta_total_bad is as small as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing B, then for all possible [l, r], compute delta_total_bad and find the minimum, then the answer is (n - B) - min_delta.\n\nNow, how do we compute B? It's the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n\nOnce we have that, we need to find the minimum delta_total_bad over all possible [l, r].\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute for all possible [l, r] the value of (c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old), where:\n\nc_12 is the number of 1→2 transitions in [l, r]\n\nc_21 is the number of 2→1 transitions in [l, r]\n\ne_old is the number of bad transitions at the edges before reversal (which is 0, 1, or 2).\n\ne_new is the number of bad transitions at the edges after reversal.\n\nSo, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, precompute for all possible [l, r] the values of c_12 and c_21. But for n=2000, there are O(n^2) possible intervals, which is 4 million. For each interval, we can compute c_12 and c_21.\n\nBut how to compute these quickly?\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for the number of 1→2 transitions and 2→1 transitions in the array.\n\nLet me think. For each position i from 1 to n-1, we can check if a[i] is 2 and a[i+1] is 1 (counts as 1 for 2→1 transitions) or a[i] is 1 and a[i+1] is 2 (counts as 1 for 1→2 transitions). So, for each i, we can have two arrays:\n\nprefix_21[i] = number of 2→1 transitions in the first i elements (or up to index i?)\n\nWait, perhaps for each interval [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions is the sum of transitions from l to r-1. Similarly for 1→2 transitions.\n\nSo, for example, for the original array, we can create a prefix array for the count of 2→1 transitions up to each position.\n\nLet me define:\n\ntrans_21[i] = 1 if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1, else 0. For i from 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based indexing).\n\nSimilarly, trans_12[i] = 1 if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2, else 0.\n\nThen, for the interval [l, r], the number of 2→1 transitions inside is the sum of trans_21[i] for i from l-1 to r-2 (assuming l and r are 1-based, and the array is 0-based). Similarly for trans_12.\n\nSo, using prefix sums for these transitions, we can compute for any [l, r] the number of 2→1 transitions inside (c_21) and 1→2 transitions inside (c_12) in O(1) time per query.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute (c_12 - c_21) for each interval [l, r].\n\nNext, the e_old and e_new.\n\ne_old is the sum of:\n\n- left_edge: if l > 1, then check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[l] is 1. If so, add 1.\n- right_edge: if r < n, check if a[r] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. If so, add 1.\n\ne_new is the sum of:\n\n- left_edge_new: if l > 1, check if a[l-1] is 2 and a[r] is 1. Add 1 if so.\n- right_edge_new: if r < n, check if a[r] (original) is now a[r] in the reversed subarray? Wait, after reversing [l, r], the element at position l becomes a[r], and the element at position r becomes a[l].\n\nWait, the original elements in [l, r] are reversed. So, the element at position l after reversal is a[r], and the element at position r after reversal is a[l].\n\nSo, for the left edge (position l-1 and l):\n\nOriginal left edge was between l-1 and l. After reversal, the element at l is a[r], so the new left edge is between l-1 and l (now a[l-1] and a[r]).\n\nSimilarly, the right edge is between r and r+1. After reversal, the element at r is a[l], so the new right edge is between a[r] (now a[l]) and a[r+1].\n\nSo e_new is:\n\nleft_edge_new = 1 if (a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1) and l>1 else 0.\n\nright_edge_new = 1 if (a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1) and r < n else 0.\n\nWait, no. Because after reversal, the element at position r is a[l], and the element at position r+1 is still a[r+1]. So the new right edge is between a[r] (which after reversal is a[l]) and a[r+1]. So, the condition is whether a[l] is 2 and a[r+1] is 1. So:\n\nright_edge_new = 1 if (a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1) and r < n else 0.\n\nSo, for e_old and e_new, we can compute these two values for each interval [l, r].\n\nPutting this all together, the delta_total_bad for interval [l, r] is:\n\n(c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this value across all [l, r].\n\nOnce we find that minimum, the answer is (n - B) - min_delta.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute B: the total number of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n\n2. Precompute prefix sums for trans_21 and trans_12.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible [l, r] intervals (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).\n\n   For each interval:\n\n   a. Compute c_21 = number of 2→1 transitions inside [l, r].\n\n      This is the sum of trans_21[i] for i from l-1 to r-2 (assuming 0-based array).\n\n   b. Compute c_12 = number of 1→2 transitions inside [l, r].\n\n      Sum of trans_12[i] for i from l-1 to r-2.\n\n   c. Compute e_old:\n\n      left_old = 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] == 2 and a[l] == 1 else 0.\n\n      right_old = 1 if r < n and a[r] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0.\n\n      e_old = left_old + right_old.\n\n   d. Compute e_new:\n\n      left_new = 1 if l > 1 and a[l-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0.\n\n      right_new = 1 if r < n and a[l] == 2 and a[r+1] == 1 else 0.\n\n      e_new = left_new + right_new.\n\n   e. delta_total_bad = (c_12 - c_21) + (e_new - e_old).\n\n   f. Keep track of the minimum delta_total_bad found.\n\n4. The answer is (n - B) - min_delta.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no transitions inside the interval [l, r]? For example, if l = r, then there are no transitions inside. So for c_12 and c_21, they are zero.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's process the input. Let's read the array as a list of integers.\n\nThen, compute B as the sum of trans_21 for all positions.\n\nFor the prefix sums:\n\nWe can create two arrays, prefix_21 and prefix_12, where prefix_21[i] is the number of 2→1 transitions in the first i elements (but need to define exactly how the prefix arrays are built).\n\nLet me think of 0-based indices for the array.\n\nLet's say the array is a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nThen, for each i in 0 <= i < n-1:\n\ntrans_21[i] = 1 if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1 else 0.\n\ntrans_12[i] = 1 if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2 else 0.\n\nThen, prefix_21 is an array where prefix_21[i] is the sum of trans_21[0..i-1]. So prefix_21[0] = 0, prefix_21[1] = trans_21[0], prefix_21[2] = trans_21[0] + trans_21[1], etc.\n\nSimilarly for prefix_12.\n\nThen, for a given interval [l, r] (1-based), which corresponds to the 0-based indices from l_start = l-1 to r_end = r-1. The transitions inside the interval are from l_start to r_end - 1 (since each transition is between i and i+1).\n\nSo, the number of 2→1 transitions inside [l, r] is sum(trans_21[i] for i in [l_start ... r_end - 1]).\n\nThis can be computed as prefix_21[r_end] - prefix_21[l_start].\n\nSimilarly for 1→2 transitions.\n\nSo, for example, if the interval is [l, r], which is 1-based, then l_start = l-1, r_end = r-1. The transitions inside the interval are from l_start to r_end - 1 (inclusive). So the number of transitions is (r_end - l_start) = (r-1 - (l-1)) = r - l. But if r == l, then r_end - l_start = 0, so there are no transitions.\n\nSo, the sum for trans_21 is prefix_21[r_end] - prefix_21[l_start].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor l in 1..n:\n\n    for r in l..n:\n\n        l_start = l - 1\n\n        r_end = r - 1\n\n        if l_start >= r_end:\n\n            c_21 = 0\n\n            c_12 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            c_21 = prefix_21[r_end] - prefix_21[l_start]\n\n            c_12 = prefix_12[r_end] - prefix_12[l_start]\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nOnce we have c_12 and c_21, then compute (c_12 - c_21).\n\nThen, compute e_old and e_new.\n\nNow, for e_old:\n\nleft_old is 1 if l > 1 and a[l-2] == 2 and a[l-1] == 1. Because in 1-based terms, l is the starting index. So the left edge is between l-1 and l. In 0-based, that's between (l-1 - 1) = l-2 and l-1. Wait, no. Wait, for l being 1-based, the original left edge is between l-1 and l. So for l=2 (1-based), the left edge is between 1 and 2 (0-based indices 1 and 2? No. Wait, for l=2 (1-based), the original left edge is between position l-1 (which is 1) and l (which is 2). So in 0-based, that's between positions 1 and 2. So the original left edge is between a[l-1 - 1] and a[l-1] ?\n\nNo, sorry. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal array is 0-based. For a given interval [l, r] in 1-based, the left edge is between l-1 (1-based) and l (1-based). Which in 0-based is (l-1-1) = l-2? No. Wait, 1-based l is the start of the interval. The left edge is between the element before the interval (if any) and the first element of the interval.\n\nSo, for example, if the interval starts at l (1-based), then the left edge is between (l-1)th element (1-based) and l-th element (1-based). Which in 0-based is (l-2) and (l-1). So for l=1, there is no left edge. For l>1, the left edge is between a[l-2] (0-based) and a[l-1] (0-based).\n\nSimilarly, for the right edge, which is between r (1-based) and r+1 (1-based). In 0-based, between a[r-1] and a[r].\n\nSo, for e_old:\n\nleft_old = 1 if l > 1 and a[l-2] == 2 and a[l-1] == 1 else 0.\n\nright_old = 1 if r < n and a[r-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0.\n\nSimilarly, for e_new:\n\nleft_new is between a[l-2] (if l>1) and a[r-1] (since after reversing [l, r], the first element of the interval is a[r-1] in 0-based (original a[r] in 1-based). Wait, let me think again.\n\nOriginal interval [l, r] in 1-based is from position l to r. In 0-based, that's positions l_start = l-1 to r_end = r-1. After reversing, the first element of the interval is a[r_end] (original a[r] in 1-based), and the last element is a[l_start] (original a[l] in 1-based).\n\nSo, the left edge after reversal is between (l-1-1) = l-2 (0-based) and the new first element of the interval (a[r_end] in 0-based). So, for the left_new, if l>1, check a[l-2] (the element before the interval) and a[r_end] (the new first element of the interval).\n\nSimilarly, the right edge after reversal is between the new last element of the interval (a[l_start] in 0-based) and a[r] (the element after the interval, if exists).\n\nSo, for e_new:\n\nleft_new = 1 if l > 1 and a[l-2] == 2 and a[r_end] == 1 else 0.\n\nright_new = 1 if r < n and a[l_start] == 2 and a[r] == 1 else 0.\n\nSo, putting this into code:\n\nFor each interval [l, r] (1-based):\n\nl_start = l-1 (0-based)\n\nr_end = r-1 (0-based)\n\nleft_old = 0\n\nif l > 1:\n\n    if a[l-2] == 2 and a[l-1] == 1:\n\n        left_old = 1\n\nright_old = 0\n\nif r < n:\n\n    if a[r-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1:\n\n        right_old = 1\n\ne_old = left_old + right_old\n\nleft_new = 0\n\nif l > 1:\n\n    if a[l-2] == 2 and a[r_end] == 1:\n\n        left_new = 1\n\nright_new = 0\n\nif r < n:\n\n    if a[l_start] == 2 and a[r] == 1:\n\n        right_new = 1\n\ne_new = left_new + right_new\n\ndelta_edges = e_new - e_old\n\ndelta_inside = c_12 - c_21\n\ntotal_delta = delta_inside + delta_edges\n\nWe need to track the minimum total_delta.\n\nOnce we find the minimum total_delta, then the answer is (n - B) - min_total_delta.\n\nBut what if there is no reversal (i.e., not reversing any interval)? Well, the original delta is zero, and that's included in the calculation. So the code considers all possible intervals, including [l, r] where l=r (no change, delta is 0).\n\nSo, the code needs to compute this for all possible intervals.\n\nNow, considering that n is 2000, the total number of intervals is O(n^2) = 2000^2 = 4,000,000. For each interval, the computations are O(1), so this is feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement this logic in code.\n\nNow, let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2 → the array is [1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nOriginal transitions:\n\nBetween 0 and 1: 1→2 → trans_12 = 1, trans_21 = 0.\n\nBetween 1 and 2: 2→1 → trans_21 = 1, trans_12 = 0.\n\nBetween 2 and 3: 1→2 → trans_12 = 1, trans_21 = 0.\n\nSo B is the number of 2→1 transitions: 1.\n\nprefix_",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any subarray of the given sequence. The sequence consists of elements 1 and 2, which simplifies our approach significantly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transitions**: The key insight is to count transitions between elements. Specifically, we are interested in transitions from 2 to 1 (which are \"bad\" for a non-decreasing sequence) and transitions from 1 to 2 (which are \"good\").\n2. **Prefix Sums**: We use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of bad (2→1) and good (1→2) transitions within any subarray.\n3. **Delta Calculation**: For each possible subarray reversal, compute the change in the number of bad transitions. This involves checking the transitions inside the subarray and at its edges before and after reversal.\n4. **Optimal Reversal**: By iterating over all possible subarrays and calculating the effect of reversing each, we find the reversal that minimizes the number of bad transitions, thus maximizing the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute trans_21 and trans_12 arrays (0-based)\n    trans_21 = [0] * (n - 1)\n    trans_12 = [0] * (n - 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1:\n            trans_21[i] = 1\n        if a[i] == 1 and a[i+1] == 2:\n            trans_12[i] = 1\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums for trans_21 and trans_12\n    prefix_21 = [0] * (n)\n    prefix_12 = [0] * (n)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_21[i] = prefix_21[i-1] + trans_21[i-1]\n        prefix_12[i] = prefix_12[i-1] + trans_12[i-1]\n    \n    B = prefix_21[n-1]  # total number of 2->1 transitions\n\n    min_delta = float('inf')\n\n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            l_start = l - 1\n            r_end = r - 1\n            # Calculate c_21 and c_12\n            if l_start >= r_end:\n                c_21 = 0\n                c_12 = 0\n            else:\n                c_21 = prefix_21[r_end] - prefix_21[l_start]\n                c_12 = prefix_12[r_end] - prefix_12[l_start]\n            delta_inside = c_12 - c_21\n\n            # Calculate e_old\n            e_old = 0\n            # left_old\n            if l > 1:\n                if a[l-2] == 2 and a[l-1] == 1:\n                    e_old += 1\n            # right_old\n            if r < n:\n                if a[r-1] == 2 and a[r] == 1:\n                    e_old += 1\n\n            # Calculate e_new\n            e_new = 0\n            # left_new\n            if l > 1:\n                if a[l-2] == 2 and a[r_end] == 1:\n                    e_new += 1\n            # right_new\n            if r < n:\n                if a[l_start] == 2 and a[r] == 1:\n                    e_new += 1\n\n            delta_edges = e_new - e_old\n            total_delta = delta_inside + delta_edges\n\n            if total_delta < min_delta:\n                min_delta = total_delta\n\n    answer = (n - B) - min_delta\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Transition Arrays**: Arrays `trans_21` and `trans_12` track transitions between elements.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: These arrays help quickly compute the number of transitions within any subarray.\n4. **Iterating Over Subarrays**: For each possible subarray `[l, r]`, compute the effect of reversing it on the number of bad transitions using prefix sums and edge checks.\n5. **Delta Calculation**: The change in bad transitions (delta) is calculated for each subarray, and the minimum delta is tracked.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by adjusting the original number of bad transitions with the minimum delta found, giving the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after an optimal reversal.",
