In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). She starts with three tiles and can draw any number of tiles. We need to find the minimal number required.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each input case (each of the three given examples), we have three tiles. We need to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, figure out the minimum tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each case, the initial three tiles might already form a mentsu. For example, if all three are same (like 9m 9m 9m), then it's a triplet. Or if they form a sequence like 1s 2s 3s. In that case, answer is zero.\n\nIf not, then we need to add tiles. The challenge is to find the minimal number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, for each possible scenario, I need to check:\n\nCase 1: Can we form a triplet with the existing tiles plus some added tiles?\n\nCase 2: Can we form a sequence with existing tiles plus some added tiles?\n\nAnd then find the minimal number of draws required between all possibilities.\n\nBut how do I check for all possibilities?\n\nLet me think. Let's first check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, for each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, compute how many tiles are needed.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any number of tiles, including multiple, but we need the minimal, perhaps we can consider all possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles and determine the minimal additions.\n\nLet me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence) that can be formed by adding some tiles, calculate the number of tiles needed to reach that mentsu.\n\nThen take the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nSo, for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), what's the minimal number of tiles needed?\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu that could be formed by adding tiles?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible options.\n\nFor a triplet: the triplet is three identical tiles. So, for example, if the current tiles have two of a certain tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there's only one, then need to add two more. Or if none, then add three.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if the current tiles have one of a certain tile, maybe adding two more would make a triplet. But maybe there's another triplet that requires fewer tiles. So, for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), compute how many tiles are needed to form a triplet with that tile. Then take the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nSimilarly for sequences. For sequences, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, if the existing tiles have two tiles that are part of a sequence, maybe adding one more. Or maybe need to add two tiles to complete a sequence.\n\nBut how to check all possible sequences?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible triplet or sequence that can be formed by adding some tiles, compute the number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the triplet first. For each possible tile type (there are 9*3=27 possible types), we can check how many of them are already present in the initial three tiles. Then, the number of tiles needed to form a triplet of that type is 3 - count. For example, if there are two 1m tiles, then 3-2=1 tile needed. But if there's zero, then 3 tiles needed.\n\nSo for all possible triplet possibilities, the minimal required tiles would be the minimum of (3 - count) for all tile types.\n\nBut then, perhaps there's a better way. Because for the triplet, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimum of (3 - count) for each tile type. However, this is only considering forming a triplet of that type. But maybe the existing tiles already have some counts, and adding the required number.\n\nSo for example, if the initial tiles have one 1m, then adding two more gives a triplet. So the required is 2.\n\nBut for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles needed is the minimum over all possible triplet types.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nNow, for sequences. How to find the minimal tiles needed to form a sequence.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, 1m, 2m, 3m. So, for each possible sequence (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9) in each suit, check how many of the tiles in the initial three are part of that sequence. Then, the number of tiles needed to complete the sequence is 3 minus the count of existing tiles in that sequence.\n\nBut how to find all possible sequences that can be formed by adding tiles?\n\nFor example, suppose the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, the sequence 1-2-3 requires adding 3s. So one tile. Or the sequence 2-3-4 requires adding 3s. Also one tile. Or the sequence 3-4-5 would require adding 3 and 5, which is two tiles. So the minimal here is 1.\n\nSo for each possible sequence (each possible triplet of consecutive numbers in same suit), we can check how many of the existing tiles are part of that sequence. Then, the number of tiles needed is 3 minus that count. But we can take the minimal such value across all possible sequences.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nFor each suit (m, p, s):\n\n   For each starting number from 1 to 7:\n\n       the sequence is [start, start+1, start+2]\n\nSo, for example, for suit m, sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9.\n\nSo, for each of these sequences, check how many of the initial tiles are part of that sequence.\n\nSo for each such sequence, the required tiles is 3 - count, where count is the number of initial tiles that are in the sequence.\n\nSo the minimal number of tiles needed for sequences is the minimum of all such (3 - count) values across all possible sequences.\n\nOnce we have the minimal for triplet and minimal for sequence, the overall answer is the minimum between these two.\n\nWait, but maybe there are cases where you can form a triplet or a sequence with fewer tiles than the minimal of those two.\n\nFor example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, for triplet, the minimal is 1 (adding another 1m). For sequences, the possible sequences could be 1-2-3 (needs 1 tile: 3m). So the minimal between 1 and 1 is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nBut what if the initial tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. Then for triplet, adding 1m (needs 1). For sequences: possible sequences could be 1-2-3. Existing tiles have 1m and 3m. So need to add 2m. That's 1 tile. So again, min is 1.\n\nSo the answer would be 1.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nCompute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet (min_triplet), and the minimal to form a sequence (min_sequence). Then the answer is the minimum between these two.\n\nBut wait, what about when the initial three tiles can be part of multiple possibilities? For example, maybe there's a way to form a triplet with 1 tile, and a sequence with 0 tiles (if the initial three are already a sequence). But in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal tiles needed for triplet (min_triplet) and for sequence (min_sequence). The answer is the minimum of these two.\n\nBut how to check if the initial three already form a mentsu?\n\nSo, for the initial three tiles, check:\n\nEither:\n\nThey form a triplet (all three are same tile).\n\nOr, they form a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit).\n\nSo, for example, if the input is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], then it's a sequence. So answer is 0.\n\nIf the input is ['9m', '9m', '9m'], answer is 0.\n\nIf the input is ['1m', '2m', '3m'], answer is 0.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nIf not, proceed to compute min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each input case:\n\n1. Check if the initial three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n2. Compute the minimal tiles needed to form a triplet (min_triplet).\n\n3. Compute the minimal tiles needed to form a sequence (min_sequence).\n\n4. The answer is the minimum between min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nSo, the next thing is to implement these checks.\n\nNow, how to implement step 1.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: they are in same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nBut the order doesn't matter. So, for example, the tiles could be 3s, 1s, 2s. So sorted, they are 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, for the sequence check:\n\n- All three must be same suit.\n\n- The numbers must be three consecutive numbers. So, when sorted, they should be x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, for the initial three tiles, let's check for this.\n\nNow, for step 2: min_triplet.\n\nWe need to find for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.) how many are present in the initial three. Then, for each such tile, the required number is 3 - count. The minimal among all possible tile types.\n\nBut since the initial three may have some counts, for example, if there are two 1m, then adding one more would make a triplet. So the required is 1.\n\nBut if there are zero of a tile type, then required is 3.\n\nSo, for all possible tile types (each of the 9 numbers in each of the three suits), we can compute how many are present in the initial three, and then compute 3 - count. Then take the minimum of these.\n\nBut note that the initial three may have some counts. For example, if the initial has one 1m, then the required is 2. But maybe there's another tile type with even less required. Like if there's a tile with two 2p's. Then for that tile, required is 1.\n\nSo, the code for min_triplet is:\n\ncount = a dictionary that counts how many times each tile appears in the initial three.\n\nfor each tile_type in all possible 27 types:\n\n    required = 3 - count.get(tile_type, 0)\n\n    keep track of the minimum required.\n\nBut since the initial three can have up to 3 of the same tile. For example, if the initial is three 1m, then the required is 0, but since the initial already forms a triplet, we would have already checked that in step 1 and returned 0.\n\nSo in this case, step 2 is only called when step 1 returns false. Therefore, for step 2, the minimal required for triplet is the minimal (3 - count) across all possible tile types.\n\nBut what if there are no existing tiles of a certain type? For example, if the initial three have zero of 1m. Then, required is 3. But maybe there's a better option.\n\nNow, for step 3: min_sequence.\n\nWe need to check for all possible sequences (each possible triplet of consecutive numbers in same suit) how many of the initial tiles are part of that sequence. Then, required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, for each suit in m, p, s:\n\n   for start in 1 to 7:\n\n       the sequence is [start, start+1, start+2]\n\n       check how many of the initial tiles are in this sequence (same suit, and number is in the sequence).\n\n       required is 3 - count.\n\n       keep track of the minimal required.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then for the sequence 1-2-3 (suit s), the count is 2 (1s and 2s). So required is 1 (add 3s). For the sequence 2-3-4 (suit s), count is 2 (2s and 4s?), no, wait. The sequence is 2,3,4. So initial tiles have 2s and 4s. So count is 2. So required is 1 (add 3s). So for this case, the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo the code for min_sequence would be:\n\nmin_seq = infinity\n\nfor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start in 1 to 7:\n\n        seq_numbers = [start, start+1, start+2]\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for tile in initial_tiles:\n\n            if tile's suit == suit and tile's number is in seq_numbers:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < min_seq:\n\n            min_seq = required\n\nso the minimal required for sequence is min_seq.\n\nThen, the answer is min( min_triplet, min_seq )\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping possibilities? For example, maybe there's a way to form a sequence that requires 1 tile, and a triplet that requires 2. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo combining the two, the minimal between the two.\n\nSo putting it all together, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each input case:\n\n- Parse the three tiles.\n\n- Check if they form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n- Compute min_triplet as the minimal (3 - count) for all possible tile types.\n\n- Compute min_sequence as the minimal (3 - count) for all possible sequences.\n\n- The answer is min( min_triplet, min_sequence )\n\nBut what about cases where the same tile can be used in multiple ways? For example, if the initial tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, the min_triplet would be 1 (add another 1m), and the min_sequence could be 1 (add 3m to form 1-2-3). So the answer is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if the initial tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then, step 1 would have detected that it's a sequence, so answer is 0.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, parsing the input. The input is three strings. For example, in the first example, the input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']. Wait, the input is three strings, each being three tiles. Wait, the input line is three strings. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit... So for example, the input is something like \"1s 2s 3s\", but the actual input is three strings. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a representation of three separate inputs. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is three strings. So the actual input is a single line with three strings separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nBut the sample shows that for the input, the output is 0, 0, 1. So perhaps the actual input is three separate test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. So for each test case, the input is three strings. But the sample input shows that the input is given as three different cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is supposed to read three separate test cases. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line containing three strings. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably not correct. Wait, the sample input shows that the output is ['0', '0', '1'], which suggests that there are three separate test cases, each with three tiles. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with three strings. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each element of the list is a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. So perhaps the actual input is three strings, each representing the three tiles in the hand. For example, for the first example, the input is three strings, each being the three tiles. So for example, the first input is \"1s 2s 3s\" (the three tiles), the second is \"9m 9m 9m\", and the third is \"3p 9m 2p\".\n\nSo the code needs to read three separate test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. So for example, the input would be:\n\n1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\n\nBut that would be nine strings. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit...\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three strings, each of which is a tile. Wait, no, the problem says:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p, or s.\n\nAh, so the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So for example, the input for the first sample is:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nWhich is three strings. Then the output is 0. The second input is 9m 9m 9m, output 0. Third input is 3p 9m 2p, output 1.\n\nSo the code should read three strings from the input, split by whitespace. So for example, the input line is three strings, each being a tile. So the code reads the input as a list of three strings.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is written as a list of three elements, but that's probably just a representation. So the actual input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for example, in the first case, the input is:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nSo the code reads the three tiles as ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nSo, the code will process each input case as a list of three tiles.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nRead the input line as three strings, split into parts.\n\nFor each of the three test cases, process them.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as three different cases, but the code needs to process each of them.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is three different cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. So perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case per input line. But perhaps the problem is that the original problem is in Chinese, and the sample input is written as three separate test cases. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with three strings. So for example, the input for the first sample is three tiles, and the output is 0. But the sample shows that there are three outputs. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read three separate test cases, each on a separate line. Or perhaps the problem is that the sample input is a list of three test cases, and the code should process each of them.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo the input is three separate test cases, each consisting of three tiles. So the code should read three lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the input is a single line with three strings, each being three tiles. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three strings, each being a tile. So the code should read three tiles. So for example, the first sample input is three tiles: 1s, 2s, 3s. The output is 0.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input has three test cases, each with three tiles. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual code is supposed to read a single test case, and output a single integer.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is three integers. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read three test cases. But the problem says that the input is one line with three strings. That's conflicting.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with three strings. For example, the sample input shows that the input is three strings. But the sample output is three integers. So perhaps the problem is that the original problem has multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings. Which implies that the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the sample shows three outputs. So there's confusion here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements, and the output is a list of three elements. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of three tiles, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is only one line with three strings. Which would imply that the code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nThis is confusing. But perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that each element in the list is a separate test case, but the actual input is three separate lines. Or perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem description is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three separate test cases, each on a separate line. For example, the sample input is three lines, each with three tiles. The sample output is three lines, each with the answer for that case.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings. Which would imply that the code is supposed to read one line of three tiles. So perhaps the sample is wrong, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of three tiles.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process three test cases, each given in a line. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers. Therefore, the code must read three test cases, each consisting of three tiles. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings. Which is conflicting.\n\nThis is a critical point. Without knowing the correct input format, the code cannot be written properly.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo the input is three separate cases, each with three tiles. So the code must read three lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the input is one line with three test cases, each being three tiles. For example, the input is three strings, each being a test case. But that's not clear.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand — it's likely that the input is three tiles, and the output is one integer. However, the sample shows three outputs, which suggests that there are three test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read three test cases, each given as three tiles. But the actual input for the code is three test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nAssuming that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with three tiles, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, the input could be three lines, each with three tiles.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to process three test cases. For example, in the sample input, the input is three separate test cases. Therefore, the code should read three lines, each containing three tiles. Each line represents a test case.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nWell, the problem's note says:\n\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.\n\nIn the second example, she has a koutsu.\n\nIn the third example, she needs to draw one tile.\n\nTherefore, the sample input is three different test cases. So the code must process three test cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. This is conflicting. However, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is three lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the input is a single line with three test cases, each with three tiles, separated by spaces.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem is that the code should read three test cases, each consisting of three tiles. And the input is given as three lines. For example, the code reads three lines, each with three tiles.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements, each being a string. So perhaps the code should read a single line with three strings, each representing a test case. For example, the input line is:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"\n\nBut that would be nine strings. Which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is three strings, each being a test case. For example, each string is three tiles separated by spaces. For example, the first test case is \"1s 2s 3s\", the second is \"9m 9m 9m\", the third is \"3p 9m 2p\".\n\nSo the input line is three strings, each being three tiles. So the input is a single line with three strings, each of which is three tiles. For example, the input line would be:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"\n\nBut that would be nine tokens. Which would be parsed as three test cases, each with three tiles. So the code would split the input into tokens, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut that's a possibility.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nWell, the problem's sample input shows that the input is three strings, each being three tiles. So the code should read the input as a list of three strings, each of which is three tiles. For example, for the first test case, the three tiles are \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\nSo, the code would read the input line as a list of three strings, each of which is a space-separated list of three tiles. For example, the input line would be:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s 9m 9m 9m 3p 9m 2p\"\n\nWhich would be split into three strings: [\"1s 2s 3s\", \"9m 9m 9m\", \"3p 9m 2p\"], and each of these is processed as three tiles.\n\nBut this is a bit unclear. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to process three test cases, each with three tiles. So the code should read the input line as a list of three test cases, each being three tiles.\n\nBut how to parse that?\n\nIn Python, the input can be read as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\ntest_cases = input_line.split()\n\nThen, each test case is a group of three tiles. For example, if the input_line is split into nine elements, then the three test cases are:\n\ntest_case_1 = test_cases[0:3]\n\ntest_case_2 = test_cases[3:6]\n\ntest_case_3 = test_cases[6:9]\n\nSo, the code would process each group of three tiles as a separate test case.\n\nBut this is an assumption based on the sample input and output.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with writing the code that processes three test cases, each consisting of three tiles.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process one test case, and the sample input is written as three test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. So, the code should read three tiles, and output one integer. But the sample shows three outputs. So this is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample shows three outputs, and the problem says that the code should print a single integer, I think that the sample is written incorrectly, and the actual problem is to process one test case. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, but the problem says that the input is one test case. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output are provided as lists, perhaps the code is supposed to read three test cases, and output three answers. For example, the code reads three lines, each with three tiles, and outputs three lines, each with the answer.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the problem says that the output is a single integer. But the sample shows three integers. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is a critical issue. Without knowing the correct input format, the code cannot be written properly.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with three strings. So for example, the input is three strings, each being a tile. So the code reads three tiles. For example, the first sample input is three tiles: 1s, 2s, 3s. The output is 0. The second input is three tiles: 9m, 9m, 9m. Output is 0. Third input is three tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p. Output is 1.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is three separate cases, each with three tiles. So the sample input and output are for three separate test cases. Hence, the code must process three test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings. So this is a contradiction. Perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is three lines, each with three tiles. Or perhaps the input is a single line with three test cases, each being three tiles.\n\nAssuming that the code should process three test cases, each with three tiles, and the input is given as three lines, each with three tiles. Then the code would read three lines, each line containing three tiles, and output three lines with the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into individual tokens, and process them as test cases.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read a single test case, and the sample shows three test cases for illustration purposes. However, this seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three tiles, and the code should output one integer, and the sample shows three separate examples, each with their own input and output.\n\nIn that case, the code should read one test case, and output one integer. But the sample input and output show three examples. So perhaps the problem is that the sample is written as three separate examples, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps looking at the problem's original source. However, assuming that the problem is from a programming competition, the input is likely to be a single test case. But the sample shows three outputs, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is three separate test cases, and the code should read them as three lines, and output three answers.\n\nBut given that the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings, I'm going to assume that the code should read three tiles, and output one integer. And the sample input and output are three separate examples, each with their own input and output.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the sample input and output? For example, the first sample input is three tiles, and the output is 0. The second sample input is three tiles, output 0. Third sample input is three tiles, output 1. So the code should process one test case, and the sample shows three test cases. This suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single line with three strings, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code should process a single test case, and the sample shows three examples.\n\nBut how to explain the sample input and output? Perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the actual code should read one test case per line. For example, the code reads three lines, each with three tiles, and outputs three lines with the answers.\n\nIn this case, the code would look like:\n\nRead three lines, each line has three tiles.\n\nFor each line, process the three tiles and output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nWell, for the purpose of solving the problem, I'll proceed with writing code that reads three test cases, each with three tiles, and outputs the answer for each.\n\nBut given that the problem statement says that the input is a single line with three strings, I'm not sure. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, assuming that the code should read three test cases, each with three tiles, and output the answer for each.\n\nNow, moving forward with the code.\n\nFirst, parsing the input.\n\nFor each test case, we have three tiles. For example, for the first test case, the tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\ntiles = list of three strings.\n\nThen, check if they form a mentsu.\n\nTo check for triplet:\n\nall three tiles are the same.\n\nTo check for sequence:\n\nall three are same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for the sequence check:\n\nWe can extract the numbers and suits of each tile.\n\nFor example, for tile '1s', number is 1, suit is 's'.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, we can get their numbers and suits.\n\nLet's write a helper function to parse a tile into its number and suit.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef parse_tile(tile_str):\n    number = int(tile_str[0])\n    suit = tile_str[1]\n    return (number, suit)\n\nOnce parsed, for the three tiles:\n\nnumbers = [n1, n2, n3]\n\nsuits = [s1, s2, s3]\n\nFor a triplet, check if all suits are the same and all numbers are the same.\n\nFor a sequence, check if all suits are the same, and the numbers are consecutive.\n\nBut how to check for consecutive numbers?\n\nSort the numbers, then check if they are x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\nif sorted_numbers[0] + 1 == sorted_numbers[1] and sorted_numbers[1] + 1 == sorted_numbers[2], then it's a sequence.\n\nSo, for the initial check:\n\nif (all suits are same and all numbers are same) OR (all suits are same and sorted numbers are consecutive), then return 0.\n\nElse, proceed to calculate min_triplet and min_sequence.\n\nNow, for the min_triplet calculation:\n\nWe need to count for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2m, etc.) how many are present in the initial three tiles.\n\nBut since the initial three tiles can have multiple occurrences of the same tile, for example, two 1m's.\n\nSo, for example, for the initial tiles, create a frequency dictionary.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nfreq = defaultdict",
