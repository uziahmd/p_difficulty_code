There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. For each house, the profit is a² where a is the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Well, since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even then, for n=50, each house can have up to h+1 possibilities (from 0 to h). So 50^50 possibilities? That's way too big. So brute-force is impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: think of it as an optimization problem with constraints. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is ≤ x_i. How can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: since the constraints involve maximums over ranges, perhaps we can model the problem by determining for each position the maximum allowed height, considering all restrictions that apply to it. But how?\n\nWait, but each restriction applies to a range. For example, a restriction on [l_i, r_i] says that the maximum in that interval must be ≤ x_i. So, for any position in that interval, the height can't be more than x_i, because if it were, then the max would be higher than x_i. Wait, no. Because maybe another house in the interval is higher. But the restriction requires that the maximum is at most x_i. Therefore, every house in the interval can't be higher than x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. So, for each restriction, all houses in [l_i, r_i] must have their heights ≤ x_i. Wait, is that correct?\n\nNo! Wait, suppose that there's a restriction that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] must be ≤ x_i. Then, if all houses in that interval are ≤x_i, then the max is automatically ≤x_i. However, the converse is not true. If one house is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i, which is invalid. Therefore, the constraint is that for each restriction, the maximum of the interval is ≤x_i. Which implies that all houses in the interval must be ≤x_i. Because if even one is higher, then the max is higher. Therefore, the constraints can be transformed into, for each restriction, for all positions in [l_i, r_i], their height must be ≤x_i. Because if you have a restriction that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is ≤x_i, then each house in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a restriction that says the maximum of [1,3] must be ≤2. Then, each of the houses 1,2,3 must be ≤2. Because if any of them is higher, the maximum would be higher than 2. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, each restriction can be considered as imposing that for all positions in [l_i, r_i], their height is ≤x_i. Therefore, for each position, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that cover that position. Wait, no. Because for a position j, any restriction that includes j in its interval [l_i, r_i] would require that the height of j is ≤x_i. Therefore, the maximum allowed height for position j is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include j in their interval. But also, there's the global h limit. So the actual maximum allowed for each position is min(h, min of all x_i's from restrictions that include that position).\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple restrictions that cover the same position. For example, if there's a restriction that [1,2] must be ≤3, and another that [1,1] must be ≤2. Then for position 1, the maximum allowed is 2, since that's the minimum of 3 and 2. So yes.\n\nSo, if I can compute for each position j, the maximum allowed height, which is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum allowed height, since each a² is maximized when a is as high as possible.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because maybe some restrictions are overlapping and conflicting. But according to the above logic, the maximum allowed for each position is the minimum of all x_i's that apply to it. So, if I set each position to that value, then all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nLet me check with the first example:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nSo for position 1: only the first restriction applies. So max allowed is 1. Position 2: only the second restriction applies, so max allowed is 3. Position 3: only third restriction, max allowed is 2. So setting each to their maximum gives 1,3,2. Which matches the example. The total is 1+9+4=14. Which is correct.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput is 4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nSo for each position:\n\nPosition 1: no restrictions. So max allowed is 10.\n\nPosition 2: covered by first restriction (2-3, x=8). So max allowed is 8.\n\nPosition 3: covered by both restrictions. First restriction says x=8, second says x=7. So min(8,7) is 7. So max allowed is 7.\n\nPosition 4: covered by second restriction (3-4, x=7). So max allowed is 7.\n\nThus, the heights are 10,8,7,7. Which gives 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262, which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the problem reduces to, for each position, compute the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include that position. Then, take the minimum between that and h. Then, sum the squares of those values.\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because each restriction requires that in its interval, the maximum height is <= x_i. By setting each position's height to the minimum of all x_i's that cover it, then for any restriction, all positions in its interval are <= x_i. Because the minimum for each position in the interval is <= x_i. So the maximum in the interval is <=x_i. Therefore, all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for each position j (from 1 to n), compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i]. Then, the maximum allowed height for j is min(h, that minimal x_i). Then sum the squares of these values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each position j (from 1 to n), find all restrictions that include j in their interval [l_i, r_i].\n\n2. For each such j, compute the minimum x_i among those restrictions. If there are no restrictions that include j, then the maximum allowed is h.\n\n3. Then, for each j, take the minimum between h and that value. Wait, but the restrictions' x_i can be up to h. So if there are no restrictions for j, then the max allowed is h. Otherwise, it's the min of the x_i's for the restrictions covering j, which could be less than h. So the overall maximum allowed for j is min( (min x_i from restrictions covering j), h). But since x_i is already <=h (as per input constraints: x_i is between 0 and h), then the min x_i is already <=h. So the maximum allowed is just the min x_i from the restrictions covering j, or h if there are no restrictions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize for each position j, the maximum allowed is h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), for each position j in l_i to r_i, set the maximum allowed for j to be the minimum between its current value and x_i.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute sum of (max_allowed[j]^2) for all j.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. For each position, track the maximum allowed height. Initially, it's h. Then for each restriction, iterate through all positions in l_i to r_i, and set their max allowed to min(current value, x_i). Finally, sum the squares.\n\nThis seems very manageable. Let's see for the first example:\n\nInitially, all positions have max allowed 3.\n\nProcess first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. So for position 1, set to min(3,1)=1.\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3. Position 2 is set to min(3,3)=3.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2. Position 3 is set to min(3,2)=2.\n\nSo the final array is [1,3,2], sum squares is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10. Initially all positions are 10.\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So positions 2 and 3 are set to min(10,8) =8.\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. For positions 3 and 4. Position 3 is min(8,7)=7. Position 4 is min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo final array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum squares is 100+64+49+49= 262.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array (say, max_heights) of size n, initialized to h.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   read l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\n   for j in range l_i to r_i (inclusive):\n\n       max_heights[j-1] = min( max_heights[j-1], x_i )\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares of each element in max_heights.\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple restrictions that affect the same positions. For example, if a restriction says [1,3] x=5, and another [1,2] x=4. Then for position 1, the max is 4, and for position 2, it's 4, and for position 3, it's 5. So the code correctly applies each restriction.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about the input parsing. The input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first input is given as a list of two elements, each being a string. For example:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich represents two test cases. The output is ['14', '262'].\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is read from standard input. So perhaps the input is multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, perhaps another test case?\n\nWait, the sample input shows two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. However, looking at the sample input, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the actual problem expects to process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows two examples, but in reality, the actual input is a single test case. Wait, perhaps the user provided the sample input as two test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads a single test case. Or perhaps the problem has multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m, etc. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, looking at the sample input, the first example's input is given as a string that starts with '3 3 3' followed by three lines. The second example is '4 10 2' followed by two lines. But the sample output is two lines. So perhaps the actual problem has multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, perhaps another test case?\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the actual problem has multiple test cases. But the problem's input format is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first input is a string that represents the first test case, and the second string represents the second test case. The output is the corresponding outputs for each test case.\n\nBut how is the input given in the actual problem? The problem's input says that the first line contains n, h, m. But in the sample input, the first line is '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2' which is for the first test case. Then the next input is another test case.\n\nBut perhaps the actual code needs to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code should read a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['14', '262']\n\nSo the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how is that given? In the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line, but perhaps the actual code needs to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is not clear. But the sample input shows that the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original description, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut that would be for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the actual code must read one test case. However, the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the output is two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But looking at the problem's note, the first example's input is given as:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is one test case. The second example's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input is not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut in the problem's original input, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split into test cases. However, the problem's input format is unclear. But looking at the sample input, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. Which suggests that there's only one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, but the problem's input description does not mention that. However, the problem's sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first line is the first test case's input. Then the second line is the second test case's input. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. But given that the sample input shows two test cases, and the output has two answers, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, in the sample input, the code is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. So for example, in the code, the input is read as a list of lines. However, in practice, when the code is run, the input comes from standard input. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases. However, how to determine how many test cases there are?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe first input is given as a list of two elements. The first element is the input for the first test case, and the second is for the second test case. However, in reality, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read from standard input, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not specify that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So for each test case, the code reads n, h, m, then m lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is missing that part. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two answers. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how? For example, the code needs to read until EOF. So for each test case, read the first line as n, h, m. Then read m lines. Then process the next test case. So the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the code should read each test case as follows:\n\nRead the first line, which is n, h, m. Then read m lines of restrictions.\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases? The code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as per test cases. For example, read the entire input as a list of lines, then process each test case in turn.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But the problem's input description does not say that. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input may have only one test case. However, given the sample input, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, the code can read all the lines, and then process each test case by reading the first line (n, h, m), then the next m lines as restrictions, and repeat until all lines are processed.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way to read from stdin is to read all lines at once.\n\nSo here's the plan: read all lines from stdin. Then process each test case as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the first line of the test case, split into n, h, m.\n\nThen read the next m lines for the restrictions.\n\nThen process the test case.\n\nBut how to manage the lines? For example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them in order.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the lines are:\n\nLine 1: '3 3 3'\n\nLine 2: '1 1 1'\n\nLine 3: '2 2 3'\n\nLine 4: '3 3 2'\n\nLine 5: '4 10 2'\n\nLine 6: '2 3 8'\n\nLine 7: '3 4 7'\n\nSo the code would read the first line as n=3, h=3, m=3. Then read next 3 lines as restrictions. Then process the next line (line 5) as n=4, h=10, m=2, then read next 2 lines as restrictions.\n\nThus, the code can process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code will need to read all lines from input, and process them as per test cases.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, here's the approach:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, process the lines as per test cases.\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(lines):\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n\n    current_line +=1\n\n    restrictions = []\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        l, r, x = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n\n        restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\n        current_line +=1\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nSo, in code, that's how to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input may have only one test case. However, the sample input shows two, and the code must process them.\n\nTherefore, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nOnce that is handled, the rest is straightforward.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nInitialize max_heights as [h] * n.\n\nFor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for j in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       max_heights[j-1] = min( max_heights[j-1], x )\n\nThen compute the sum of squares of each element in max_heights.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n, h, m = ... \n\n    max_heights = [h] * n\n\n    for each of m restrictions:\n\n        l, r, x = ... \n\n        for pos in range(l, r+1):\n\n            idx = pos -1\n\n            if max_heights[idx] > x:\n\n                max_heights[idx] = x\n\n    total = sum( [a*a for a in max_heights] )\n\n    print(total)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test for the first example:\n\nTest case 1: n=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions are (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2).\n\nmax_heights starts as [3,3,3]\n\nAfter first restriction (1-1, x=1): [1,3,3]\n\nAfter second (2-2, x=3): [1,3,3]\n\nAfter third (3-3, x=2): [1,3,2]. sum squares 1+9+4=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions (2-3, 8) and (3-4, 7).\n\nmax_heights starts as [10,10,10,10]\n\nFirst restriction: positions 2 and 3. So set to 8. Now [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction: positions 3 and 4. Set to 7. So [10,8,7,7]. sum 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about overlapping restrictions?\n\nFor example, a restriction that covers a range and another that covers a subset. Like:\n\nn=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nrestriction 1: 1-2, x=3.\n\nrestriction 2: 1-1, x=4.\n\nThen for position 1: min(3,4) =3. Position 2: 3. So sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nBut the first restriction says that the max in 1-2 is <=3, which is satisfied. The second restriction says the max in 1-1 is <=4, which is satisfied.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: if a restriction is redundant. Like, a restriction on [1-2] x=5, and another on [1-2] x=3. Then the code will process both, and the max_heights for positions 1 and 2 will be 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about if there are no restrictions? Then the max_heights is all h, sum is n*h².\n\nYes.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nn=1, h=0, m=0. Then the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,1, 3]. So max_height is 3. sum is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles all these.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nNow, the code must read from stdin. So, the code can be structured as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    current_line = 0\n\n    while current_line < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n, h, m\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n\n        current_line +=1\n\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n\n            current_line +=1\n\n            # Apply this restriction to positions l to r\n\n            for pos in range(l, r+1):\n\n                idx = pos -1\n\n                if max_heights[idx] > x:\n\n                    max_heights[idx] = x\n\n        total = sum( a*a for a in max_heights )\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is parsed correctly.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as a list, and processed.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the input has multiple test cases, but the code reads them correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe code processes the first test case, outputs 14, then processes the second, outputs 262.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, code this.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. Also, note that for some cases, the input may have multiple lines for a single test case. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if m=0? Then, the code skips the for loop, and the max_heights is all h. Correct.\n\nWhat if l_i and r_i are same as the position? It's handled correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses the same variable names as in the problem.\n\nSo, this should be correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a maximum value `h`, and each restriction imposes a limit on the maximum height of houses within a specific range. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum allowed height for each house to the global maximum height `h`.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowed height for each house within the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    current_line = 0\n    while current_line < len(lines):\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n        current_line += 1\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[current_line].split())\n            current_line += 1\n            for pos in range(l, r + 1):\n                idx = pos - 1\n                if max_heights[idx] > x:\n                    max_heights[idx] = x\n        total = sum(a * a for a in max_heights)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize an array `max_heights` where each element starts as the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate over the specified range of houses and update their maximum allowed height to ensure it does not exceed the restriction's limit. This ensures that all restrictions are satisfied.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the values in `max_heights`.\n\nThis approach efficiently applies each restriction and ensures that the solution adheres to all constraints while maximizing the profit. The complexity is manageable given the problem constraints (n, h, m ≤ 50), making this approach both effective and efficient.",
