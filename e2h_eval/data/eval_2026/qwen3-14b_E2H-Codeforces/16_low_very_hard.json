Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows us to compute adjacency efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the number of blocks can be huge (since each new line can potentially double the number of regions), it's impossible to generate all blocks explicitly. So we need another approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of representing the blocks directly, think about the problem in terms of the regions defined by the roads. Each region can be uniquely identified by the sign of the equations of each road. Because for each road, a point lies on one side or the other of the line. So for each road, the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i will be either positive or negative. So, the region can be represented by a tuple of signs for each road. However, since there are n roads, each with two possible signs, there are 2^n possible regions. But for n=300, this is impossible. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe we don't need to generate all regions. Instead, think about the problem as a graph where each node represents a region (block). Two regions are connected if they share a common border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home region and the university region. But how to model this graph?\n\nThe problem is that the number of regions is too large for n=300. So we need a way to model this without explicitly enumerating all regions.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the problem as a BFS traversal where each state is the set of roads that separate the current region from the home region. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: For any two regions, if they are adjacent, then they differ by exactly one road. Because, when you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. But wait, is that true?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two regions are separated by a single road. Then, their signs for all roads except that one are the same. But if there are multiple roads, maybe two regions can differ in more than one road's sign and still be adjacent. No, I think that's not possible. Because if two regions are adjacent, their boundary is a line (road), so they must share a common border which is part of that road. Therefore, they must differ in exactly one road's sign. Because all other roads would have the same sign for both regions. Because otherwise, if two regions differ in two roads' signs, then their boundary would require crossing two roads, which might not be possible. Wait, maybe not. But according to the problem statement, moving between regions requires that their common border has non-zero length. So, if two regions are adjacent across a single road, then they differ in exactly one road's sign. But if two regions are separated by multiple roads, maybe they can't be adjacent. Therefore, the adjacency graph is such that two regions are connected if they differ in exactly one road's sign. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign flips needed to go from the home region's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, with each step flipping exactly one sign.\n\nBut how do we model that? Because each road's sign can be determined for the home and university positions. Let's see:\n\nFor the home point (x1, y1), for each road i, compute s_i = sign(a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i). Similarly for the university point (x2, y2), compute t_i = sign(a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). \n\nNow, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of steps to change the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, where each step can flip exactly one sign. However, this is only possible if the two sign vectors differ in some positions. But wait, each step corresponds to crossing a road, which flips the sign for that road. However, the minimal steps would be the number of differing signs between the home and university's sign vectors. But that's only if each differing sign can be flipped individually. But wait, that's not correct. Because if two regions differ in k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can flip one road's sign. But why?\n\nWait, for example, suppose home's sign vector is [s1, s2, s3], and the university's is [t",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero length boundary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each block can be represented by the signs of the values obtained by plugging the coordinates of a point into each road's equation. Two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one sign (i.e., they are separated by a single road).\n\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For both the home and university coordinates, calculate the sign of each road's equation. This gives us two sign vectors representing the regions containing the home and university.\n\n3. **Determine Differences**: The minimum number of steps required is determined by the number of differing signs between the home and university sign vectors. Each differing sign represents a road that needs to be crossed to move from one block to another.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for home\n    home_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        sign = 1 if val > 0 else -1\n        home_signs.append(sign)\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for university\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        sign = 1 if val > 0 else -1\n        uni_signs.append(sign)\n    \n    # Count differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, and the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Vectors Calculation**: For each road, compute the sign of the value obtained by substituting the home and university coordinates into the road's equation. These signs form vectors that represent the regions containing the home and university.\n3. **Difference Calculation**: The number of differing signs between the two vectors gives the minimum number of steps required, as each differing sign indicates a road that must be crossed to move from the home region to the university region.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, avoiding the need to explicitly model all possible regions.",
