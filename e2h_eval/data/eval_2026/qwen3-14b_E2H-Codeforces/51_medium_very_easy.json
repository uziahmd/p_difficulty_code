Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is a pile of letters found in the morning. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the first two names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host names. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenated string of the first two lines (guest + host) has exactly the same characters as the third line (the pile), with the same counts for each character.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. One way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then sort them, and compare with the sorted pile string. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because sorting both and comparing will ensure that the counts of each character are the same.\n\nSo for example, if guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAUS\", combining gives \"SANTACLAUS\". Then the pile should be a permutation of that. Sorting both the combined string and the pile, if they are equal, then it's possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Sort the concatenated string and the third line's string.\n4. Compare the two sorted strings. If equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the pile has more or less letters than the combined length? For example, if the combined length is 10, but the pile is 9 letters. Then obviously, it's impossible. But when we sort and compare, the lengths would differ, so the sorted strings would not match. So checking the sorted strings would automatically account for that.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's straightforward. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nLet me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nCombined is guest + host. Let me check the lengths. Guest is 10 letters (SANTACLAUS is 10 letters?), let me count:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S → that's 10 letters. Host is DEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Combined length is 18.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Let me count:\n\nBut maybe the exact count isn't needed. When sorted, the combined and pile should be same.\n\nSo the code would sort both and compare.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is YES. So the code would return YES.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nguest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. Combined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see the length. Let me count:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Combined is 19 letters. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me check the length. Let me see: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters. Let me see, maybe it's 19 letters? Or maybe not. But according to the note, there's a missing P and an extra L. So when sorted, the combined and pile would differ.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nThird sample input: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me see, the note says there's an extra L. So the code would compare sorted combined and sorted pile, which would differ.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is three lines. So in Python, how to read them?\n\nIn Python, we can read using input().strip() three times. But perhaps, since the input may have leading or trailing spaces? But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So we can safely read each line with input().strip().\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nBut in actual input, the three lines are separated by newlines. So for each test case, the code would read three lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So for each test case, we read three lines.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the input is three lines. For example, the first input is three lines: first line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nSo the code needs to read three lines. So in Python, for each test case, read three lines.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code would read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"A\", then sorted(combined) is ['A', 'B'], sorted(pile) is ['A'], so they are different. So the code handles that.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS\nSecond: DEDMOROZ\nThird: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see:\n\nThe combined letters: S A N T A C L A U S D E D M O R O Z.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see:\n\nLetters: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S.\n\nWait, but the combined has D E D M O R O Z. The pile has D E D C L A U S ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the combined has letters that when sorted, match the pile.\n\nBut the sample says it's correct. So the code would return YES.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's count letters. Let's see:\n\nPAPAINOEL → P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → 9 letters.\n\nJOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → 10 letters. Total 19 letters.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters. Let me check the length. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → Let's count letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → Let me count:\n\nBut perhaps the length is 19? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nOriginal combined length is 9 + 10 = 19. The pile's length is len(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\")?\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → Let me count each letter:\n\nJ (1), O (2?), U (3?), L (4?), N (5), A (6), P (7), A (8), O (9), I (10), L (11), E (12), L (13), U (14), P (15), U (16), K (17), K (18), I (19). So length 19. So same length. But the note says that there's a missing P and an extra L. So when sorted, the combined and pile would differ.\n\nFor example, in the combined, the count of P is 2 (from guest PAPAINOEL: two P's) and in host JOULUPUKKI: one P. So total 3 P's. In the pile, let's see: how many P's?\n\nIn the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me look for P's. The letters are:\n\nLooking at the string: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. So there are two P's? Let me see:\n\nThe letters: there's a P in \"JOULNAP...\" (position 6?), then another P in \"LUP...\" (position 14?), so two P's. So the combined has three P's, but the pile has two. So when sorted, the combined would have three P's, pile has two. So the sorted lists would differ. Hence the code returns NO.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's see, the note says there's an extra L.\n\nSo the combined has some letters, and the pile has an extra L. So when sorted, the pile would have an extra L, hence the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case where all letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"BA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABB\" → NO.\n\nSo the code handles all these.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, the problem says that the input is three lines, and the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead three lines, then check as above.\n\nNow, the sample input given in the problem is a list of three test cases. But the actual input for the code is three lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile.\n\nSo for each test case, there are three lines. But the sample input shows three different test cases, each with three lines. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, and the sample input shows multiple test cases as examples.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but the actual input for the code is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. For example, in the sample input, each of the three examples is a separate test case. But the code is supposed to read three lines from stdin, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich would output YES.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is a list of three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nBut this is probably just a way to represent multiple test cases in the sample. However, the actual code is supposed to read three lines from standard input. So for example, when the user runs the code, the input is three lines, and the code outputs one line (YES or NO).\n\nTherefore, the code is written to process a single test case. So the code is as follows:\n\nRead three lines, process them, output YES or NO.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nif sorted(guest + host) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS', host = 'DEDMOROZ', pile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nsorted(guest + host) is sorted('SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ') → which should be the same as sorted(pile), which is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → sorted.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nguest = 'PAPAINOEL', host = 'JOULUPUKKI', pile = 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\nsorted(guest + host) would have letters of PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. The code compares sorted versions. Since the pile has one less P and one extra L, the sorted lists would differ. So returns NO.\n\nThird sample input: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS, pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. The combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile has an extra L. So sorted(pile) would have more Ls than combined. So returns NO.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about leading or trailing spaces? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So the input lines don't have any leading or trailing whitespace. So using input().strip() is safe. But perhaps, the problem's input lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces? But according to the problem statement, no. So the code uses strip() to remove any possible leading/trailing whitespace, but in reality, the input lines are correct. However, the problem says that the lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters only. So perhaps using input().strip() is redundant, but better safe than sorry. For example, if there's a trailing newline or something. But in practice, the input lines are correct. However, using strip() ensures that even if there are any leading/trailing spaces (which shouldn't be there according to the problem statement), they are removed. But according to the problem statement, the input lines don't have such spaces. So perhaps the code can use input().strip() to read each line.\n\nBut in Python, input() reads a line without the trailing newline. So for example, if the input is 'ABC\\n', then input() would return 'ABC'. So in the code, using input().strip() is safe. However, if the input line is empty, but the problem says that all lines are non-empty. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read three lines from the input. The first two lines represent the guest's name and the host's name, while the third line represents the pile of letters found.\n2. **Concatenation**: Combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Comparison**: Sort the characters of the combined string and the pile string. If both sorted strings are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `input().strip()` to ensure any leading or trailing whitespace is removed, although the problem guarantees that inputs are clean.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to represent all characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: By sorting the characters of both the combined string and the pile string, we can directly compare if they contain the same characters in the same frequencies. If they do, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of characters using sorting, which ensures correctness and simplicity. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n) where n is the total length of the combined string and the pile. This is efficient given the problem constraints.",
