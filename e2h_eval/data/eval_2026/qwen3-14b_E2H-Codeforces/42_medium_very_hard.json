    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nSo, the first thing I need to understand is how these progress bars work. Let me rephrase the problem. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file's progress, and floor(100 * (sum of all previous files' sizes plus x) / total_sum) for the total progress. And we need to find all values that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nThe challenge here is to simulate all possible moments when these two percentages are equal. But since the number of files can be up to 100, and each file can be up to 1000 bytes, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000=10^5. So for each byte copied, we can check both percentages and track when they are equal. However, with 1e5 bytes, and for each byte checking two calculations, this seems feasible. But maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nWait, but the problem says that after each byte, the progress bars are updated. So for each byte copied, we have to check if the two percentages are the same. But considering that for each file, there are a_i bytes. So the total number of steps is sum(a_i), which could be up to 1e5. For each step, we can compute both percentages and record if they match. Then collect all such values.\n\nBut how do I model the steps? Let's think:\n\nWe can iterate through each file, and for each byte in that file, compute the current progress and the total progress.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFirst, compute the total_sum = sum(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Then, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), compute:\n\ncurrent_progress = floor(100 * x / a_i)\ntotal_progress = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n\nwhere sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of the previous files (i.e., sum(a_1 ... a_{i-1})). \n\nBut also, note that before any bytes are copied, both bars are zero. So the initial state (0,0) is included. Wait, according to the problem statement: \"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\" So that's a moment where both are 0. So 0 is definitely part of the answer.\n\nBut when we simulate the steps, the initial 0 is included. However, when you start copying the first byte, the progress bars update after that byte. So the initial 0 is considered as a valid moment. So we need to include that.\n\nBut how do we capture that? Well, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So perhaps we can consider that as a separate case. But maybe during the simulation, when x is 0 (but that's not part of the steps, since x starts at 1?), no. Wait, according to the problem description, after copying each byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% on both bars. Then, after copying the first byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state is a moment where both are 0. So we need to check if 0 is present. But during the simulation, when processing each byte, we have to check the values after that byte is copied. However, the initial 0 is a moment that occurs before any bytes are copied. So we need to account for that. \n\nSo, for example, in the first test case, the output includes 0 and 100. Because when the copy is done, the total is 100%. But during the process, the bars are equal at all steps, so all percentages are same. But how to capture that initial 0?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all the valid percentages.\n\n- Add 0 to the set initially, since that's the starting state.\n\n- Then, simulate each byte copied, and for each, compute the current and total progress, check if they are equal. If so, add that value to the set.\n\n- Also, after all bytes are copied, the progress bars are 100% (since for the total, it's floor(100 * total_sum / total_sum) = 100. For the current file's progress, when x is a_i, then floor(100 * a_i / a_i) = 100. So the final state is 100% for both. So we need to check if 100 is present. However, during the simulation, when the last byte is processed, the code would have already added 100 if it's present.\n\nWait, but when the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100% and the current progress is 100% (for that last file). So during the simulation, that would be captured. However, if the last byte is processed, then the code would check for that. So adding 0 as initial, and then processing all bytes, and then adding 100 if it's captured. Or maybe the simulation already captures it.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output includes 0 and 100. So the initial 0 is included, and the final 100 is included. So during the simulation, when the last byte is copied, the code checks for the percentage and adds 100. But what about the case where the total progress is 100% but the current progress is not? Like, suppose the last byte is copied, and the current progress is 100%, but the total is 100% as well. So that's captured. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- Then, for each file, for each byte in the file (from 1 to a_i):\n\n   - Compute current progress (floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   - Compute total progress (floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n\n   - If they are equal, add to the set.\n\n- Then, after processing all bytes, check if 100 is in the set. But wait, during the simulation, when x is a_i (the last byte of the file), then the current progress is 100, and the total progress is (sum_prev + x) / total_sum = total_sum / total_sum = 1. So 100 * 1 is 100, floor is 100. So yes, that would be captured. So in the simulation, the 100% is added when the last byte is processed. However, if the total sum is zero? No, because a_i are positive. So the code will capture 100% if it occurs.\n\nBut what if the total_sum is such that (sum_prev + x) is exactly total_sum? Then the total progress is 100. So yes.\n\nBut in the initial state, the 0 is added. Then during simulation, the other steps are checked. So the code would capture all the possible values.\n\nBut how to handle the sum_prev? Let's think about variables:\n\nWe can precompute the total_sum.\n\nThen, for each file i (starting from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev is the sum of the first i files. Wait, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a_1. For the third, sum_prev is a_1 + a_2, etc. So we can compute prefix sums.\n\nSo for example, for each file i (starting from 0), the prefix sum up to the previous files is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i]. So during the iteration over the files, we can track the prefix sum.\n\nSo steps to implement:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums: an array where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to have a variable that accumulates the sum_prev as we process each file.\n\nSo for example, initialize sum_prev = 0. Then for each file in a:\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current progress is (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       total_progress is ((sum_prev + x) * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current == total_progress, add to the set.\n\n   sum_prev += a_i\n\nBut that's the way. So the code would loop through each file, and for each byte in that file, calculate the current progress and the total progress. \n\nBut wait, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. Then, for each x in 1 to a_1, the total is (sum_prev + x) = x. So the total progress is (x * 100) // total_sum. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, the problem is to collect all the numbers between 0 and 100 that are present in this set. Then, output them sorted.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. However, during the simulation, when x is 1, for example, the progress bars may be 0. For example, if the first file is size 6 (as in the first sample input). Then, for x=1, current progress is 1*100//6 = 16, and total progress is 1*100//6 = 16. So in that case, during simulation, the code would add 16. But the initial 0 is already in the set.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output includes 0, 16, 33, etc. So the initial 0 is included, and during simulation, other values are added.\n\nBut what about the case when the total progress and current progress are both 0? For example, when x is 1, but the total progress is 0. For example, if the total_sum is 1000, and x is 1. Then the total progress is 0. So during simulation, that would be added. However, the initial 0 is already in the set. So the code would collect all the 0s, but since we are using a set, duplicates are handled automatically.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\nThen, for each file, for each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current_progress = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n   compute total_progress = ( (sum_prev + x) * 100 ) // total_sum\n\n   if current_progress == total_progress, add to the set.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but what about the moment when the total progress is 100%? For example, when sum_prev + x equals total_sum. Then, the total progress is 100. And the current progress is (x * 100) // a_i. But in that case, x is a_i (since sum_prev is sum of previous files, and adding x (which is a_i) gives the total_sum. So sum_prev is sum of previous files, and sum_prev + x is sum_prev + a_i = total_sum. So x is a_i. So for the last byte of the last file, the current progress is (a_i * 100) // a_i = 100. So total progress is 100. So this case is captured in the simulation. Thus, 100 is added to the set if it occurs.\n\nBut in the initial setup, we have 0 in the set. So for example, in the first sample input, the initial 0 is added. Then during simulation, when x=1, current and total progress are 16. So 16 is added. Then when x=2, 2*100/6 = 33.333... floored to 33. Total progress is 2*100/6 = 33. So added. And so on. Finally, when x=6, current progress is 100, and total progress is 100. So added.\n\nThus, the code would collect all the required values.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nFor example, when a file has size 1. Then for x=1, current progress is 100. And the total progress depends on the total_sum.\n\nAnother edge case is when the total_sum is 1. Then, the total progress for x=1 is 100. So the current progress is 100. So both are 100. So the set will have 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when a single file of size 1000. Then during the simulation, for each x, the current progress is (x * 100) // 1000. The total progress is (x * 100) // 1000. So all values are same. So the set will contain 0, 0.1, 0.2, etc., but since they are floored, the same as current progress. So the set will have all the possible percentages that are generated during the process. But since the initial 0 is added, and during simulation, the code adds all the values. So the output would be all numbers from 0 to 100, but only those that are achieved by the floor function.\n\nWait, but for example, for x=1, the current progress is 0.1% floored to 0. So during simulation, 0 is added again. But since it's a set, it's already there. So the code would collect all the unique values.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must include all numbers between 0 and 100 inclusive that exist in the set. So the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}.\n\nsum_prev = 0.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_progress = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_progress = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_progress == total_progress:\n\n            result.add(current_progress)\n\n    sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nOnce done, collect all elements in the result, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first input is:\n\nInput is 1 followed by 6. The output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nLet's see. For a single file of size 6. The total_sum is 6.\n\nFor each x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_progress = (x * 100) // 6\n\ntotal_progress = (x * 100) // 6. So they are same. So all values generated during the simulation will be added. Also, the initial 0 is added. So for x=1, current progress is 16, added. x=2: 33, added. x=3: 50, added. x=4: 66 (4*100/6=66.666... floored to 66). x=5: 83 (5*100/6=83.333...), x=6: 100. So the set contains 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample output. So the code would generate that.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput is 2, 100 500. Output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nLet me think. The total_sum is 600. So for the first file, size 100. For each x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_progress is (x * 100)/100 = x. So current_progress is x. The total progress is (sum_prev + x)*100 / 600. sum_prev is 0 for first file. So total progress is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So for example, x=1: current is 1, total is 0. So not equal. x=6: current is 6, total is 1. Not equal. So during the first file, when is current equal to total?\n\nWe need x = (x * 100)/600 → x = x/6 → 6x = x → 5x=0 → x=0. Which is not in the simulation. So during the first file, no matches except maybe when x is 0 (initial state). So during the first file, the code would not add any values except possibly 0 (but 0 is already in the set). \n\nThen, when the first file is done (sum_prev becomes 100). Now, for the second file of size 500. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_progress is (x * 100)/500 = x/5. \n\ntotal progress is (100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 + x) / 6.\n\nWe need x/5 = (100 +x)/6 → 6x = 5(100 +x) → 6x = 500 +5x → x=500. So when x=500, current_progress is 500/5=100, total progress is (100+500)/6 * 100 → 600/6=100. So that's added. So during the simulation, when x=500, it's added. Also, for other values?\n\nBut what about during the second file. Let's take x=599. For example:\n\ncurrent_progress = 599/5 = 119.8 → 119.\n\ntotal progress is (100 + 599) * 100 / 600 = 699 * 100 / 600 = 116.5 → 116. So not equal.\n\nBut during the second file, perhaps there are some x where x/5 equals (100 + x)/6. Let's solve for x:\n\nx/5 = (100 + x)/6 → 6x = 500 +5x → x=500. So only x=500. So during simulation, that's added. But also, what about the initial 0? And when the total progress reaches 100%?\n\nBut the initial 0 is added. Also, during the second file, when x=500, the code adds 100. So the set contains 0 and 100. However, the sample output shows more numbers. Wait, the sample output for the second input is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. So why are those numbers present?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that during the first file, no matches occur. But maybe during the first file, when the total progress is 95, 96, etc. Let me re-examine the second example.\n\nSample input is 2\\n100 500. So total_sum is 600.\n\nLet me think about the first file (size 100). For each x in 1..100:\n\ncurrent_progress = x * 100 / 100 = x.\n\ntotal_progress = (x * 100) / 600 = x / 6.\n\nWe need x = x/6 → x=0. Which is not in the simulation. So during the first file, no matches except maybe when x is 0 (already in the set). So no new values added here.\n\nNow, after the first file is copied (sum_prev is 100). Then, during the second file, for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_progress = x * 100 / 500 = x/5. Since x is integer, this is floor(x/5). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (x * 100) // 500. For example, x=1: 100/500 = 0.2 → floor is 0. x=5: 5*100/500 = 1.0 → 1. So current_progress is floor(x * 100 / 500) = floor(x/5). \n\nThe total progress is (100 + x) * 100 / 600. Let's call this value T.\n\nWe need to find x where floor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ). \n\nLet me compute for various x:\n\nLet me take x= 500. Then current is 100, total is 600 * 100 / 600 = 100. So yes.\n\nBut what about other x?\n\nFor example, let's take x= 599. But that's beyond the second file's size (500). So no.\n\nLet me think about x in the second file. Let's take x from 1 to 500.\n\nLet me think of the total progress: (100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 + x) / 6. \n\nWe can write this as T = floor( (100 + x) / 6 )\n\nBut current progress is C = floor( x / 5 )\n\nWe need C = T. So for which x?\n\nLet me find x such that floor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nLet me denote y = x.\n\nSo for y in [1, 500], find y where floor(y/5) = floor( (100 + y)/6 )\n\nLet me try solving this equation.\n\nLet me denote k = floor(y/5) = floor( (100 + y)/6 )\n\nSo for some integer k, we have:\n\nk ≤ y/5 < k+1 \n\nand \n\nk ≤ (100 + y)/6 <k+1 \n\nWhich implies:\n\n5k ≤ y <5(k+1)\n\nand \n\n6k ≤ 100 + y <6(k+1)\n\nSubstituting the first into the second:\n\n6k ≤ 100 + y <6k +6 \n\nBut y >=5k, so substituting:\n\n6k ≤ 100 + y → y ≥ 6k - 100 \n\nBut since y ≥5k, combining with this:\n\ny ≥ max(5k, 6k -100 )\n\nAlso, from the upper bound:\n\ny <6k +6 -100 → y <6k -94 ?\n\nWait, let me re-express the second inequality:\n\nFrom 100 + y <6(k+1) → y <6(k+1) -100 → y <6k +6 -100 = 6k -94.\n\nSo combining with y <5(k+1):\n\nSo for each k, possible y must satisfy:\n\nmax(5k, 6k - 100) ≤ y < min(5(k+1), 6k -94 )\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe trying specific values for k.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about possible k values.\n\nWhat's the possible range of k?\n\nSince y ranges from 1 to 500, floor(y/5) can be from 0 (when y=1-4) up to 100 (when y=500).\n\nSimilarly, (100 + y)/6 ranges from (101)/6 ≈16.83 to (100+500)/6=600/6=100. So floor can be from 16 to 100.\n\nSo k ranges from 0 to 100. But for k to be in the overlap between the two, possible values of k are between 0 and 100.\n\nBut for example, when k is 95:\n\nLet me compute for k=95.\n\nFor y to satisfy:\n\n5k = 475 ≤ y <5(k+1)=5*96=480.\n\nAnd from the second inequality:\n\n6k -100 = 6*95 -100 = 570 -100 = 470 ≤ y <6k -94 = 6*95 -94 = 570-94=476.\n\nSo combining the lower bounds:\n\nmax(475, 470) = 475 ≤ y < min(480, 476) → 475 ≤ y <476. So y can be 475.\n\nSo y=475.\n\nCheck if floor(475/5) = 95. Yes, 475/5=95. \n\nCheck floor( (100 +475)/6 ) = floor(575/6) = floor(95.833...) = 95. So yes. So for y=475, k=95.\n\nSo this is a valid case. So when x=475, current progress is 95, and total progress is 95. So 95 is added to the set.\n\nSimilarly, for k=96:\n\nFind y such that:\n\n5k=480 ≤ y <5*97=485.\n\nFrom second inequality:\n\n6k -100 = 6*96 -100 = 576 -100 = 476 ≤ y <6k -94 = 6*96 -94 = 576 -94 = 482.\n\nSo combining:\n\nmax(480, 476) = 480 ≤ y < min(485, 482) → 480 ≤ y <482. So y can be 480, 481.\n\nCheck for y=480:\n\ncurrent progress is 480/5=96.\n\ntotal progress: (100 +480)/6 = 580/6 = 96.666..., floor 96. So yes, equal. So added.\n\nFor y=481:\n\ncurrent is 481/5=96.2 → 96.\n\ntotal is (100+481)/6= 581/6= 96.833... → 96. Equal. So added. So for k=96, two values of y.\n\nSimilarly for k=97:\n\nCompute:\n\n5k=485 ≤ y < 5*98=490.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n6k -100 = 6*97 -100 = 582 -100 = 482 ≤ y < 6k -94 = 6*97 -94 = 582 -94= 488.\n\nSo combining:\n\nmax(485, 482) = 485 ≤ y < min(490, 488) → 485 ≤ y <488 → y=485,486,487.\n\nCheck for y=485:\n\ncurrent is 485/5=97.\n\ntotal: (100+485)/6 = 585/6 = 97.5 → floor 97. Equal. So added.\n\nSimilarly for y=486: 486/5=97.2 →97. (100+486=586/6= 97.666... →97. So yes. Same for y=487: 587/6= 97.833... →97. So yes. So three values added for k=97.\n\nSimilarly for k=98:\n\n5k=490 ≤ y < 495.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n6k -100 = 6*98 -100 = 588-100=488 ≤ y < 6k-94= 588-94=494.\n\nSo combining: max(490, 488) = 490 ≤ y < min(495, 494) → 490 ≤ y <494 → y=490,491,492,493.\n\nCheck for each:\n\ny=490: current is 490/5=98. total is (100+490)/6 = 590/6 = 98.333... →98. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for k=98, four values of y.\n\nk=99:\n\n5k=495 ≤ y <500.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n6k-100 = 6*99 -100 = 594-100=494 ≤ y < 6k -94 = 594-94=500.\n\nSo combining:\n\nmax(495,494) =495 ≤ y < min(500,500) → 495 ≤ y <500. So y ranges from 495 to 499 inclusive.\n\nFor each of these y:\n\ncurrent progress is floor(y/5) = 99 (since 495/5=99, 499/5=99.8 →99).\n\nTotal progress: (100 + y)/6. For y=495, 595/6=99.166... →99. So yes. Similarly for y=496: 596/6= 99.333 →99. y=497: 597/6=99.5 →99. y=498: 598/6= 99.666 →99. y=499: 599/6=99.833... →99. So all these y's are valid. So for k=99, five values.\n\nk=100:\n\n5k=500 ≤ y <5*101=505. But since y can't exceed 500, the only possible y is 500.\n\nCheck the second inequality:\n\n6k -100 = 6*100 -100 = 500 ≤ y < 6k-94 = 600 -94=506. So y must be between 500 and 506. Since y is 500, it's included.\n\nSo for y=500:\n\ncurrent progress is 500/5=100.\n\ntotal progress is (100+500)/6 = 600/6=100 →100. So yes. So added.\n\nThus, for the second file, the values 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added. Also, the initial 0 is present. So the set contains 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample output. So the code would capture these values.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all these steps.\n\nNow, considering that for n up to 100, and each a_i up to 1000, the total number of steps is sum(a_i) up to 1e5. For each step, the code does simple calculations. So even for 1e5 steps, it's manageable in Python.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set, result = {0}.\n\nsum_prev = 0.\n\nLoop over each file in a:\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_progress = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_progress = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_progress == total_progress:\n\n           add to result.\n\n   sum_prev += a_i\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of elements in result.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first example input is ['1\\n6', ...], but in reality, the input is read as per standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in practice, the code will read n from input, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, sometimes the input may have multiple lines, but for the problem, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nOnce that's done, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the above logic.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem states that a_i is at least 1, so total_sum can't be zero.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is handled correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich produces the output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo the code would generate these numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nresult = {0}\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n   current_file_size = file\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_progress = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_progress = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_progress == total_progress:\n\n           result.add(current_progress)\n\n   sum_prev += current_file_size\n\nOnce done, sort the list and print each element on a separate line.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nresult = {0}\n\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n        current_p = (x * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, the output includes 0,95,...,100. Let's see for the code.\n\nBut in the code, the initial 0 is added. Then, during the second file's processing, for x=475, etc., the code adds 95, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check for the case when the total progress is 100. For example, when the last byte is copied. For example, in the first sample input, the code adds 100.\n\nBut what if during the simulation, the code doesn't capture 100? For example, if the last byte is copied, and the current progress is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 inclusive that are simultaneously displayed on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a set containing the initial value 0, as both progress bars start at 0%.\n2. **Iterate through Files**: For each file, simulate the copying of each byte and compute both progress percentages.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied, compute the current file's progress and the total progress. If both values are equal, add this value to the set of results.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure the initial state (0%) and the final state (100%) are considered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nresult = {0}\nsum_prev = 0\n\nfor file_size in a:\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (x * 100) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_p = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n        if current_p == total_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n    sum_prev += file_size\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate both the current file's progress and the total progress using integer division to floor the result.\n4. **Tracking Matching Percentages**: Use a set to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars show the same value.\n5. **Output**: Sort the collected values and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each byte's contribution to both progress bars, ensuring that all possible matching percentages are captured and displayed in the required format.",
