Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible matchings?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The key is that for any two pairs (ship1 → base1) and (ship2 → base2), the line segments between them shouldn't cross each other. So even if two lines cross, even if they are not part of the same matching, that's a problem. Wait, no. The problem says that any two paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship) should not intersect. So in the matching, every pair of lines must not cross each other.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that. Oh wait, the input says that R and B are given. Wait, the first line has R and B. So the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. Which implies that R must equal B. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So yes, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So first thing to check: if R != B, output No. But the input constraints say that R and B are between 1 and 10. So in the code, first check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R and B are equal. Otherwise, return No.\n\nNow, assuming R = B = n. We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (a permutation of the bases to the ships) such that all the line segments between ship and base do not cross each other.\n\nThe challenge is to check for all possible permutations of the assignment and see if any of them satisfies the non-crossing condition.\n\nBut how do we check if two line segments cross each other?\n\nSo for a given permutation (each ship is assigned to a base), we need to check all pairs of line segments (ship_i to base_i) and (ship_j to base_j) for i < j, and see if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair intersects, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of assigning ships to bases (since R = B = n, there are n! possibilities).\n\n- For each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments are non-intersecting.\n\n- If any permutation passes, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut for n=10, 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking O(n^2) pairs of line segments. For n=10, that's 100 per permutation. So total operations are around 3.6e5 * 1e2 = 3.6e7 operations. That's acceptable for Python, perhaps? Well, maybe. Let's think: for each permutation, for each pair of lines, check if they cross. But how to implement that efficiently.\n\nBut first, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So that might help with some edge cases. Also, the problem says that no two points coincide. So for the line segments, they can't have overlapping endpoints.\n\nSo the first thing is to generate all permutations. Now, for each permutation, we need to check that all line segments between ship and base do not cross each other.\n\nSo the key is to implement a function that checks whether two line segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) intersect.\n\nHow to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a standard computational geometry approach for this. The steps are:\n\nFirst, check if the two line segments intersect by checking the orientation of the four points.\n\nBut I need to implement the standard line segment intersection algorithm. Let me recall.\n\nThe standard approach is to use the following steps:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n1. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. (This is the case where the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\n2. One of the endpoints of a segment lies on the other segment. However, given that no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. Because if a point lies on another segment, then that would imply that three points are colinear. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. Therefore, in our problem, the second case (where an endpoint lies on another segment) is impossible. Therefore, we can ignore that case.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that no three points are colinear. So any three points (from the input) are not colinear. However, when considering line segments between ships and bases, perhaps two line segments could share a common point. But the problem says that no two points (ships or bases) are the same. So, for example, if two line segments are from ship A to base X and ship B to base Y, then their endpoints are all distinct. So the only way for two line segments to intersect is if they cross each other in the interior, not at endpoints. So the first case applies.\n\nTherefore, the code to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\nCheck if the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different.\n\nSo the first step is to implement a function to compute the orientation of three points.\n\nOrientation of three points p, q, r:\n\n- 0 if colinear (but in our problem, this can't happen because the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So maybe we can ignore that case?)\n\nWait, but the line segments between ships and bases could have endpoints that are not in the original input. So for example, two line segments could cross each other. However, the problem says that the input points (ships and bases) are such that no three are colinear. But when you take two line segments between different pairs, their intersection could be at a point that's not part of the original input. However, the code for checking whether two line segments cross must account for that.\n\nBut the standard line segment intersection code will handle that. So for our problem, the code for checking whether two line segments cross is as follows:\n\nImplement the orientation function. Then, for two line segments AB and CD, check if they intersect.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute orientation(p, q, r). The orientation is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clockwise or counterclockwise\n\nThen, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of first segment, c and d of second\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: the segments intersect properly\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    # Special cases (but according to problem statement, these can't happen?)\n    # But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, maybe the special cases can't happen?\n    # So, for example, if o1 is 0, then c is colinear with AB. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, but in this case, the points are a, b, c. So if c is colinear with AB, then that's a violation of the input constraints. Hence, in our problem, o1, o2, o3, o4 can't be zero. So we can ignore the cases where any of them is zero.\n\n    # Wait, the input says that no three points are colinear. However, the line segments are between a ship and a base. So if two line segments are between (ship1, base1) and (ship2, base2), then the points involved are four distinct points. So for example, if the line segment ship1-base1 and ship2-base2 cross, then the four points are not colinear. So the orientation checks would not be zero. But what if two line segments share a common point? Like, ship1 is connected to base1, and ship2 is connected to base1. But that's impossible since each ship is connected to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one ship. So in the permutation, each base is assigned once. So the line segments are between distinct pairs. So for any two line segments in the permutation, their endpoints are all distinct. Hence, for any two line segments, the four points are distinct. Therefore, in the orientation checks, the o1, o2, o3, o4 can't be zero. So the code can safely assume that the orientations are 1 or 2.\n\n    # Therefore, the only case where segments intersect is when o1 != o2 and o3 != o4.\n\n    # However, there's another possibility: if one of the segments is entirely inside the other. But since the input points are such that no three are colinear, this can't happen. Because, for example, if AB is a segment and CD is a segment where C is on AB. But that would require three points being colinear. Which is not allowed. So the code can proceed with checking the general case.\n\n    # Therefore, return True only if the general case holds.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but this is not sufficient. For example, if one segment is entirely contained within the other. But according to the input constraints, that's not possible. Because suppose that AB is a segment, and CD is such that C is on AB. Then, the points A, B, C would be colinear. Which is not allowed. So the code can safely assume that the only way two segments can cross is the general case.\n\nTherefore, the function segments_intersect can be implemented as follows.\n\nOnce that is done, for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments in that permutation. For example, for a permutation where ship i is matched to base p[i], then for each pair (i,j), check if the line between ship i and base p[i] crosses with the line between ship j and base p[j].\n\nIf any pair crosses, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, read R ships' coordinates, then B bases' coordinates.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of ships to bases). For each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments don't cross.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. For example, for R=3, the bases are 3 in number. So for each permutation of the bases, we assign ship 0 to base perm[0], ship 1 to base perm[1], etc.\n\nBut wait, the ships are given in order. So for example, the first ship is index 0, and the permutation is for the bases. So for each permutation, the assignment is ship i is connected to base perm[i].\n\nBut the bases are given as a list. Let me think:\n\nSuppose ships are stored in a list called ships, and bases in a list called bases. Then, for a permutation p (which is a list of indices of bases), the assignment is ship i is connected to bases[p[i]].\n\nBut for generating permutations, the code can generate all possible permutations of the list [0, 1, ..., B-1], which are the indices of the bases. Then, for each permutation, check if the assignment of ship i to base p[i] is valid.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n\nBut since B is R, which is up to 10, this is manageable.\n\nNow, for each perm, check all pairs of line segments. For each i < j, check if the line between ships[i] and bases[perm[i]] intersects with the line between ships[j] and bases[perm[j]].\n\nIf any such pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code for checking that:\n\ndef is_valid(ships, bases, perm):\n    n = len(perm)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            a = ships[i]\n            b = bases[perm[i]]\n            c = ships[j]\n            d = bases[perm[j]]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                return False\n    return True\n\nIf this returns True for any permutation, then the answer is Yes.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement the segments_intersect function correctly.\n\nLet me test the segments_intersect function with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nTwo line segments that cross: (0,0)-(2,2) and (0,2)-(2,0). They cross. The orientations would be:\n\nFor AB = (0,0)-(2,2), and CD = (0,2)-(2,0).\n\nCheck orientation of AB with C and D.\n\nOrientation of AB, C (0,2):\n\nval = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4. So positive. So orientation is 1.\n\nOrientation of AB with D (2,0):\n\nval = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 2*0 - 2*2 = -4. Negative. So orientation is 2. So o1 != o2. Then check o3 and o4.\n\nFor CD, check orientation of CD with A (0,0) and B (2,2).\n\nOrientation of CD (points (0,2) to (2,0)), point A (0,0):\n\nval = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) ?\n\nWait, the orientation function is:\n\norientation(p, q, r) computes (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x).\n\nSo for CD being (c, d) = (0,2) and (2,0). For p = c (0,2), q = d (2,0), r = A (0,0).\n\nSo (q.x - p.x) = 2-0 = 2. (r.y - p.y) = 0-2 = -2. (q.y - p.y) is 0-2 = -2. (r.x - p.x) is 0-0=0.\n\nSo val = 2*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4 - 0 = -4. Which is negative. So orientation is 2.\n\nFor point B (2,2), orientation of CD (c, d) with B:\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 2-0=2. (r.y - p.y) = 2-2=0. (q.y - p.y) = 0-2=-2. (r.x - p.x) = 2-0=2.\n\nval = 2*0 - (-2)*2 = 0 +4 =4>0. So orientation is 1. So o3 is 2, o4 is 1. So o3 != o4. Therefore, the segments intersect. So the function returns True. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: two segments that don't cross. For example, (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel. The orientations would be:\n\nFor AB (0,0)-(1,0), C (0,1):\n\norientation is (1-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(0-0) = 1*1 - 0*... = 1. So 1.\n\nD (1,1): orientation is (1-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 1*1 - 0 = 1. So o1 and o2 are same. So the function returns false. Which is correct.\n\nSo the function seems to work.\n\nNow, code-wise, I need to implement this function.\n\nBut in Python, the code for orientation and segments_intersect.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input for the ships and bases are given. So, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is [0,1,2], meaning ship 0 is connected to base 0, ship 1 to base 1, ship 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck if any of the line segments cross.\n\nShip 0 (0,0) to base 0 (-2,1): line from (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nShip 1 (2,0) to base 1 (0,3): line from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nShip 2 (3,1) to base 2 (2,2): line from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck all pairs.\n\nBetween first and second lines: do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nAB is (0,0) to (2,0). Wait, no. Wait, the first line is from (0,0) to (-2,1). The second line is from (2,0) to (0,3). Let me compute the orientations.\n\nFor AB = (0,0) to (-2,1). Let's call this segment AB. The other segment is CD: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCheck if AB and CD intersect.\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A,B,C), where C is (2,0).\n\nWait, A is (0,0), B is (-2,1), C is (2,0).\n\nval = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 0-0=0.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1-0=1.\n\nC.x - A.x = 2-0=2.\n\nval = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = 0 - 2 = -2 <0. So orientation is 2.\n\no2 is orientation(A,B,D) where D is (0,3).\n\nSame calculation:\n\nval = (-2)*(3 - 0) - (1)*(0 - 0) = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. So orientation is 2. So o1 and o2 are same. So the segments don't cross. So the function returns false for this pair.\n\nThen check between AB and CD (third segment). Let's say AB is (0,0) to (-2,1), CD is (3,1) to (2,2). Let's check.\n\nA is (0,0), B is (-2,1). C is (3,1), D is (2,2).\n\no1 = orientation(A,B,C) = ?\n\nB.x - A.x = -2-0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 1-0 = 1.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1-0 = 1.\n\nC.x - A.x = 3-0 = 3.\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → D is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)*(2 - 0) - 1*(2 - 0) → (-2)*2 -1*2 = -4 -2 = -6 <0 → orientation 2. So same as o1. So no intersection.\n\nThen check between second and third segments. Second is (2,0) to (0,3), third is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nFor AB being (2,0)-(0,3), and CD being (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nCheck o1 = orientation(A,B,C) where A is (2,0), B is (0,3), C is (3,1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) → (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) where D is (2,2). \n\nval = (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) → (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4 -0 = -4 <0 → orientation 2. Same as o1. So no intersection.\n\nThus, all pairs are non-crossing. So this permutation is valid.\n\nHence, the code would return 'Yes'.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all permutations and check.\n\nNow, considering that for n=10, the code may take some time, but for n up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python would be:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R lines of ships' coordinates.\n\nRead B lines of bases' coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (indices 0 to B-1).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Check if all pairs of line segments in the permutation do not cross.\n\n   If any permutation passes, output 'Yes' and exit.\n\nIf none found, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. But in practice, the code should read from stdin. So the code will read from stdin, split into lines, and process accordingly.\n\nBut for the problem, the code should read from standard input, not from a list. So the code would be:\n\nRead R and B from the first line.\n\nThen read R lines for the ships.\n\nThen read B lines for the bases.\n\nBut the code needs to process the input correctly.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement the orientation function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be written as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    # Check if the segments intersect properly\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the function returns True if the general case holds. Else, returns False.\n\nNow, for each permutation, check all pairs.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, for all i < j, check if segments_intersect between (ships[i], bases[perm[i]]) and (ships[j], bases[perm[j]]).\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    # Generate all permutations of the bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations( range(B) ):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                a = ships[i]\n                b = bases[ perm[i] ]\n                c = ships[j]\n                d = bases[ perm[j] ]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, for the permutation, the perm is a permutation of the B bases (since B=R). So for each perm in permutations(range(B)), which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\nShips:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the code would generate permutations of [0,1,2]. One of them is [0,1,2], which is valid. So the code would output 'Yes'.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 1\n\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the first line is 2 1. So R=2, B=1. Since R != B, the code outputs 'No'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=2, and the two ships and two bases are arranged such that the lines cross. For example, ships at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (0,2) and (2,0). Then, the permutation [0,1] would have lines (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, which don't cross. But if the permutation is [1,0], then the lines are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These lines cross. So the code would check all permutations. The first permutation [0,1] is valid. So output is 'Yes'.\n\nBut if the ships are (0,0), (2,2), and bases (2,0), (0,2). Then, for permutation [0,1], the lines are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These cross. For permutation [1,0], the lines are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These don't cross. So the code would find that permutation and output 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat about when there are multiple permutations, but some are invalid and some are valid?\n\nThe code will check all permutations and return as soon as one is found.\n\nNow, what about the case when R=B=1? Then, there's only one permutation, and no pairs of lines. So it's valid. Output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2. Ships are (0,0), (1,0). Bases are (0,1), (1,1). Then, any permutation is valid. Because the lines are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,0)-(1,1) (parallel, no crossing), or (0,0)-(1,1) and (1,0)-(0,1), which cross. Wait, for permutation [1,0], the lines are from ship 0 to base 1 (0,0) to (1,1), and ship 1 to base 0 (1,0) to (0,1). These lines cross. So in this case, the code would check all permutations. The permutation [0,1] is valid (no crossing), so the code outputs 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code would return 'Yes' in this case.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2, ships at (0,0), (2,0), bases at (1,1), (1,-1). Then, for permutation [0,1], the lines are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (1,-1). Do these cross?\n\nLet me compute. The first line is from (0,0) to (1,1). The second line is from (2,0) to (1,-1). These two lines meet at (1,1) and (1,-1) — but the lines are not crossing. Wait, the lines are:\n\nLine 1: (0,0)-(1,1) is a straight line. Line 2: (2,0)-(1,-1) is a straight line. These two lines cross at (1, 1) ? No. Let me compute the equations.\n\nLine 1: y = x.\n\nLine 2: from (2,0) to (1,-1). The slope is (-1 -0)/(1-2) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So equation is y - 0 = 1*(x - 2) → y = x -2. So solving y = x and y = x-2 → no solution. So the lines are parallel? No, same slope, but different intercepts. So they don't cross. Therefore, the permutation [0,1] is valid. So code returns 'Yes'.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code may have some performance issues for n=10, but given that 10! is about 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs, each with 4 orientation checks. It's manageable.\n\nAnother possible optimization: early termination. For each permutation, once any pair of segments is found to intersect, we can break and proceed to the next permutation. Which is already handled in the code.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nShips:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample output is 'Yes'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R != B, output 'No'.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample input from the note:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nOutput: Yes.\n\nAnother example where the answer is No:\n\nSuppose two ships and two bases arranged such that any permutation causes crossing.\n\nBut that's not possible. For example, ships (0,0), (2,2), bases (0,2), (2,0). Then, the permutation [0,1] gives lines from (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0) (vertical lines, no crossing). So answer is Yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting line segments intersect. This problem can be approached by checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying if any permutation meets the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Check**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, immediately output \"No\".\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of bases, consider it as a potential assignment of bases to spaceships.\n3. **Check Intersections**: For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments formed by connecting spaceships to their assigned bases. Use computational geometry to determine if any two line segments intersect.\n4. **Orientation Calculation**: Use the orientation of three points to determine if two line segments intersect. This involves calculating the cross product to determine the relative orientation of points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a = ships[i]\n                b = bases[perm[i]]\n                c = ships[j]\n                d = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Calculation**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product. This helps determine if points are collinear, clockwise, or counterclockwise.\n2. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientations of four points to determine if two line segments intersect.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The main function reads input values, checks for immediate invalid cases (when R ≠ B), and generates all permutations of base indices. For each permutation, it checks all pairs of line segments for intersections. If any permutation is found where no intersections occur, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently within the constraints, leveraging computational geometry principles to validate the non-intersecting condition.",
