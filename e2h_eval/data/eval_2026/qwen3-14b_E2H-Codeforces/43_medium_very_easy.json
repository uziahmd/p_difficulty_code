He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a' here.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. And there's at least one 'b' here as well.\n3. C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, it's possible that the count equals both. But importantly, the 'c's are added at the end.\n\nSo the final string must have all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters in the string must be a bunch of a's, then b's, then c's. Any deviation from this order would make the answer NO.\n\nAdditionally, the counts must satisfy:\n\nLet me think. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nAccording to the process:\n\n- The initial string (before B adds 'b's) has count_a_initial = count_a. Then B adds count_b_initial = count_b. But since B added some number of 'b's, which is at least 1. So count_b is >=1.\n\nThen C adds count_c = either count_a (which is count_a_initial) or count_b (which is count_b_initial). Or both.\n\nWait, but after B adds the 'b's, the count of a's is count_a_initial (same as original), and count_b is count_b_initial. Then C appends count_c 'c's, where count_c equals count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nSo for the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut count_a_initial is the original count of a's, which is the same as the count of a's in the final string. Similarly for count_b_initial. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original).\n\nBut in the final string, the count of a's is count_a, and the count of b's is count_b. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but the original count of a's is the same as the count in the final string. Because B and C only added b's and c's. So yes. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the string must be in the order a's followed by b's followed by c's. So for example, if the string is 'aabcc', then the order is correct. But if it's 'ababc', then no.\n\nSo the steps to check are:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.\n\n2. Check that the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's.\n\nAlso, the initial conditions: the original string must have at least one a and one b. Because when B added the b's, he made sure that there is at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Because the original string (before adding b's) had at least one a. Then B added at least one b. So in the final string, count_a is same as original (>=1), count_b is >=1. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo the steps for the solution:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the form a* b* c*. So, for example, the string should not have any 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b', and no 'b's after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n\nHow can I check that?\n\nWe can check the order of characters. For example, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, for the entire string, the characters must be in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the string must be such that the characters are in order. So for example, if there's a 'b' followed by an 'a', that's invalid. Or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo how to check that? Let's iterate through the string and check that each character is not less than the previous one. Because if any character is less than the previous, that's invalid. For example, if the string is 'abba', then after the first 'b', there's an 'a' which is less than 'b', so invalid.\n\nSo that's one check.\n\nOnce that is done, we can count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1? Wait, no. Because the original string (before C added the c's) had a's and b's. Then C added c's. So the count_c could be zero? No, because according to the problem statement, the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So C added some number of c's, which is at least 1? Wait, no. Because suppose the original count of a's is 1, and the original count of b's is 1. Then C could add 1 c. But what if the original count of a's is 0? No, because in the problem statement, the original string (from A) has some number of a's (so count_a_initial >=1). Then B adds some number of b's (count_b_initial >=1). So when C adds the c's, the count of a's is count_a_initial (>=1), count of b's is count_b_initial (>=1). So the number of c's added is equal to either count_a_initial (>=1) or count_b_initial (>=1). Therefore, count_c is >=1.\n\nSo in the final string, count_c must be >=1. So the counts of a, b, c must all be >=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string given to us may have any of the letters. However, according to the process, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Because:\n\nOriginal string (from A) has at least one a. Then B adds at least one b. Then C adds at least one c. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So, for example, if the input string is 'aabb', then it's invalid because there are no c's. So in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least 1, count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input string is given, and we have to check if it could have been formed by the process. So the input string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Because otherwise, it's impossible. For example, if the input string is 'aabb', then even though the order is correct, there are no c's, which means that C didn't add any. But according to the problem, C added some number of c's. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCheck:\n\n1. The string is in the form a* b* c*, i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n2. The counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\n3. The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the count of c's being equal to count_a or count_b?\n\nBut in the process, when C added the c's, the number of c's added was equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the string at that moment. Which is the same as the count of a's and b's in the final string. Because the count of a's and b's didn't change after B added the b's. So for example, after B added the b's, the count of a's is count_a_initial (original), and count of b's is count_b_initial. Then C added count_c = count_a_initial or count_b_initial. So in the final string, count_c is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But count_a_initial is equal to the count of a's in the final string (since no a's were added or removed after that). Similarly for count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b in the final string.\n\nSo condition 3 is count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the input string S:\n\nCheck:\n\n- All a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. So the string is in the order a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n- The counts of a, b, c are all at least 1.\n\n- count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all of these are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo now, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, checking the order. How can we check that the string is in the form a* b* c*?\n\nWe can check that the string is non-decreasing in terms of the characters. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So, for example, if the string is 'aabbc', then each character is >= the previous. But if it's 'abba', then after the first 'b', there's an 'a', which is less than 'b', so invalid.\n\nSo for the entire string, each character must be >= the previous one. So we can loop through the string and check that for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, s[i] >= s[i-1].\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because for example, if the string is 'aabcc', then it's okay. But if the string is 'aabbcc', that's okay. But what about 'aaabbbcc'? Also okay.\n\nBut if the string is 'abac', then the third character is 'a' which is less than 'b' (the previous character), which is invalid.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is non-decreasing. That would ensure that all a's are first, then b's, then c's. Because once a 'b' appears, there can't be any 'a's after. Similarly, once a 'c' appears, there can't be any 'a's or 'b's after.\n\nSo that's the first check.\n\nOnce that is done, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nThen check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nThen check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc'\n\nCheck the order: a a a b c c c. Each character is >= previous. Yes.\n\ncounts: a=3, b=1, c=3. count_c is 3. Is 3 equal to count_a (3) or count_b (1)? Yes, equal to count_a. So output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than 'b' (previous character). So the order check fails. So output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → the string is a a b c. Order is correct. counts: a=2, b=1, c=1. count_c is 1. Which is equal to count_b (1). So output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → the order check would fail because after the first two a's, there are two b's, then a's again. So the third character is 'b', then fourth is 'a' which is less than 'b' → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → order is a, b, c, c. Correct. counts: a=1, b=1, c=2. count_c is 2. Is it equal to a (1) or b (1)? No. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → counts a=1, b=3, c=1. count_c is 1. Which is equal to a's count (1). So output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. c is equal to a (1) or b (1). So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. c is equal to a and b. So YES.\n\nNow, what about a string like 'aabbcc' → yes. But what if the counts are a=2, b=3, c=2. Then c equals a. So yes.\n\nSo the code needs to do:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nIn Python, for each i in range(1, len(s)):\n\nif s[i] < s[i-1], then invalid.\n\nIf any such occurrence, return NO.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that all counts are >=1.\n\nThen check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES else NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nThen counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, check for the order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nThen, count the a, b, c.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nCheck if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc'? Then the order is correct. count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So it's valid. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → order is invalid, so no.\n\nBut what about the string 'aabcc'? The order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=2. So count_c is 2, which is equal to count_a. So yes.\n\nBut what about 'abba'? The order check will fail because the third character is 'b' which is after 'a' but then the next is 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the code would return no.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'a'? Then the code checks the order (no problem), but count_b is 0, count_c is 0. So the check for counts >=1 fails. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → counts are 1,1,2. So count_c is 2. Not equal to 1 or 1. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=2. count_c is 2. Which equals count_b. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's see the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. c equals a → yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order check fails (the third character is 'a' which is less than 'b') → output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b → yes.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → YES.\n\nCase 2: 'ab' → counts c=0 → no.\n\nCase 3: 'ac' → order is correct (a followed by c). But count_b is 0 → no.\n\nCase 4: 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. c equals a → yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2 → yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4 → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbcc' → counts a=4, b=3, c=2. c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbccc' → counts a=4, b=3, c=3. So c equals b → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbcc' → counts a=4, b=3, c=2. So no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → counts a=1, b=3, c=1. c equals a → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nNow, what about the string 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck for the order.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check order\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? The order check would catch the 'b' followed by 'a' and return NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → order is correct, counts are 2,2,2. So yes.\n\nBut what about 'abba'? The order check would find that the third character is 'b' (i=2, s[2] is 'b', s[1] is 'b', so okay. Then i=3, s[3] is 'a', which is less than s[2] 'b' → returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So yes.\n\nSample 2: 'bbacc' → the order check will fail at index 2 (s[2] is 'a' which is less than s[1] 'b'). So output NO.\n\nSample 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1 → yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2, which is not equal to a (1) or b (1). So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1, which equals a (1). So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → order check fails.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about a string with only a's and c's, but no b's? Like 'aacc'? The code would check that count_b is 0, so output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'ab' → count_c is 0 → output NO.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order and under certain constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and then a block of 'c's. This ensures that the characters are in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Count Check**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This is because each step in the process ensures that at least one of each character is present.\n3. **Character Count Validation**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure that each character is not less than the previous one.
