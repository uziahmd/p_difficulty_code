His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the first and second tour points, but they are not linked to names. So, the idea is that Vasya's actual total is some a_i + b_j where a_i is from the first array and b_j from the second. But since the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, we have to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that their sum is >=x. Then, for each possible such pair, determine what rank Vasya could get, and find the best (minimum possible) and worst (maximum possible) ranks.\n\nBut how do I compute that efficiently?\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank: we want to maximize Vasya's total points. Because higher total means better rank. So the best case is when Vasya's total is as high as possible. So, find the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, count how many participants have a total higher than this value. The best rank is that count + 1. But wait, since the jury can arrange the same totals in any order, if there are others with the same total, Vasya could be placed first.\n\nWait, no. For the best possible rank, we want to assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and that other people have as low as possible totals. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible. Because then, the number of people who have a higher total is minimized. For example, if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he can be placed first. But if there are multiple people with the same maximum total, the jury can assign him first place.\n\nSo the approach for best rank:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s = a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, count how many pairs (a_k + b_l) are strictly greater than s. The best rank is that count + 1. Because even if there are others with the same sum, the jury can assign him the first position.\n\nWait, but how do I find the maximum possible s? Well, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because that's the highest possible sum. So for example, if there's a pair that adds up to that maximum, then that's the best scenario for Vasya.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a pair that gives a sum higher than x, but not the maximum. However, the best rank is achieved when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. So the first step is to find the maximum possible sum that is >=x. Because that gives the best chance for the best rank.\n\nSo, for best rank:\n\nCompute max_sum = max(a_i + b_j for all i,j) but only considering those pairs where a_i + b_j >=x. Wait, but the problem says that there exists at least one such pair. So, the max_sum would be the maximum possible sum of any pair (a_i + b_j), but since there's at least one pair that meets the x condition, it's possible that the maximum sum is larger than x. But even if the maximum is less than x, but the problem says that there exists a pair that is >=x. Wait, no. The problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists i,j with a_i + b_j >=x. So, the maximum sum will be at least x. So, the best possible scenario for Vasya is when he has that maximum sum. Then, the number of people with sum strictly greater than that is zero. So his best rank is 1. But if there are other people with the same sum, then the jury can put him first. So the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if there are other people with the same sum? For example, if there are multiple pairs that add up to the same maximum sum. Then, the jury can assign Vasya the first place. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the best rank is 1, but only if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) that gives the maximum sum. Which there is. Because the maximum sum is the maximum possible. So for best rank, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let's think again. Suppose the maximum sum is S. How many people have a sum >= S? Well, since S is the maximum, all people with sum equal to S are in that group. But for the best rank, the teacher can arrange that Vasya is placed first. So regardless of how many people have the same sum, the best",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The scores are given in two separate lists, and we need to consider all possible pairs of scores from these lists to determine Vasya's potential ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we consider the highest possible sum of scores from the two tours. This is because a higher score will minimize the number of participants with a higher score, potentially placing Vasya at the top.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we consider the lowest possible sum that still meets or exceeds the minimum score requirement (x). This involves counting how many participants can have a higher score than Vasya's minimum possible score, thus determining the worst possible rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    # Sort a and b\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Best case: max possible sum\n    max_a = a[-1]\n    max_b = b[-1]\n    max_sum = max_a + max_b\n    \n    # Count how many pairs have sum > max_sum\n    # Since max_sum is the maximum possible, there are none\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Worst case: min possible sum >= x\n    # Find the minimal sum s such that s >= x\n    # To get the worst rank, we need the minimal s >= x, then count how many pairs have sum > s\n    # But how to find the minimal s?\n    # Actually, for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal possible s (>=x) such that as many people as possible have higher sums.\n    # Wait, no. To get the worst possible rank, we need to assume that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and as many others as possible have higher totals.\n    # So, find the minimal s >=x, and count the number of pairs with sum > s.\n    # But how to find s? It's the minimal possible value >=x, which would be x itself if possible.\n    # However, we need to find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j.\n    # But since we need the worst case, we should take the minimal s >=x, because that would allow more people to have higher sums.\n    \n    # However, the minimal s >=x may not be achievable. For example, if x is 5, and the possible sums are 6,7, etc. Then the minimal s is 6.\n    # So, we need to find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s.\n    \n    # But since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, we can proceed.\n    \n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can iterate through all possible a_i and find the minimal b_j that makes a_i + b_j >=x.\n    # However, for efficiency, we can use two pointers approach.\n    \n    # First, find the minimal s >=x.\n    # Let's find the minimal possible s that is >=x.\n    # We can do this by sorting a and b, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n    \n    # But for the purpose of finding the worst case, we need to find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved, and then count how many pairs have sum > s.\n    # However, this approach might be too slow for n=1e5.\n    \n    # Alternatively, to find the minimal s >=x, we can use binary search.\n    # But perhaps the following approach is better:\n    \n    # For the worst case, we want to find the minimal possible s that is >=x, and then count how many pairs have sum > s.
