And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average of their sleep times. Then, I have to find the average of all those weekly averages.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weeks' totals. Wait, the example says that in the third case, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Oh right, because each week's average is (sum of k days)/k, and then the overall average is the sum of all those averages divided by the number of weeks. But since each week's average is sum/k, the total average would be (sum of all weeks' sums) / (number of weeks * k). Wait, but the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weekly averages. So, for each week, compute the average (sum of k days divided by k), then take the average of all those values.\n\nAlternatively, since the average of averages is equal to the total sum divided by (number of weeks * k). Because each week's average is sum_week / k. The average of all these is (sum_week1 + sum_week2 + ... ) / (number_of_weeks * k). So, the total sum of all the weekly sums divided by (number_of_weeks * k).\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the weekly sums?\n\nLet me think. For example, if n=3, k=2, the weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11, so total sum is 18. The average is 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But according to the first example, the output is 9.000... Wait wait, no. Wait the first example input is 3 2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... Wait, that's because the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weekly averages. Let me check:\n\nIn that example, there are two weeks. The first week's average is (3+4)/2 = 3.5. The second week's average is (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of those two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, wait the sample input given in the problem says that for the first example, the output is 9.0000000000. Wait that can't be right. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement. Oh! Oh no, the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there are n -k +1 weeks. For example, when k=2, n=3, the example says the result is 9.0. Wait, but according to my calculation, the average of the two averages is 4.5. So why is the sample output 9.0?\n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the result is\" for the example given. Let me check the example again. Oh wait, the first example input is 3 2 and a = [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... Wait, how?\n\nAh, maybe the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Because in that example, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by the number of weeks (2), gives 9. Which matches the sample output. Oh! So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. Wait, but the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is what? Well, the sample output for that case is 9.000... So the example must be that the average is 9. So the problem says that the answer is the average of the sum of each week. Because in that example, the sum of the two weeks is 7+11=18, divided by 2 weeks gives 9. So the output is 9. So why is that the case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently calculating the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each `k`-day window. This technique allows us to compute the sum of each subsequent window in constant time after the initial sum calculation.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: First, calculate the sum of the first `k` days. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element that is sliding out of the window and add the new element that is sliding into the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: Once we have the sum of all window sums, we divide this total by the number of windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].strip().split()))\n        total_sum = 0\n        # Calculate the sum of the first window\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        # Slide the window\n        for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n            current_sum += a[i + k - 1] - a[i - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        # Compute the average\n        average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n        # Print with 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This ensures each sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the average, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
