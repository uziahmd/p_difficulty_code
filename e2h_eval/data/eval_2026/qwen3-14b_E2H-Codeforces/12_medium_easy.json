The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks.\n\nFor example, suppose she is currently at position current, and the next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n if we take the shortest path. Wait, no. Wait, because moving clockwise, if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3→4→1→2, which is n - (current - next) steps? Or wait, the number of steps between current and next in clockwise direction is (next - current) if next > current, else (n - current + next). Wait, no. For example, if current is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup. The clockwise steps from 3 to 2 would be 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (n - (current - next))? Let me compute:\n\ncurrent = 3, next = 2. The difference is 2-3 = -1. So, the clockwise steps would be (next - current + n) % n. Let's see: (2-3 +4) = 3, which is correct. So the formula for the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current) mod n, but since mod can be negative, maybe adding n and then taking mod again?\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers in a way that might not be what we want. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So, the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, if current is 3 and next is 2, then (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance is (next - current) % n. But wait, that's not exactly right. Because if next is equal to current, then the distance is zero. So, for consecutive tasks, we need to compute the distance between the current position and the next task's position, and add that to the total time.\n\nBut the problem says that the tasks must be done in order. So, for each task from 1 to m, we have to process them in order. So, Xenia starts at position 1. Then, for each task a_i, she needs to move from her current position to a_i, but considering that she can't go backward (since movement is only clockwise). So, the time between the previous position (say prev) and the current a_i is the clockwise distance between prev and a_i.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given in a list. So, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. But Xenia must complete all tasks in order. So, for each task i, she must be at a_i. But she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then she just stays there, so the time between them is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there). Then, for each task in the list a_1 to a_m, compute the distance from current to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current to a_i.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for the first task, she starts at 1. So the first step is to move from 1 to a_1. Then, for the second task, move from a_1 to a_2, etc. So yes, the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, where the initial position is 1, and each subsequent position is a_i.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nThe steps are:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Add 2 to total.\n\nNow current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3 steps. So add 3. Now total is 5.\n\nCurrent is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother sample input is ['4 3\\n2 3 3']. So the tasks are [2,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Distance from 1 to 2 is 1. Total is 1.\n\nCurrent is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Distance is 1. Total is 2.\n\nCurrent is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance is 0. Total remains 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through the list of a's, and for each element, compute the distance from the previous position to the current a_i, add it to the total, and then update the previous position.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nThen output total_time.\n\nWait, but wait: what if the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1, according to the input constraints (since m is ≥1? Let me check the input constraints. The problem says m can be 1. So for m=1, the code will process once.\n\nBut let me check the input constraints again. The first line says n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5). So m can be 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test another case. Suppose n=2, m=2, a = [1, 2]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 1: distance is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. total is 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct: move from 1 to 2, which is 1 step.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct: moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise: 2→1). So total is 1+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So (ai - current_pos) could be negative, but mod n will give the correct distance.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nBut wait, let's check the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → total is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 = 3 → total is 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample Output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1 → total 1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0 → total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo code works for these cases.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] — but perhaps that's for testing purposes. In reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read from stdin. So, for example, the first line is read as input().split(), then the second line is read as list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nBut need to make sure that for the second line, there are exactly m numbers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's.\n\nBut in Python, sometimes when reading input, there can be issues with leading/trailing spaces, but the code should handle that.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but for the case where the list a is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut let me check the constraints again. The problem says m can be 1. So the code works.\n\nBut what if the list has m elements? For example, the input is m=3, and the second line has three numbers. So the code is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nWhich matches the examples.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[1, 5]. Starting at 1. First step is 0 (distance from 1 to 1). Then from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 is 4 → total 4. So output is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: a_i is same as previous. So, for example, n=5, m=3, a=[3,3,3]. The total time is (3-1) mod5 = 2, then 0, then 0 → total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. Since movement is only allowed clockwise, the time to move from one house to another depends on their positions.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses in a clockwise direction can be computed using modulo arithmetic. For two houses `current` and `next`, the distance is `(next - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house, accumulate the total time, and update the current position after each task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of houses where each task needs to be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Accumulate this distance into the total time and update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
