The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks. Since each task must be done in order, we have to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the distance between two points depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next task is at 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 → 4 → 1 → 2, which is 3 steps. But if the next task is at 4, then it's just 1 step.\n\nSo the distance between current_pos and next_pos (when moving clockwise) is (next_pos - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if next_pos is larger than current_pos, then the distance is next_pos - current_pos. If it's smaller, then it's (n - current_pos + next_pos). But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nWait, for example, current_pos is 3, next is 2. n is 4. So the distance is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Or maybe (next_pos - current_pos) if positive, else (next_pos - current_pos + n). So the formula would be (next_pos - current_pos) if next_pos >= current_pos, else (next_pos - current_pos + n). But that's equivalent to (next_pos - current_pos + n) % n, but since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct distance.\n\nBut wait, when next_pos is equal to current_pos, the distance is zero. So for each consecutive task, we need to compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the tasks are given in the order they must be done. So the initial position is 1. Then for each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, we need to compute the time taken to get from the previous position to this task's position, and add it to the total.\n\nWait, but the tasks are in order. So for example, if the first task is a_1, then Xenia has to go from 1 to a_1. Then for the second task a_2, she has to go from a_1 to a_2, and so on. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where the first step is from 1 to a_1, then a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nBut how do we compute the distance between two positions?\n\nLet me think. Let's say current position is pos_prev, and next position is pos_next. The distance is (pos_next - pos_prev) if pos_next >= pos_prev, else (pos_next - pos_prev + n). Alternatively, (pos_next - pos_prev) % n? Wait, no. Because if pos_next is less than pos_prev, then (pos_next - pos_prev) is negative. For example, pos_prev is 3, pos_next is 2. Then (2-3) is -1. Mod n (say n=4) gives 3, which is the correct distance. So the distance is (pos_next - pos_prev) % n. But wait, if pos_next is 3 and pos_prev is 2, then (3-2) mod 4 is 1, which is correct. So yes, the distance between pos_prev and pos_next (clockwise) is (pos_next - pos_prev) if positive, else (pos_next - pos_prev + n). Which is equivalent to (pos_next - pos_prev) % n, but since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values, perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So (pos_next - pos_prev) % n would give the correct distance. So for example, when pos_prev is 3 and pos_next is 2, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the distance is (pos_next - pos_prev) % n.\n\nBut wait, if pos_prev is 1 and pos_next is 1, then the distance is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between two positions is (pos_next - pos_prev) % n. However, since the movement is clockwise, this is correct.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = a_i\n\nBut wait, let's test with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\nSo initial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. distance is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. So total_time is 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, and the a is [2,3,3]. Let's see.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total_time is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total_time remains 2. So output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a's, compute the distance from the previous position to the current a_i, add it to the total, and update the current position.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same house is visited multiple times? Like if a_i is same as previous, then the distance is zero, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nThen print total_time.\n\nBut wait, let's check another example. Suppose n=2, m=2, a = [1, 2].\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 1: distance is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. total_time is 0. current_pos is 1.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total_time is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, a = [2, 1]. So first task is 2: distance (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. Then next task is 1: (1-2) mod 2 is -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic works.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. First line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem, the input is given as something like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] but that's probably for testing. But in actual input, the user will input two lines. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but let's check for the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4=3. total is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. The code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nBut what about when n=1? Wait, no. The constraints say that n is at least 2. Because in the input description, the first line has n and m, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when the list a has multiple entries for the same house? Like [1,1,1], then the code would compute 0 for each step after the first. So for example, initial position is 1. First ai is 1: distance is 0. Then next ai is 1: distance 0. So total time is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task is located at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent one takes one unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from one house to another can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The distance from the current position to the next task's position is computed as `(next_position - current_position) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's position, accumulate this distance, and update the current position to the task's position for subsequent calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_pos = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n        total_time += distance\n        current_pos = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Accumulating Time**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current position to the task's house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
