Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers where one's end is before the other's start (so they don't overlap), and the sum of their durations is exactly x. And find the minimum cost of such pairs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. Need something efficient, like O(n log n) or O(n).\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each voucher, we can check if there's another voucher that starts after this one ends, and whose duration is x minus the current voucher's duration. But how to efficiently find that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each voucher, compute duration d = ri - li + 1. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need to find another voucher with duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to find those efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers j with duration (x - d) such that either j's start is after i's end, or i's start is after j's end. But since we need to consider all possible pairs, maybe we can split into two parts: for each voucher, check for vouchers that end before it starts, and have the required duration, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that quickly?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible duration d, we can store the vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time (or start time?), so that when looking for a voucher of duration (x - d) that ends before a certain time, we can find the minimum cost quickly.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a voucher A with duration d. Then I need a voucher B with duration (x - d). The voucher B must end before A starts, or start after A ends. But since we are considering pairs (A,B) and (B,A), maybe we can process them in two separate ways.\n\nLet me think of splitting into two cases:\n\nCase 1: Voucher A ends before voucher B starts. So, for voucher B, we want to find vouchers A with duration (x - duration_B) that end before B's start.\n\nCase 2: Voucher B ends before voucher A starts. Which is symmetric to case 1.\n\nBut perhaps we can handle both cases by processing for each voucher B, looking for vouchers with duration (x - duration_B) that end before B's start, and then take the minimum cost among those. Then do the same for the other direction (vouchers that start after B ends). Wait, but maybe that's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, we can check for vouchers of the required duration that end before the current voucher's start. Then, for each such voucher, we can take the minimum cost. Similarly, check for vouchers of the required duration that start after the current voucher's end.\n\nBut how to find these vouchers efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\n- Precompute for each possible duration d, a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end time, and also keep track of the minimum cost up to that end time. Or maybe for each duration d, we can have a sorted list of end times, and for each end time, have the minimum cost up to that point. That way, when looking for vouchers of duration d that end before a certain time (say, s), we can perform a binary search to find the latest end time <= s, and get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nWait, but for each duration d, if we have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time, and for each position in the list, we have the minimum cost up to that position, then for a given s, we can find the maximum end time <= s, and then get the minimum cost among all vouchers with duration d that end before s.\n\nBut how to build that structure.\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, create a list of (end_time, min_cost_so_far). But perhaps for each d, we can sort all vouchers with that duration by their end time, and then precompute a prefix minimum array. So for example, for vouchers sorted by end time, the prefix minimum array would store the minimum cost from the start up to that index. Then, when we need to find the minimum cost for vouchers with duration d that end before a certain value s, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times to find the largest end time <= s, and then take the corresponding prefix minimum.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers with duration d, sorted by their start time, perhaps we can have a structure that allows us to find the minimum cost for vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nWait, but in the case where we need a voucher B that starts after voucher A's end, then voucher B's start must be > A's end. So for voucher A with duration d_A, we need a voucher B with duration d_B = x - d_A. And B's start must be > A's end. So for B's start, we can look for vouchers of duration d_B where their start is greater than A's end. How can we find the minimum cost of such vouchers?\n\nFor that, perhaps for each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by their start time. Then, for a given start time s (A's end + 1?), we can find the first voucher in the list with start time >= s, and then find the minimum cost among all vouchers from that index onwards.\n\nBut how to precompute the minimums for suffixes. So for each duration d, we can sort the vouchers by start time, and create a suffix minimum array. So for each index i in the sorted list, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to the end of the list. Then, when we perform a binary search to find the first start time >= s, we can take the suffix_min at that index.\n\nSo combining these two approaches:\n\nFor each voucher A with duration d_A, we need to find vouchers of duration d_B = x - d_A. For these vouchers, they can be either:\n\n1. Ending before A's start (so A's start is after B's end). So for B's duration d_B, we look for vouchers that end before A's start. For that, we can use the sorted list of end times for duration d_B and find the minimum cost.\n\nOR\n\n2. Starting after A's end. So B's start is after A's end. For that, we look for vouchers of duration d_B that start after A's end. For that, we use the sorted list of start times for duration d_B, and find the minimum cost.\n\nBut how to handle both cases? Because for each voucher A, we need to check both possibilities (whether there's a voucher B that ends before A starts, or starts after A ends). But since the problem requires two vouchers that don't overlap, either case is acceptable.\n\nBut how to avoid double-counting? For example, if voucher A and B are considered once in case 1 (B ends before A starts) and again in case 2 (A ends before B starts). However, since we're considering all pairs, but the code will process each pair once (either as A and B or B and A), but perhaps we can process both possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding the minimal cost, perhaps checking both possibilities for each voucher is necessary.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess for each duration d, two structures:\n\n   a. A sorted list of end times, along with a prefix min cost array. This allows us to find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration d that end before a certain time.\n\n   b. A sorted list of start times, along with a suffix min cost array. This allows us to find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration d that start after a certain time.\n\nThen, for each voucher A with duration d_A, compute d_B = x - d_A. If d_B is not present in the duration map, skip. Else:\n\n   - Check if there are vouchers of duration d_B that end before A's start. For that, query the prefix min for duration d_B with end <= (A's start - 1). If found, take that min cost and add to A's cost.\n\n   - Also check if there are vouchers of duration d_B that start after A's end. For that, query the suffix min for duration d_B with start >= (A's end + 1). If found, take that min cost and add to A's cost.\n\nThen, among all these possibilities, find the overall minimum.\n\nBut what about overlapping vouchers? Well, the structures ensure that the vouchers are non-overlapping.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n1. Preprocessing the data for each duration.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nLet's create a dictionary, say, for each duration d, we have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by end time. Also, a prefix min array for the costs.\n\n- A list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by start time. Also, a suffix min array for the costs.\n\nSo, for example, for each d, we can have:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers with duration d, key=lambda v: v.end)\nprefix_min_end = [ ... ] where prefix_min_end[i] is the minimum cost from sorted_by_end[0..i]\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers with duration d, key=lambda v: v.start)\nsuffix_min_start = [ ... ] where suffix_min_start[i] is the minimum cost from sorted_by_start[i..end]\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher A, we can compute d_B and check for the two cases.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then group them by duration. For each group, process the sorted lists and the prefix/suffix arrays.\n\nBut what about when d_B is zero? Well, since x can be up to 2e5, but the duration of a voucher is at least 1 (since li <= ri). So x must be at least 2 (since Leha needs two vouchers with durations adding to x). So if x is less than 2, the answer is -1. But according to the input constraints, x is >= 2? Wait, no. The input says x can be as low as 2. Wait, the input constraints say 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x is at least 2. So for d_B, x - d_A can be zero if d_A is x. But since each voucher's duration is at least 1, then x - d_A can be zero only if x = d_A. But then, d_B is zero, which is not possible. Therefore, when d_A is x, d_B is zero, which is invalid. So in that case, we can ignore that possibility.\n\nSo during processing, for each voucher A, compute d_A. Then check if x - d_A is positive. If not, skip.\n\nSo, for each voucher A:\n\nd_A = ri - li + 1\n\nd_B = x - d_A\n\nif d_B < 1: continue\n\nThen, check if there are vouchers with duration d_B.\n\nIf yes, proceed to check both cases.\n\nNow, for the first case: find vouchers with duration d_B that end before A's start (li_A).\n\nWait, A's start is li_A. So for a voucher B to end before A's start, B's end must be <= li_A - 1.\n\nSo for the vouchers of duration d_B, sorted by end time, we can find the largest end time <= li_A - 1. Then, if such exists, take the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case: vouchers with duration d_B that start after A's end (ri_A + 1). So for vouchers of duration d_B, sorted by start time, find the first start time >= (ri_A + 1). Then, take the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for each of these two cases, we can perform a binary search.\n\nNow, how to perform the binary search.\n\nFor the first case (end time <= s):\n\nWe have a list of end times sorted in ascending order. We can perform a bisect_right to find the insertion point of s+1, then subtract 1. If the insertion point is 0, then there are no such vouchers. Otherwise, the index is insertion_point - 1. Then, the prefix_min_end array at that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nFor the second case (start time >= s):\n\nWe have a list of start times sorted in ascending order. We can perform a bisect_left to find the first index where start time >= s. If the index is beyond the list length, no such vouchers. Else, the suffix_min_start array at that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nNow, the next step is to precompute for each duration d, these sorted lists and the prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to code this in Python.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. So, for example, using a defaultdict(list) where the key is duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (each voucher is represented by li, ri, cost).\n\nOnce grouped, for each duration d in the dictionary, process the list:\n\nFor the sorted_by_end list:\n\nSort the vouchers by their end time (ri). Then, create a prefix_min array. The prefix_min array is built as follows: prefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher. For i >=1, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost). This way, for any index i in the sorted_by_end list, the minimum cost up to that index is known.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_by_start list:\n\nSort the vouchers by their start time (li). Then, create a suffix_min array. The suffix_min array is built from the end. suffix_min[-1] = cost of last voucher. For i from len-2 downto 0: suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost). This way, for any index i in the sorted_by_start list, the minimum cost from i to the end is known.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher A, we can check for d_B and proceed.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each, compute duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup them into a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers (each voucher is a tuple of li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, process the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through all vouchers. For each voucher A:\n\nCompute d_A = duration of A.\n\nd_B = x - d_A.\n\nIf d_B < 1, skip.\n\nCheck if d_B is in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the first case: find vouchers of duration d_B that end before A's start (li_A). So, s = li_A - 1.\n\nIn the sorted_by_end list of d_B, find the largest end time <= s. If exists, take the min cost up to that index. Add to A's cost.\n\nFor the second case: find vouchers of duration d_B that start after A's end (ri_A + 1). So, s = ri_A + 1.\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list of d_B, find the first start time >= s. If exists, take the min cost from that index onwards. Add to A's cost.\n\nWe collect all these possible candidates and track the minimum.\n\nBut wait, for each voucher A, we have to check both possibilities (case 1 and case 2) for the d_B vouchers. Also, note that the voucher B can't be the same as voucher A. But since the problem says i != j, but in our approach, if there is a voucher B with same duration and same start/end as A, but since we are checking for all vouchers in the duration group, but when we process voucher A, we might include itself. However, since the problem requires two different vouchers, we need to make sure that when we find the min cost, it's not the same voucher.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Suppose voucher A has duration d_A, and d_B = x - d_A. Suppose that there's a voucher B with duration d_B, and it's the same as voucher A. But in that case, when we check for case 1 (voucher B ends before A's start), but if B is the same as A, then B's end is ri_A. So for case 1, s is A's start (li_A) - 1. So B's end is ri_A, which must be <= li_A - 1. But since li_A <= ri_A (because it's a voucher), this would require ri_A <= li_A -1, which implies that ri_A < li_A, which is impossible. So in this case, the voucher B can't be the same as A. Because in that case, the voucher B's end is ri_A, which is >= li_A. So when we check for vouchers ending before A's start (li_A - 1), the voucher A itself can't be part of that. Similarly for the other case.\n\nWait, but if voucher B is the same as voucher A, but in the case where the voucher B starts after A's end. For example, if voucher A's end is ri_A, and voucher B is same as A, then B's start is li_A. So for case 2, we need B's start >= ri_A + 1. But since li_A <= ri_A, this is only possible if ri_A + 1 <= li_A. Which implies ri_A < li_A, which is impossible. So in all cases, when we check for vouchers in the d_B group, they cannot be the same as voucher A. Therefore, even if there's a voucher B with same parameters as A, but in the d_B group, the code will not include it in the same pair. So we don't need to worry about duplicates here.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the preprocessing for each duration.\n\nNow, in Python, for each duration d, we can process the vouchers as follows:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # since each voucher is (li, ri, cost), ri is x[1]\n\nThen, create prefix_min_end:\n\nprefix_min = []\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor voucher in sorted_by_end:\n    current_min = min(current_min, voucher[2])\n    prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n    suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher A, when checking for d_B, we can perform the binary searches.\n\nNow, the binary search part.\n\nFor the first case (end <= s):\n\nIn the sorted_by_end list of d_B, the end times are sorted. So we can extract a list of end times, say, ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end].\n\nWe can perform a bisect_right on ends for s. The insertion point gives the number of elements <= s. So if insertion_point is 0, then no elements. Else, the index is insertion_point - 1. The prefix_min array at that index gives the min cost.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport bisect\n\ns = ... \n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(ends, s) - 1\n\nif index >=0:\n\n    min_cost_b = prefix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n    no such voucher.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (start >= s):\n\nIn the sorted_by_start list of d_B, the start times are sorted. So we can extract starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start].\n\nWe perform bisect_left on starts for s. The index gives the first element >= s. If index is within the list, then the suffix_min array at index gives the min cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(starts, s)\n\nif index < len(starts):\n\n    min_cost_b = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n    no such voucher.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut how to store the sorted lists and their prefix/suffix arrays. For each duration d, we need to have:\n\n- sorted_by_end list, and the prefix_min_end array.\n\n- sorted_by_start list, and the suffix_min_start array.\n\nSo, perhaps we can precompute for each duration d, these structures. For example, a dictionary that maps durations to tuples of (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut in Python, for each duration d, we can store these as separate entries.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with li, ri, cost. Compute duration for each.\n\nGroup them into duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start lists, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\nCompute d_A = duration.\n\nd_B = x - d_A.\n\nif d_B < 1: continue.\n\nif d_B not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nProcess the two cases.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers of duration d_B that end before voucher A's start.\n\nSo, for the d_B group:\n\nsorted_by_end_list = duration_dict[d_B][0]\n\nprefix_min_end = duration_dict[d_B][1]\n\nends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end_list]\n\ns = voucher_A's li - 1.\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(ends, s) - 1.\n\nif index >=0:\n\ncurrent_min = prefix_min_end[index]\n\ntotal = current_min + voucher_A's cost.\n\nupdate the global answer.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers of duration d_B that start after voucher_A's end.\n\nsorted_by_start_list = duration_dict[d_B][2]\n\nsuffix_min_start = duration_dict[d_B][3]\n\nstarts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start_list]\n\ns = voucher_A's ri + 1.\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(starts, s)\n\nif index < len(starts):\n\ncurrent_min = suffix_min_start[index]\n\ntotal = current_min + voucher_A's cost.\n\nupdate the global answer.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the answer is still infinity, output -1 else output the answer.\n\nBut how to store the sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, etc. for each duration.\n\nIn Python, perhaps for each duration d, we can precompute:\n\nFor example, for duration_dict, instead of storing lists of vouchers, we can precompute for each duration d, the sorted_by_end list, the prefix_min_end array, sorted_by_start list, and suffix_min_start array.\n\nSo during the preprocessing phase, for each duration d:\n\nvouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nprefix_min_end = compute as above.\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsuffix_min_start = compute as above.\n\nThen, store in a new structure, say, preprocessed_data, which is a dictionary mapping duration d to (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we can generate these four components.\n\nNow, code-wise, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\npreprocessed_data[d] = (sorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start)\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher, for d_B, we can retrieve these components.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nBut how to handle the preprocessed_data?\n\nLet me think. Let's proceed.\n\nOnce the vouchers are grouped into duration_dict, for each duration d in duration_dict, process the vouchers:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])\n\nprefix_min_end = []\n\ncurrent_min = infinity\n\nfor v in sorted_by_end:\n\n    current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n\n    prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0])\n\nsuffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\ncurrent_min = infinity\n\nfor i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n\n    suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n\nThen, store these in preprocessed_data.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A in the original list, process as before.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and same start/end times? The code handles that correctly, as the prefix and suffix min arrays will account for all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3.\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5. We need two vouchers with durations adding to 5. Possible combinations: 3+2, 2+3.\n\nFor each voucher:\n\nLet's take voucher 1 (duration 3). d_B = 5-3=2. So check for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th vouchers.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before voucher 1's start (1). voucher 1's li is 1. So s = 1-1=0. The end times of vouchers with duration 2 are 2, 6, 2. So sorted_by_end for duration 2 would be sorted by end time. Let's see:\n\nOriginal vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost=5.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2, cost=4.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6, cost=1.\n\nsorted by end time (r): voucher 2 and 4 have r=2, voucher 3 has r=6. So sorted_by_end would be [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]. Their end times are 2,2,6. The prefix_min_end array would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1)=1]. So for s=0, bisect_right on [2,2,6] for 0 returns 0. index is -1. So no such voucher.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers with duration 2 that start after voucher 1's end (3). voucher 1's ri is 3. So s is 3+1=4. Now, the sorted_by_start list for duration 2 is sorted by l. The vouchers are voucher2 (l=1), voucher4 (l=1), voucher3 (l=5). So starts are [1,1,5]. bisect_left for 4 would find the first index where start >=4. starts are [1,1,5]. 4 is between 1 and 5. So bisect_left returns 2. suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So adding 1 + voucher1's cost (4) gives 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this case would contribute 5.\n\nAnother voucher is voucher3 (duration 2). d_B =5-2=3. Are there vouchers with duration 3? Yes, voucher1. So check for vouchers with duration 3 that end before voucher3's start (5) or start after voucher3's end (6).\n\nCase1: vouchers with duration 3 (voucher1) end before voucher3's start (5). voucher1's end is 3. 3 <= 5-1=4? Yes. So the min cost for vouchers with duration 3 is 4. Adding to voucher3's cost (1) gives 5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo this would be another candidate. So the code would capture that.\n\nThus, the code would find the correct answer.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut in Python, how to handle the bisect steps. For each duration d_B, during preprocessing, we can precompute the list of ends and starts. But during the processing of each voucher, for each d_B, we need to access these lists. However, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can precompute the list of ends (for sorted_by_end) and starts (for sorted_by_start), and store them in the preprocessed_data.\n\nBut in code, for example, for the preprocessed_data, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nsorted_by_end, prefix_min_end, sorted_by_start, suffix_min_start.\n\nBut during the processing of voucher A, when we check for d_B, we need to get the sorted_by_end list and its prefix_min_end, and the sorted_by_start list and suffix_min_start.\n\nBut in code, for each duration d in preprocessed_data, the sorted_by_end is a list of vouchers sorted by end time, and the ends can be generated by [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end], but perhaps during preprocessing, we can precompute the list of ends and starts, to avoid recomputing them every time.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of each voucher, for d_B, we can generate the list of ends and starts on the fly. But that would be O(k) for each check, which is not feasible for large k. Hence, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can store the list of ends (for sorted_by_end) and starts (for sorted_by_start).\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration d:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\nprefix_min_end = ...\n\nSimilarly for starts.\n\nSo during the preprocessing phase, for each duration d, we can store:\n\npreprocessed_data[d] = (ends, prefix_min_end, starts, suffix_min_start)\n\nBut how to store that. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nduration_dict = dict()  # key: duration, value: list of vouchers (li, ri, cost)\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, duration) )  # storing duration for later use?\n\n    if duration not in duration_dict:\n\n        duration_dict[duration] = []\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess the data for each duration\n\npreprocessed = dict()\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process sorted_by_end\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    ends = [x[1] for x in sorted_by_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min_end\n\n    prefix_min_end = []\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for v in sorted_by_end:\n\n        min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n\n        prefix_min_end.append( min_cost )\n\n    # process sorted_by_start\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    starts = [x[0] for x in sorted_by_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min_start\n\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n\n        min_cost = min( min_cost, sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n\n    # store in preprocessed\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (ends, prefix_min_end, starts, suffix_min_start)\n\n# Now, iterate through all vouchers and check for possible pairs\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    li_A, ri_A, cost_A, duration_A = voucher\n\n    d_B = x - duration_A\n\n    if d_B < 1:\n\n        continue\n\n    if d_B not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for d_B\n\n    ends, prefix_min_end, starts, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[d_B]\n\n    # Case 1: find vouchers with duration d_B that end before li_A - 1\n\n    s = li_A - 1\n\n    # perform bisect_right on ends\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, s) - 1\n\n    if idx >= 0:\n\n        current_min = prefix_min_end[idx]\n\n        total = current_min + cost_A\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\n    # Case 2: find vouchers with duration d_B that start after ri_A + 1\n\n    s = ri_A + 1\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, s)\n\n    if idx < len(starts):\n\n        current_min = suffix_min_start[idx]\n\n        total = current_min + cost_A\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n\n    print(-1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but in the vouchers list, each voucher is stored as (li, ri, cost, duration). But during the initial reading, the code appends (li, ri, cost, duration). But in the code above, when we read the vouchers, we have:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = ... \n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, duration) )\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the duration_dict, we stored (li, ri, cost) for each voucher. So the code for the preprocessing is okay.\n\nTesting this code against the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2.\n\nSo during the processing of voucher (1,3,4,3):\n\nd_B = 5-3=2. Check if 2 is in preprocessed. Yes.\n\nends for d_B=2 is [2,2,6], prefix_min_end is [5,4,1].\n\nCase 1: s = li_A -1 = 1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. idx is -1. No.\n\nCase 2: s = ri_A +1 = 3+1=4. starts for d_B=2 is [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So total is 1 + 4 = 5. min_total is updated to 5.\n\nThen, when processing voucher (5,6,1,2), duration_A=2. d_B = 5-2=3. Check if 3 is in preprocessed. Yes. For d_B=3, the preprocessed data would have ends = [3], prefix_min_end = [4]. starts = [1], suffix_min_start = [4].\n\nCase 1: s = li_A -1 = 5-1=4. ends is [3]. bisect_right([3], 4) returns 1. idx=0. current_min is 4. total is 4 + 1 = 5. So min_total remains 5.\n\nCase 2: s = ri_A +1 = 6+1=7. starts is [1]. bisect_left([1], 7) returns 1, which is >= len(starts) (1). So no.\n\nSo this case contributes 5 again.\n\nOther vouchers may contribute as well, but the code finds the correct answer.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 --> duration 3.\n\n2 4 1 --> duration 3.\n\n3 5 4 --> duration 3.\n\nSo x is 2. Each voucher has duration 3. So d_B = x - duration_A = 2 -3 = -1. So all vouchers are skipped. Hence, output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, x=2. Each voucher has duration 1. So two vouchers. They must not overlap.\n\nFor example:\n\nvoucher1: 1-1 (duration 1), cost 1.\n\nvoucher2: 2-2 (duration 1), cost 2.\n\nSo the code would process voucher1. d_B = 2-1=1. Check for vouchers with duration 1. For case 1: s = li_A -1 =1-1=0. ends for d_B=1 is [1,2]. bisect_right([1,2], 0) is 0. no. case2: s=1+1=2. starts for d_B=1 is [1,2]. bisect_left([1,2], 2) returns 1. suffix_min_start[1] is 2. total is 2+1=3. Then voucher2: d_B=1. case1: s=2-1=1. ends for d_B=1 is [1,2]. bisect",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers with specific durations.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists based on their end times and start times. Additionally, we compute prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted lists. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimum cost of vouchers that meet specific criteria.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration such that they do not overlap. This is done by using binary search on the preprocessed sorted lists to find valid non-overlapping vouchers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = dict()  # key: duration, value: list of (li, ri, cost)\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n        if duration not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[duration] = []\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess data for each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted by end\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [x[1] for x in sorted_by_end]\n        # Compute prefix min end\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_cost)\n        # Process sorted by start\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [x[0] for x in sorted_by_start]\n        # Compute suffix min start\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n        # Store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (ends, prefix_min_end, starts, suffix_min_start)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        li_A, ri_A, cost_A, duration_A = voucher\n        d_B = x - duration_A\n        if d_B < 1:\n            continue\n        if d_B not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Get preprocessed data for d_B\n        ends, prefix_min_end, starts, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[d_B]\n        # Case 1: vouchers with duration d_B end before li_A - 1\n        s = li_A - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, s) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min_end[idx]\n            total = current_min + cost_A\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        # Case 2: vouchers with duration d_B start after ri_A + 1\n        s = ri_A + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, s)\n        if idx < len(starts):\n            current_min = suffix_min_start[idx]\n            total = current_min + cost_A\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: This allows efficient lookup of vouchers with specific durations.\n- **Preprocessing**: By sorting vouchers by their start and end times and computing minimum cost arrays, we can quickly determine the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers using binary search.\n- **Binary Search**: This helps in efficiently finding the earliest end time or latest start time that meets the non-overlapping criteria, ensuring the solution is optimal and efficient even for large input sizes.",
