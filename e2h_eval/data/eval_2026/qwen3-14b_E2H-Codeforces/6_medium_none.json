Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration equals exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break down the requirements:\n\nEach voucher has a departure day (li), return day (ri), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i≠j) such that their durations add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. Non-overlapping means either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li).\n\nThe challenge is to find such pairs efficiently given the constraints of n up to 2e5. A brute-force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow for n=2e5. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher that doesn't overlap with it and has a duration of (x - duration of current voucher). But how do we find that efficiently?\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each possible duration d, store the minimum cost of vouchers with that duration. Also, maybe store the earliest ending day or latest starting day for each duration to help with non-overlapping checks?\n\nWait, but for each voucher with duration d, we need to find another voucher with duration (x - d) that does not overlap with it. So for each voucher, we can check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before li (so that the other voucher is before this one), or starts after ri (so that the other voucher is after this one).\n\nBut how to quickly find the minimum cost for vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can pre-process for each possible duration, the list of vouchers sorted by their end time, and also sorted by their start time. Then, for a given voucher with duration d, and target duration t = x - d, we can query for the minimum cost in vouchers of duration t that end before li (so that they don't overlap with the current voucher), or start after ri (so that they don't overlap with the current voucher).\n\nBut how do we do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose we have for each duration t, two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to that end time. So for example, for vouchers of duration t, sorted by their end time, and for each position, we have the minimum cost up to that point. Then, for a given li, we can find the maximum end time that is less than li, and get the minimum cost among those.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case: vouchers of duration t that start after ri. So, for these vouchers, sorted by their start time, and for each position, the minimum cost from that start time onwards. Then, for a given ri, we can find the earliest start time that is greater than ri, and get the minimum cost in that range.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration t, we can have:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, and for each end time, keep track of the minimum cost for vouchers up to that end time. This allows us to perform a binary search for the largest end time <= some value (like li - 1), and then get the min cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times, sorted, and for each start time, keep track of the min cost from that start time onward. Then, for a given ri + 1, find the smallest start time >= that value, and get the min cost.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is two lists:\n\n   For each duration t:\n\n   - A list of (end_time, min_cost_so_far) sorted by end_time. This is built by sorting all vouchers of duration t by their end_time, and then computing a prefix min array. So for each position in the sorted list, the prefix min up to that index is stored.\n\n   - A list of (start_time, min_cost_from_here) sorted by start_time. Similarly, sorted by start_time, and compute a suffix min array.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher with duration d, we can compute t = x - d. If t is not present in our duration map, skip. Otherwise, check for vouchers of duration t that end before the current voucher's start (so that they don't overlap) or start after the current voucher's end.\n\nFor example, take a voucher with li and ri. For the first case, we look for vouchers of duration t that end before li. To find the minimum cost among them, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end_time list for t, find the largest end_time <= li - 1. Then, using the prefix min array, get the min cost up to that index.\n\nFor the second case, we look for vouchers of duration t that start after ri. So, in the sorted start_time list for t, find the first start_time >= ri + 1. Then, using the suffix min array, get the min cost from that index onwards.\n\nFor each voucher, we can compute both possibilities and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how do we handle the cases where t is zero? Well, since x is at least 2 (since n ≥ 2 and x ≥ 2?), Wait, no. Wait, the input says x can be as low as 2. For example, in the second sample input, x is 2. But for a voucher's duration to be part of a sum, each voucher's duration has to be at least 1. So for x=2, each voucher must have duration 1 and 1. So, for each voucher of duration 1, we need to find another voucher of duration 1 that doesn't overlap.\n\nSo, the approach is valid.\n\nNow, the steps for the algorithm:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary grouped by their duration. For each duration, we have two sorted lists (sorted by end time and sorted by start time) and their respective min arrays.\n\n2. Iterate through each voucher. For each voucher, compute d = duration. Check if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the dictionary). If not, skip.\n\n3. For the current voucher, check for vouchers of duration t = x - d that end before the current voucher's li (so that they don't overlap). Also check for vouchers of duration t that start after the current voucher's ri.\n\n4. For each of these two possibilities, find the minimum cost, and combine with the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the voucher we are checking is not the same as the current voucher. However, since the problem allows i and j to be different vouchers, even if they are in the same duration group. So when we process a voucher, and look for vouchers in the t duration group, we need to ensure that there's at least one voucher in that group (and possibly not the same as the current voucher if the duration is t and the current voucher's duration is d, but that's only possible if t = d and x = 2d. So for example, if x is 2d, and the current voucher's duration is d, then the t is d. So when looking for vouchers in the t group, we need to ensure that there's at least one voucher in that group, and that it's not the same voucher as the current one. However, since we're considering all vouchers in the group, and the minimum cost may include the same voucher, but that would be invalid. So how to avoid that?\n\nAh, right! Because when processing the current voucher, the code might check for vouchers in the t group. But if the current voucher's duration is t, then when looking for vouchers in the t group, we need to make sure that the voucher is not the same as the current one.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, suppose the current voucher is part of the t group. When looking for vouchers in the t group that end before li or start after ri, perhaps the same voucher is included. But that's not allowed.\n\nThis complicates things. How can we avoid considering the same voucher?\n\nOne approach is to pre-process for each duration, not only the list of vouchers but also track the minimum cost for all vouchers except the current one. However, that seems difficult.\n\nAlternative idea: during the preprocessing step, for each duration t, we have all vouchers of that duration. Then, when checking for vouchers in t, we can include all of them, but when the current voucher is part of the t group, we need to make sure that the voucher found in the t group is not the same as the current one. However, how to handle that?\n\nBut given that for each voucher, when we look for a voucher in the t group, the current voucher's own presence in the t group may or may not be considered. For example, if the current voucher is in the t group, then when we look for vouchers in t group that end before li, it's possible that the current voucher is part of that set. But since the current voucher's end time is ri, and the current voucher's li is the start time. So if the current voucher is in the t group, and we are looking for vouchers in the t group that end before li (current voucher's li), then the current voucher's end time is ri. Which is >= li (since ri >= li). So the current voucher cannot be in the list of vouchers that end before li. Similarly, when looking for vouchers that start after ri, the current voucher's start time is li, which is <= ri. So the current voucher cannot be in that list. Therefore, when looking for vouchers in the t group that end before li or start after ri, the current voucher is not included. Thus, even if the current voucher is part of the t group, it won't be considered in these cases. Therefore, the same voucher is not considered, so we don't need to worry about that.\n\nThat's a relief. Because when the current voucher is in the t group, but when looking for vouchers that end before li, the current voucher's end time is ri which is >= li. So the current voucher is not part of the list. Similarly, when looking for vouchers that start after ri, the current voucher's start time is li which is <= ri. So again, the current voucher is not part of that list. Hence, the same voucher is not considered. Therefore, even if the current voucher is part of the t group, the code will not select it again. Thus, we don't need to worry about duplicates here.\n\nTherefore, the approach is safe.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nLet's outline the steps again:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, say duration_dict, where for each duration d, we have:\n\n   - A sorted list of end times, along with a prefix min cost array. So for each voucher of duration d, sorted by end time, and for each index i, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\n   - A sorted list of start times, along with a suffix min cost array. For each voucher of duration d, sorted by start time, and for each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to end.\n\nSo for example, for duration d, sorted_end_list is sorted by end time. The prefix_min array is computed as follows: prefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher, prefix_min[1] = min(prefix_min[0], cost of second voucher), etc.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start_list is sorted by start time, and suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost between vouchers[i], vouchers[i+1], ..., vouchers[-1].\n\nOnce we have these structures, for each voucher (li, ri, cost), we calculate d = ri - li + 1. Then, t = x - d. If t is not in duration_dict, skip. Otherwise:\n\n   For the first case: find vouchers in duration t that end before li. How?\n\n   - Take the sorted_end_list for duration t. Perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is <= li - 1. If such exists, then get the prefix_min up to that index. The minimum cost for that case is that value.\n\n   For the second case: find vouchers in duration t that start after ri. How?\n\n   - Take the sorted_start_list for duration t. Perform a binary search to find the first start time that is >= ri + 1. If such exists, then get the suffix_min from that index. The minimum cost for that case is that value.\n\n   Then, the total cost for this pair is current voucher's cost plus the found min cost. We keep track of the global minimum.\n\nWe need to process all vouchers in this way and find the minimal total cost.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement the binary searches and the prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nLet's think about the first case. For the sorted_end_list of duration t. Each element is (end_time, cost). But actually, the list is sorted by end_time. So, for the sorted_end_list, we can have a list of end_times, and a prefix_min array. So, for example, sorted_end_times = [e1, e2, e3...], sorted in increasing order. The prefix_min array is [min_cost_1, min_cost_1_2, ...].\n\nTo find the largest end_time <= li-1, we can use bisect_right on the sorted_end_times. For example:\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_end_times, li - 1) - 1.\n\nIf index >=0, then the prefix_min[index] is the minimum cost for vouchers ending before li.\n\nSimilarly for the second case. The sorted_start_times for duration t is sorted in increasing order. We need to find the first start_time >= ri + 1. Using bisect_left, the index would be the first occurrence. If that index is within the list, then the suffix_min[index] is the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo, for each duration, we need to have:\n\n- sorted_end_times: list of end times sorted in ascending order.\n- prefix_min: list of the minimum cost up to each index.\n- sorted_start_times: list of start times sorted in ascending order.\n- suffix_min: list of the minimum cost from each index to the end.\n\nNow, how to build these structures.\n\nFor example, for each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of all vouchers with duration d.\n\n   sorted by end time:\n\n      sorted_vouchers_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.end)\n\n      sorted_end_times = [v.end for v in sorted_vouchers_end]\n\n      prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_vouchers_end)\n      prefix_min[0] = sorted_vouchers_end[0].cost\n      for i in 1 to len-1:\n          prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_vouchers_end[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly for sorted by start time:\n\n      sorted_vouchers_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.start)\n\n      sorted_start_times = [v.start for v in sorted_vouchers_start]\n\n      suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_vouchers_start)\n      suffix_min[-1] = sorted_vouchers_start[-1].cost\n      for i in len-2 downto 0:\n          suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_vouchers_start[i].cost)\n\nBut how to represent this in Python? Well, perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\n- a list of end times, sorted, and the prefix min array.\n\n- a list of start times, sorted, and the suffix min array.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration, we process the vouchers accordingly.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, for each of the n vouchers, read li, ri, cost. Compute duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nStore all vouchers in a list, and also group them by duration in a dictionary.\n\nOnce grouped, for each duration in the dictionary, we process the sorted_end and sorted_start lists with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, compute d = duration. Check if t = x - d exists in the duration_dict.\n\nIf yes, then:\n\n   For the current voucher's li and ri:\n\n   Case 1: Find vouchers in t that end before li.\n\n      For that, get the sorted_end_times of duration t. Use bisect to find the largest end_time <= li -1.\n\n      If found, get the corresponding prefix_min value.\n\n   Case 2: Find vouchers in t that start after ri.\n\n      For that, get the sorted_start_times of duration t. Use bisect to find the first start_time >= ri + 1.\n\n      If found, get the corresponding suffix_min value.\n\n   For both cases, if any of them is possible, add the current voucher's cost to the found min and update the global answer.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, considering all edge cases.\n\nBut how to handle the grouping? Let's think about the data structures. For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nduration_dict[d] = (sorted_end_times, prefix_min, sorted_start_times, suffix_min)\n\nBut how to build that.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, d) )\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, we process the sorted_end and sorted_start.\n\nBut for each duration, we need to create the sorted_end list, then compute the prefix_min array, and sorted_start list, and suffix_min array.\n\nSo, let's create a new structure. For example, another dictionary called processed_durations, where for each duration d, we have:\n\nprocessed_durations[d] = {\n    'sorted_end': list of end times (sorted),\n    'prefix_min': list of prefix mins,\n    'sorted_start': list of start times (sorted),\n    'suffix_min': list of suffix mins,\n}\n\nBut perhaps better to separate into two parts: for end and for start.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nSo, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\noriginal_vouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(original_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # since each voucher is (li, ri, cost), ri is x[1]\n\nsorted_end_times = [voucher[1] for voucher in sorted_by_end]\nprefix_min = []\nmin_so_far = float('inf')\nfor voucher in sorted_by_end:\n    min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher[2])\n    prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(original_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\nsorted_start_times = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start]\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\nmin_so_far = float('inf')\nfor i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n    min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n    suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\nThen, store these in the processed_durations.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can process it as follows.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor li, ri, cost, d in vouchers:\n    t = x - d\n    if t not in processed_durations:\n        continue\n    # check case 1: vouchers with duration t that end before li\n    # get the sorted_end_times and prefix_min for duration t\n    data = processed_durations[t]\n    end_times = data['sorted_end']\n    prefix_mins = data['prefix_min']\n    # find the largest end_time <= li -1\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li -1) -1\n    if idx >=0:\n        candidate = cost + prefix_mins[idx]\n        if candidate < ans:\n            ans = candidate\n    # check case 2: vouchers with duration t that start after ri\n    start_times = data['sorted_start']\n    suffix_mins = data['suffix_min']\n    # find first start_time >= ri +1\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri +1)\n    if idx < len(start_times):\n        candidate = cost + suffix_mins[idx]\n        if candidate < ans:\n            ans = candidate\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if ans is still infinity, output -1 else ans.\n\nBut wait, how to build the processed_durations. Let me code that part.\n\nBut first, in the code, after reading the vouchers, we need to process each duration.\n\nprocessed_durations = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n    # process sorted by end\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    sorted_end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_by_end:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n        prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n    # process sorted by start\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    sorted_start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    # store in processed_durations\n    processed_durations[d] = {\n        'sorted_end': sorted_end_times,\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'sorted_start': sorted_start_times,\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nBut in Python, the code would have to be structured like that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\n- x is 0? No, because according to input constraints, x ≥ 2.\n\nWait, the problem says x is given as per input constraints: 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. Wait, no, the input says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.\n\nSo x can be as small as 2. So for example, if x is 2, then each voucher must have duration 1 and 1. So for each voucher with duration 1, we need to find another voucher of duration 1 that doesn't overlap.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers have exactly the required durations and are non-overlapping. For example, voucher1 (1-1, cost 1), voucher2 (2-2, cost 1). x is 2. The answer is 2.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and overlapping. Need to find the ones that are non-overlapping.\n\nNow, what about when t is zero? Well, since x is at least 2 and d is at least 1 (since ri >= li, so duration is at least 1), then t = x -d can be zero only if x =d. But since x is at least 2, and d is at least 1. For example, if x is 2 and d is 2, then t is 0. But in that case, the duration of the other voucher would have to be 0, which is not possible. So in that case, we can ignore t=0. So during processing, when t is zero, we skip.\n\nSo, in code, for each voucher, compute t = x -d. If t is not in processed_durations, or t is zero, then skip.\n\nWait, but t could be zero. For example, if x=2, d=2. Then t=0. But there are no vouchers with duration 0. So in this case, we can skip.\n\nThus, during the code, after computing t = x -d, we check if t is in processed_durations and t > 0. Because duration can't be zero.\n\nSo in code:\n\nt = x - d\nif t <= 0 or t not in processed_durations:\n    continue\n\nBut wait, what if t is positive but there are no vouchers of that duration? Well, the processed_durations only contains durations that have at least one voucher. So if t is not in processed_durations, then there are no vouchers of that duration. So we can skip.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4 5\n1 3 4\n1 2 5\n5 6 1\n1 2 4\n\nThe vouchers:\n\nVoucher 0: li=1, ri=3, cost=4 → duration 3.\nVoucher 1: li=1, ri=2, cost=5 → duration 2.\nVoucher 2: li=5, ri=6, cost=1 → duration 2.\nVoucher 3: li=1, ri=2, cost=4 → duration 2.\n\nx=5. So for each voucher, compute d and t = 5 -d.\n\nFor voucher 0: d=3, t=2. Check if t=2 is in processed_durations. Yes.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers of duration 2 that end before li=1. So end_time <= 0. Since vouchers of duration 2 have end times 2, 2, 6 (voucher 1, 3, 2?), wait:\n\nWait, vouchers of duration 2 are voucher1 (1-2), voucher3 (1-2), voucher2 (5-6, duration 2? Wait, 5-6 is 2 days (6-5 +1 = 2). So yes.\n\nSo for duration 2, the sorted_end_times would be [2, 2, 6], sorted. The prefix_min for these would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1)=1]. So when looking for end_time <= li-1 = 1-1=0. The bisect_right finds 0 in [2, 2, 6], returns 0. idx = -1. So no candidates here.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers of duration 2 that start after ri=3. So start_time >= 3 +1 =4. The sorted_start_times for duration 2 is sorted by start time. The vouchers are voucher1 (start 1), voucher3 (start 1), voucher2 (start 5). So sorted_start_times is [1,1,5]. Looking for first start_time >=4. bisect_left([1,1,5],4) returns 2. Check if idx < len (3). Yes. suffix_min[2] is 1. So the candidate is 4 + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this is one of the candidates.\n\nThen, for voucher2 (duration 2, t=5-2=3). Check if duration 3 exists. Yes, voucher0. So for voucher2's li=5, ri=6. t=3. Check for vouchers of duration 3 that end before 5 (li is 5). Voucher0 has end time 3. So in the sorted_end_times for duration 3, which is [3], the bisect_right(3, 5-1=4) returns 1, idx=0. prefix_min[0] is 4. So candidate is 1 +4=5. Also, case 2: find vouchers of duration 3 that start after 6. Are there any? Probably not. So the total for this pair is 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut in Python, the way to process the vouchers and the processed_durations.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code for building the processed_durations. For example, when a duration is zero, but that's handled by checking t>0.\n\nAnother thing: when x is 2, and two vouchers of duration 1 each. So for each voucher, t=1. So during the processing, for each voucher, we check for vouchers of duration 1 that end before li or start after ri.\n\nAnother possible issue is when there are multiple vouchers in the same duration, but the code correctly finds the minimum.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the above steps.\n\nBut first, note that in the initial code, the vouchers are stored in the duration_dict as (li, ri, cost). Then, during processing, sorted_by_end is sorted by ri (voucher[1]).\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        d = ri - li +1\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, d) )\n        duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # preprocess durations\n    processed_durations = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # process sorted by end time\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # process sorted by start time\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # store in processed_durations\n        processed_durations[d] = {\n            'sorted_end': sorted_end_times,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'sorted_start': sorted_start_times,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost, d in vouchers:\n        t = x - d\n        if t <=0 or t not in processed_durations:\n            continue\n        # process case 1: vouchers with duration t that end before li\n        data = processed_durations[t]\n        end_times = data['sorted_end']\n        prefix_mins = data['prefix_min']\n        # find largest end_time <= li -1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li-1) -1\n        if idx >=0:\n            current_min = cost + prefix_mins[idx]\n            if current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min\n        # process case 2: vouchers with duration t that start after ri\n        start_times = data['sorted_start']\n        suffix_mins = data['suffix_min']\n        # find first start_time >= ri +1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri +1)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = cost + suffix_mins[idx]\n            if current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code reads input as a single split, which is okay. Now, let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n1 3 4\n1 2 5\n5 6 1\n1 2 4\n\nWhich after splitting becomes:\n\n['4', '5', '1', '3', '4', '1', '2', '5', '5', '6', '1', '1', '2', '4']\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nvouchers are:\n\n(1,3,4,3), (1,2,5,2), (5,6,1,2), (1,2,4,2)\n\nduration_dict:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\nThen, for d=3, processed_durations[3] is:\n\nsorted_by_end is [(1,3,4)] → end_times [3], prefix_min [4]\n\nsorted_by_start is [(1,3,4)] → start_times [1], suffix_min [4]\n\nFor d=2:\n\nsorted_by_end: sorted by ri. The vouchers are (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). Their ri are 2,2,6. So sorted_by_end is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. sorted_end_times is [2,2,6]. prefix_min is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nsorted_by_start: sorted by li. All three have li 1, 1,5. So sorted_by_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times [1,1,5]. suffix_min for i=2 is 1, i=1 is min(4, 1) =1, i=0 is min(5, 1) =1. So suffix_min is [1,1,1].\n\nNow, when processing voucher (1,3,4,3) (d=3, t=5-3=2):\n\nprocessed_durations[2] exists.\n\nCase 1: end_times is [2,2,6]. li is 1. li-1 is 0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0 → idx=-1 → no.\n\nCase 2: start_times is [1,1,5]. ri is 3. ri +1 is 4. bisect_left([1,1,5],4) → returns 2. idx is 2, which is <3. suffix_mins[2] is 1. So current_min is 4+1=5. So min_total is updated to 5.\n\nThen, processing voucher (1,2,5,2) (d=2, t=5-2=3). processed_durations[3] exists.\n\nCase 1: end_times is [3]. li is 1. li-1 is 0. bisect_right([3], 0) → 0 → idx -1 → no.\n\nCase 2: start_times is [1]. ri is 2. ri+1 is 3. bisect_left([1],3) → 1, which is >= len(1) → no. So nothing added.\n\nThen, voucher (5,6,1,2): d=2, t=3. Check processed_durations[3].\n\nCase 1: end_times is [3]. li is 5. li-1 is 4. bisect_right([3],4) returns 1 → idx=0. prefix_mins[0] is 4. current_min = 1+4=5. So min_total remains 5.\n\nCase 2: start_times is [1]. ri is 6. ri+1=7. bisect_left([1],7) returns 1, which is >= len(1). No.\n\nThen, voucher (1,2,4,2): d=2, t=3. same as previous voucher. case 1: li=1, li-1=0 → no. case 2: ri=2, ri+1=3. start_times is [1]. bisect_left returns 1, which is out of range. So no.\n\nThus, the min_total is 5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3\n\n2 4 1\n\n3 5 4\n\nEach voucher's duration is 3 (6-4+1=3), 3 (4-2+1=3), 3 (5-3+1=3). x is 2. So for each voucher, d=3. t=2-3 = -1. So no possible pairs. Output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if there are multiple vouchers with same duration and overlapping, but some non-overlapping pairs?\n\nFor example, two vouchers: voucher1 (1-1, cost 1), voucher2 (2-2, cost 1). x=2. So d=1 for each. t=1. So for each voucher, check for vouchers of duration 1.\n\nFor voucher1: case 1: find vouchers of duration 1 that end before li=1. li-1 is 0. So no. case 2: find vouchers of duration 1 that start after",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given value `x` and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to `x`.\n2. **Preprocess Data Structures**: For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end time of vouchers, along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start time of vouchers, along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we determine if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration. Using binary search, we efficiently check for non-overlapping vouchers in both directions (before and after the current voucher).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, d))\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed_durations = {}\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted by end time\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process sorted by start time\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # Store in processed_durations\n        processed_durations[d] = {\n            'sorted_end': sorted_end_times,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'sorted_start': sorted_start_times,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost, d in vouchers:\n        t = x - d\n        if t <= 0 or t not in processed_durations:\n            continue\n        data = processed_durations[t]\n        # Case 1: vouchers ending before li\n        end_times = data['sorted_end']\n        prefix_mins = data['prefix_min']\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li - 1) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            current_min = cost + prefix_mins[idx]\n            if current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min\n        # Case 2: vouchers starting after ri\n        start_times = data['sorted_start']\n        suffix_mins = data['suffix_min']\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, ri + 1)\n        if idx < len(start_times):\n            current_min = cost + suffix_mins[idx]\n            if current_min < min_total:\n                min_total = current_min\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by their start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end times and start times, and compute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays to facilitate quick minimum cost queries.\n4. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, we use binary search to check for non-overlapping vouchers with the required complementary duration, ensuring efficient lookup and minimizing the total cost.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid pairs of vouchers while maintaining an optimal time complexity.",
