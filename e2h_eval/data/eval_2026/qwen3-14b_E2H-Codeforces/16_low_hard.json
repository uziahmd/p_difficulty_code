Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n lines, each line divides the plane into two regions. The arrangement of these lines creates multiple regions (blocks), and each block can be represented by some kind of identifier based on which side of each line it's on.\n\nWait, right. For each line, a block can be on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine whether a given point is on one side or the other. Since the home and university are not on any line, they are in some block.\n\nSo, the idea is to model each block as a set of signs (for each line, whether the point is positive or negative when evaluated in the line equation). However, with n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations. But that's way too big for n=300. Wait, but n can be up to 300, which makes 2^300 possibilities. That's impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo, that approach isn't feasible. We need another way.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to model all the blocks. Instead, think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how to represent the blocks and their adjacency?\n\nAnother thought: since moving from one block to another requires crossing a line (road), the adjacency between blocks depends on sharing a common line. So, two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one line's sign. Because crossing a line would flip the sign of that line's equation, and keep others the same. But wait, that's only true if the two blocks are separated by exactly one line. However, multiple lines could intersect, creating regions that are adjacent via different lines. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency is determined by being separated by a single line. So, two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one line. But how to check that?\n\nBut even if that's the case, how do we model the blocks? Because for each line, the sign of the equation for the home point determines which side it's on. So, for each line, the home point is either in the positive or negative region. So, the home block can be represented by a vector of signs for each line. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut again, with 300 lines, the number of possible sign vectors is 2^300, which is way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible for n=300. Therefore, there must be another way.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the minimal number of steps. So, maybe the minimal steps is related to the number of lines that separate the home and university blocks. Let me think.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of hyperplanes. Each line is a hyperplane in 2D. The home and university are points in the plane. The question is, what is the minimal number of hyperplanes you need to cross to get from home to university. Each step allows crossing one hyperplane (line) into an adjacent block.\n\nBut how does that relate to the minimal steps? Because each time you cross a line, you move to an adjacent block. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that you have to cross to get from home to university.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Because the minimal steps would be the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university points. Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if the two points are in the same block (i.e., no lines separate them), then steps needed is zero. If they are separated by one line, then steps needed is 1. If they are separated by two lines, but those lines are arranged so that you can cross them in sequence, then steps needed is 2.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let me think of the problem as a graph where each node is a point (home or university), and edges represent crossing a line. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS where each state is the current position (but that's not feasible because there are infinite positions). So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: For each line, the home and university points are on one side or the other. Let's compute for each line whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n\nIf the home and university are on the same side of a line, then that line doesn't separate them. If they are on opposite sides, then",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Block Representation**: Each block can be represented by the sign (positive or negative) of the evaluation of each line equation at a given point. For example, if a point (x, y) lies on one side of a line defined by $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, it will yield a positive or negative value when evaluated against that line.\n\n2. **Determine Separation by Lines**: For each line, check whether the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the line. This is done by evaluating the line equation at both points and checking the sign of the result.\n\n3. **Graph Representation**: Treat each line as a node in a graph. If two lines intersect, they form an edge. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path between two nodes (home and university) in this graph, where edges represent lines that separate the home and university points.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the shortest path in terms of the number of lines (steps) that need to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block. The BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    \n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Function to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line\n    def is_opposite(a, b, c, x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        return (val1 * val2) < 0\n\n    # Build the graph: lines that separate home and university\n    # Each line is a node, and edges exist if two lines intersect\n    # But we need to find the minimal steps, which is the minimal number of lines separating them\n    # Wait, no.

It's similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of hyperplanes separating two points.\n\n    # Another approach: consider the set of lines that separate home and university. For each such line, we can model the problem as a graph where each node represents a line, and edges connect lines that intersect. Then, the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines needed to go from the home to the university, which corresponds to the minimal number of lines that form a path in this graph.\n\n    # However, this seems complicated.

For example, if the home and university are separated by two lines that do not intersect, then you can't cross them in sequence. But since the lines are infinite, they must intersect unless they are parallel. So, if two lines separate the home and university, and they are not parallel, they intersect, allowing you to cross them in sequence.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each such line must be crossed once. But how to verify this?\n\n    # For example, in the first sample input:\n    # Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The lines are x=0 and y=0. Both points are on opposite sides of both lines. So, the number of separating lines is 2. The answer is 2 steps.\n\n    # In the second sample input, the lines are x=0, y=0, x+y=3. The home is (1,1), which is on the positive side of x=0 and y=0, but on the negative side of x+y=3 (1+1-3=-1). University is (-1,-1), which is negative for x=0 and y=0, and also negative for x+y=3. So, the lines that separate are x=0 and y=0. Hence, answer is 2.\n\n    # So, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\n    # Wait, but what if there are three lines that separate them? For example, suppose home and university are separated by three lines. Then, the minimal steps would be 3? Or can we find a path through two lines?\n\n    # Let's imagine three lines that form a triangle around the home and university. Suppose the home is inside the triangle and the university is outside. Then, you need to cross three lines. But if the lines are arranged such that crossing two of them suffices, then the answer would be 2.

Each step crosses one line. Therefore, the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that must be crossed to get from home to university.\n\n    # But how to compute that? Well, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a set of lines that have been crossed, and edges represent adding a new line. But this is not feasible for large n.\n\n    # Another idea: the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university.

Answer is 2. Correct.\n\n    # Second sample: two lines separate the points. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\n    # Now, consider a scenario where home and university are separated by one line.
