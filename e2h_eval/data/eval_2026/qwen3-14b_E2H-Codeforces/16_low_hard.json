Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. The key is to represent each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if their blocks are adjacent (i.e., share a common border). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are infinite blocks, it's impossible to list them all. So I need a way to represent each block uniquely based on the roads. \n\nWait, maybe I can model the problem using the concept of regions divided by lines. Each region can be determined by the sign of the equations of the lines. For example, for each line, a point is on one side or the other. But with multiple lines, the combination of signs determines which region the point is in. However, since the lines are infinite and can intersect, the regions are determined by these inequalities.\n\nBut how can I represent the regions? Each region can be represented by a set of signs for each line. For example, for each line i, compute the value of ai*x + bi*y + ci. Since the point isn't on any line, this value is non-zero. So for each line, we can note whether the value is positive or negative. The combination of all these signs uniquely identifies the region (assuming that the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions where each region has a unique signature of signs). Wait, but that's only true if the lines are in general position, but maybe not. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps each region can be uniquely identified by the set of signs for each line. \n\nBut even if two different regions have the same set of signs, that's impossible. Because each line divides the plane into two parts. If two regions have the same sign for all lines, then they must be the same region. So, the signature (the vector of signs for each line) uniquely identifies the region. \n\nSo, for a given point (home or university), I can compute a signature vector. The problem then becomes: find the minimal number of steps to go from the home's signature to the university's signature, where each step corresponds to flipping the sign of exactly one line (since crossing a line would change the sign for that line, and thus move to an adjacent region). Wait, no. Because crossing a line would change the sign of that line's equation. However, moving between regions requires that the two regions share a common border, which implies that they differ by exactly one line's sign. Because if two regions differ by more than one line's sign, they are not adjacent. For example, if you cross one line, you flip that line's sign. So, two regions are adjacent if their signatures differ in exactly one line's sign. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Suppose two lines cross. Then, regions on opposite sides of one line can be adjacent. However, maybe there are regions that are separated by multiple lines. Hmm, perhaps the adjacency is such that two regions are adjacent if they share a common boundary, which is a segment of a line. To cross into another region, you have to cross exactly one line. Therefore, the regions that are adjacent to a given region are those that differ in exactly one line's sign. Because when you cross a line, you flip the sign of that line's equation. So, the signature of the new region is the same as the original except for that one line. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to modeling each region as a node, with edges between regions that differ by exactly one line's sign. Then, the minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of sign flips needed to transform the home's signature into the university's signature, moving through adjacent regions. \n\nBut how do we model this as a graph? Well, the problem is that the number of possible signatures is 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big. So, for n=300, it's impossible to generate all possible nodes. So, this approach is not feasible. \n\nHmm. So, what's another way? Let's think again. The problem requires finding the minimal steps between two regions, where each step changes the sign of exactly one line. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that need to be flipped to transform the home's signature into the university's signature. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because each step can flip only one line's sign. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines between the home and university signatures. Because each differing line requires a flip. However, if the home and university signatures differ in k lines, then the minimal steps is k.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block (home) to a target block (university) in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plane is divided into regions by lines. Each region can be uniquely identified by the sign (positive or negative) of the value obtained by plugging the coordinates of a point into each line equation. Moving from one region to an adjacent region involves crossing exactly one line, which changes the sign of that line's equation for the new region.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of lines for which the signs of the values computed at the home and university coordinates differ. This is because each differing sign indicates a need to cross that line, thus changing regions.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the sign of each line equation evaluated at the home coordinates.\n   - Compute the sign of each line equation evaluated at the university coordinates.\n   - Count the number of lines where these signs differ. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read the roads\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute signature for home and university\n    def get_signature(x, y):\n        sig = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            sig.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return sig\n    \n    home_sig = get_signature(x1, y1)\n    univ_sig = get_signature(x2, y2)\n    \n    # Count differing positions\n    diff = sum(1 for i in range(n) if home_sig[i] != univ_sig[i])\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, and the coefficients of the lines defining the roads.\n- **Signature Calculation**: For both the home and university coordinates, a signature is generated by evaluating each line equation and recording whether the result is positive or negative.\n- **Difference Counting**: The number of differing signs between the home and university signatures is counted.
