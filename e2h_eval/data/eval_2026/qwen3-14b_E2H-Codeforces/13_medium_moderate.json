For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again.\n\nA major triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. So total X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z where X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4 semitones. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order matters here. For example, the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upwards. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Or is it the actual difference in positions?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the notes are arranged in a cycle of 12. Let's think of each note as having an index. For example:\n\nLet me assign numbers to the notes. Let's list them in order:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. Wait, the original list is:\n\nThe notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in some notations, B is followed by C. But here, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, then back to C.\n\nSo the list is 12 elements. So each note can be mapped to a number from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the next note after H (11) is C (0).\n\nSo the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. From C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. So that's correct. But if we have E and C, the distance is 8 semitones? Because moving from E to C would require going up by 8 steps (since E is 4, adding 8 gives 12, which mod 12 is 0, which is C). So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But when considering the distance between two notes, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nBut in terms of calculation, for any two distinct notes, the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured along the scale from lower to upper, perhaps the actual way is that if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X, else 12 - (X - Y). But in terms of the problem's example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is correct. And between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X. Otherwise, it's (Y - X + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Let me think: for example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0). Then, the distance from X to Y is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8? Because (Y - X) mod 12 would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But in the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones, which matches that calculation. So, the formula for the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper, perhaps that's the way to compute it. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) which is (Y - X) mod 12. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is to map each note to its corresponding index. So I need to create a dictionary that maps the note names to their numerical values. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0-11. So for example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, 'D#' is 3, 'E' is 4, 'F' is 5, 'F#' is 6, 'G' is 7, 'G#' is 8, 'A' is 9, 'B' is 10, 'H' is 11.\n\nSo the first step is to create a dictionary mapping each note to its index. Then, for any two notes, we can calculate the distance between them.\n\nNow, given three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of them to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nFor example, for a major triad, we need to find if there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance(X,Y) is 4, distance(Y,Z) is 3. Similarly for minor, distance(X,Y) is 3 and distance(Y,Z) is 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. However, since there are 3! = 6 permutations, for each of them, we can check if they satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for each possible permutation of the three notes, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4 and the next two have 3, etc. But since the order of the three notes can be arranged in any way, perhaps we can generate all permutations and check for each of them.\n\nAlternatively, for the three notes, we can check all possible pairs for the first step. For example, for each possible pair (X, Y), compute the distance between them, and then check if the third note Z is such that the distance between Y and Z is 3 (for major) or 4 (for minor). But how to arrange that.\n\nBut given that the three notes are in a set, perhaps generating all permutations of the three notes is manageable. For example, for each of the 6 permutations, check if the first two have distance 4 and the next two have distance 3 (for major). Also check if for the same permutation, the first two have distance 3 and next two have 4 (for minor). But maybe for each permutation, check both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, for a given set of three notes, we can check all possible orderings (permutations) and see if any of them meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the three input notes into their numerical indices.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three indices.\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n\n   a. Is the distance between X and Y equal to 4, and between Y and Z equal to 3? If yes, then it's a major chord.\n\n   b. Is the distance between X and Y equal to 3, and between Y and Z equal to 4? If yes, then it's a minor chord.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies a, then the answer is major. If any permutation satisfies b, then the answer is minor. Otherwise, strange.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we don't have to worry about overlapping cases.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, \"C E G\" is converted to indices 0, 4, 7.\n\nLooking at the permutation (0,4,7):\n\ndistance between 0 and 4 is 4 semitones (correct). Between 4 and 7 is 3 (7-4=3). So that's a major chord.\n\nAnother example, the second input is \"C# B F\". Let's convert them to their indices.\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. Now, the permutation B, C#, F would be 10,1,5. The distance between 10 and 1: (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So 3 semitones. Then between 1 and 5 is 4 semitones. So that's a minor chord.\n\nSo the algorithm should work.\n\nNow, how to generate all permutations of the three notes. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the three notes, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\n- Read the input: a list of three notes. Wait, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] but that's probably an example of multiple test cases. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the input for the sample would be \"C E G\" (as one line) and the output is \"major\". So the code needs to read a single line of input, split into three notes.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably a mistake. Because in the problem statement, the input is described as \"the only line contains 3 space-separated notes\".\n\nSo for example, the first example input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] which seems to be three test cases. But the actual input for the code is one line per test case. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case per input line. However, the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So the code should read one line, split into three notes.\n\nBut the sample shows that for the input ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], the output is ['major', 'minor', 'strange']. So that's three test cases, each on a separate line. But the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line, which contains three notes, and output one of the three options.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three notes, e.g., \"C E G\", and the output is a single string, e.g., \"major\".\n\nThe sample input given in the problem is perhaps a list of test cases, but that's just an example. So the code should process a single input line.\n\nSo, the code should read a line, split into three notes, process them, and output the result.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's make a dictionary.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nBut wait, the note_order list must be in the order given in the problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list is as follows:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nYes. So the note_order list is as above. So the dictionary can be built as follows:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note 'B'? The problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo that's the correct mapping.\n\nNow, for each note in the input, we can get their index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, say, a, b, c, then generate all permutations of these three indices. For each permutation (x, y, z), check:\n\nFor major: distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3.\n\nFor minor: distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. Else, 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes as a list.\n\nConvert them to their indices.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y) is 4 and (distance between y and z) is 3 → if yes, then it's a major chord.\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y) is 3 and (distance between y and z) is 4 → if yes, then it's a minor chord.\n\nOnce any of these conditions is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, how to compute the distance between two notes. For two indices, x and y, the distance is (y - x) % 12. But wait, according to the problem's example, the distance between C (0) and E (4) is 4, which is (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4. Correct. Between E (4) and C (0) is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between x and y is (y - x) % 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper, but the way we compute it is (y - x) mod 12. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the case of the permutation (x, y, z), the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod 12, and between y and z is (z - y) mod 12. But for the problem's definition, the distance between x and y is considered as the number of semitones from x to y. So in the major case, the distance between x and y must be exactly 4, and between y and z exactly 3. So regardless of the order of the notes, the code checks for those distances.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the permutation is (y, x, z), then the distance between y and x would be (x - y) mod 12. Which may not be 4. So the code has to check all permutations.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check if the first two elements have a distance of 4, and the next two have 3. Or for the minor case, first two have 3, next two have 4.\n\nSo, code-wise, for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 == 4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nSo, the code needs to check for each permutation.\n\nNow, for the three notes, the permutations can be generated with itertools.permutations.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, convert each note to index.\n\nBut first, need to create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nOnce the three indices are obtained, say, as a list [a, b, c], then generate all permutations of this list.\n\nFor each perm in itertools.permutations([a, b, c]):\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nOnce any of the permutations meet the condition, return the result.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck all permutations. For each permutation, check if it meets major or minor conditions. Once any permutation meets major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nThen:\n\nnotes_input = input().split()\n\nThen, convert each note to index. For example:\n\ntry:\n\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes_input]\n\nexcept KeyError:\n\n    # but the problem says that the input is valid, so no need to handle that.\n\nOnce the indices are obtained, generate all permutations.\n\nThen, for each permutation:\n\nx, y, z = perm\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\n    exit\n\nelif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\n    exit\n\nOnce all permutations are checked, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, and for each permutation, we check both possibilities (major and minor), the code can proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nBut wait, note that the note names may have '#' in them. For example, 'C#' and 'D#', etc. So the keys in the dictionary must match exactly. So the code must have entries for 'C#', 'D#', 'F#', 'G#', 'B', 'H', etc.\n\nNow, the code for the note_to_index:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G' → indices 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations:\n\n(0,4,7): d1 = 4-0=4 mod12=4, d2=7-4=3 → major. So returns 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: 'C# B F' → C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. Let's look for a permutation where the first two have distance 3 and next two have 4. For example, permutation (10, 1, 5):\n\nd1 = 1 - 10 = -9 mod 12 is 3. d2 is 5 -1 =4 mod12 is 4. So this is minor. So returns 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H' → A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Let's check all permutations.\n\nFor example:\n\npermutation (9, 10, 11):\n\nd1 = 1 → 10-9=1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nd2 = 1 → 11-10=1.\n\nOther permutations:\n\n(9,11,10): d1 = 11-9=2 mod12=2. d2=10-11= -1 mod12= 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 9, 11): d1 is 9-10 = -1 mod12= 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 11, 9): d1 is 11-10=1. d2 is 9-11= -2 mod12= 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 9, 10): d1 is 9-11 = -2 mod12= 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 10, 9): d1 is 10-11 = -1 mod12= 11. d2 is 9-10 = -1 mod12= 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each permutation, we have to check both possibilities. So, for each permutation, check if it's a major or minor.\n\nOnce any of them is found, return the answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. Alternatively, after finding a condition, we can break and return.\n\nBut for code, using sys.exit, but perhaps in code, after printing, we can return. But in Python, the code can use return, but since it's a script, perhaps the code can use break after finding the condition.\n\nBut in the code, once any permutation meets the condition, we can print and exit.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use sys.exit(), but for that, we need to import sys. Alternatively, after checking, we can return.\n\nBut in a script, perhaps the code can use:\n\nOnce any of the conditions is met, print and exit.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note appears multiple times? For example, if the input is three same notes. But the problem says that the input is a chord, which is a set of three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but they could be same? Well, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, but perhaps the code can handle it.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. For example, if all three are same, then all permutations would have d1 = 0 and d2 = 0. So, no match, output 'strange'.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G' → code will generate permutations. One of them is (0,4,7) which gives d1=4, d2=3 → 'major' is printed.\n\nSample Input 2: 'C# B F' → indices are 1, 10, 5. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) mod12 is 4. So it's minor.\n\nSample Input 3: 'A B H' → indices 9, 10, 11. All permutations checked, none meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about other cases?\n\nTest case: 'C# B F' → the code would process as in the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'B C# F' → same as the second sample input. The code would check permutations. For example, the permutation (10, 1, 5) is present, and the code would detect minor.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'. Let's see. C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8. Let's check permutations.\n\nFor permutation (0,4,8):\n\nd1 is 4-0=4. d2 is 8-4=4. So d1=4, d2=4. Not major or minor.\n\nAnother permutation (0,8,4): d1 is 8-0=8 mod12=8. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation (4,0,8): d1 is 0-4= -4 mod12= 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation (4,8,0): d1=8-4=4. d2=0-8= -8 mod12=4. So d1=4, d2=4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (8,0,4): d1=0-8= -8 mod12=4. d2=4-0=4. So d1=4, d2=4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (8,4,0): d1=4-8= -4 mod12=8. No. So this is a strange chord.\n\nThus, output is strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G#'. Let's see. C# is 1, E is 4, G# is 8. Check permutations.\n\nTake permutation (1,4,8): d1=3, d2=4. So that's minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nYes. Because (1,4,8) → d1 is 3 (4-1=3), d2 is 4 (8-4=4). So minor.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses itertools.permutations, which for three elements generates all 6 permutations. So that's manageable.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same note is present twice? For example, input is ['C', 'C', 'E'].\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a chord, but the problem allows that? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes, but they can be same? Well, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But according to the code, if the same note is present, then for example, in a permutation (C, C, E), d1 is 0, which is not 3 or 4, etc. So the code would output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem's definition, a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. But perhaps the input can have duplicates, but the code handles it.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code should be written in Python, and read input from stdin. So the code is as written above.\n\nNow, the code needs to import itertools and sys.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nSample input 'C# B F' → output 'minor'.\n\nSample input 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'. As discussed earlier, output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E# G' → but E# is not a valid note. However, the problem says that the input is valid, so the code doesn't have to handle invalid notes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific semitone distance criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each musical note to a numerical index based on their position in the chromatic scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the semitone distances between the first and second note, and between the second and third note. Use modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each musical note to an integer from 0 to 11, representing their position in the chromatic scale.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of three notes, which are then converted to their corresponding indices.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the semitone distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Major/Minor Check**: For each permutation, the distances are checked against the criteria for major (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) and minor triads (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If a match is found, the result is printed immediately and the program exits. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification.",
