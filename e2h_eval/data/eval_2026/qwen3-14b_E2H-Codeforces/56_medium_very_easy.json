Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to determine if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible permutations.\n\nWait, first, the perfect matching requires that R equals B. Oh right, because each base must have exactly one guardian and vice versa. So the first thing to check is if R and B are equal. If they aren't, then immediately output No. Oh right, the problem says that in the input, R and B are given. So for example, in the second example input, it's 2 1, so R is 2, B is 1. So output is No. But in the first example, R and B are both 3.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R == B. If not, return No.\n\nAssuming R == B, then we need to check if there's a way to match each spaceship to a base such that no two line segments cross each other.\n\nNow, how do we check if two line segments cross? Well, given two line segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4), we can check if they intersect. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, that might simplify things. Wait, the note says that no three points are on the same line. So any two line segments can't have overlapping parts except at endpoints, but since all points are unique, the only way two line segments could intersect is if they cross each other in the middle.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says that any two paths (lines) shouldn't intersect. So for a given permutation (matching), all the line segments between the matched pairs must be non-intersecting.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. For each permutation, check if all the line segments between the matched pairs are non-intersecting. If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut since R and B can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments for intersections. For each permutation, there are (R choose 2) pairs of line segments. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, check if they intersect.\n\nBut with 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks, that's 163 million operations. But given that Python is efficient enough for small numbers, perhaps it's manageable. Because 10! is about 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs. Let's see, 3.6 million * 45 is about 162 million operations. But each operation is checking if two line segments intersect. How expensive is that?\n\nBut for the constraints given (R and B up to 10), this approach should be feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read R and B. If they are not equal, output No.\n\nElse:\n\n2. Read the R spaceship coordinates, then read the B base coordinates.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the B bases (since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship). So for each permutation of the bases, we can consider that the i-th spaceship is matched to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nWait, but the spaceships are ordered. So for example, if we have R=3, and the spaceships are S1, S2, S3. Then a permutation of the bases (say B1, B2, B3) would correspond to S1->B1, S2->B2, S3->B3. So the permutations are all possible ways to assign the bases to the spaceships.\n\nBut since the spaceships are in a fixed order, the permutations are over the bases. So for each permutation of the B bases, we can check if the matching between the spaceships and the permuted bases has all non-intersecting lines.\n\nSo for each permutation, we generate the list of line segments between S_i and permuted_base_i, and check that none of them cross.\n\nNow, how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWe need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can use that to our advantage. Because if two line segments share an endpoint, they are not considered as crossing (since the problem says that the paths are straight lines from a base to its assigned spaceship. So if two lines share an endpoint, that's allowed? Wait, but the problem says that any two paths must not intersect. So if two paths share an endpoint, that's allowed? Because the endpoints are the base and spaceship. For example, suppose two lines are connected to the same spaceship, but different bases. Then their paths would meet at the spaceship, but that's allowed? Or is that considered an intersection?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the paths are from a base to its assigned spaceship. So each path is between a spaceship and a base. So two paths can share a common endpoint (like two paths connected to the same spaceship) but that's allowed. However, the problem says that the paths should not intersect. So if two paths share an endpoint, that's not considered an intersection. But if two paths cross each other in the middle, that's not allowed.\n\nSo the function to check whether two line segments intersect must return True only if they cross each other in their interiors, not at endpoints.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWell, the standard line segment intersection algorithm. One approach is to use the orientation method. Let me recall.\n\nThe standard approach for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\n- Check if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. That would imply that the segments cross each other.\n\nBut also, there are cases where one of the endpoints lies on the other segment. However, the problem says that no three points are colinear. Therefore, if two line segments share an endpoint, then that point is part of both segments. But since no three points are colinear, the segments can't have overlapping parts except at endpoints. However, since the problem says that the paths shouldn't intersect, but the endpoints are allowed.\n\nWait, the problem says that the paths shouldn't intersect. So if two paths share an endpoint (i.e., a spaceship is connected to two different bases?), but no, in the perfect matching, each spaceship is connected to exactly one base. So each path is between a unique spaceship and a unique base. So two paths can't share an endpoint. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. Therefore, in the matching, each path is between a unique pair of points. Therefore, two different paths can't share an endpoint. Therefore, when checking for intersections between two line segments (from different pairs), they cannot share endpoints. Therefore, the problem reduces to checking whether two line segments cross each other in their interiors.\n\nTherefore, in our case, when checking two line segments AB and CD, we can safely assume that they don't share any endpoints. Therefore, the condition for intersection is that the two segments cross each other.\n\nSo how to compute that?\n\nThe standard approach is to check if the two segments intersect using the orientation method. The code for that can be found in computational geometry resources.\n\nLet me think about the steps for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\nFirst, check if the orientation of (A, B, C) is different from the orientation of (A, B, D). If they are different, then the line CD crosses the line AB. Then, check if the orientation of (C, D, A) is different from the orientation of (C, D, B). If both conditions are true, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nBut since no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about the case where one of the endpoints lies on the other segment. Because that would require three points being colinear. Which is not allowed.\n\nSo the code for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be written as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nWait, but the sign of the cross product tells us the orientation. So if ccw1 and ccw2 have opposite signs, that means that C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Similarly for the other check. So if both pairs are opposite signs, then the segments cross.\n\nYes. So this function will return True if the segments AB and CD cross each other.\n\nBut wait, what if one of the segments is entirely inside the other? Like, if AB is a longer line and CD is a part of it. But since no three points are colinear, that can't happen. Because if AB and CD are colinear, then the three points A, B, C would be colinear. Which is not allowed. So the problem's input ensures that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the segments can't be colinear. So the above function should work.\n\nSo, with that function, for a given permutation of the bases, we can check all pairs of line segments. For each pair, check if they intersect. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases:\n\n   create the list of line segments between spaceship[i] and permuted_bases[i]\n\n   for all pairs of segments (i,j) where i < j:\n\n      check if they intersect. If any do, break and try next permutation.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read input. For example, the first input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo R=3, B=3. Then R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nSo in code, read R and B. Then read R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nThen, if R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, check if the line segments between spaceship[i] and base_perm[i] have any intersections between any two segments.\n\nBut how to generate permutations of the bases? Since the bases are stored in a list, say bases = [ (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... ].\n\nThen, for each permutation of bases, we can generate all possible orderings. For example, using itertools.permutations(bases).\n\nBut wait, the bases are stored as a list. So for example, in the first example, the bases are [ (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) ] ?\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nThe first line is R and B. Then for 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i+1-th line is the spaceship coordinates. Then the following B lines are the bases.\n\nSo for the first example input:\n\nThe input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the first three lines after R and B are the spaceships: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1). Then the next three lines are the bases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nSo for the first example, the code would generate all permutations of the bases list, which has 3 elements. Each permutation is a possible assignment of bases to spaceships.\n\nSo for each permutation, we check if all pairs of line segments between spaceship i and base in permutation[i] are non-intersecting.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the ccw function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, we can represent points as tuples of integers.\n\nNow, for each permutation, generate all pairs of segments and check for intersections.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Now check all permutations\n    # Generate all permutations of the bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # For each permutation, check all pairs of segments\n        # Create list of segments: rebels[i] to perm[i]\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with rebels[j] and perm[j]\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each permutation, we check all pairs of segments. For each pair (i, j), where i < j, check if the segments (i-th and j-th) intersect. If any of them do, the permutation is invalid.\n\nBut in the code, for each i in range(R), then j in i+1 to R-1. For each pair of segments (i, j), check if they intersect.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, the loop is:\n\nfor i in range(R):\n\n    for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n        check if the i-th and j-th segments intersect.\n\nBut how are the segments defined? For the i-th spaceship, the segment is rebels[i] to perm[i], and for j-th, rebels[j] to perm[j].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, if any of these pairs intersect, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes.\n\nIn the code, when the permutation is the same as the order of the bases, then the segments are:\n\nRebel 0 (0,0) to base (-2,1)\n\nRebel 1 (2,0) to base (0,3)\n\nRebel 2 (3,1) to base (2,2)\n\nCheck if any two segments intersect.\n\nLet me see.\n\nCheck between first and second segments:\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nSegment 2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nDo they intersect?\n\nLet me compute the cross products.\n\nFor AB (A=(0,0), B=(-2,1)), and CD (C=(2,0), D=(0,3)).\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C) = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x is -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y is 0 - 0 = 0? Wait, C is (2,0), so C.y - A.y is 0 - 0 = 0?\n\nWait, A is (0,0), B is (-2,1). C is (2,0), D is (0,3).\n\nccw(A,B,C) = (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nccw(A,B,D) is (-2) * (3 - 0) - 1 * (0 - 0) = (-2)*3 - 0 = -6.\n\nSo ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6. Their product is positive, so the first condition (ccw1 * ccw2 <0) is false. So the segments do not cross.\n\nSimilarly, check for the other pair.\n\nSo in this case, the two segments do not cross.\n\nThen check between first and third segments:\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (-2,1). Segment 3: (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross. Probably not. Similarly for others.\n\nThus, this permutation may be valid.\n\nHence, the code would find this permutation and output Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output No. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=2, but the two possible permutations (base1 and base2) and (base2 and base1). For each, check if the two segments cross.\n\nSo for example, if the two bases are arranged such that the lines cross.\n\nBut the code would check all permutations.\n\nNow, what about the time constraints? For R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 cross product calculations and some checks. But in Python, even with that, for small R and B (up to 10), it's manageable.\n\nBut for R=10, 3.6 million permutations, each with 45 checks. Let's see, 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.62e8 operations. Each operation is a few arithmetic operations. In Python, this may be tight, but given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. However, for the given problem, since it's marked as easy, this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where R=B=1. Then there's only one possible assignment. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2, with two spaceships and two bases. Suppose the two lines cross. Then the code would check both permutations. For example, if the first permutation has lines that cross, but the second permutation doesn't. But for two permutations, the code would check both.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2, and the two lines cross in both permutations. Then output No.\n\nBut how can that happen? Suppose the two spaceships are S1 and S2, and the two bases are B1 and B2. Suppose that connecting S1-B1 and S2-B2 cross, and connecting S1-B2 and S2-B1 also cross. Then output is No.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nBut the code would generate both permutations and check.\n\nNow, what about the code's handling of the permutations? The code uses itertools.permutations, which generates all possible orderings of the bases. So for example, for B=2, the permutations are [(B1, B2), (B2, B1)].\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when we have perm in permutations(bases), but the bases are stored as a list. However, permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the list. But since the bases are unique (as per input constraints), each permutation is unique.\n\nBut what if two bases are in the same position? No, the problem says that no two points coincide. So all bases are unique.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother thing: the code reads the input correctly. For example, the first line is R and B. Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\nNow, the code for reading input. For example, the input is read via input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines(). Then, the lines are processed.\n\nNow, in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as multiple lines. But the sample input is presented as two separate test cases. However, the code is supposed to process one input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the purpose of the problem, is given as a single input. However, the sample shows that the code is given two test cases, but perhaps the actual code is supposed to read from stdin, which is a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first example. But the user provided the sample input as a list of two inputs, but perhaps that's just for the example. For example, in the problem statement, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nOutput: Yes\n\nThe second input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nOutput: No\n\nBut the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for each run, is a single test case. So the code is written to process a single test case. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, possible issues with the code:\n\n- The code uses permutations(bases), but bases is a list of tuples. Since tuples are hashable, permutations should work. However, when generating permutations, if two bases are same (but the problem says no two points coincide), so no problem.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses the same variable names for the points. For example, in the segments_intersect function, A, B are the endpoints of the first segment, C, D of the second.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible error: in the code, the function segments_intersect returns True when the segments cross, and the code checks if any pair of segments cross. If any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, this should solve the problem.\n",

This is done using computational geometry techniques involving cross products to determine the orientation of points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **ccw Function**: This function calculates the counter-clockwise turn from point A to B to C using the cross product. It helps determine the orientation of three points.\n- **segments_intersect Function**: This function checks if two line segments AB and CD intersect by using the cross product to determine if the segments straddle each other.\n- **Main Function**: Reads input values, checks if the number of spaceships and bases are equal, generates permutations of bases, and checks each permutation for intersecting segments. If any permutation is valid (no intersections), it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible assignments using permutations and geometric checks to determine valid non-intersecting paths.",
