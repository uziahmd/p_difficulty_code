There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nLet me think about the examples first. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Maybe the first game is between two players, say 1 and 2. The winner (say 1) then plays against 3. But wait, the rule says that when two players play, their number of previous games must differ by at most one. So in the first game, both have 0 games, so that's okay. Then the winner has 1 game, and the next opponent (player 3) has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's why for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. The note says that the optimal way is to split into two matches first: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has played 2 games. But why can't there be a scenario where the winner plays more? Like, maybe 1 plays 2, then 1 plays 3, then 1 plays 4. But that would require that each time the opponent has a number of games differing by at most one. Let's see:\n\nFirst game: 1 vs 2. Both have 0 games. After that, 1 has 1 game. Next, 1 plays 3. 3 has 0 games. Difference is 1, allowed. Then 1 has 2 games. Now, 4 hasn't played yet. So to play against 4, the difference would be 2-0=2, which is not allowed. So that's why the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given the constraints on how matches are arranged.\n\nHmm. So the question is to model how the matches can be arranged to maximize the number of games for the winner. Let's think recursively. Let's say the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must have a new opponent. The opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to his current number of games, or one less. Because when the winner plays his first game, he has 0 games. Then after winning, he has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. But since the opponent must have won all their previous games, perhaps the structure is similar to a binary tree, but with some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents a player, and each level represents a game. Wait, but the winner's path through the tournament would be a sequence of games. Each time he plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let me think about the structure of the tournament.\n\nThe maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the way the tournament is structured. For example, in order to have the winner play as many games as possible, each time he plays, he needs to face opponents who have as many games as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Because, for the winner to play k games, each time he has to have opponents that are in a certain state. Let me try to model this.\n\nSuppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). We need to find f(n) for a given n.\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as m(k). Then, for each k, m(k) is the minimal number of players needed to allow the winner to play k games. Once we can find m(k), then for a given n, the maximum k such that m(k) ≤ n is the answer.\n\nSo for example, for k=1, the minimal number of players is 2. For k=2, it's 3. For k=3, how much is it? Let's think. To have the winner play 3 games, he must have opponents in each round. Let's think recursively. For the first game, he plays someone. Then, for the second game, he needs to play someone who has either 0 or 1 games. But to get to the third game, he must have played two games. Let's imagine:\n\nIn the first game, he plays against someone (player A). Then, in the second game, he plays against someone else (player B). For player B to be able to play against him, player B must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's say player B has played 0 games. Then, in order for player B to reach the second round, he must have won his previous games. But if he has played 0 games, that means he hasn't played any game before. So, the first game for player B is against the winner. But that's the second game for the winner. But then, for the third game, the winner needs to play against someone who has played either 1 or 2 games. Let's think about the structure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the winner needs to have a sequence of opponents where each opponent is from a subtree that allows them to reach the current round.\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, to have the winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that to have the winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is m(k). How can we find m(k)?\n\nFor the first game, the winner plays against one player. Then, for the second game, the winner must face another player. However, for that player to reach the second round, they must have played one game (since the winner has already played one game). So that player must have come from a subtree where they had to play one game. Similarly, for the third game, the winner has played two games. The opponent must have played either one or two games. But to get to that point, the opponent must have a path that allows them to reach that round. \n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, the minimal number of players required is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Because, in the first step, the winner plays one game. Then, for the next game, the opponent must have played one game (so that the difference is 1). But that opponent must have come from a subtree where they played one game. But to get to that point, the number of players required for that subtree is m(k-1) (the winner's path up to k-1 games?), or maybe m(k-1) is the number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Wait, perhaps I should think of m(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before, and then have an opponent that has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 0) or k-2 games (difference is 1). But to get that opponent, the minimal number of players would be m(k-1) for the opponent's path. Wait, perhaps the recurrence is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Because, for the winner to play k games, he must have played in the first k-1 games, and then face an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 0) or k-2 games (difference is 1). But to get that opponent, the minimal number of players would be m(k-1) + m(k-2). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet's take the example of k=1. Then m(1) is 2. For k=2, the winner has to play two games. The first game is against one player. Then, for the second game, he has to face someone who has played either 0 or 1 games. But to get that someone, let's think: if the opponent has played 0 games, then that's a new player. But then the winner would have played 1 game, and the opponent 0. So the total players is 2 (for first game) + 1 (the new player) = 3. Which is m(2) = 3. For k=3, the winner must have played 3 games. So for the third game, he must face an opponent who has played 2 games (so difference is 1). How can that opponent have played 2 games? That requires that the opponent has a path of 2 games. So the minimal number of players for that opponent is m(2) = 3. But then, the winner's previous games would be m(2) players (since he has to have played two games before facing this opponent). Wait, no. Let me think: the winner's first two games would require that he has faced two opponents, but that's not the case. Wait, for the third game, the winner has already played two games. So the opponent must have played two games (so that the difference is zero) or one game (difference is 1). But if the opponent has played two games, then the minimal players needed for that opponent is m(2) = 3. And the winner's path up to two games would have required m(2) players. Wait, but that would be overlapping. Or maybe the total number of players is m(2) + m(1) ?\n\nWait, here's a better way to think: for the winner to play k games, the first game is against someone. Then, for the second game, he has to face someone who has played 0 or 1 games. But to reach the second game, that someone must have been in a subtree. For example, if the winner plays in the second game against someone who has played 1 game, then that someone must have had a path of 1 game. So the total number of players is the players needed for the winner's path up to k-1 games, plus the players needed for the opponent's path up to k-1 games. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the minimal number of players for the winner to play k games is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). Let's see:\n\nFor k=1, m(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2, m(2) = m(1) + m(0). Wait, but what's m(0)? If k=0, that's the case where the winner hasn't played any games. So m(0) = 1? Because you need one player. So m(2) = m(1)+m(0) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches the example.\n\nFor k=3, m(3) = m(2) + m(1) = 3 + 2 =5. So for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's check that. For example, with 5 players, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet's imagine:\n\nFirst, the winner plays against player 2. Then, he plays against player 3. Then, he plays against player 4. Wait, but how does that work? Let's think of the structure.\n\nAlternatively, the structure is like a Fibonacci tree. For example, the winner's path requires that in each step, the opponent comes from a subtree that requires m(k-1) and m(k-2) players. So the minimal number of players is m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2). With m(0) = 1, m(1) = 2.\n\nLet me check for k=3: m(3) = 3+2=5. So if n is 5, the answer is 3. For n=5, the maximum games is 3.\n\nBut what about n=4? The answer is 2. Because m(3) is 5, which is larger than 4. So the maximum k is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that m(k) ≤ n, where m(k) follows the Fibonacci-like sequence m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2), with m(0)=1, m(1)=2.\n\nWait, let's compute the m(k) sequence:\n\nm(0) = 1\n\nm(1) = 2\n\nm(2) = m(1) + m(0) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nm(3) = m(2) + m(1) = 3 + 2 =5\n\nm(4) = 5 +3=8\n\nm(5)=8+5=13\n\nm(6)=21, etc.\n\nSo for example, when n=3, the answer is 2, since m(2)=3. For n=4, m(3)=5>4, so the answer is 2. For n=5, answer is 3.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum k such that m(k) ≤n. Where m(k) is the sequence defined as above.\n\nSo the approach is to generate this sequence until m(k) exceeds n, then return k-1 or something like that.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to generate the sequence until m(k) exceeds n. For example, for n=1e18, the sequence grows exponentially (like Fibonacci), so the number of steps is around O(log n), which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the sequence m(k) until it exceeds n.\n\n- Find the maximum k such that m(k) ≤n.\n\nBut let's test the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3, output is 2. Which is correct because m(2)=3.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4, output is 2. Because m(2)=3 <=4, m(3)=5>4. So the answer is 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. Let's see:\n\nCompute m(3)=5, m(4)=8, m(5)=13. So for n=10, m(4)=8<=10, m(5)=13>10. So the answer is 4. Wait but according to the sample input, when n=10, the output is 4. Which matches. So yes.\n\nYes! So the sample input for n=10 gives output 4, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem is reduced to finding the maximum k where m(k) ≤n, where m(k) is the sequence starting with m(0)=1, m(1)=2, m(2)=3, etc.\n\nBut how to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can generate the sequence until the value exceeds n. Let's see:\n\nInitialize variables a = 1 (m(0)), b = 2 (m(1)), then for each step, compute next term as a + b. Then, increment the count. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for n=2, the sequence is:\n\na=1 (m(0)), b=2 (m(1)), which is for k=1. Then, next term is 3 (m(2)). For n=2, the maximum k is 1 (since m(1)=2 <=2, m(2)=3>2). So the answer is 1. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nInitialize k=0, current m(k) = 1. Then, while the next term is <=n, we increment k and update the current value.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nprev_prev = 1 (m(0))\n\nprev = 2 (m(1))\n\nk = 1 (since m(1) is 2)\n\nif n is 1, then the answer is 0? But n starts from 2. So for n=2, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, let's think of the algorithm:\n\nWe need to find the maximum k such that m(k) ≤n.\n\nWe can start with k=0, m(k)=1.\n\nThen for each step, compute the next term.\n\nLet me think of the steps for n=3.\n\nInitially, m(0)=1, m(1)=2. Then m(2)=3. So for n=3, the maximum k is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm can be:\n\nInitialize a = 1 (m(0)), b = 2 (m(1)), k=1.\n\nWhile True:\n\n   compute c = a + b.\n\n   if c >n: break.\n\n   else: a = b, b = c, k +=1.\n\nAt the end, the maximum k is the answer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, n=3:\n\nInitially a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=1+2=3 <=3. So a becomes 2, b becomes 3, k becomes 2. Now loop again: compute c=2+3=5>3. Break. So the answer is k=2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2. The initial a=1, b=2, k=1. c=3>2, so break. Answer is k=1.\n\nAnother example: n=5. The steps:\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=3 <=5. a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\nc=2+3=5 <=5. a=3, b=5, k=3. Now compute next c=3+5=8>5. So answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the answer is k.\n\nBut what about n=4? Let's see:\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=3 <=4. a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\nc=2+3=5>4. So answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a = 1 (m(0)), b = 2 (m(1)), k=1 (since m(1) is 2, which is the first possible value for the answer).\n\nThen, while the next term (a + b) is <=n, we do:\n\na = b\n\nb = a + b (or previous a + b?)\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nEach iteration, the next term is a + b. So for example, the first term is m(0) =1, m(1)=2, m(2)=3, m(3)=5, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\na = 1 (m(0))\n\nb = 2 (m(1))\n\nk = 1 (since m(1) is 2, which is the first valid value)\n\nthen:\n\nwhile (a + b) <=n:\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\n    k +=1\n\nreturn k\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=3:\n\nInitially a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nCheck a + b =3 <=3: yes.\n\na becomes 2, b becomes 3. k becomes 2.\n\nNow check a +b = 5>3. So loop ends. Return k=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nInitial a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\na +b=3 <=5 → yes. a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\na +b=5 <=5 → yes. a=3, b=5, k=3.\n\na +b=8>5. So return 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=10.\n\nInitial steps:\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\na +b=3 <=10 → a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\na +b=5 <=10 → a=3, b=5, k=3.\n\na +b=8 <=10 → a=5, b=8, k=4.\n\na +b=13>10 → exit. So return 4. Which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the code would generate the correct k.\n\nBut what about n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n is 1, return 0 (but n ≥2).\n\nElse:\n\nInitialize a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nWhile a + b <=n:\n\n   a, b = b, a + b\n\n   k +=1\n\nreturn k.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? Well, the problem says n is ≥2.\n\nSo for example, for n=2, the initial a=1, b=2. a +b=3>2. So loop doesn't run. return k=1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about n=1? Well, the problem says n is between 2 and 1e18.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nif n ==1: print(0) but n is at least 2.\n\nElse:\n\nInitialize a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nloop:\n\nif a +b <=n:\n\n   a, b = b, a +b\n\n   k +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   break\n\nreturn k.\n\nBut wait, what about when the initial a=1, b=2. For n=2, the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The code returns 2. Correct.\n\nBut let's think about when n is exactly m(k). For example, n=5. The code returns 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is larger than m(k) but less than m(k+1). For example, n=6. m(3)=5, m(4)=8. So for n=6, the maximum k is 3. Which is correct. Because the code would generate:\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\na +b=3 <=6 → a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\na +b=5 <=6 → a=3, b=5, k=3.\n\na +b=8>6 → break. return 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input. Then compute the maximum k as described.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e18, but the loop runs O(log n) times, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor n=2, output is 1.\n\nFor n=3, output is 2.\n\nFor n=4, output is 2.\n\nFor n=10, output is 4. Which matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother example: n=5 → output is 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut let's code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nHandle the case where n is 1? But input constraints say n ≥2.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    a, b = 1, 2\n\n    k = 1\n\n    while a + b <= n:\n\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n        k +=1\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but for n=2, the loop condition is a +b = 3 <=2? No. So loop doesn't run. So k=1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for n=3:\n\na=1, b=2. a +b=3 <=3 → yes. So a becomes 2, b becomes 3. k=2. Then loop again: a +b=5>3. So exit. print 2. Correct.\n\nn=4: same as n=3, but a +b=5>4. So loop runs once, k increases to 2. Then exit. So output 2. Correct.\n\nn=10: the code returns 4. Correct.\n\nSo this code works for the samples.\n\nBut wait, let's check the case where n=5. The code returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=8. The code will generate:\n\nInitially a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nLoop:\n\na +b=3 <=8 → a=2, b=3, k=2.\n\na +b=5 <=8 → a=3, b=5, k=3.\n\na +b=8 <=8 → a=5, b=8, k=4.\n\nNow check a +b = 13>8. So loop ends. So output is 4. Which is correct, since m(4)=8. So the answer is 4.\n\nYes. So for n=8, the answer is 4.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific constraint on the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This leads us to consider a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Sequence Generation**: We generate a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the two previous terms. This sequence helps us determine the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a specific number of games.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the initial values of the sequence, we iteratively compute subsequent terms until the term exceeds the given number of players, `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how far we can go in this sequence without exceeding `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    while a + b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the initial values of the sequence `a = 1` (representing the minimum players needed for 0 games) and `b = 2` (representing the minimum players needed for 1 game).\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We iteratively compute the next term in the sequence by summing the previous two terms. Each iteration increases the count of games `k` that the winner can potentially play.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as the sum of the current terms does not exceed the given number of players `n`. Once the sum exceeds `n`, the loop terminates, and the value of `k` is printed, representing the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method that leverages the properties of a Fibonacci-like sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
