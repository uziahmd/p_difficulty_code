    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, and each ring is the border of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away two cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next one is 2 steps inwards. So for example, the first ring is the outermost border. Then the second ring is 2 cells in from the edge, which would require that the width and height are sufficient. \n\nSo for each ring, the number of cells is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, how do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but the corners are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the corners counted twice) → 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8.\n\nYes. So for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each i, the rectangle must have at least 1 cell in width and height. So for example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each, the resulting width and height must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, let me check. The problem says that k is between 1 and floor( (min(n, m) +1)/4 ), but here n and m are probably w and h. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nk is between 1 and floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but in the input description, the variables are w, h. So maybe the formula is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). But perhaps the problem ensures that for the given k, all the rings are possible. So for example, for the i-th ring, the dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)) must be at least 1. So when i ranges from 1 to k, then for each i, 4*(i-1) must be less than both w and h. But since k is given as allowed, we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring and sum them all.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h = 3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28. For i=2: current_w is 7-4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9-4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*(6) = 12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes zero or negative? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because for the maximum k, min(w, h) must be >= 4*(k-1) + 1. Because for the k-th ring, the min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) must be >=1. Let me see:\n\nThe input constraints state that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me see for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For that case, 4*(1-1) = 0. So current_w and current_h are w and h, which are >=3. So okay.\n\nAnother example: if min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1. For k=1, 4*(1-1)=0. So current_w and current_h are 5 and whatever. For k=2, it would be 4*(2-1) =4. So min(w,h) -4 must be >=1. So 5-4=1, which is okay. So the formula for k is such that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >=1.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line as three integers w, h, k.\n\nCompute total = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. \n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, 1+1-2 is 0, multiplied by 2 is 0. So adding 16+0=16. But what is the actual number of cells?\n\nFor the second ring, the rectangle is 1x1. The perimeter would be 4 cells? Wait, but according to the formula, 2*(1 + 1 - 2) = 0. That's wrong. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait, the formula for perimeter. Let me think again. How to compute the number of cells in the border of a rectangle.\n\nFor a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W cells (top and bottom) and H cells (left and right), but the four corners are counted twice. So subtract 4. So 2W + 2H -4. Which is same as 2*(W + H - 2). So for W=1 and H=1, that gives 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Which is correct? Because the border of a 1x1 rectangle is zero cells. Because the entire rectangle is just one cell, and the border is the perimeter, but there's no cells around it. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut in this case, when the rectangle is 1x1, the ring is zero cells. So for example, if k=2, then the second ring would contribute zero. So in the case of w=5, h=5, k=2, the total would be 16 + 0 = 16. But is that correct?\n\nLet me think. The first ring is the outermost border. For 5x5, the first ring is the perimeter. Which is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Then the second ring is 2 cells inward. So the inner rectangle is 5 - 4*(2-1) = 5-4=1. So 1x1. But the ring is the border of that rectangle. Which is zero cells. So the total is 16. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the input is 5,5,2? According to the problem's constraints, what is the maximum allowed k? Let's compute min(w, h) is 5. So (5 +1)/4 is 6/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not have k=2 for w=5, h=5. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's take the third sample input. For 7 9 2. The first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Second ring is 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then the answer is 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nBut what is the actual cells? For the first ring, it's the outer perimeter. Then the second ring is the perimeter of the 3x3 rectangle. Which is 8 cells. Which is correct. So total 24+8=32.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward. Now, let's implement it.\n\nRead input as w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line. Split into three integers.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nSample code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, what about when k is zero? But according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nEdge cases: For example, when k=1 and w=3, h=3. Which gives 8. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1 and w=4, h=4. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 2*6=12. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when k=2, but the min(w, h) is 5. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So the input would not have k=2. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, progressively moving inward with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost perimeter, the second ring is 2 cells inward from the edge, and so on. Each ring's dimensions decrease by 4 cells in both width and height compared to the previous ring (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of width `w` and height `h`, the perimeter in terms of cells is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while avoiding double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the corresponding inner rectangle and its perimeter, then sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both the original width and height.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required number of gilded cells by leveraging the properties of rectangles and their perimeters, iterating through each ring exactly once. The complexity is linear with respect to `k`, making it efficient given the problem constraints.",
