    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the rectangle it's based on is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but the ring is the border of that rectangle. So for each such rectangle, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) would be calculated as 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter in cells is 2*(w + h) - 4. Wait, because each side contributes. Let me think again. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3. The perimeter cells would be 3*4 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let's compute it as 2*(w + h - 2). For 3x3: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8. So that formula seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. However, we have to make sure that the rectangle is valid. For example, if after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions, the resulting width and height must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's allowed. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions for the rectangle would be valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, calculate 2*(width + height - 2), where width and height are the adjusted dimensions for that ring. Then sum all those values.\n\nWait, let me check the examples. \n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. The first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. So 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So the first ring is perimeter of 7x9. So 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   - compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to the total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because the maximum k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). Let's see. For example, if min(w,h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So for k=1, the first ring is 3x... which is okay. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0, so current_w and current_h are original. For i=2, 4*(1) =4. So if original min(w,h) is 3, then 3-4= -1. But since k is limited, that case is not possible. So the problem ensures that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop for each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nSo that's straightforward. Let's test the examples again.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nSecond ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*(0) = 0? Wait, but that's a 1x1 rectangle. Its perimeter is zero? Because the border of a 1x1 is zero cells. So yes. So for k=2, the total would be 16 + 0 = 16. But according to the input constraints, what's the maximum k here? min(w, h) is 5. So (5+1)/4 = 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the problem would not allow that input. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=7, h=7, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Which would be the answer.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=7, h=9, k=2. Which is the third sample. Which gives 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input: the input is three integers. So read from stdin. For example, input could be given as a single line, like '3 3 1'.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check for i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0. So current_w is w, current_h is h. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3-2) = 8 → correct.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28 → correct.\n\nSample 3: 7 9 2 → first iteration i=1: 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2)=28. i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40 → correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about when k is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: w=4, h=4, k=1. Then 4x4 → perimeter 2*(4+4-2) = 12. So output 12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is essentially the perimeter of a rectangle. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are adjusted by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both the width and height of the original plate. This adjustment accounts for the previous rings placed around the plate.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` can be calculated using the formula `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while avoiding double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the adjusted dimensions of the rectangle and its perimeter. Sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width, height, and number of rings, respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, adjust the width and height of the plate by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. This adjustment ensures that each subsequent ring is placed correctly inward from the previous one.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)` and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and adjusting the dimensions accordingly, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
