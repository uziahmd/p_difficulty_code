Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, right. So, the classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. That must be a clue for an efficient solution.\n\nWait, because if all items had arbitrary weights, the standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be O(nm), which for n=1e5 and m=3e5 would be way too slow. But since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe we can find a way to handle them more efficiently.\n\nLet me think. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, the problem becomes figuring out how many items of each weight to take, considering their total weight doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut how do we combine these choices optimally? Because taking some number of weight 1 items, some of weight 2, and some of weight 3. But since the total weight is limited, we need to find the best combination.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list of costs, and prefix sums.\n- Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken, we can compute how much weight is left and then decide how to take the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. But even that might be too slow if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can process them in a way that allows us to calculate the optimal selection for each possible remaining weight.\n\nAnother idea: Let's first process all items of weight 1, 2, 3. Sort each group by cost descending, then compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nOnce we have those, the problem reduces to selecting x items from weight 1, y items from weight 2, z items from weight 3, such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. And we want to maximize the sum of their costs.\n\nBut how to find x, y, z optimally?\n\nLet me consider that for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can compute the maximum possible for the remaining weight with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that could be O(m) for each possible z. Wait, but what's the maximum possible z? For example, if all items are weight 3, then z can be up to m//3. But m is up to 3e5, so that's 1e5 steps. Then, for each z, we need to compute the best combination of 1 and 2 items with the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items given a certain capacity. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose we have a capacity of W. How to choose x and y such that x + 2y ≤ W. And maximize the sum of the first x items of weight 1 and first y items of weight 2.\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. For each possible number of y (number of weight 2 items), we can take as many weight 1 items as possible. But how to find the optimal combination quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2. Then, for a given capacity W, we can iterate over the possible number of weight 2 items (y) and compute the maximum x = min(W - 2y, len(weight1)), and take the sum of the first y weight2 items plus the first x weight1 items.\n\nBut if W is up to m (say 3e5), then for each z, this approach would take O(W) time, which would be too slow when combined with the O(z) steps.\n\nSo that approach would be O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think: For the weight 1 and 2 items, given a capacity W, what's the optimal way to select them?\n\nWe can think of it as follows: for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), we can take up to (W - 2y) weight 1 items. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, taking as many as possible is optimal.\n\nSo for a given W, the maximum value is max over all possible",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry given a weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3 and a corresponding cost. The solution leverages the limited weight values to efficiently compute the optimal selection of souvenirs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: First, we sort the souvenirs by their weight categories (1, 2, 3) in descending order of their costs. This allows us to use prefix sums to quickly compute the maximum cost for any number of items taken from each category.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Counts of Weight 3 Items**: For each possible count of weight 3 items, we calculate the remaining weight capacity and then determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and weight 2 items that can be carried within this remaining capacity.\n3. **Efficient Combination Check**: For each remaining capacity after accounting for weight 3 items, we iterate over possible counts of weight 2 items and compute the corresponding maximum number of weight 1 items that can be included, using the precomputed prefix sums for quick lookup.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ci = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n\n    # Sort each list in descending order\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n\n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n\n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n\n    max_total = 0\n\n    # Try all possible number of weight 3 items\n    max_z = min(len(w3), m // 3)\n    for z in range(0, max_z + 1):\n        weight_used = z * 3\n        remaining = m - weight_used\n        # Now find best x and y for weight 1 and 2 with remaining\n        max_y = min(len(w2), remaining // 2)\n        # For each possible y, compute x\n        # We can optimize by trying y up to max_y, but since it's O(1) per step\n        # Let's try all possible y\n        # However, to optimize, we can use two pointers approach\n        # But for the constraints here, even O(max_y) is acceptable\n        # Since max_y is up to 1.5e5 and max_z is up to 1e5, total steps would be 1.5e10 which is too big\n        # So we need a better way\n\n        # Alternative: for the remaining weight, find the best combination of weight1 and weight2\n        # Let's think of the following:\n        # For each possible y, the maximum x is min(remaining - 2*y, len(w1))\n        # So the total cost is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(remaining - 2*y, len(w1)) ]\n        # To find the best y in 0 <= y <= max_y\n        # But how to do this efficiently?\n\n        # Here's an optimized approach: for the current remaining weight, we can try all possible y in the range\n        # [max(0, max_y - k), max_y], where k is small, but given the time constraints, maybe just loop through all possible y\n        # However, for large max_y, this could be slow.\n\n        # Alternative approach: for the remaining weight, we can try all possible y up to min(max_y, remaining//2)\n        # and for each y, calculate x as max(0, remaining - 2*y)\n        # Then take the sum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[x]\n\n        # But even with that, for each z, it's O(max_y), which could be 1.5e5 steps, and multiplied by 1e5 steps for z, it's 1.5e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\n        # Wait, but the maximum value of m is 3e5, and for each z, the remaining is up to m. But how can we optimize this part?\n\n        # Here's another idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the best value.\n        # But how? Well, the standard knapsack for 0-1 with weights 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, we can do it more efficiently.\n\n        # Another Idea: For the current remaining weight, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the higher value items.\n        # Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n        # Let me think: for the remaining weight W, we can consider taking some number of weight 2 items (y), and the rest as weight 1 items (x). To maximize the value.\n\n        # Let's find the optimal y such that 2y + x <= W, where x is as much as possible. Since the items are sorted, for a given y, x = min(W - 2y, len(w1)).\n\n        # But how to find the best y efficiently. Since the prefix sums are non-decreasing, perhaps we can binary search on y?\n\n        # Alternatively, for each possible y, the optimal x is fixed. So we can try all possible y in the range [0, max_y], but that's again O(max_y) per z.\n\n        # However, given that the constraints for n and m are tight, perhaps this is manageable with optimizations. Let's proceed with this approach and see.\n\n        # Let's try for each possible y in 0 to max_y, and compute the value.\n\n        # However, given that max_y can be up to 1.5e5, and z up to 1e5, this would be O(1.5e10), which is way too slow. So this approach is not feasible.\n\n        # Therefore, we need a smarter way to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given capacity W.\n\n        # Here's a better idea: For each possible capacity W, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the higher-value items. Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a greedy approach with some adjustments.\n\n        # Let's think of the problem as follows: For a given W, we want to choose x and y such that x + 2y <= W, and the sum of the first x weight 1 items and first y weight 2 items is maximized.\n\n        # Let's consider that for each possible y, the maximum x is min(W - 2y, len(w1)). So the total cost is prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2y, len(w1))].\n\n        # But instead of checking every y, we can note that the optimal y is around W//2. However, this doesn't help directly.\n\n        # Another Idea: For the given W, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, max_y - k), max_y], where k is small, like 300. Because for larger W, the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y. This is a heuristic, but given that the cost is high for the top items, this might work.\n\n        # However, for the purposes of solving this problem, let's think of another approach.\n\n        # Let me think about the fact that the weight 1 and 2 items can be combined optimally by considering the best possible number of weight 2 items and the rest as weight 1.\n\n        # Let's denote the number of weight 2 items as y. For each y, the maximum x is (W - 2y). But since we can't have negative x, we take max(0, ...).\n\n        # However, since the items are sorted, the best y is the one that gives the highest sum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2y, len(w1))].\n\n        # To find this efficiently, we can iterate y from 0 to min(max_y, (W)//2), but that's still O(W) time.\n\n        # Given that the original constraints are tight, perhaps we can optimize by iterating only up to the minimum of max_y and (W//2) plus some small number of steps around it.\n\n        # But given the time, let's proceed with the initial approach, but optimize the inner loop.\n\n        # Let me try to implement the following: for each z, we compute the remaining weight W = m - 3*z. Then, for this W, we try all possible y from 0 to min(max_y, W//2), and for each y, compute x = min(W - 2*y, len(w1)), and get the sum.\n\n        # However, this might be too slow for large cases. So let's proceed with this approach and see.\n\n        # Let me write code for this part.\n\n        max_y = min(len(w2), remaining // 2)\n        # Try all possible y in 0 to max_y\n        # But even for max_y=1e5, and z=1e5, it's 1e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\n        # Wait, but the problem says n can be up to 1e5, but for the weight 2 and 1 items, the length can be up to 1e5. However, for each z, the remaining weight is up to m. So for example, if m is 3e5, and z is 0, then remaining is 3e5, and max_y is 1.5e5. But with z up to 1e5, this is not feasible.\n\n        # So this approach is not efficient enough. Need a better way.\n\n        # Alternative Idea: Precompute for weight 1 and 2 items the best possible value for any capacity up to m. How?\n\n        # Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a dynamic programming approach for this subproblem.\n\n        # Let's define dp[i] as the maximum value achievable with capacity i.\n\n        # However, since the weight is up to 3e5, and n is up to 1e5, this would be O(m) time for each weight group. But combining weight 1 and 2 items would be O(m) time.\n\n        # Let's think of it as follows:\n\n        # For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a DP array for the maximum value achievable with capacity up to m.\n\n        # Initialize dp[0] = 0.\n\n        # For each item in weight 1, we can add it to the dp array.\n\n        # Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\n        # But since we have multiple items of weight 1 and 2, and we can take at most one of each, this is the standard 0-1 knapsack problem. However, with m up to 3e5, this would be O(m * n) which is not feasible.\n\n        # But wait, the items are sorted in descending order. So for weight 1 items, taking as many as possible is optimal. Similarly for weight 2 items. But combining them is tricky.\n\n        # Another Idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the best number of weight 1 items. This is similar to what I thought before, but how to optimize it.\n\n        # Let me think of the following: For a given capacity W, the optimal number of weight 2 items (y) can be determined by trying all possible y up to min(len(w2), W//2), and for each y, compute the maximum number of weight 1 items x = min(W - 2*y, len(w1)), and then take the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[x].\n\n        # But how to reduce the number of y's we check.\n\n        # Since the prefix sums are non-decreasing, the function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))] may have a single peak, so we can use ternary search on y.\n\n        # Ternary search can be applied if the function is unimodal. But is it?\n\n        # Let's think: as y increases, prefix2[y] increases, but the term for x decreases. So the function may first increase and then decrease, making it unimodal.\n\n        # If that's the case, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, max_y], which would take O(log max_y) time per z.\n\n        # This would reduce the complexity to O(max_z * log max_y), which is acceptable.\n\n        # So the plan is:\n\n        # For a given W, perform a ternary search on y in [0, max_y] to find the maximum value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))].\n\n        # Let's implement this approach.\n\n        # Now, how to handle the min(W - 2*y, len(w1))?

So for each y, x_max is the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take.\n\n        # So, for a given W, we can perform ternary search on y between 0 and max_y.\n\n        # Let's implement this.\n\n        # Now, code:\n\n        def get_max_for_W(W):\n            max_y_possible = min(len(w2), W // 2)\n            low = 0\n            high = max_y_possible\n            best = 0\n            # Ternary search\n            while low <= high:\n                mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n                mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n                val1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[min(W - 2*mid1, len(w1))]\n                val2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[min(W - 2*mid2, len(w1))]\n                if val1 < val2:\n                    best = max(best, val2)\n                    low = mid1 + 1\n                else:\n                    best = max(best, val1)\n                    high = mid2 - 1\n            # After ternary search, also check around the boundaries\n            for y in range(max(0, low - 2), min(max_y_possible, low + 2)):\n                current = prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))]\n                best = max(best, current)\n            return best\n\n        # Now, call this function for each z.\n\n        current_W = remaining\n        if current_W < 0:\n            continue\n        current_val = get_max_for_W(current_W)\n        total = prefix3[z] + current_val\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n\n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: The souvenirs are sorted by their weights in descending order of cost. Prefix sums are computed for each weight category to quickly calculate the total cost for any number of items taken from each category.\n2. **Iterating Over Weight 3 Items**: For each possible number of weight 3 items, we calculate the remaining capacity and use a ternary search to find the optimal combination of weight 1 and weight 2 items that can be carried within the remaining capacity.\n3. **Ternary Search**: This technique is used to efficiently find the optimal number of weight 2 items (y) that maximizes the total cost when combined with the maximum number of weight 1 items (x) that fit in the remaining capacity after selecting y weight 2 items.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore the possible combinations of items while leveraging the constraints on the weights to optimize the solution.",

Well, the standard knapsack for 0-1 with weights 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, we can do it more efficiently.\n\n        # Another Idea: For the current remaining weight, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the higher value items.\n        # Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n        # Let me think: for the remaining weight W, we can consider taking some number of weight 2 items (y), and the rest as weight 1 items (x).

So this approach is not feasible.\n\n        # Therefore, we need a smarter way to compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given capacity W.\n\n        # Here's a better idea: For each possible capacity W, the optimal selection is to take as many as possible of the higher-value items. Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a greedy approach with some adjustments.\n\n        # Let's think of the problem as follows: For a given W, we want to choose x and y such that x + 2y <= W, and the sum of the first x weight 1 items and first y weight 2 items is maximized.\n\n        # Let's consider that for each possible y, the maximum x is min(W - 2y, len(w1)). So the total cost is prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2y, len(w1))].\n\n        # But instead of checking every y, we can note that the optimal y is around W//2. However, this doesn't help directly.\n\n        # Another Idea: For the given W, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, max_y - k), max_y], where k is small, like 300. Because for larger W, the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y. This is a heuristic, but given that the cost is high for the top items, this might work.\n\n        # However, for the purposes of solving this problem, let's think of another approach.\n\n        # Let me think about the fact that the weight 1 and 2 items can be combined optimally by considering the best possible number of weight 2 items and the rest as weight 1.\n\n        # Let's denote the number of weight 2 items as y. For each y, the maximum x is (W - 2y). But since we can't have negative x, we take max(0, ...).\n\n        # However, since the items are sorted, the best y is the one that gives the highest sum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2y, len(w1))].\n\n        # To find this efficiently, we can iterate y from 0 to min(max_y, (W)//2), but that's still O(W) time.\n\n        # Given that the original constraints are tight, perhaps we can optimize by iterating only up to the minimum of max_y and (W//2) plus some small number of steps around it.\n\n        # But given the time, let's proceed with the initial approach, but optimize the inner loop.\n\n        # Let me try to implement the following: for each z, we compute the remaining weight W = m - 3*z. Then, for this W, we try all possible y from 0 to min(max_y, W//2), and for each y, compute x = min(W - 2*y, len(w1)), and get the sum.\n\n        # However, this might be too slow for large cases. So let's proceed with this approach and see.\n\n        # Let me write code for this part.\n\n        max_y = min(len(w2), remaining // 2)\n        # Try all possible y in 0 to max_y\n        # But even for max_y=1e5, and z=1e5, it's 1e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\n        # Wait, but the problem says n can be up to 1e5, but for the weight 2 and 1 items, the length can be up to 1e5. However, for each z, the remaining weight is up to m. So for example, if m is 3e5, and z is 0, then remaining is 3e5, and max_y is 1.5e5. But with z up to 1e5, this is not feasible.\n\n        # So this approach is not efficient enough. Need a better way.\n\n        # Alternative Idea: Precompute for weight 1 and 2 items the best possible value for any capacity up to m. How?\n\n        # Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can use a dynamic programming approach for this subproblem.\n\n        # Let's define dp[i] as the maximum value achievable with capacity i.\n\n        # However, since the weight is up to 3e5, and n is up to 1e5, this would be O(m) time for each weight group. But combining weight 1 and 2 items would be O(m) time.\n\n        # Let's think of it as follows:\n\n        # For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a DP array for the maximum value achievable with capacity up to m.\n\n        # Initialize dp[0] = 0.\n\n        # For each item in weight 1, we can add it to the dp array.\n\n        # Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\n        # But since we have multiple items of weight 1 and 2, and we can take at most one of each, this is the standard 0-1 knapsack problem. However, with m up to 3e5, this would be O(m * n) which is not feasible.\n\n        # But wait, the items are sorted in descending order. So for weight 1 items, taking as many as possible is optimal. Similarly for weight 2 items. But combining them is tricky.\n\n        # Another Idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the best number of weight 1 items. This is similar to what I thought before, but how to optimize it.\n\n        # Let me think of the following: For a given capacity W, the optimal number of weight 2 items (y) can be determined by trying all possible y up to min(len(w2), W//2), and for each y, compute the maximum number of weight 1 items x = min(W - 2*y, len(w1)), and then take the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[x].\n\n        # But how to reduce the number of y's we check.\n\n        # Since the prefix sums are non-decreasing, the function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))] may have a single peak, so we can use ternary search on y.\n\n        # Ternary search can be applied if the function is unimodal. But is it?\n\n        # Let's think: as y increases, prefix2[y] increases, but the term for x decreases. So the function may first increase and then decrease, making it unimodal.\n\n        # If that's the case, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, max_y], which would take O(log max_y) time per z.\n\n        # This would reduce the complexity to O(max_z * log max_y), which is acceptable.\n\n        # So the plan is:\n\n        # For a given W, perform a ternary search on y in [0, max_y] to find the maximum value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))].\n\n        # Let's implement this approach.\n\n        # Now, how to handle the min(W - 2*y, len(w1))? Let's define x_max = min(W - 2*y, len(w1)). So for each y, x_max is the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take.\n\n        # So, for a given W, we can perform ternary search on y between 0 and max_y.\n\n        # Let's implement this.\n\n        # Now, code:\n\n        def get_max_for_W(W):\n            max_y_possible = min(len(w2), W // 2)\n            low = 0\n            high = max_y_possible\n            best = 0\n            # Ternary search\n            while low <= high:\n                mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n                mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n                val1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[min(W - 2*mid1, len(w1))]\n                val2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[min(W - 2*mid2, len(w1))]\n                if val1 < val2:\n                    best = max(best, val2)\n                    low = mid1 + 1\n                else:\n                    best = max(best, val1)\n                    high = mid2 - 1\n            # After ternary search, also check around the boundaries\n            for y in range(max(0, low - 2), min(max_y_possible, low + 2)):\n                current = prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(W - 2*y, len(w1))]\n                best = max(best, current)\n            return best\n\n        # Now, call this function for each z.\n\n        current_W = remaining\n        if current_W < 0:\n            continue\n        current_val = get_max_for_W(current_W)\n        total = prefix3[z] + current_val\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n\n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
