A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the goal is to determine how many toasts each friend can make, given certain resources. All friends must make the same number of toasts. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends are making one toast each. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend uses those amounts. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl for their toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices needed per toast is n. And salt per toast is n * np, since each friend uses np grams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each friend needs ...\". So for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, per friend, they need nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend would need t * nl ml. But since there are n friends, the total drink required is n * t * nl? Or wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nLet me rephrase: For each toast, each friend makes one. So for one toast, each of the n friends uses nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. Then, for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. Similarly, for lime slices: each toast requires each friend to have a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams. So total salt is t * n * np.\n\nBut the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts t that can be made is limited by each of these resources. So for each resource, compute the maximum possible t, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl. So maximum t_drink is total_drink // (n * nl). \n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So t_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np. So t_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends. \n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So total toasts from drink is 20 // 9 = 2.222... which is 2. \n\nLimes: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. So 80//3 = 26.666... which is 26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, 3 slices. So for 80 toasts, 3 * 80 = 240 slices. But 10 * 8 is 80 slices. So 80 slices divided by 3 per toast gives 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. Wait what's the problem here?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, 80 slices divided by 3 slices per toast would be 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait why is that?\n\nAh! Oh, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the note. The note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the total drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So per toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl. \n\nIn the first sample, the drink is 20 ml. For each toast, n * nl = 3 * 3 = 9. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. Which is what the note says. \n\nThe limes: total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. Each toast requires n slices (since each friend needs a slice per toast). So per toast, 3 slices. So 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's impossible. Wait why does the note say that?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that's not possible. Let me check the note again. Oh, the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait this is confusing. How does 20 / 3 equal 6? Because 20 / 3 is 6.666... but that's the total number of toasts? Wait maybe the note is considering that each toast requires per friend nl, but perhaps the note is miscalculating? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But according to our previous logic, the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 ml. 20 / 9 = 2.222. But the note says 20 / 3 = 6. So why?\n\nAh! Oh, perhaps I got the problem wrong. Maybe the problem is that each toast requires per friend nl, but for each toast, each friend makes one. So for one toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the note says that 20 / 3 = 6. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. So perhaps the note is considering that the total drink per toast is nl, not n * nl. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So if there are t toasts, each friend will have t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut in the note, the sample input is n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. The note says that it's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if for each toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. So that would mean that nl is 1. But in the input, the nl is 3. \n\nWait the input for the first sample is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So the nl is 3, np is 1. So the note says that the drink is 20ml, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That suggests that for each toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, the total is nl. But that would be if per toast, all friends together use nl ml. But that contradicts the problem statement. \n\nWait perhaps the note is wrong? No, that's unlikely. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me re-examine the note. The note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. \n\nSo how does that calculation happen? 20 divided by 3 equals 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. But why is that the case? \n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the problem is that each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has one toast. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But the note is considering that for each toast, the total drink is nl. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses nl / n ml. That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is considering that the total number of toasts is the total drink divided by (nl per toast per friend). But that would be if each toast is per friend. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast is per friend. Like, each friend can make a certain number of toasts. But the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts. \n\nLet me rephrase the problem. The friends want to make as many toasts as possible, such that each friend makes exactly t toasts. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses some resources. \n\nSo for each friend, for t toasts, they need:\n\n- t * nl milliliters of drink.\n\n- t slices of lime.\n\n- t * np grams of salt.\n\nBut since there are n friends, the total resources needed are:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl \n\nLimes: n * t slices (because each friend uses t slices)\n\nSalt: n * t * np \n\nAh! Because each friend uses t slices. So total slices is n * t. \n\nSo for the first sample, the total drink is 20. \n\nDrink required for t toasts is n * t * nl = 3 * t * 3 = 9t. \n\nSo 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 20 /9 = 2.222 → t=2. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6. So why?\n\nThat suggests that the note is considering that the drink required per toast is nl, not n * nl. Which would be the case if the problem was that per toast, the total drink is nl. But that would be if per toast, all friends together need nl ml. Which would be different than the problem statement. \n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So 6 comes from 20 / 3. Which would be if the total drink is 20, and per toast, the total drink is 3. \n\nSo what's the correct way to model this?\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink is 20, and per toast, the total is 3. So that would be if each toast requires 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. So in this case, the nl is 1. But in the sample input, nl is 3. \n\nThis is very confusing. Let me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. \n\nSo n=3 friends, k=4 bottles, l=5 ml per bottle. So total drink is 4*5=20. \n\nnl is 3, which is the amount per friend per toast. \n\nSo for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So total for one toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. For t toasts, 3 * 3 * t = 9t. \n\nSo 9t <=20 → t=2. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So where is this 6 coming from?\n\nWait the note says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" So 20 divided by 3 is 6.666, which is 6. So why is this 20 divided by 3?\n\nAh! Oh, maybe the problem is that the total drink is divided by the amount per toast per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl. So the total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut the note is calculating 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, giving the maximum number of toasts per friend. But then, since there are n friends, perhaps the total toasts is that value divided by n? \n\nWait, that would be the case if the total drink is divided by (nl * n) to get t. \n\nBut the note says that 20 /3 is 6. So maybe the note is calculating the maximum number of toasts per friend, and then dividing by n? \n\nBut this is getting really confusing. Let's look at the note again. \n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 comes from 20/3. Which is the total drink divided by nl. So that suggests that the total number of toasts per friend is 20 / nl, and then divided by n? \n\nBut how does that fit into the problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires per friend nl. So for each friend, the total drink they need is t * nl. So for all friends, the total is n * t * nl. Which is what I thought earlier. \n\nBut in the note, the 20 /3 =6 is the total number of toasts per friend. Which would be if each friend could make 6 toasts. But since there are 3 friends, the total drink would be 3 *6 *3 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that can't be. \n\nSo clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. To make a toast, each friend needs these. So for each toast, each friend uses these. So if a friend makes t toasts, they need t * nl ml. \n\nBut the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So the number of toasts each friend makes is t. So the total drink required is n * t * nl. \n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, which is 3. So 20/3 =6.666, which is 6. But that would be the maximum number of toasts per friend. Because if each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nBut in that case, the maximum t is (total_drink) / (n * nl). \n\nSo in the first sample, total_drink is 20. n is 3, nl is 3. So 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so t=2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why does the note say that? \n\nAh! Oh, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the note. Let me check the sample explanation again. \n\nThe note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nWait, this is very confusing. According to this, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. So why is that? \n\nMaybe the note is mistaken. Or perhaps the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts that can be made in total, not per friend. \n\nWait, suppose that the total number of toasts is T. Each toast requires each friend to have one. So for T toasts, each friend makes T toasts. So the total drink is n * T * nl. \n\nBut if the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts, then that would be T = 6. Which would require 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that can't be. \n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which would be 6/3 = 2. So perhaps the note is calculating T as 6, and then dividing by n to get per friend toasts. \n\nBut that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is using T as the total number of toasts, and then dividing by n to get per friend. But that would be the case if each toast is made by all friends together. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nThis is really confusing. How can we reconcile the note with the problem statement?\n\nLet me try to think of the sample input and output. \n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Output is 2. \n\nLet's see what the correct calculation should be. \n\nTotal drink: 4 *5 =20. \n\nTotal drink required per toast (per friend): nl =3. \n\nTotal per toast (for all friends): 3 *3 =9. \n\nSo total toasts possible from drink: 20 //9 = 2. \n\nLimes: 10 *8 =80 slices. Each toast requires n slices (3 per toast). So 80//3 = 26. \n\nSalt: p =100. Each toast requires n * np =3 *1=3. 100//3=33. \n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo the note must be wrong. Or perhaps the note is written in a way that is confusing. \n\nBut according to the note's explanation, they said that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts, which would be 6. But according to our calculation, it's 20/(3*3) = 2.222. \n\nSo why does the note say that? \n\nLooking at the note's explanation again: \n\n\"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the note is considering that the total number of toasts is T, and each toast requires per friend nl. So for T toasts, each friend makes T toasts. So total drink is n * T * nl. \n\nBut the note is calculating T_drink as (total_drink) / nl. Which is 20 /3 =6.666. So T_drink is 6. \n\nBut then, since each friend makes T toasts, the total drink is n*T*nl. Which for T=6, would be 3 *6 *3 =54. Which is larger than 20. So that's not possible. \n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3. So why is that? \n\nThis suggests that the note is considering T as the total number of toasts that can be made, but then dividing by the number of friends. Which would be the case if the total toasts is T, and each friend makes T/n toasts. But that would not make sense because T must be divisible by n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong, but the correct approach is the one that gives the sample output. \n\nSo, based on the sample input, the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum number of toasts possible, and take the minimum of those. \n\nSo, for each resource:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So max_toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nLimes: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toast_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np. So max_toast_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is min( max_toast_drink, max_toast_lime, max_toast_salt )\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nmax_toast_drink = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nmax_toast_lime = 80 /3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nmax_toast_salt = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 →33. \n\nmin is 2. Which is correct. \n\nThe note seems to have a mistake in its explanation, but the sample output is correct with this approach. \n\nSo the problem is to calculate the minimum of these three values. \n\nNow, the task is to code this. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nPrint result.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if the toast_lime is 80. But according to the calculation, it's 80//3=26. So why does the note say that?\n\nBecause according to the note's explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the code is wrong. But according to the sample output, the code is correct. \n\nBut according to the note's explanation, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3. Which would be 6/3=2. Which is the correct answer. But why is 6 in there?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the note is calculating the maximum number of toasts per friend, and then dividing by n. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose that the number of toasts per friend is t. Then:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l)/(n * nl)\n\nLimes: n * t ≤ c*d → t ≤ (c*d)/n \n\nSalt: n * t * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np)\n\nThus, the maximum t is the minimum of the three values. \n\nWhich is exactly what we computed earlier. \n\nSo in the first sample, the values are:\n\nt_drink = 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → 2.\n\nt_lime = 80/3 = 26.666 →26.\n\nt_salt = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 →33.\n\nminimum is 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be if t_drink was 6. How is that possible?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is considering that the drink is sufficient for 20 / (nl) = 20/3 = 6.666 toasts. But this would be if each toast requires nl per friend, but the total number of toasts per friend is t. So for one friend, t * nl ≤ total_drink. But that would be the case if there was only one friend. \n\nBut with multiple friends, the total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nSo the note's explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct with our approach. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is to compute the three values as above and take the minimum. \n\nNow, let's test the other sample inputs. \n\nSecond sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10. Total drink is 100 *10 = 1000. \n\nnl=4. \n\ntoast_drink = 1000 / (5 *4) = 1000 /20 =50. \n\nlimes: c=1, d=19. total_slices=19. toast_lime = 19 //5 =3. \n\nsalt: p=90. np=3. toast_salt = 90/(5*3) = 90/15=6. \n\nso min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3. \n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000. \n\nnl=50. \n\ntoast_drink = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000. \n\nlimes: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575 slices. toast_lime = 575//10=57. \n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → toast_salt = 1/(10*1) = 0. \n\nso min(2000, 57, 0) is 0. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo the code works for the samples. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nWe need to read the input line, split into integers, compute the three values, and print the minimum. \n\nBut wait, the input is given as multiple lines? Wait the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait the example shows that the input is given as a list of multiple lines, but the actual input is one line. \n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably the list of test cases. But for the actual program, the input is one line. So the code should read one line from stdin. \n\nBut in the problem description, the sample input is given as multiple lines. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read one line, split into the 8 integers. \n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the line, split into parts. \n\nFor example:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to make sure that division is integer division. \n\nYes, because in Python, using // will do integer division. \n\nBut what if n * nl is zero? Well, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero. \n\nSo this should handle all cases. \n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20. n * nl =3 *3=9. 20//9=2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Constraints**: Calculate the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Toast Limits**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the available quantity:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Find Minimum Limit**: The number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value from the limits calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values are read and parsed into individual variables representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: Compute the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n- **Toast Limits Calculation**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made considering the requirements per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Determination**: The result is the minimum value among the limits calculated for each resource, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraints.",
