    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, all n friends are making one. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible (let's call it t) is limited by each of these resources. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl. So max toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nLime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So max toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but the sample input seems to confirm this. Let's check the first example.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 *3=9 ml. 20//9 is 2 (since 2*9=18, 3*9=27>20). So that gives 2.\n\nLimes: 10 *8=80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices. 80//3 is 26 (since 3*26=78, 3*27=81>80). Wait but the sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, what's the calculation here?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh, because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices. So for the first example, 3 slices per toast. So total slices is 10 *8=80. So 80 / 3 is 26.666..., which floored is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. Wait no, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, it's 80 / 3 = 26.666, so 26. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait, no, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? No, wait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? Wait no, the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the drink allowing 6 toasts? Because the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires per friend 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222... So floor is 2. But in the note, they say 20 /3 =6. Oh wait, that's a mistake. Wait no, perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends has nl. So total per toast is n * nl. So for the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says 20 /3 =6. Which would be if per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, but for one toast, the total is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs nl, but the total per toast is nl. That's not possible. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: ... the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts.\"\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for one toast, all friends are making one toast, so total drink per toast is n * nl. So in the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the total per toast is nl, not n * nl. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait this is a critical point. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. Therefore, total drink per toast is n * nl ml.\n\nBut according to the note, the first sample has 20 ml of drink, and that allows 6 toasts. So 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222. But the note says 20 /3 =6. Which implies that per toast, the total drink is nl, not n * nl. So there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each friend has one toast, so the total is n * nl. But maybe the note is wrong? Or maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct and the problem is different. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 /3 =6 toasts. So the note says that 20 ml can make 6 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires 20/6 = 3.333 ml. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires per friend 3 ml. So for 3 friends, that's 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. 6 toasts would require 54 ml, which is more than 20. So that's impossible. Therefore, the note must have a mistake? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\nAh! Oh! So the question is, how many toasts can each friend make. So for each friend, the number of toasts is t. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each friend, total drink needed is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. For t toasts, total slices needed is n * t. And the total available is c *d.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend, so total per t toasts is n * t * np.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum t such that:\n\nn * t * nl <= k*l (total drink)\n\nn * t <= c*d (total lime slices)\n\nn * t * np <= p (total salt)\n\nSo solving for t in each case:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c*d) // n \n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut in the first sample, let's compute these:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. \n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9. So t_drink is 20 //9 = 2.\n\nt_lime: c*d is 10 *8=80. Divided by n=3. 80//3 is 26. So t_lime is 26.\n\nt_salt: p is 100, n * np is 3 *1 =3. 100//3 is 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2,26,33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is referring to something else. Wait the note says:\n\n\"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\"\n\nWait that's not matching with our calculation. Wait why is the note saying that the drink allows 6 toasts? Because 20 /3 is 6. But according to our calculation, the drink allows 2 toasts. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note. Let me re-read the note again.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. But according to our calculation, the drink allows 2. So why?\n\nAh, I think the note is wrong. Or maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Which would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the note is considering that the total per toast is nl, not per friend. Let me think.\n\nIf the note's calculation is correct, then for the drink, the total per toast is 3 ml (nl). So for 6 toasts, total is 6 *3 =18 ml. Which is within 20. But then, why would that be the case? Because that would imply that each toast requires nl ml for all friends combined, not per friend. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem statement says that each friend needs nl per toast. So if each friend makes t toasts, then each friend uses t * nl ml. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which is what I thought before.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is 20ml, which allows 6 toasts. Which would mean that t is 6. Then n * t * nl = 3 *6 *3 =54 ml, which is way over 20. So that's impossible. Therefore, the note must have an error. But the sample output is 2, which matches our calculation. So the note's explanation must be wrong, but the sample output is correct.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the three values as I did earlier, and take the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nCalculate for each resource the maximum possible t, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nRead the input numbers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_toast_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nmax_toast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min( max_toast_drink, max_toast_lime, max_toast_salt )\n\nThen print result.\n\nLet me check the first sample:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20\n\nn * nl = 3*3=9 → 20//9 = 2.\n\ntotal_lime = 10*8=80 → 80//3 =26.\n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1)= 33. So min(2,26,33) is 2. Correct.\n\nSample output is 2. Which matches.\n\nAnother sample: the second input line is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nLet me parse this as n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\ntotal_drink = 100*10=1000. n * nl =5*4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_lime: 1 *19 =19. divided by n=5 → 19//5=3.\n\nsalt: p=90, divided by (5 *3) =15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1e6.\n\nn * nl is 10 *50 =500. 1e6 //500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_lime: 25 *23=575. divided by 10 → 575//10 =57.\n\nsalt: p=1, divided by (10 *1) =10 → 1//10 =0. So min(2000, 57, 0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process each line, and output the result.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as multiple lines? Or is it one line?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nThe first line says:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably the input for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo the input is one line. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is one line. So for example, in the first sample, the input is a single line with the numbers 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. The output is 2.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of three lines. Probably that's a formatting error. For example, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is the first and only line. So the code should read one line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. But that's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is one line. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but each is a separate input line.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So the code should read one line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, then process as per the variables.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, then n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen calculate the three max_toast values and take min.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime // n \n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min( max_drink, max_lime, max_salt )\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut need to handle division correctly, using integer division (floor division).\n\nBut in Python, using // does floor division. However, when the numbers are positive, it's okay.\n\nNow, test the code with the first sample input.\n\nSample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → output is 3.\n\nThird sample input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → output is 0.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input line, split into variables.\n\nBut what if the input is given as multiple lines? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is one line. So the code can read one line.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, process as per variables.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint( min( max_drink, max_lime, max_salt ) )\n\nWait, but what if n * nl is zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So n >=1, nl >=1. So n * nl >=1. So division is okay.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nBut in the third sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl is 10 * 50 = 500. 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_lime is 25 *23 = 575. divided by 10 → 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n*np =10 *1=10 → 1//10 =0. So min(2000, 57, 0) → 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when any of the resources is zero. But since all inputs are at least 1, the code is safe.\n\nAnother case: when the division is exact.\n\nE.g., n=2, k=1, l=4, nl=2 → total_drink is 4. n * nl =4. 4//4=1. So max_drink is 1.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating how many toasts can be made based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include the number of friends, the number of bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices by multiplying the number of limes by slices per lime.\n   - **Total Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n3. **Toast Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the drink available, considering each toast requires a certain amount of drink per friend.\n   - **Lime Limit**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the lime slices available, considering each toast requires a slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the salt available, considering each toast requires a certain amount of salt per friend.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value of the three calculated limits, as each resource constrains the number of toasts that can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual variables representing the problem parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total available drink, lime slices, and salt are computed.\n- **Toast Limits Calculation**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is determined by dividing the total available resource by the required amount per toast, considering all friends.\n- **Result Determination**: The minimum of the three calculated limits is taken to ensure all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the constraints for each resource and ensures that the solution is optimal and meets all problem requirements.",
