Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X or not. The conditions are that both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. Hmm.\n\nSo first, the input is an n x n grid, where n is odd. The steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check that all the cells on the two diagonals are the same. Wait, but both diagonals must have the same letters? Or each diagonal's letters are same among themselves, but the two diagonals can be different? Wait the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". Oh, so both diagonals must have the same letter. Like, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is also all 'x', then that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, does that mean that all letters on the two diagonals are the same? Like, all the letters in both diagonals are the same. For example, if the main diagonal has all 'a's and the anti-diagonal has all 'a's, then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, then that's not okay. Because the problem says that both diagonals must have all letters the same. So the two diagonals must have the same letter. So the first step is to check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each diagonal has all letters same. Like, for example, the main diagonal is all same letters, and the anti-diagonal is all same letters. But those two could be different. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So the wording suggests that all letters on both diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has all 'a's and the anti-diagonal has all 'a's, then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's, then that's not okay. Because the letters on both diagonals (i.e., all of them) must be the same. So the two diagonals must have the same letter. So the first condition is that all elements on the two diagonals are the same. So for example, for a 3x3 grid, the positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2) — wait no. Wait the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). So for each cell in either of these two diagonals, they must all be the same. So for example, in the sample input where the answer is YES, like the second case:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nLet's see. The main diagonal is (0,0) = 'w', (1,1) = 's', (2,2) = 'w'. Wait that's not same. Wait but the sample output says YES. Wait that's conflicting. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample input includes the case '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', which outputs 'YES'. Let's check that. Let me think:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe main diagonal is (0,0) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,2) = w. So all same. The anti-diagonal is (0,2) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,0) = w. So all same. So both diagonals are same. And the other cells are the ones not on the diagonals. Let's see: for example, (0,1) is s, (1,0) is s, (1,2) is s, (2,1) is s. All of them are s. Which is different from the diagonals (w). So this case satisfies the conditions. So the sample output is YES. So in that case, the two diagonals are same (all w's). So the first condition is that all elements on both diagonals are same. So how do I check that?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Collect all the elements on the two diagon",
