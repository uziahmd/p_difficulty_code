He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nThe challenge is to find all n's that result in exactly m zeros. But how do I find them efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be zero, one, or multiple n's. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of their factorials has exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, but wait: 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1?), yes. So why does that happen? Because when you go from 5 to 6, the count of 5s increases by 1 (since 5 is included once in 5, and 6 adds nothing. Wait, no. Wait, the count for 5 is 1 (5/5=1). For 6, it's still 1. So the count increases when n crosses multiples of 5. But when n is 25, the count increases by 2, because 25 contributes two 5s. So for numbers between 25 and 29, the count would be 6 (floor(25/5) =5, plus floor(25/25)=1, total 6. Then for 26, same. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25, 26, 27, 28, 29?), but maybe not. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the count for 25 is 6 (5 + 1). For 26, same. For 29, same. Then at 30, the count would be 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So the numbers 25-29 have 6 trailing zeros. So for m=6, there are 5 numbers. But for m=5, what happens? Let's see. The count for 24 is 4 + 0 (since 24/5 is 4, 24/25 is 0. So 4. So m=5 would have numbers that have exactly 5 zeros. So for example, 25 is 6. So maybe there's no n where the count is exactly 5. Wait, but maybe for some m, there's no n. Like if m is 5, maybe there's no n. Because when you reach 25, the count jumps from 4 (for 24) to 6 (for 25). So there's no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros. So for such m, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how to find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find for a given m, the possible n's. But how?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. Find the minimum n where the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Then check if the count for low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are multiple n's that give the same count. For example, m=1 has 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, the possible n's are in a range. But how to find that range?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the smallest n where the count of zeros is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where the count is exactly m, and then find the largest n where the count is exactly m. Then the numbers between them would be the answer.\n\nWait, but how to find the range of n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose that for some m, there exists a range of numbers where the count is exactly m. Let's say that the count increases by 1 when n crosses a multiple of 5. But sometimes, when n crosses multiples of higher powers of 5, the count increases by more than 1. So for example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2.\n\nSo for m=5, the count for n=24 is 4, and for n=25 it's 6. So there is no n with exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the key is that for a given m, there may be zero or one or more n's. But how to find if there are any n's, and which ones?\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- First, find the minimal n such that the count of zeros is m. Let's call this n_min.\n\n- Then find the maximal n such that the count is m. Let's call this n_max.\n\n- The numbers from n_min to n_max would be the answer. But how to find these?\n\nBut how to find n_min and n_max?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the count is m.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the count function is non-decreasing. So, for each m, there's a range of n's where the count is exactly m. But the count can jump over m, which would mean that there's no solution.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n   Let's call this lower_n.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\n   Else, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) == m. Then find the largest n where count_zeros(n) == m. The numbers between them are the answer.\n\nBut how to find the largest n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nAlternatively, find the first n where count_zeros(n) == m, and then find the first n where count_zeros(n) == m+1. Then the numbers between the first and the second minus one would be the answer.\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nThe first n where count_zeros(n) is 1 is 5. The first n where count_zeros(n) is 2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) would be the answer. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this start.\n\n- Find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Call this end.\n\n- Then the numbers from start to end-1 are the solutions.\n\nBut how to find these two points?\n\nSo, for example, if there is no n with count_zeros(n) = m, then the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m, find the numbers n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nFirst, find the lower bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m). Then check if count_zeros(lower_bound) is m. If not, then return 0. Otherwise, find the upper bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1). Then the numbers between lower_bound and upper_bound -1 are the valid n's.\n\nSo the number of solutions is upper_bound - lower_bound.\n\nBut how to compute the count_zeros(n) function.\n\nThe count_zeros function is straightforward: for a given n, compute the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nNow, the binary search part. Let's think about how to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least 1, but perhaps more). So for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which gives count_zeros(5) = 1. For m=5, 5*5=25, count_zeros(25) is 6, which is more than 5. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nBut maybe even higher. Well, perhaps 5*m is sufficient for the binary search.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, for a given m, find the lower_n as the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have lower_n, check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, return 0.\n\nElse, find upper_n as the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the answer is the numbers from lower_n to upper_n-1 inclusive.\n\nThe number of such numbers is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo, the code for finding the lower_n (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m) can be done via binary search.\n\nSimilarly for upper_n (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1).\n\nSo, let's think about the binary search function.\n\nWe can write a helper function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut for the binary search, the possible range is from 0 to some high value. Let's say, 5*target. Because for example, for target m, the minimal n is at least m*5, but maybe not. Wait, no. For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. Which is 5*1. For m=2, the minimal n is 10. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). So 5*m is not always the upper bound. For example, when m=6, 5*6=30. But the minimal n is 25 which is less than 30. So perhaps the upper bound can be set to 5*m. Because for any m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >= m is <= 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms contribute more). So the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nSo, the binary search for the minimal n with count_zeros(n) >= target can be done between 0 and 5*target.\n\nBut perhaps even 5*target is too big, but for the constraints of m up to 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code for the binary search would be:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSo, once we find this low, it's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nSo for our problem, for the given m, we first find the minimal n for target m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Else, find the minimal n for target m+1. Then the numbers from the first n to (second n -1) are the answers.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1, find_min_n(1) returns 5. Then find_min_n(2) returns 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute find_min_n(5). Let's see what that returns.\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 (since 24//5=4, 24//25=0. So total 4). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So there are no solutions. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo that's how the code would work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, the input is m >=1.\n\nBut the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo for the given m:\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m: then output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1 are the answers.\n\nThe count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut then, how to handle cases where upper_n is not found? Well, since for m+1, the find_min_n would return the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for example, if m is very large, but there's no n with count_zeros(n) = m, then the code would have already detected that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nNow, code-wise, the code will be:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print 0\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    the answer is [lower_n, upper_n -1]\n\n    the number of elements is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut wait, for example, when m is 6, the lower_n is 25. Then upper_n is find_min_n(7). What's the count_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So upper_n is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So upper_n - lower_n is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code would generate the list from lower_n to upper_n -1 inclusive.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the problem requires that for the input m, we output the count and the list of numbers.\n\nNow, considering that m can be up to 1e5, and the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, the find_min_n function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for some targets, 5*target may not be enough. For example, let's say target is 1, then 5*target is 5. Which is correct. But what about when the target is very large?\n\nWait, for example, target is 1e5. Then 5*target is 5e5. Let's see what count_zeros(5e5) is. Well, 5e5 /5 = 1e5, 5e5 /25 = 2e4, 5e5 /125 = 4e3, etc. The sum is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 800 + ... which is definitely larger than 1e5. So the high is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the minimal n is larger than 5*target. Let me think. Suppose target is 1. The minimal n is 5. 5*target is 5. So that's okay. Suppose target is 2. Minimal n is 10. 5*target is 10. So okay. Suppose target is 3. Minimal n is 15. 5*target is 15. So okay. For target=4, minimal n is 20. 5*target=20. For target=5, minimal n is 25. 5*target=25. So for these cases, the high is correct.\n\nBut for m=6, the minimal n is 25. 5*6=30. So high is 30. So the binary search would find 25.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead m from input. Then:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is a list like ['1', '5'], but the actual input is a single integer m. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps that's just an example of how the input and output are structured. But in reality, the input is a single integer m. Because the problem says \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nSo the code should read m as an integer from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen proceed as discussed.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nThe numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1 inclusive.\n\nSo the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nNow, for example, when m is 5:\n\nlower_n is find_min_n(5) which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. lower_n is find_min_n(6) which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then upper_n is find_min_n(7) which returns 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code:\n\nThen, collect the numbers from lower_n to upper_n-1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nWait, but the output requires that the first line is k, then the numbers in increasing order. So for example, in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut when we do range(lower_n, upper_n), that gives lower_n, lower_n+1, ..., upper_n-1. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive of the upper limit. So for example, range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut when upper_n is 30, range(lower_n, upper_n) is 25 to 29 inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(1) returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nupper_n = find_min_n(2). Let's compute that.\n\nWhat is find_min_n(2)?\n\nThe binary search for target 2.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=10 (5*2=10).\n\nmid = 5. count_zeros(5) is 1 <2. So low becomes 6.\n\nmid is (6+10)/2=8. count_zeros(8) is 1 <2. low becomes 9.\n\nmid is (9+10)/2=9.5 -> 9. count_zeros(9) is 1 <2. low becomes 10. Now low=high=10. return 10.\n\nSo upper_n is 10. So the range is 5 to 10-1=9. So the numbers are 5-9. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nNow, what about m=0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if 5*target is too small? For example, when the target is such that the minimal n is larger than 5*target. Let's think.\n\nSuppose target is 1e5. Let's compute 5*target is 5e5. What is count_zeros(5e5)?\n\ncount_zeros(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... \n\nWhich is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,  let's calculate:\n\nLet me compute:\n\n500000 /5 = 100000\n\n/25: 500000 /25 = 20000\n\n/125: 500000 /125 = 4000\n\n/625: 500000 /625 = 800\n\n/3125: 500000 /3125 = 160\n\n/15625: 500000 /15625 = 32\n\n/78125: 500000 /78125 = 6.4 → 6\n\n/390625: 500000 /390625 = 1.28 → 1\n\nHigher divisions are zero.\n\nTotal sum is 100000 + 20000 = 120000 + 4000 = 124000 + 800 = 124800 + 160 = 124960 + 32 = 124992 +6 = 124998 +1= 124999.\n\nWhich is way larger than 1e5. So the binary search would find the minimal n where the count is >= target. So for target=1e5, the minimal n is somewhere between 0 and 5e5. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother thing to note: when m is very large, but the upper_n is not found. But since the code uses 5*target as high, which for target=m+1 is 5*(m+1), which is sufficient.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, for very large m (like 1e5), the code may take some time, but given that binary search is O(log(5m)) steps, and each step is O(log n) for count_zeros, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, the code must read input from stdin and output the required values.\n\nBut for the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=2. The lower_n is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. upper_n is find_min_n(3). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(14) is 2 (14//5=2, 14//25=0). count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So find_min_n(3) returns 15. So the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Which is 5 numbers. So for m=2, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nRead m as input().strip().\n\nBut the input is a single integer. So:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '1', which is m=1. The output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written as a script. So:\n\nThe code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n    else:\n        print()\n\nWait, but when k is zero? Well, if upper_n is lower_n, then k is zero. But how can that happen? Because when m is such that there's exactly one n (like m=0, but m starts from 1). But for example, if m is such that there's exactly one n, then upper_n is lower_n +1. So k=1.\n\nBut in the code, when k is zero, the code would print 0, but that's already handled in the first condition.\n\nWait, no. The first condition checks if count_zeros(lower_n) is m. If that's true, then upper_n is find_min_n(m+1). So, for example, if m is such that there's exactly one n (say, m=2, but for some reason upper_n is lower_n +1?), then k would be 1. So the code would print 1 and the number.\n\nBut in the code, the 'else' part is executed only when the count_zeros(lower_n) is m. So the code for the else part is safe.\n\nBut when upper_n is lower_n, then k=0, which would mean that there are zero numbers. But how can that happen? For example, if lower_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) is m, and the next n (lower_n +1) has count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then upper_n is lower_n +1. So k is upper_n - lower_n = 1. So the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n-1, which is lower_n. So the code would output 1 and the number.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if upper_n is lower_n? That would imply that find_min_n(m+1) returns lower_n. Which would require that count_zeros(lower_n) >= m+1. But since lower_n is the first n with count_zeros(n) >= m, and count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then find_min_n(m+1) would be >= lower_n. But if count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then for m+1, the find_min_n(m+1) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So if count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then find_min_n(m+1) can't be lower_n, because count_zeros(lower_n) is m < m+1. So the code for find_min_n(m+1) would return a number higher than lower_n.\n\nSo the code for upper_n is always >= lower_n + 1. Thus, k is upper_n - lower_n >= 1.\n\nSo the code can safely print the range.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nOutput is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother sample case: m=6. Output is 5 numbers 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. Output is 5 numbers 10-14.\n\nNow, code for Python.\n\nBut in the code, when k is zero, but the code is in the else block, but that's not possible. Because if count_zeros(lower_n) == m, then upper_n is find_min_n(m+1), which is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and count_zeros(upper_n) is >= m+1. Therefore, the numbers from lower_n to upper_n-1 have count_zeros(n) = m. So upper_n - lower_n is the number of such numbers.\n\nBut what if upper_n is not found? Well, the code for find_min_n is designed to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. So for any target, there is a solution. Because for n=5*target, count_zeros(n) is >= target.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case when k is zero, but that's not possible. So the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=5:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the code prints 0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) == m.\n\nIf not, print 0.\n\nElse, compute upper_n, then print k and the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the else part:\n\nprint(k) followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in Python, when you have to print the numbers, for example, when k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nIn Python, the code:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the code would print 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the first print is k, then the second print is the numbers. So for the sample input, it's correct.\n\nBut when k is zero, the code is not in the else clause. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for `n` that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one trailing zero, and higher powers of 5 (like 25, 125, etc.) contribute more zeros.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`. This helps us determine the lower bound of possible values for `n`.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Range**: After determining the lower bound, we check if it indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid solutions. Otherwise, we find the upper bound by checking the smallest number where the count of trailing zeros exceeds `m`.\n\n4. **Generate Results**: Using the lower and upper bounds, we generate all valid values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n    else:\n        print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the target value. This helps in determining the lower bound of valid values for `n`.\n\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - Read the input value `m`.\n   - Determine the lower bound using `find_min_n(m)`.\n   - Check if this lower bound indeed results in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n   - If valid, determine the upper bound by finding the smallest integer where the trailing zeros exceed `m`.\n   - Output the count of valid integers and the integers themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the valid range of `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
