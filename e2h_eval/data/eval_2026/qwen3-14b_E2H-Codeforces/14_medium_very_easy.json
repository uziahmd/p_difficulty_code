He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5!, the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6!, same as 5! multiplied by 6, which adds no 5s. So the count remains 1. Similarly up to 9. But when you get to 10, you add another 5 (from 10), so the count becomes 2. So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find these n's efficiently.\n\nBut how do we find them? Let's think about the possible values of n. For a given m, there might be 0, 1, 5, etc. numbers. Wait, in the sample, there are 5 numbers. How can that be?\n\nBecause when you have a certain m, the numbers that produce it could be consecutive. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there might be no n's (like if m is 5, but maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros? Or wait, maybe not.)\n\nWait, let's think. For example, m=5. Let's compute for some n:\n\nn=24: 24/5 =4, 24/25=0. Total 4. So not enough. n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is zero. So that's why in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's such that f(n) = m. And if so, how many and which ones.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find the possible n's where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAn approach is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m. But how to find that?\n\nLet me think. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, there can be a range of n's where f(n) = m. However, because of the way the count increases, sometimes there's no such n. For example, when m is between two steps of the function.\n\nSo first, we need to find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Then all numbers between them (inclusive) would be valid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there's either 0 or 5 numbers. Wait, in the sample, m=1 has 5 numbers. But why 5? Because the next step (when adding 5) increases the count by 1. So for example, when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, but not of higher powers, adding 5 numbers (like 5,6,7,8,9) will have the same count.\n\nBut when there's a higher power of 5, like 25, then the count increases by 2. So for example, when n=25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For example, to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest and largest n's where the count is m.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor a given m, first, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between min and max (inclusive) are the solutions. However, how to find min and max.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal n for which f(n) = m is the first occurrence of m. The maximal is the last occurrence. But how to find these.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Well, perhaps using binary search. Because f(n) is non-decreasing.\n\nBut first, the function f(n) can be computed quickly. Let's code that function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for a given m, we need to find all n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the largest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then the numbers from the smallest to the largest would be the answer.\n\nBut how to find those.\n\nBut first, we need to check if there exists any n with count_zeros(n) = m. Because for some m, there may be none.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the lower and upper bounds of n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5, and the maximum is 9. Because count_zeros(5)=1, count_zeros(9)=1, count_zeros(10)=2.\n\nSo how to find the minimal and maximal n.\n\nLet me think of binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if that value is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is found.\n\nSimilarly, find the maximal n where count_zeros(n) <= m. Then check if that value is exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound for the numbers that have exactly m zeros.\n\nLet me think: the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) = m is the first occurrence of m. The maximal is the last occurrence of m.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence.\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, the first occurrence is 5, the last is 9.\n\nSo for the first occurrence, we can find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n. Then check if count_zeros(low_n) is exactly m. If not, then no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) is m. Similarly for the upper bound.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps:\n\nWe can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's say that's x. Then the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m is y. Then the answer is all numbers from x to y inclusive. The count is y - x + 1.\n\nBut how to find x and y.\n\nLet me think of the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. To find that, perhaps find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and check if that value is m. If not, then no solution.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. That can be done via binary search.\n\nSimilarly, find the maximal n where count_zeros(n) <= m. Then check if it's equal to m.\n\nBut perhaps the following approach:\n\nFind the lower bound of n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it low. Then find the upper bound, high. Then the numbers between low and high are the answer.\n\nBut how to find low and high.\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m zeros must satisfy that count_zeros(n) = m. Since count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing, once it exceeds m, all higher n's will have count_zeros(n) > m. So the numbers that have exactly m zeros must be between the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence of m.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nFind the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this left.\n\nFind the largest n where count_zeros(n) = m. Call this right.\n\nIf left doesn't exist (i.e., no n gives m), then output 0.\n\nElse, the answer is the numbers from left to right inclusive.\n\nSo how to find left and right.\n\nTo find left, we can perform a binary search for the first occurrence of m.\n\nBut how to find that. For example, the first occurrence is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that. Let me think. Let's find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this candidate. If count_zeros(candidate) is not equal to m, then there's no solution. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) = m is the first n where count_zeros(n) equals m. So, for example, if the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is x, and count_zeros(x) is m, then x is the first occurrence. But if count_zeros(x) is greater than m, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, but how to find x. For example, let's say m is 5. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But since count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than m=5. Therefore, there's no solution for m=5.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nUse binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this lower.\n\nThen check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, then no solution. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) == m. Which would be lower?\n\nWait, no. Because lower is the first occurrence where count_zeros(n) >= m. So if count_zeros(lower) is m, then lower is the first occurrence of m. But how to find the upper bound.\n\nSimilarly, find the upper bound as the largest n where count_zeros(n) = m. How to find that?\n\nWell, the largest n for which count_zeros(n) = m is the largest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Which is the same as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 minus 1. Because once count_zeros(n) reaches m+1, all numbers after that will have count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the upper bound is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2 is 10. So upper bound is 10-1 =9. Which is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor a given m, find lower = first n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m, then return 0.\n\nelse:\n\nfind upper = first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 - 1.\n\nthen the numbers from lower to upper are the answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute lower = find_first(n where count_zeros(n) >=m).\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute upper = find_first(n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1) -1.\n\nthen the answer is upper - lower +1 numbers, from lower to upper.\n\nBut how to implement find_first(n where count_zeros(n) >=m). That can be done with binary search.\n\nNow, the binary search for find_first.\n\nThe binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe possible range for n can be from 0 to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because 5*m /5 =m, and higher divisions contribute more. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nWait, but for example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct lower bound. For m=5, 5*5=25, which gives count_zeros(25)=6. So the upper bound for binary search can be set as 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even higher. However, for binary search purposes, we can set the upper limit as 5*m. Because for any m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m is less than or equal to 5*m.\n\nWait, for example, m=5. The count_zeros(25) is 6. So 25 is 5*5. So yes, the upper bound of 5*m is acceptable.\n\nSo the binary search for the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) >= m would be between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nSo the code for find_first would be:\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5*m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nOnce we have this, then for the given m, we can compute lower = find_first(m). Then check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, return 0. Else, compute upper = find_first(m+1) -1.\n\nSo for example, when m=1:\n\nlower = find_first(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1 → ok.\n\nupper is find_first(2) -1. find_first(2) is 10. So upper is 9. So numbers from 5 to 9 → 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nfind_first(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output is 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo now, the code structure is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower = find_first(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute upper = find_first(m+1) -1.\n\nthe answer is the list of numbers from lower to upper inclusive.\n\nSo the number of elements is upper - lower +1.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is given as between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_first function.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut in Python, for large m (like 1e5), 5*m is 5e5. Binary search on that is manageable.\n\nBut let's test for m=1e5. What is 5*m? 5e5. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is around 20 steps. Each step computes count_zeros, which is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute lower = find_first(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nupper = find_first(m+1) -1.\n\nthen collect all numbers from lower to upper inclusive.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5. Let's see.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut first, the helper functions.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nThen:\n\nlower = find_first(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper = find_first(m+1) -1\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower, upper+1))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but for example, when m is 5, lower is find_first(5) which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the condition is not met, so output 0.\n\nBut what about when m is 6?\n\nLet's compute for m=6.\n\nfind_first(6) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=25: count_zeros is 6. So the first occurrence is 25. Then upper is find_first(7) -1.\n\nfind_first(7) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 6 (29//5=5, 29//25=1, total 6). count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So find_first(7) returns 30. So upper is 30-1=29.\n\nSo numbers from 25 to 29. Let's check count_zeros(25)=6, 26: same, 27, 28, 29. So 5 numbers. So output would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nBut wait, why? Because for 25, count_zeros is 6. For 29, same. Then 30 adds another 5 (so count_zeros(30) is 7). So yes, the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Output is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1. Output is 5 numbers: 5-9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nNow, code for the problem:\n\nBut the input is a single integer m. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000). The sample input shows ['1', '5'] which probably refers to two test cases, but the actual input is a single line. Wait, the sample input shows that for input '1' the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input '5' the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code needs to read m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list with two elements, but that's perhaps part of the problem's test case description. The actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code should read m as input. For example:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    lower = find_first(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        upper = find_first(m+1) -1\n\n        k = upper - lower +1\n\n        print(k)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper+1))))\n\nBut wait, for the case when upper is lower, then the list is [lower], which is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nBut what if m is 1e5? Let's see, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, the code may take some time, but given that the binary search is O(log(5e5)) steps, and each step is O(log n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut let's test for m=1.\n\nYes, the code would return lower=5, upper=9.\n\nBut when m=1, find_first(1) is 5. find_first(2) is 10. upper is 9. So the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nNow, what about when m is 2?\n\nFor example, find_first(2) is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). Then find_first(3) is 15. So upper is 14. Let's check count_zeros(14) is 2 (14//5=2, 14//25=0. So 2). So numbers from 10 to 14. So 5 numbers again.\n\nWait, 10,11,12,13,14. Yes, five numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. As discussed earlier, returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about when m=24?\n\nLet me think. Let's find the numbers where count_zeros(n) =24.\n\nLet me compute for n=99: count_zeros(99) is 99//5=19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Not enough. n=100: 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24. So lower is 100. Then find_first(25) is ?\n\nLet's compute for m=25. find_first(25) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nn=100: count is 24. n=105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So find_first(25) is 105. Then upper for m=24 is 104. Let's check count_zeros(104) is 24?\n\nYes. 104//5 =20, 104//25=4, 104//125=0. 20+4=24. So upper is 104. So numbers from 100 to 104. So 5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's only one n? For example, when m is 3. Let's see:\n\nWait, m=3.\n\nfind_first(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). Then find_first(4) is 20. So upper is 19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3, 19//25=0). So numbers from 15-19. 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what if m is 24, and the upper is 104. So 100-104 is 5 numbers. So why does this pattern happen?\n\nBecause when you have a normal case where the count increases by 1, the numbers between the first occurrence and the next step (which increases by 1) is 5 numbers. But when there is a jump of more than 1, like when you hit a multiple of 25, then the count increases by 2, so there's a gap.\n\nLike for m=5. The code returns 0. Because the first occurrence for m=5 is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). So the code returns 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code for Python:\n\nBut when the code prints the numbers, for example, when the numbers are from lower to upper, which could be a lot. For example, when m=1, the code outputs 5 numbers. For m=2, 5 numbers, etc. But for cases where there's no solution, it outputs 0.\n\nNow, let's code this. Also, note that when upper is lower, the code will output 1 number.\n\nBut what if m is such that the upper is lower?\n\nFor example, m=6. Suppose that find_first(6) is 25, and find_first(7) is 30. Then upper is 29. So numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the upper is lower?\n\nWait, that's not possible. Because find_first(m) returns the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) >=m. Then find_first(m+1) returns the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) >=m+1. So the upper is find_first(m+1) -1. So if the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 at the next step, then the upper is find_first(m+1) -1, which is the last n where count_zeros(n) is m.\n\nBut in the case where the count_zeros increases by more than 1, like when m is 5, then find_first(5) is 25, which has count_zeros(25)=6. So the code returns 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code for main() would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_first(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper = find_first(m+1) -1\n        k = upper - lower +1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper+1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. But the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. However, when the code prints the numbers, the 'range(lower, upper+1)' would be 5 to 9 inclusive. So range(5, 9+1) is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are more than 5? For example, if m is such that there are 5 numbers, but in some other cases?\n\nWait, in all cases, the code returns the correct numbers. So the code should work.\n\nBut let's check the case where m is 0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. Let's see if the code can handle that. Well, the code uses 5*m as high. For m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search for that is feasible.\n\nBut what if the find_first(m) returns a value where count_zeros is m. For example, m=1e5. Let's assume that there are numbers for that. Then the code will generate the numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1 → output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. Output is 5 numbers: 25-29.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 24, which we discussed earlier. The code returns 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: To find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n3. **Range Determination**: For a given $ m $, we determine the smallest $ n $ (lower bound) where the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $. If this value does not yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, there are no valid $ n $. Otherwise, we find the upper bound by checking the next increment in trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_first(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper = find_first(m + 1) - 1\n        k = upper - lower + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_first Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. This helps in determining the lower bound of valid $ n $ values.\n3. **Main Function**: Reads the input $ m $, determines the valid range of $ n $ values using the helper functions, and prints the count and the values of $ n $ in increasing order. If no valid $ n $ exists, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
