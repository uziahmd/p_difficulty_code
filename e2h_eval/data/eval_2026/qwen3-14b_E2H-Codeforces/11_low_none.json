A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for each toast, all n friends are having one. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n. And salt per toast is n * np.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend has their own portion. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. The total lime slices needed is n (each friend gets one slice). The total salt needed is n * np.\n\nSo the problem is to find how many toasts (let's call it t) can be made such that:\n\nt * (n * nl) <= total_drink_available\n\nt * n <= total_lime_slices_available\n\nt * (n * np) <= total_salt_available\n\nAnd then the answer is the minimum of the possible t's from each constraint.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l. Then the maximum possible toasts based on drink is total_drink // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\nWait, but if total_drink is divided by (n * nl) per toast. For example, if total_drink is 20, n=3, nl=3. Then per toast, 3*3=9. 20//9 is 2, which gives 2 toasts. Which matches the first example.\n\nYes. So for the drink, the max toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nThen for the lime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max toasts is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max toasts is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 is 2. So that's 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Divided by n=3 per toast. 80//3 is 26. But wait, in the example explanation, they said that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, but according to the calculation, the total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. Each toast requires 3 slices (since n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666..., which would be 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh, that's conflicting. Wait what's wrong here?\n\nWait no. Wait the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait why?\n\nAh, wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait, but that's not correct. Because the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the",
