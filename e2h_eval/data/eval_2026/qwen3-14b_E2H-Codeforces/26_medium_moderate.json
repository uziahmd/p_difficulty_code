    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the other conditions (like x + z > y) are automatically satisfied since z ≥ y and x ≥ 0, so x + z will definitely be larger than y. Similarly, y + z will be larger than x. So the only condition we need to check is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C, then x ≤ y. Also, since y ≤ C ≤ z, then y ≤ z. So the ordering x ≤ y ≤ z is maintained.\n\nWait, but the problem says that x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So x can be up to B, and y is between B and C, and z between C and D. So the constraints are:\n\nx ranges from A to B (inclusive)\ny ranges from B to C (inclusive)\nz ranges from C to D (inclusive)\n\nBut also, the problem states that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So for example, if B is 2, C is 3, then y is between 2 and 3. So for each x, y, z, they are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is at most B, and y is at least B. So x ≤ y. Similarly, y is at most C, and z is at least C. So y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle inequality is x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to count all possible (x, y, z) with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], such that x + y > z.\n\nThe challenge is how to compute this efficiently given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000. So brute-forcing all possible combinations would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow. For example, if all are 5e5, then it's (5e5)^3 operations, which is impossible.\n\nWe need a smarter approach. Let's think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each possible x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must be less than x + y. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are those between C and min(D, x + y - 1). However, there's a catch: if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z's. Otherwise, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nBut even this approach would take O(B * (C - B + 1)) time. Let's see: B can be up to 5e5, and C - B can be up to 5e5. So that's 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations. Which is way too slow. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need to find a way to compute this sum more efficiently. Let's think about how to optimize.\n\nFirst, note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let's think of x and y as variables, but perhaps we can find a way to precompute certain values or find ranges where x + y is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can fix z and find the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, with x ≤ B, y ≥ B, etc. But I'm not sure. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible z in [C, D], find the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z. Then sum over all z. But again, for each z, how do we compute the number of (x, y) pairs?\n\nBut again, if D is up to 5e5, then for each z, we need to compute something. But maybe this approach is better? Let's think.\n\nFor a given z, the condition is x + y > z. Since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, and y ≤ C. So x can be from A to B, and y can be from B to C. Let's think of the possible (x, y) pairs.\n\nBut for each z, the sum over x and y of 1 if x + y > z, else 0. How to compute that?\n\nLet me think of it as for each z, the number of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y > z. Let's denote this as f(z).\n\nThe total answer is sum_{z=C}^D f(z).\n\nNow, how to compute f(z) efficiently.\n\nLet me think: For a fixed z, the condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z - x. Since x is in [A, B], and y is in [B, C].\n\nBut for each x, the minimal y that satisfies y > z - x is max(B, floor(z - x) + 1). Wait, since y must be ≥ B and ≥ (z - x + 1) (since y must be > z - x, which is equivalent to y ≥ z - x + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the number of valid y's is the number of y's in [B, C] that are ≥ (z - x + 1). Let me compute that.\n\nThe lower bound for y is max(B, z - x + 1). The upper bound is C. So if max(B, z - x + 1) > C, then there are zero. Otherwise, the count is C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the count is max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut again, for each z, iterating over all x in [A, B] is O(B) per z, leading to O(D * B) time. Which for D up to 5e5 and B up to 5e5, that's 2.5e11 operations again. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's find for each z, the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y > z. Let's think of x and y as variables in their ranges.\n\nSince x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let's consider that for a fixed z, the minimal value of x + y is A + B (since x is at least A and y is at least B). The maximum value of x + y is B + C (since x is at most B and y is at most C). So for z values less than A + B, all pairs (x, y) will satisfy x + y > z. For z values larger than B + C, no pairs satisfy the condition. For z in between, we need to calculate.\n\nSo for each z, if z < A + B: then all possible (x, y) pairs are valid. The number of pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nIf z > B + C: then no pairs are valid. So contribution is 0.\n\nElse, for z between A + B and B + C, inclusive, we need to compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each z in [A+B, B+C], compute the number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], x + y > z. Then, for the ranges of z outside that, handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the total number of possible (x, y) pairs as total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). For a given z, the number of pairs where x + y > z is equal to total_pairs minus the number of pairs where x + y <= z.\n\nSo, if I can compute the number of pairs (x, y) with x + y <= z, then subtract that from total_pairs to get the required count for f(z).\n\nSo the problem becomes, for a given z, compute the number of (x, y) pairs with x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y ≤ z.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables. Let me fix x, and find the range of y that satisfies y ≤ z - x. Since y must be ≥ B and ≤ C. So for each x, the maximum y allowed is min(C, z - x). But since y must be ≥ B, the valid y's are in [B, min(C, z - x)].\n\nBut if min(C, z -x) < B, then there are no valid y's for this x. Otherwise, the count is min(C, z -x) - B + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the count is max(0, min(C, z - x) - B + 1).\n\nSo the total number of pairs where x + y <= z is sum_{x=A}^B [max(0, min(C, z - x) - B + 1)].\n\nAgain, for each z, this would take O(B) time, which is not feasible for large B and D.\n\nSo we need a way to compute this sum quickly for all z.\n\nLet me think of the sum as follows. Let me denote for a given z, the sum over x in [A, B] of the number of y's for that x.\n\nLet me define for each x, the upper bound of y as s = z - x. So the y's allowed are up to s, but also can't exceed C, and must be ≥ B.\n\nSo for each x, the number of y's is max(0, min(s, C) - B + 1) if min(s, C) >= B, else 0.\n\nSo min(s, C) is the same as min(z - x, C). Let me denote that as t = min(z - x, C).\n\nSo the condition is t >= B. Which implies that z - x >= B → x <= z - B. Also, since t can be C if z -x >= C. So for each x, the condition is whether z - x >= B. That is, x <= z - B.\n\nSo for x in [A, min(B, z - B)], the value of t is min(z -x, C). But for x > z - B, z -x < B, so the count is zero.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts: x such that x <= z - B, and x such that x > z - B. The latter contributes 0.\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], where x_max = min(B, z - B), we have to compute the sum over x of [min(z - x, C) - B + 1].\n\nLet me make substitution: Let me define for x in [A, x_max], the term is min(z -x, C) - B + 1.\n\nLet me split this into two cases based on whether z -x is less than or equal to C.\n\nCase 1: z - x <= C → x >= z - C. Then min(z -x, C) = z -x. So the term is (z -x) - B + 1 = (z - B + 1) - x.\n\nCase 2: z -x > C → x < z - C. Then min(z -x, C) = C. So the term is C - B + 1.\n\nSo for x in [A, x_max], the sum can be split into two regions:\n\nx_low = max(A, z - C) → x_low is the first x where z -x <= C.\n\nx_high = min(x_max, z - C - 1) → x_high is the last x where z -x > C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find for x in [A, x_max], what is the range of x where z - x >= C, i.e., x <= z - C.\n\nSo for x <= z - C → z - x >= C. So for these x, the term is C - B + 1.\n\nFor x > z - C → z -x < C. So term is (z -x) - B + 1.\n\nSo the sum over x in [A, x_max] can be split into two parts:\n\nsum_1: x in [A, x_lower], where x_lower is min(x_max, z - C - 1) ?\n\nWait, let me think again. For x <= z - C → z -x >= C. So for x <= z - C, the term is C - B + 1. For x > z - C, the term is (z - x) - B + 1.\n\nSo the x range for sum_1 is [A, x1], where x1 is min(x_max, z - C).\n\nThen, the x range for sum_2 is [x1 + 1, x_max], where the term is (z - x) - B + 1.\n\nBut x1 can be calculated as min(x_max, z - C). However, if z - C < A, then sum_1 is zero. Similarly, if x_max < z - C, then sum_1 is over x in [A, x_max], and sum_2 is zero.\n\nSo putting this together, for a given z, the sum over x in [A, x_max] is:\n\ncount = (number of x in [A, x1]) * (C - B + 1) + sum_{x=x1+1 to x_max} (z - x - B + 1).\n\nBut how do we compute x1?\n\nx1 = min(x_max, z - C).\n\nBut x_max is min(B, z - B). Because x_max is the maximum x for which x <= z - B. Because for x > z - B, z -x < B, which makes the y's count zero.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nx_max = min(B, z - B)\n\nif x_max < A → then no x in the range, so sum is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nx1 = min(x_max, z - C)\n\nthe first part is the count of x in [A, x1], which is max(0, x1 - A + 1) multiplied by (C - B + 1).\n\nThen, for the second part, the sum from x = x1 + 1 to x_max of (z - B + 1 - x).\n\nWhich is sum_{x = a}^b (k - x), where k = z - B + 1, a = x1 + 1, b = x_max.\n\nThis sum can be rewritten as sum_{x=a}^b (k - x) = sum_{d= (k - b)}^{(k -a)} d} ?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's say the sum is sum_{x=a}^b (k - x) = sum_{x=a}^b ( (k - a) - (x - a) ) ?\n\nAlternatively, note that sum_{x=a}^b (k - x) = (k - a) + (k - (a+1)) + ... + (k - b).\n\nWhich is same as sum_{i= (k - b)}^{(k - a)} i }, but in reverse order. Wait, for example, when x increases from a to b, k - x decreases from k - a to k - b.\n\nSo the sum is equal to sum_{m = (k - b)}^{(k -a)} m }, but the terms are (k - a) + (k - a - 1) + ... + (k - b).\n\nWhich is the same as the sum of integers from (k - b) to (k - a), inclusive. However, since (k - b) could be less than (k - a), but the sum is from lower to higher. So the sum is equal to [ (number of terms) * (first + last) ] / 2.\n\nThe number of terms is (b - a + 1).\n\nThe first term is (k - a), the last term is (k - b).\n\nSo the sum is ( (k - a) + (k - b) ) * (b - a + 1) ) / 2.\n\nWhich simplifies to (2k - a - b) * (b - a + 1) / 2.\n\nBut k is z - B + 1. So substituting:\n\nk = z - B + 1.\n\nSo the sum for the second part is ( (2*(z - B + 1) - a - b ) * (b - a + 1) ) / 2, where a = x1 + 1 and b = x_max.\n\nSo putting all this together, for each z, we can compute the number of (x, y) pairs with x + y <= z.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute f(z) = total_pairs - count.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all z in the range [C, D]?\n\nBut even with this approach, for each z, we need to perform a few calculations. Let's think about the steps required for each z.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each z in [C, D], compute:\n\nif z < A + B → all pairs are valid. So add total_pairs to the answer.\n\nelif z > B + C → no pairs are valid. So add 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute the number of pairs (x, y) with x + y <= z → call it count_le.\n\nthen, the number of valid pairs for this z is total_pairs - count_le.\n\nAdd this to the answer.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute count_le for each z efficiently.\n\nBut for each z, the calculation of count_le is O(1) time, using the above method.\n\nSo the overall time complexity would be O(D - C + 1) * O(1) = O(D) time. Which is acceptable for D up to 5e5.\n\nSo let's proceed to code this approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps to compute count_le for a given z.\n\nFirst, compute x_max = min(B, z - B).\n\nBut z - B is the maximum x such that x <= z - B. Because for x to be such that z -x >= B → x <= z - B.\n\nBut x_max is the maximum x in [A, B] for which x <= z - B. So x_max = min(B, z - B).\n\nIf x_max < A → no x's, so count_le is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute x1 = min(x_max, z - C).\n\nSo x1 is the upper bound for the first part where x <= z - C.\n\nThen, the first part is the number of x in [A, x1], which is max(0, x1 - A + 1) multiplied by (C - B + 1). But only if x1 >= A.\n\nThen, for the second part, a = x1 + 1, b = x_max. If a > b, then this part is zero.\n\nElse, compute the sum as discussed.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\ndef compute_count_le(z):\n\n    total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n\n    # compute count_le\n\n    x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n    if x_max < A:\n\n        return 0\n\n    # Now, x ranges from A to x_max\n\n    z_minus_C = z - C\n\n    x1 = min(x_max, z_minus_C)\n\n    # first part: x from A to x1\n\n    part1_count = max(0, x1 - A + 1)\n\n    part1 = part1_count * (C - B + 1)\n\n    # second part: x from x1 + 1 to x_max\n\n    a = x1 + 1\n\n    b = x_max\n\n    if a > b:\n\n        part2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        k = z - B + 1\n\n        # sum_{x=a}^b (k - x) \n\n        # which is sum from (k - b) to (k - a) ?\n\n        # number of terms is (b - a + 1)\n\n        # first term is k - a, last term is k - b\n\n        # sum = ( (k - a) + (k - b) ) * (b - a + 1) // 2 \n\n        sum_terms = ( ( (k - a) + (k - b) ) * (b - a + 1) ) // 2 \n\n        part2 = sum_terms \n\n    count_le = part1 + part2 \n\n    return count_le \n\nThen, for each z, the number of valid pairs is total_pairs - count_le, but only if z is in the range [A+B, B+C]. Else, handled as before.\n\nSo now, the overall approach is:\n\nCalculate total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n\nans = 0\n\nfor z in [C, D]:\n\n    if z < A + B:\n\n        ans += total_pairs \n\n    elif z > B + C:\n\n        ans += 0 \n\n    else:\n\n        count_le = compute_count_le(z)\n\n        ans += (total_pairs - count_le)\n\nBut wait, the z ranges from C to D. So for each z in that range, we process.\n\nBut what if A + B is larger than B + C? No, because since A ≤ B ≤ C. So A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C. So A + B ≤ B + C. So the range for z where we need to compute count_le is from max(C, A+B) to B + C.\n\nBut since C ≥ B, and A ≤ B, then A + B can be less than or equal to C. For example, if A=1, B=2, C=3. Then A + B = 3 = C. So for z starting from C=3, which is equal to A + B.\n\nBut in any case, the code above handles it.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic correctly.\n\nBut let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ntotal_pairs = (2-1+1) * (3-2+1) = 2 * 2 =4.\n\nFor each z in [3,4].\n\nz=3:\n\nCheck if z is between A+B (1+2=3) and B + C (2+3=5). Yes.\n\nCompute count_le for z=3.\n\nx_max = min(B, z - B) = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\nx_max is 1, which is >= A (1).\n\nz_minus_C = 3 -3 = 0.\n\nx1 = min(1, 0) = 0.\n\nBut x1 is 0, which is less than A (1). So part1_count is max(0, 0 - 1 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0 → part1 = 0.\n\na = 0+1=1, b=1. So a <=b.\n\nk = z - B + 1 = 3 -2 +1 = 2.\n\nsum_terms = ((2 - 1) + (2 - 1 )) * (1 - 1 + 1)/2 → (1 +1) * 1 /2 → 2 * 1 /2 = 1.\n\nSo part2 is 1. count_le is 0 +1 =1. So valid pairs is 4-1=3. So for z=3, add 3.\n\nz=4:\n\nz is between 3 and 5.\n\nx_max = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nz_minus_C =4-3=1.\n\nx1 = min(2, 1) =1.\n\npart1_count = 1 -1 +1 = 1 → multiply by (3-2 +1)= 2 → part1 is 1*2=2.\n\na = 1+1=2, b=2.\n\nk=4 -2 +1 = 3.\n\nsum_terms = (3 -2 + 3 -2) * (2-2 +1)/2 → (1 + 1)*1/2 → 1.\n\npart2 =1. count_le is 2+1=3. valid pairs is 4-3=1. So add 1.\n\nSo total ans is 3 (from z=3) + 1 (from z=4) =4. Which matches the sample. So this seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me see. A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo total_pairs = (2-1+1) * (2-2+1) = 2 *1 = 2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, there are 3 triangles. Wait, but according to this code, how?\n\nWait, let me think again. For this case:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo the constraints are x in [1,2], y in [2,2], z in [2,5]. So y can only be 2. So for each x (1 or 2), y is 2. Then z can be between 2 and 5. But the triangle condition is x + y > z → 1+2>z → z <3. Or 2+2>z → z <4.\n\nSo for x=1, y=2: valid z's are 2 (since z must be >=2 and <3 → z can be 2). So 1 value.\n\nFor x=2, y=2: valid z's are 2,3 (since 2+2>z → z <4 → z can be 2,3. So 2 values. So total 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the sample.\n\nNow according to our code:\n\nFor each z in [2,5].\n\nBut according to the code, the z ranges from C=2 to D=5.\n\nFor each z:\n\nz=2:\n\nCheck if z >= A+B (1+2=3)? No. So z < A+B → add total_pairs (2). But wait, z=2 is less than 3. So the code adds 2. But in reality, for z=2, the condition x + y > z is 1+2>2 → 3>2 → yes. So for z=2, all pairs (x,y) are valid. So the code is correct here.\n\nSimilarly, for z=2, the code adds 2.\n\nz=3: which is >= A+B (3). So compute count_le.\n\nx_max = min(B, z - B) = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) =1.\n\nx_max is 1 >=A=1.\n\nz_minus_C =3-2=1.\n\nx1 = min(1, 1) =1.\n\npart1_count is 1 -1 +1 =1 → multiply by (2-2+1)=1 → part1=1.\n\na=2, b=1 → a >b → part2=0. count_le=1. total_pairs - count_le = 2-1=1. So add 1.\n\nz=3 contributes 1.\n\nz=4: which is between 3 and B + C = 2 + 2 =4.\n\nSo compute count_le.\n\nx_max = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nz_minus_C =4-2=2.\n\nx1 = min(2, 2) =2.\n\npart1_count = 2-1+1=2 → multiply by 1 → 2.\n\na=2+1=3, which is >b=2 → part2=0. count_le=2. total_pairs - count_le = 2-2=0. So add 0.\n\nz=4 contributes 0.\n\nz=5: which is greater than B + C (4). So add 0.\n\nSo total ans is for z=2 (2), z=3 (1), z=4 (0), z=5 (0). Total 2 +1 +0 +0 =3. Which matches the sample. So the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample: input 500000 500000 500000 500000. Output is 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000. So x can be 500000, y can be 500000, z can be 500000. The condition x + y > z → 500000 + 500000 > 500000 → 1e6 > 5e5 → yes. So only one triple. Which is correct.\n\nSo according to code:\n\ntotal_pairs = (500000 - 500000 +1) * (500000 -500000 +1) = 1 *1 =1.\n\nz ranges from C=500000 to D=500000. So only z=5e5.\n\nCheck if z >= A+B (5e5 +5e5= 1e6). But z is 5e5 < 1e6. So code adds total_pairs (1). So answer is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in the code, for each z in [C, D], we have to loop through all of them. However, for D up to 5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, read A, B, C, D from input. Then compute the answer.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers on the first line. But in the sample input, there are three lines, but the user probably provided multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut the actual problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo the input is one line. However, the sample shows multiple lines. Probably, the user is providing multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual code should read one line of input. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as the first line containing four integers. So the code should read one line of input. But the sample input shows multiple lines, perhaps as multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print the output. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases, each with their own input line, and the output is three lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. However, the problem's input format says that the first line contains four integers. But the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line containing four integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is \"1 2 3 4\", and output is 4. But the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So this is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has three lines, each being a separate test case. Therefore, the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nTherefore, in the code, we need to read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process each line as a test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case, but the sample shows multiple test cases. However, in programming competition problems, it's common to have multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\n\"The first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D...\"\n\nWhich implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three lines, each with four integers. The sample output is three lines. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the four integers, and output the result for each.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line:\n\nsplit into A, B, C, D.\n\ncompute the answer for this test case.\n\nprint the answer.\n\nNow, the code for a single test case:\n\nImplement the logic discussed.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nFor a given A, B, C, D:\n\nCompute total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n\nans = 0\n\nfor z in range(C, D+1):\n\n    if z < (A + B):\n\n        ans += total_pairs\n\n    elif z > (B + C):\n\n        pass # add 0\n\n    else:\n\n        # compute count_le for z, then add (total_pairs - count_le)\n\n        # compute count_le as per the function above\n\n        x_max = min(B, z - B)\n\n        if x_max < A:\n\n            count_le = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            z_minus_C = z - C\n\n            x1 = min(x_max, z_minus_C)\n\n            part1_count = max(0, x1 - A + 1)\n\n            part1 = part1_count * (C - B + 1)\n\n            a = x1 + 1\n\n            b = x_max\n\n            if a > b:\n\n                part2 = 0\n\n            else:\n\n                k = z - B + 1\n\n                # sum from a to b of (k - x) \n\n                # which is sum_{x=a}^b (k -x) \n\n                # equals (k -a + k -b) * (b -a + 1) // 2 \n\n                sum_terms = ( ( (k - a) + (k - b) ) * (b - a + 1) ) // 2 \n\n                part2 = sum_terms \n\n            count_le = part1 + part2 \n\n        ans += (total_pairs - count_le)\n\nreturn ans\n\nBut for large D (up to 5e5), looping from C to D is O(D - C + 1) steps. For example, if C=1 and D=5e5, then 5e5 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, even 5e5 steps per test case is manageable",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key constraint for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we focus on the condition $x + y > z$ since $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ are constrained such that $A \\leq x \\leq B$, $B \\leq y \\leq C$, and $C \\leq z \\leq D$.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Directly iterating over all possible combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ would be too slow. Instead, we use mathematical insights to optimize the calculation.\n3. **Range Analysis**: For each possible value of $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, we determine the valid pairs $(x, y)$ such that $x + y > z$. This involves calculating the number of valid pairs using arithmetic properties and ranges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n        ans = 0\n        min_z = C\n        max_z = D\n        for z in range(min_z, max_z + 1):\n            if z < (A + B):\n                ans += total_pairs\n            elif z > (B + C):\n                continue\n            else:\n                x_max = min(B, z - B)\n                if x_max < A:\n                    count_le = 0\n                else:\n                    z_minus_C = z - C\n                    x1 = min(x_max, z_minus_C)\n                    part1_count = max(0, x1 - A + 1)\n                    part1 = part1_count * (C - B + 1)\n                    a = x1 + 1\n                    b = x_max\n                    if a > b:\n                        part2 = 0\n                    else:\n                        k = z - B + 1\n                        sum_terms = (( (k - a) + (k - b) ) * (b - a + 1)) // 2\n                        part2 = sum_terms\n                    count_le = part1 + part2\n                ans += (total_pairs - count_le)\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Total Valid Pairs**: For each test case, we compute the total number of possible $(x, y)$ pairs, which is $(B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1)$.\n3. **Iterating Over $z$**: For each $z$ in the range $[C, D]$, we determine the valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x + y > z$. This involves checking if $z$ is within the valid range for triangle inequality and computing the count of valid pairs efficiently using arithmetic range calculations.\n4. **Efficient Range Calculations**: For each $z$, we split the problem into parts based on the values of $x$ and use arithmetic series properties to quickly compute the number of valid pairs without iterating through all possible values explicitly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently, adhering to the constraints and optimizing the solution using mathematical insights.",
