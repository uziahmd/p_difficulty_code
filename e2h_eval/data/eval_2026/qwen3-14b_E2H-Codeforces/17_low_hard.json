He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The challenge is that we don't know s, but we have to find a possible assignment that's consistent with some s.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's see. The key idea here is that the original string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input gives us all the improper prefixes and suffixes, but mixed up, we need to figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original string s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. Also, there's exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for example, for length 1, there are two strings, which must be the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix) of s. But since there are two of them, maybe they are the same? Or maybe not. Like in the second example where the input has two 'a's for length 1. But the actual string is \"aaa\".\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a possible s that is compatible with the given list of prefixes and suffixes. Once we have that s, we can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original s must have certain properties. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (also of length n-1) must be present in the input. But since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by considering that the longest possible prefix and suffix (of length n-1) must be parts of the original string.\n\nWait, but the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes. So for example, the original string s has exactly one prefix of length n-1, and one suffix of length n-1. But those two might be different. However, in the input, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. So one of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix.\n\nBut how can we find which one is which? Well, the original string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 (call it p) and the suffix of length n-1 (call it s) must satisfy that p + last_char equals s, and first_char + s equals s. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe original string s is of length n. Its prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the original string is equal to the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character. Also, the original string is equal to the first character plus the suffix of length n-1.\n\nSo, if we can find two strings of length n-1 in the input, say A and B, such that A + c = B + d (where c and d are the last characters of A and B?), wait no. Let me think again. Suppose that A is the prefix of length n-1. Then the original string s is A + x, where x is the last character. Also, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is the string A[1..n-2] + x. Similarly, if B is the suffix of length n-1, then B is the string s[1..n-1], which is the original string's suffix. So the original string is the first character (s[0]) followed by B. So combining these two, we have:\n\nOriginal string is A + x, and also s[0] + B.\n\nTherefore, A + x must be equal to s[0] + B. Also, since A is the prefix of length n-1, s[0] is the first character of A. So s[0] = A[0]. Therefore, A + x = A[0] + B. Which implies that A[1..n-2] + x = B. Because A is length n-1, so A[0] is the first character, then the rest is A[1..n-2], and x is the last character. So the original string is A + x, which is A[0] followed by A[1..n-2] + x. But the suffix of length n-1 is B, which is the same as A[1..n-2] + x. So B must be equal to A[1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, mixed in arbitrary order. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix of `s` (both of length `n-1`) must be present in the input. These two strings can help us reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix and suffix, we can determine the original string `s`. This is done by checking which combination of the longest prefix and suffix forms a valid string `s` where the first character of the prefix matches the first character of the suffix.\n3. **Check Validity of All Strings**: Once we have a candidate for `s`, we verify that all given strings are indeed either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    # Try all possible pairs of these two to find the correct s\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Check if they can form a valid s\n            # s should be prefix_candidate + last_char, and also first_char + suffix_candidate\n            # So the first character of prefix_candidate must be the same as the first character of the original s\n            # Also, the suffix_candidate must be the s[1...n-1]\n            # So the original s would be prefix_candidate + (suffix_candidate[-1] if prefix_candidate[-1] != suffix_candidate[-1] else ...)\n            # Wait, better to check if prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate\n            # Because prefix_candidate is of length n-1, so s = prefix_candidate + x, and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = prefix_candidate[1:] + x\n            # Which should equal suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1] == suffix_candidate:\n                s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check if all strings are prefixes or suffixes of s\n                # For each string in the input, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s\n                result = []\n                for st in strings:\n                    if s.startswith(st):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif s.endswith(st):\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This shouldn't happen as per the problem statement\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n    \n    # If not found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    print(''.join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2*n - 2)]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access the longest prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`).\n3. **Finding Valid Combinations**: The algorithm tries all combinations of the two longest strings (of length `n-1`) to determine a potential original string `s`. It checks if these combinations form a valid string `s` where the longest prefix and suffix are consistent.\n4. **Validation**: Once a valid `s` is determined, each input string is checked to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`, and the result is constructed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine a valid configuration of prefixes and suffixes for the unknown string `s`.",
