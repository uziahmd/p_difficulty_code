He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. But how do we figure out which is which?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the input gives. The input has all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s. For example, if the original string is \"ababa\" (like in the first example), then for each length from 1 to n-1 (which is 4 here), there are two strings: one prefix and one suffix. But the problem is that the input gives all these strings mixed up, and we have to assign each as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nThe challenge is to find a way to assign P and S labels such that there exists at least one possible original string s that matches the assignments. Also, note that there might be multiple possibilities, but we can output any valid one.\n\nSo, the key idea is to find the correct original string s, and then check which of the input strings are its prefixes and suffixes. Once we know s, we can match each input string to either P or S.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as its prefixes and suffixes. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present in the input. But since there are exactly two strings of each length, for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. However, the actual original string s must have both of these as its prefix and suffix. Wait, no. Because for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So those two must be present in the input. But how do we find s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original string s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the original string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 are both present in the input. Then, the original string s would be the combination of the prefix of length n-1 and the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the first example. The input includes \"abab\" (length 4) and \"baba\" (length 4). The correct s is \"ababa\". The prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". So the original string is the prefix of length n-1 (abab) plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (the suffix is baba, so last character is a). So combining those gives abab + a = ababa. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the idea is that the original string can be constructed by taking the prefix of length n-1 (let's call it p) and the suffix of length n-1 (call it s). Then, the original string must be p concatenated with the last character of s. But since the original string's suffix of length n-1 is s, then the original string's last character is the last character of s. So, the original string is p + s[-1].\n\nBut how do I find which of the two strings of length n-1 are the prefix and suffix? Because for the original string, the prefix of length n-1 is p, and the suffix of length n-1 is s. So, the original string must be p + s[-1], and also, the suffix of length n-1 of this string must be s. Therefore, the suffix of length n-1 of the constructed string must be s. Let's see:\n\nIf the original string is p + s[-1], then the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters. The length of p is n-1, and adding one character makes the total length n. So the suffix of length n-1 is p[1:] + s[-1], which must equal s. So p[1:] + s[-1] = s. Which implies that s must be equal to p[1:] + s[-1]. But since s is of length n-1, and p is of length n-1, then p[1:] is of length n-2. Adding s[-1] (a single character) gives a length of n-1. So yes.\n\nTherefore, for the two strings of length n-1, say a and b, we can check if a[1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Original String**: The original string `s` can be reconstructed by considering the longest improper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`). By combining these, we can infer the original string.\n2. **Check Validity**: For each pair of strings of length `n-1`, check if they can form the original string. If valid, use this string to determine the correct assignments for all given prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once the original string is identified, iterate through all input strings and classify each as a prefix or suffix based on their presence in the original string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of the two candidates for prefix and suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Construct possible original string\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of possible_s\n            if possible_s[-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n                # Now, this possible_s is valid\n                # Now assign P and S to the input strings\n                result = []\n                for s in strings:\n                    if len(s) == len(possible_s):\n                        continue  # not possible since len(s) is up to n-1\n                    if possible_s.startswith(s):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif possible_s.endswith(s):\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Constructing Original String**: By combining the candidate prefix and the last character of the candidate suffix, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: The constructed string is validated by checking if the candidate suffix matches the suffix of the constructed string.\n5. **Assigning Roles**: Once a valid original string is found, each input string is checked against it to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, resulting in the final output string of 'P' and 'S'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct roles of each input string based on the inferred original string, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
