The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. We need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m and sum them all. The challenge is to find an efficient way to calculate this sum, especially since m can be up to 1e9, which means we can't compute each f(x) individually in O(1) time or something like that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach starting from 0, without ever stepping outside [0, x]. So the frog can make any sequence of jumps as long as all intermediate positions are within [0, x].\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. The frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions? Let's think about the problem in terms of linear combinations. The frog can reach positions that are of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this is only possible if during the process of reaching that position, the frog never goes outside [0, x]. But for the purposes of f(x), we need to know all positions that can be reached with such steps, considering the constraints.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mathematical way to model this. Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because the steps are adding a or subtracting b. So the reachable positions (without constraints) would be all numbers of the form (a*k - b*l) where k and l are non-negative integers. But since a and b are positive integers, their gcd divides any such combination. Therefore, the reachable positions must be multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). However, the constraints here are that the frog cannot go beyond 0 or x during the journey.\n\nBut perhaps for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and lie in [0, x], provided that certain conditions are met. For example, if a and b are coprime, then eventually the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (i.e., any integer) as long as it can reach it through some sequence of steps. But the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x] may prevent that.\n\nWait, but for example, if the frog wants to reach a certain position, say, y, then during the process of getting there, it might have to go beyond x. So even if y is reachable in theory, if the path requires stepping outside [0, x], then it's not counted in f(x).\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model the positions that are reachable under the constraint that all steps are within [0, x]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find for each x, the maximum reachable position, and then determine how many positions are reachable. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at the sample input:\n\nFirst example: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output sum is 19.\n\nIn that case, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5 (by jumping +5 once), and also 5-3=2 (but wait, how does that work? Let's think. Starting at 0, the frog can jump to 5. Then from 5, it can jump to 5-3=2. So 2 is reachable. Then from 2, can it jump to 2+5=7, but x=5, so that's not allowed. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. But then from 2, can it jump to 2-3= -1, which is invalid. So yes, f(5)=3.\n\nBut for x=7, the frog can reach more positions. For example, from 0, it can jump to 5, then to 2, then to 5 again (from 2, adding 5 gives 7, which is allowed because x=7. So 7 is reachable. Then from 7, you can subtract 3 to get 4. Then from 4, add 5 to get 9, which is beyond x=7. So not allowed. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. Then from 1, adding 5 gives 6 (allowed). From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, add 5 gives 8 (invalid). Subtract 3 gives 0. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. So total of 8, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to find, for each x, the number of positions reachable under the constraints, and sum them up from x=0 to x=m.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find an efficient way to compute this sum for very large m (up to 1e9).\n\nLet me think about the conditions when the frog can reach certain positions.\n\nLet me first note that the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d = gcd(a, b). Let me check that. Suppose d is the gcd of a and b. Then, since a and b are multiples of d, any combination of steps will result in a position that is a multiple of d. For example, adding a (which is d * a') or subtracting b (d * b'). So the total change is a multiple of d. So the reachable positions must be multiples of d. Therefore, for any x, f(x) is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut how do we determine which multiples of d are reachable?\n\nAnother observation: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can reach it via some sequence of steps that doesn't go out of bounds. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k+a (if k+a <=x) by jumping forward, and k -b (if k -b >=0) by jumping backward. But this depends on whether those steps are allowed.\n\nBut this seems like a dynamic programming problem, but for x up to 1e9, it's impossible to compute for each x.\n\nAlternative approach: find for each x, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of positions that are multiples of d, and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients that allow the frog to reach them without going out of bounds. However, this seems too vague.\n\nWait, but perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is between 0 and x, provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is sufficiently large, the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x], as long as the minimal steps can be taken. But how to determine when x is large enough?\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the frog can reach any integer that is non-negative and can be written as a combination of a and b steps. But the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x during the process.\n\nBut if x is large enough, say, greater than or equal to (a + b), then maybe the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 here) up to x. But how?\n\nWait, in the classic coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (coprime) is a*b -a -b. But that's for non-negative combinations. However, here the frog can use both +a and -b steps. So perhaps the reachable positions are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0, and can be expressed as (some number of a steps) minus (some number of b steps), but during the process of getting there, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems difficult to model.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0. But how?\n\nFor example, in the sample input, a=5, b=3, d=1. The positions reachable for x=7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which are all numbers from 0 to 7. So for x >=7, the frog can reach all positions. But how?\n\nBut for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. So why can't it reach 1, 3, 4?\n\nBecause to reach those positions, the frog would have to take some steps that would require going beyond x during the process.\n\nBut perhaps for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and between 0 and x. Let's assume that. Then, for x >= some value, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. But how to find that value?\n\nBut how to find the threshold after which all multiples of d up to x are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0, provided that x is at least (some value). For example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then by adding a steps, it can reach higher positions. Similarly, by subtracting b steps, it can reach lower positions, but only if they are within [0, x].\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and which is between 0 and x, as long as there exists some way to reach it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a BFS, but for x up to 1e9, that's impossible. So we need a mathematical formula.\n\nAnother thought: since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but can't go below 0 or above x. Let's consider that the frog can reach a position y if and only if y is a multiple of d, and there exists some k and l such that y = k*a - l*b, and during the process of moving from 0 to y, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, this seems too abstract.\n\nWait, but what if we ignore the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x], and just consider the positions reachable in general. Then, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be written as y = a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this is the same as y = a*k + b*m, where m is a non-negative integer (since subtracting b*l is equivalent to adding (-l)*b, but m can be negative. Wait, no. Wait, the frog can perform any sequence of steps, which can be represented as a series of +a and -b steps. So the total displacement is (number of +a steps) * a - (number of -b steps)*b. Let me denote the number of +a steps as k and the number of -b steps as l. So the displacement is k*a - l*b. So the total position is 0 + (k*a - l*b) = k*a - l*b. However, the problem is that during the process of making these steps, the frog might have gone outside [0, x], which would disqualify that position from being counted in f(x).\n\nBut perhaps for large enough x, the frog can reach any multiple of d that is between 0 and x. For example, once x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions up to x by adding a steps and subtracting b steps as needed.\n\nLet me think of the case when a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is non-negative, provided that x is large enough. For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can add a steps to reach higher positions. But how to ensure that during the addition steps, it doesn't go beyond x.\n\nBut if x is large enough, say, x is larger than the maximum of a and b, then the frog can reach all positions up to x. For example, if the frog can reach position y, then it can reach y + a, provided that y + a <= x. So if x is sufficiently large, then the frog can reach all positions from some starting point upwards.\n\nBut how to find that starting point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be divided into two parts:\n\n1. For x < some threshold, compute f(x) directly (maybe via BFS or some other method).\n2. For x >= threshold, compute f(x) using a formula.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we need the threshold to be small enough so that for x >= threshold, we can compute f(x) quickly.\n\nLet me think about the threshold. For example, the maximum number of steps that the frog needs to reach any position. Maybe the threshold is a + b, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is between 0 and x, provided that x >= some value. Let's assume that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, the sum can be split into two parts: the sum for x less than some value (computed with BFS), and the sum for x >= that value (computed with a formula).\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of 1 (i.e., any integer) once x is large enough. What is the minimal x for which this is true?\n\nWell, suppose that the frog can reach any position y >= some value. For example, once the frog can reach a and b, then it can reach any number beyond that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem resembles the classic problem of finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But in our case, the coefficients can be negative, but the steps are constrained to not go out of bounds.\n\nThis seems too different.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0. However, during the process of reaching it, the frog may have to go beyond x. So for a given x, the reachable positions are those multiples of d that can be expressed as y = k*a - l*b, and there exists a path from 0 to y where all intermediate positions are within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. The frog can reach 0. From there, it can jump to a (if a <=x) or to -b (which is invalid, so not allowed). So for x >=a, the frog can reach a. From a, it can jump to a +a = 2a (if <=x), or a -b (if >=0). And so on.\n\nBut this seems like a BFS approach. However, for large x, this is not feasible.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, perhaps we can find for each possible x the reachable positions using some mathematical properties.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to compute the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x). So maybe we can find a way to compute for each x, the value of f(x), based on the reachable positions up to x.\n\nAnother observation: the frog can only move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. However, the backward steps are only allowed if the current position is >=b. So the frog can reach positions that are in the range [0, x], and the ability to reach a position depends on whether there's a path that allows it without stepping out of bounds.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions. For any x, the set of reachable positions is the set of positions that can be reached via some sequence of jumps, with all intermediate positions in [0, x]. So, for example, if the frog can reach position y, then it can reach y +a (if y +a <=x), and y -b (if y -b >=0).\n\nThis looks like a BFS problem where the nodes are positions in [0, x], and edges are the allowed jumps. However, since x can be up to 1e9, we can't perform this BFS for each x.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern to the reachable positions. For example, once x is large enough, the reachable positions are all multiples of d in [0, x], and the number of such positions is floor(x/d) + 1. If that's the case, then the sum can be computed as follows:\n\nFor x >= T (some threshold), f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < T, we need to compute f(x) separately.\n\nThe key is to find T and compute the sum for x < T, and then compute the sum for x >= T.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet me think about the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. For example, in the first sample, when x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. So T for that case would be 7.\n\nBut how to find T in general?\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d. Once x reaches a certain value, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, once the frog can reach all positions from some value onwards. For example, the classic problem says that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of a and b is a*b -a -b. But since in our case, the frog can use both +a and -b steps, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers >= (something) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any number >=0 once x is large enough. For example, if x is large enough that the frog can reach any position by adding a steps and subtracting b steps as needed. So for example, if x is >= a, then the frog can reach a, and from there, reach a +a = 2a, etc. But if x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this becomes true?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0. However, to reach a position y, the frog must have a way to get there without stepping out of bounds. For example, to reach y, the frog can start from 0 and keep adding a steps until it reaches a position >= y, then subtract b steps as needed. However, during this process, the frog must not exceed x.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But this is not correct, because the frog can also subtract steps.\n\nAlternatively, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0. Because the frog can perform steps that add a and subtract b in any order, leading to any such multiple. However, the problem is that during the process of reaching that position, the frog might have to go beyond x, thus making it unreachable for smaller x.\n\nBut once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. So, for x >= some value, f(x) is equal to floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo, the question is: what is that value?\n\nLet me think of the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x. Let's call this threshold X.\n\nIf I can find X, then for x >= X, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < X, we need to calculate f(x) individually.\n\nBut how to find X?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Since the frog can jump forward by a steps, once the frog can reach a certain position y, it can reach y + a, provided that y + a <=x. Similarly, if the frog can reach y + b, it can reach y.\n\nBut to reach all multiples of d up to x, the frog needs to have a way to reach every such multiple. This suggests that once the frog can reach a certain range of positions, it can generate others.\n\nBut perhaps the threshold X is max(a, b) * something. Or perhaps X is a + b.\n\nAlternatively, consider that once the frog can reach a and b, then it can reach any combination of them. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try with the first sample. a=5, b=3, d=1. The threshold X is 7. Let's see: for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. How did that happen?\n\nWell, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Then, when x increases to 7, the frog can reach 5 + 5 = 10 (but that's beyond 7). However, from 5, it can subtract 3 to reach 2, then add 5 to reach 7. So 7 is added. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1, etc. So once x is at least 7, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut how to find that threshold?\n\nAnother idea: the threshold X is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from there, can reach all positions down to 0 by subtracting b steps. For example, if x is such that x is reachable, and x >= b, then subtracting b steps from x gives x -b, which is also reachable, and so on until 0. So if the frog can reach x, and x is >= b, then all positions down to x mod b can be reached. But this depends on the values.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position y that is a multiple of d and is between 0 and x, provided that x is large enough that there exists a way to reach y by adding a steps and subtracting b steps without going out of bounds.\n\nBut this is still too vague.\n\nPerhaps we can find X as the maximum between a and b multiplied by something. For example, X = a * b. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is between 0 and x, provided that x >= (a + b). Because once the frog can reach a and b, then by combining steps, it can reach all positions. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nBut for the sample input, a=5 and b=3. x=5 is less than 5+3=8. However, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. When x increases to 8, the frog can reach 5+5=10 (which is beyond 8, so not allowed), but from 5, subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7 (allowed). From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, subtract 3 to get 0. So for x=8, the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. All positions from 0 to 8 except 8 itself. But wait, 8 is a multiple of d=1. How can the frog reach 8?\n\nFrom 5, adding a (5) would get to 10, which is beyond 8. From 2, adding a gives 7 (allowed). From 7, adding a would get to 12 (no). So to reach 8, the frog would have to find some path. For example, can it reach 8 from 0?\n\nLet's see: 0 → +5 → 5 → +5 → 10 (invalid). No. Or 0 → +5 →5 → -3 → 2 → +5 →7 → +5 → 12 (invalid). No. Or 0 → +5 →5 → -3 → 2 → -3 → -1 (invalid). No. So perhaps 8 is not reachable for x=8. But according to earlier reasoning, for x=8, the frog can reach all positions up to 7, but not 8. So the threshold X is higher than 8.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous assumption about the threshold is incorrect.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex. How can I find for each x, the number of reachable positions?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients that allow it to be reached without stepping out of bounds. But how to find this for all x up to m?\n\nBut since m is up to 1e9, we need a formula-based approach.\n\nLet me think of the following: the frog can reach a position y if and only if y is a multiple of d and y can be expressed as y = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process of reaching y, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut this is still too vague.\n\nLet me try to model the reachable positions for a fixed x. Let's imagine that the frog can reach some positions. For example, the initial position is 0. From 0, it can jump to a (if a <=x) or to -b (invalid). So for x >=a, the frog can reach a. From a, it can jump to a +a (if <=x) or to a -b (if >=0).\n\nThis looks like a BFS problem. However, for x up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for every x. But perhaps for each x, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of positions reachable in the BFS up to x. But how can we find a pattern for f(x)?\n\nAnother observation: since the frog can move forward by a steps, the reachable positions for x are a subset of the reachable positions for x+1. Because if x increases, the frog has more room to move. So f(x) is non-decreasing as x increases.\n\nThis is important. Because once the frog can reach a certain position for x, it can reach it for any larger x. So the function f(x) is non-decreasing.\n\nThis implies that for x >= some value, f(x) is equal to the number of multiples of d up to x. Because once the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x, increasing x further would allow more multiples.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of multiples of d up to x, but only if x is large enough. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = gcd(a, b). If d is not 1, then the frog can only reach multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum possible f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1, assuming the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to determine if that's the case.\n\nLet me think of the following: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0, provided that x is large enough. So for x >= some value, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThe question is to find this value and compute the sum accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0, as long as x is at least the maximum of (a, b) * something. But how to find this value.\n\nLet me think about the following. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0, provided that x >= (a + b) * something. For example, once x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nTake the first sample: a=5, b=3, d=1. The threshold X was 7. Which is less than a + b = 8. So for x >= 7, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nAnother example: a=1, b=2. d=1. For x=2, the frog can reach 0, 1 (from 0 +1), 2 (from 0 +1 +1, or 0 +2). So for x=2, f(x) = 3. For x=3, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3. Because from 2, you can jump to 2+1=3. So for x >= 1, it seems that the frog can reach all positions. But what about x=1? For x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1. So f(1) = 2. Which is floor(1/1)+1 = 2. So for x >= 1, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nSo in this case, the threshold X is 1.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=2. d=2. The frog can only reach even numbers. For x=2, the frog can reach 0 and 2. For x=4, it can reach 0, 2, 4. For x=3, it can only reach 0 and 2. So the threshold X for x=2 is 2, and for x >=2, f(x) = floor(x/2) +1. But what about x=3? The frog can't reach 2 + 2 = 4 which is beyond x=3. But it can reach 2. So for x=3, the reachable positions are 0 and 2, which is floor(3/2)+1 = 2. So yes, it matches. So in this case, the threshold is 0, because for x >=0, f(x) is floor(x/2)+1. But that's not true for x=1. For x=1, the frog can't reach 2, but floor(1/2)+1 = 0 +1=1. Which is correct, since the only position is 0.\n\nSo in this case, the threshold is 0. So for any x, f(x) is floor(x/d) +1.\n\nSo what's the pattern here?\n\nIt seems that for cases where a and b are multiples of d, and the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x for any x >=0. But that's not the case in the first sample. Wait, no. In the first sample, a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. For x=5, the frog can't reach all multiples of 1 (all integers) up to x=5. It can reach 0, 2, 5. But for x=7, it can reach all.\n\nSo what's the difference between the a=2, b=2 case and the a=5, b=3 case?\n\nIn the a=2, b=2 case, the frog can only jump forward by 2 or backward by 2. So from 0, it can reach 2 (if x >=2). From 2, it can jump back to 0, or forward to 4 (if x >=4). So for x=2, the reachable positions are 0 and 2. For x=3, it can't reach 4, so the reachable positions are still 0 and 2. But floor(3/2) +1 = 1 +1 = 2, which matches. So even though the frog can't reach 1 or 3, which are not multiples of d=2, the count is correct. So in this case, the formula holds.\n\nSo the formula for f(x) is always floor(x/d) +1, but only if the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. But how to determine if this is the case.\n\nWait, in the first sample, for x=5, the formula would give floor(5/1) +1 = 6, but the actual f(x) is 3. So clearly, the formula is not applicable for all x.\n\nSo why in the a=2, b=2 case it works, but not in the first sample?\n\nBecause in the a=2, b=2 case, the frog can reach all multiples of d=2 up to x. But in the first sample, for x=5, it can't reach all multiples of d=1 (which are all integers) up to x=5.\n\nSo what determines whether the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x?\n\nMaybe it depends on whether a and b are such that the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x, provided that x >= (some value). \n\nLet me think about the following: the frog can reach any multiple of d >=0 if and only if the frog can reach d. Because once it can reach d, it can add a steps to reach d + a, d + 2a, etc. But since d is the gcd of a and b, a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to whether the frog can reach d. Once it can reach d, then it can reach any multiple of d by adding a steps (since a is a multiple of d). But also, since the frog can subtract b steps (also a multiple of d), it can reach lower multiples of d.\n\nWait, but if the frog can reach d, then from d, it can jump to d + a (if allowed), which is another multiple of d. Also, from d, it can jump to d - b (if >=0), which is also a multiple of d. So, if the frog can reach d, then it can reach any multiple of d that is >= (d - b) and <= (d + a), and so on.\n\nBut how to ensure that all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nSo the key is whether the frog can reach d. Once it can, then it can reach all multiples of d up to x, provided that x is large enough.\n\nBut how to determine whether the frog can reach d.\n\nLet me think of d as the gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d to get a' and b', which are coprime. Now, the problem becomes whether the frog can reach d = 1*d, which is equivalent to reaching 1 in terms of a' and b'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the frog can reach any integer that is a combination of a' and b' steps. But again, the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x] complicate things.\n\nBut perhaps for the frog to be able to reach d, it needs to have x >= a (so that it can jump to a = d*a') and then possibly subtract b steps to reach d.\n\nWait, let's take the first sample: a=5, b=3, d=1. So a'=5, b'=3. To reach d=1, the frog needs to find a combination of steps that results in 1. For example, 5*2 - 3*3 = 10 -9 = 1. So the frog can reach 1, but only if during the process of doing so, it doesn't step out of bounds.\n\nBut how to ensure that during the process of reaching 1, the frog stays within [0, x]. For example, if x is large enough, say, x >= 10 (the maximum position in the path), then the frog can reach 1.\n\nBut for smaller x, it may not be possible.\n\nSo, the threshold X is the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. This depends on the minimal x where the frog can reach d, and from there, reach all multiples.\n\nBut how to find this X?\n\nLet me think that once the frog can reach d, then it can reach any multiple of d up to x, provided that x is large enough to allow the steps. For example, if x >= d + a, then the frog can reach d + a, which is 2d, and so on. But how to ensure that all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the threshold X is the minimal x such that the frog can reach d, and x >= d + max(a, b). Or something like that.\n\nBut how to compute this minimal x.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x where the frog can reach d is the minimal x such that there exists a way to reach d without stepping outside [0, x]. Once this x is found, then for x >= this value, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to find this x.\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime. Then, the minimal x needed to reach",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line, given constraints on its jumps, and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given maximum value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `d`.\n\n2. **Threshold Determination**: For sufficiently large values of `x`, the frog can reach all multiples of `d` within the range `[0, x]`. This threshold is determined based on the ability to reach the smallest positive multiple of `d` using valid jumps.\n\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of values `f(x)` for all `x` from 0 to `m` is split into two parts:\n   - For small values of `x` (below a certain threshold), we use a breadth-first search (BFS) to compute reachable positions.\n   - For larger values of `x`, we use a formula based on the number of multiples of `d` up to `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check if the frog can move at all\n    if a == 0 and b != 0:\n        # Frog can only jump back, but starts at 0, so only 0 is reachable\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n    elif b == 0 and a != 0:\n        # Frog can only jump forward, so for each x >=0, f(x) is floor(x/a) +1\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(m + 1):\n            total += (i // a) + 1\n        print(total)\n        return\n\n    # Now, a and b are coprime\n    # We need to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x\n    # Let's compute the minimal x such that the frog can reach d\n    # Since d = gcd(a,b), and after dividing by d, a and b are coprime.\n\n    # Find the minimal x where the frog can reach d\n    # This is equivalent to finding the minimal x such that there exists a way to reach d\n    # Using BFS up to some limit\n\n    # We can simulate BFS up to a certain limit (like a + b) to find all reachable positions\n    # Then, once we find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable, we can proceed\n\n    # Let's compute all reachable positions up to a + b\n    max_limit = a + b\n    visited = set()\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n    visited.add(0)\n    while q:\n        current = q.popleft()\n        next1 = current + a\n        if next1 <= max_limit:\n            if next1 not in visited:\n                visited.add(next1)\n                q.append(next1)\n        next2 = current - b\n        if next2 >= 0 and next2 <= max_limit:\n            if next2 not in visited:\n                visited.add(next2)\n                q.append(next2)\n\n    # Now, check which multiples of d are reachable in this range\n    # The minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable is when the frog can reach d\n    # So, check if d is in visited\n    if d in visited:\n        # Then, for x >= some value, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x\n        # The threshold is max_limit\n        threshold = max_limit\n    else:\n        # Need to find the minimal x where d is reachable\n        # But this might not be possible, so we have to calculate for all x up to m\n        # However, since the problem says it's an easy question, perhaps we can assume that for x >= a, the frog can reach all multiples\n        # Wait, no.
