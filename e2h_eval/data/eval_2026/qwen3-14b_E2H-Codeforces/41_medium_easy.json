There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the task is to build houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. I need to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But even with n=50, trying all possibilities for each house would be h^50, which is way too big. So brute-force isn't going to work here.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the constraints. Each restriction requires that the maximum in a range is <= x_i. So for each range, the maximum of the houses in that range can't exceed x_i. So the problem is to assign heights to each house such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nHow to model this? It feels like a constraint satisfaction problem. Maybe we can model it with some kind of dynamic programming or backtracking with pruning. But even backtracking might be too slow for n=50. Wait, but n is up to 50, and h is up to 50. Let's think: for each house, the possible height is from 0 to h. But with constraints, perhaps we can find for each position the maximum possible height it can have, considering all constraints that apply to it.\n\nBut how do the constraints affect individual houses? For example, a restriction on a range [l, r] says that the maximum in that range is at most x. So for any house in that range, its height can't exceed x. Because if any house in the range is higher than x, then the maximum would be higher than x, violating the constraint. Wait, no. The maximum in the range must be <= x. So that implies that every house in the range must be <= x. Because if even one house in the range is higher than x, then the maximum would be higher than x. Therefore, for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), all houses in positions l_i to r_i must be <= x_i. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Suppose there's a restriction that says the maximum in [l, r] is at most x. Then, the maximum of the houses in that range must be <=x. Which means that all houses in that range must be <=x. Because if any house in that range is higher than x, then the maximum would be higher than x. So, the constraints can be transformed into per-house constraints. For example, for each house j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i]. Because each restriction that includes j in its interval imposes that the house j can't be higher than x_i. So for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions that cover that house.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because suppose there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is 2. Then, each house in 1-3 can be at most 2. But if there's another restriction that says the maximum in [2,3] is 3, then for house 2 and 3, the first restriction says they can't exceed 2, and the second allows up to 3. So the effective maximum for house 2 and 3 is min(2,3) = 2. So for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_i for which the house is in [l_i, r_i].\n\nWait, but that's only if the restriction applies to that house. So for each house j, collect all the restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum allowed height for j is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i among those restrictions. Because each restriction that includes j in its interval requires that the maximum in that interval is <=x_i. Therefore, the house j's height must be <=x_i for each such restriction. Hence, the maximum possible height for j is the minimum of h and all x_i's of the restrictions that include j.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Because if there are multiple restrictions covering j, each of them imposes that j's height can't be higher than their x_i. So the maximum j can be is the minimum of all those x_i's, and also h (since the maximum possible is h).\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to, for each house j, compute the maximum possible height allowed by the constraints, which is min(h, min of x_i for all restrictions that include j in [l_i, r_i]). Then, set each house to that maximum value. Because that would maximize the sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for house 1, x is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → house 2's max is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → house 3's max is 2.\n\nSo for each house, the maximum allowed is 1, 3, 2. So the optimal is [1,3,2], sum of squares 1+9+4=14, which matches the example. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the second input.\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → for houses 2 and 3, their max is 8.\n\n3 4 7 → for houses 3 and 4, their max is 7.\n\nSo for house 1: no restrictions, so max is 10.\n\nHouse 2: restricted by 8 (from first restriction). So max is 8.\n\nHouse 3: restricted by 8 and 7. So min(8,7) =7.\n\nHouse 4: restricted by 7. So max is 7.\n\nSo the optimal is [10,8,7,7], sum is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262, which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the problem reduces to for each house, find the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include that house. Then, the maximum height for each house is min(h, that minimum). Then, set each house to that value. Then sum the squares.\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because if there's a restriction that says the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is x_i, then the maximum of the houses in that interval must be <=x_i. However, if for each house in that interval, the maximum allowed is x_i, then the maximum in the interval is <=x_i. So this approach ensures that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is 2. Then, each house in 1-3 can be at most 2. So the maximum in the interval is 2. Which satisfies the constraint. So this approach works.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is 2, and another that says the maximum in [1,2] is 3. Then, for house 1 and 2, their maximum allowed is min(2,3) = 2. House 3 is allowed 2. So the maximum in [1,3] is 2, which is okay. But the maximum in [1,2] is 2, which is <=3. So that's okay.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all constraints correctly. Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], all houses in that interval are allowed to be at most x_i. Therefore, the maximum in that interval is <=x_i. Hence, the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house j, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum height for j is min(h, that value). Then, the answer is the sum of squares of these values.\n\nWait, but what if there are no restrictions that include a particular house? Then, the maximum allowed is h, as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each house j (from 1 to n), collect all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\n2. For each such j, compute the minimum x_i among those restrictions. If there are no restrictions, then the min is h (since the maximum allowed is h).\n\nWait, no. For a house j with no restrictions, the maximum allowed is h. Because the problem says that each house can have a height between 0 and h. So the initial maximum is h. But if there are restrictions that apply to j, then the maximum is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of those restrictions.\n\nSo, for each house j, the maximum allowed is min(h, min_x), where min_x is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include j in their interval. If there are no restrictions that include j, then min_x is h (since the maximum allowed is h).\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize for each house j, max_height[j] = h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i):\n\n   for each j in l_i to r_i:\n\n       if max_height[j] > x_i:\n\n           max_height[j] = x_i\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the max_height array holds the maximum allowed height for each house. Then, the total profit is sum of (max_height[j]^2) for all j.\n\nWait, but this would be correct? Let's see.\n\nYes. Because for each restriction, we are ensuring that all houses in [l_i, r_i] have their max_height not exceeding x_i. Because for each house in that range, we take the minimum between their current max_height and x_i. So after processing all restrictions, each house's max_height is the minimum of h and all x_i of restrictions that cover it. Which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array max_height of size n, with all elements set to h.\n\nThen, for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = input values.\n\n   for j in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       if max_height[j-1] > x:\n\n           max_height[j-1] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute sum of (h^2) for each h in max_height.\n\nWait, but in Python, indexes start from 0, but the problem uses 1-based for the spots. So for j in l_i to r_i, we have to loop from l_i to r_i, and for each position, adjust the max_height array.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nInitially, max_height is [3,3,3].\n\nProcess first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. So for j=1, set max_height[0] to 1. Now array is [1,3,3].\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3. So j=2, which is index 1. Current value is 3, which is not greater than x=3. So no change. Array remains [1,3,3].\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2. So j=3, index 2. Current value 3 > 2 → set to 2. Now array is [1,3,2]. Sum of squares is 1 +9 +4 =14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nInitial max_height is [10,10,10,10].\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So for j=2 and 3 (indices 1 and 2). Their current values are 10, so set to 8. Now array is [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. For j=3 (index 2) and 4 (index 3). For j=3, current value 8>7 → set to 7. For j=4, current value 10>7 → set to 7. Now array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are two overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions: [1,2,3], [1,1,4]. Then, for the first restriction, both houses are set to 3. Then, for the second restriction, house 1 is set to min(3,4) → 3. So the max_height is [3,3]. Sum is 18. But the first restriction requires that the max in [1,2] is 3. Which is satisfied. So correct.\n\nAnother case: if a restriction is redundant. Like, for a house already limited to a lower value. For example, n=1, h=5, m=2. Restrictions: [1,1,3], then [1,1,4]. The first sets the max to 3, the second does nothing. So the final value is 3. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input. But the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the sample input shows something like:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. But in reality, the actual input is given as per standard input. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from standard input. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThen another input for the second example. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, the output is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two separate test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['14', '262']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is two test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line has n, h, m. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's original statement may not mention that. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and gives the input as per the first example. But the sample input shows two test cases. But the original problem's input may be for a single test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nOutput:\n\n['14', '262']\n\nBut this is probably a mistake in the way the user presented the problem. Because in the actual programming competition problem, the input would be a single test case. However, looking at the note, the first example's input is as given. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the original problem's input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's because the user is providing multiple test cases for testing the code. However, the actual problem expects that the code reads a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nAnd output is 14. The second example's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput is 262.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that. However, the user's sample input shows that. So perhaps the code needs to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. However, perhaps the user is using a format where the input is given as multiple test cases, each as a separate string. But that's unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is wrong. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the original problem statement's note, the first example's input is given as:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is one test case. The second example's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich is another test case. So the sample input is two test cases. But the problem statement's input says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem's original input may not have multiple test cases. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, in the problem's original statement, it's unclear.\n\nBut looking at the user's instruction, the code is to read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line has n, h, m, etc. So perhaps the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. For example, the user may have used a list to represent the input, but in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin.\n\nBut given the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says nothing about multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the first line is a list of two test cases. But that's not the standard way of presenting input. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. In that case, the sample input's first example is the first test case, and the second example is another test case. But how to read them?\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, the code is given two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to know when to stop reading?\n\nWell, given that in the sample input, the code is given two test cases, but the problem statement's input is for a single test case, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, given that the sample input is given as a list of two test cases, and the sample output is a list of two outputs, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. So the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to parse the input? For example, the input may be given as multiple lines, each test case being a group of lines. For example, the first line is n, h, m, then m lines of restrictions, then another test case's first line, etc.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the code needs to read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read one test case, but the sample input shows two test cases for the purpose of the example.\n\nBut since the problem says that the output is a single integer, perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nBut given the problem's note, which describes the first example, and the second example, perhaps the code is supposed to handle a single test case. But the user's sample input shows two test cases, which may be part of the code's testing.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the problem. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle a single test case. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code will read n, h, m from the first line, then read m lines of restrictions, process them as explained, compute the sum of squares.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nInitialize max_height as [h] * n.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for j in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       if max_height[j-1] > x:\n\n           max_height[j-1] = x\n\nThen compute sum of squares.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_height = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n\n            max_height[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum( [a*a for a in max_height] )\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check the loop for l and r. For example, l=1, r=3. Then, the loop is from l-1=0 to r-1=2. So range(0,3) → 0,1,2. Which is correct for the 3 positions 1, 2, 3. So yes.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nmax_height starts as [3,3,3]\n\nProcessing first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 → loop from 0 to 0 (i=0). Set to 1.\n\nSecond restriction l=2, r=2 → i=1. x=3. current value is 3 → no change.\n\nThird restriction l=3, r=3 → i=2. x=2. current value is 3 → set to 2.\n\nsum is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second example.\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → l=2, r=3. i ranges from 1 to 2 (inclusive). So indices 1 and 2. So set their values to 8.\n\nThen 3 4 7 → l=3, r=4. i ranges from 2 to 3. So indices 2 and 3. So for index 2, current value 8 → set to 7. Index 3: 10 → set to 7.\n\nmax_height becomes [10, 8, 7, 7]. sum is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo this code works for the sample inputs.\n\nNow, what about cases where multiple restrictions apply to the same house?\n\nLike, for example, a house is covered by two restrictions. The code takes the minimum x_i for that house.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when a restriction's x_i is larger than h?\n\nFor example, n=1, h=2, m=1. Restriction is l=1, r=1, x=3. Then, the code sets the max_height to min(2, 3) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when there are overlapping ranges?\n\nYes, the code handles it correctly.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct.\n\nSo the Python code is as described above.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines of l, r, x.\n\nProcess as above.\n\nBut what about if there are multiple test cases? For example, the sample input shows two test cases. But according to the problem's input description, it's a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nBut the code as written will handle a single test case. However, if the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, then the code should read until EOF. For example, in the sample input, the code would need to read two test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but that may be part of the user's example of how to test the code.\n\nBut the problem says that the output should be a single integer. So perhaps the code should handle one test case. Thus, the code as written is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, the code is given two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. How to handle that?\n\nIn that case, the code would need to read all the input lines, split them into test cases. For example, for each test case, read the first line as n, h, m, then read m lines for the restrictions.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? The code can read all the lines at once, and process them in groups.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, the code can read all the input lines into a list, and then process them sequentially.\n\nBut the problem is that the code may be run in a way where the input is given as multiple test cases. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes multiple test cases are given, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, the original problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, it's possible that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's sample input may be incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of two test cases, but the problem's description says that the code should output a single integer, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, the code should be written according to the problem's description.\n\nBut according to the problem's input description, the code should read a single test case. So the code as written earlier is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the code may have two test cases. However, the user's code may have to handle that. But how?\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', which is the first test case. Then the second line is '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'.\n\nBut how to read this in Python? Well, if the input is provided as multiple test cases, each consisting of a group of lines, the code needs to read them accordingly. For example, in the sample input, the code may have two test cases, and the code should read them all.\n\nBut how to determine when to stop reading? Well, perhaps the code should read until EOF. So, for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as test cases.\n\nBut how to split them into test cases? Each test case starts with a line containing n, h, m, followed by m lines of restrictions.\n\nThus, the code can read all the lines into a list, and process them sequentially.\n\nBut for the code to handle multiple test cases, here's how it can be done:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nptr = 0\n\nwhile ptr < len(lines):\n\n    # read n, h, m from lines[ptr]\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n\n    ptr += 1\n\n    max_height = [h] * n\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        l, r, x = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n            if max_height[i] > x:\n\n                max_height[i] = x\n\n    total = sum(a*a for a in max_height)\n\n    print(total)\n\nBut this code would handle multiple test cases. However, the original problem may not require that. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output has two outputs. So perhaps the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description may not mention this, but the sample input shows it. Hence, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says, \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\" So for each test case, print a single integer. Thus, the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to determine that? Well, the original problem's sample input may have been incorrectly formatted. However, the user's sample input and output suggest that the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code should be written to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input may be only one test case. However, the user's sample input shows two. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code should be written to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them in Python?\n\nIn the code, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process each test case as follows:\n\nRead the first line of the test case, get n, h, m. Then read m lines for the restrictions. Then process.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut how to read from stdin in Python? Using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), for example.\n\nSo, here's the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(data):\n\n        line = data[idx].strip()\n\n        if not line:\n\n            idx += 1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        max_height = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            if idx >= len(data):\n\n                break\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, data[idx].split())\n\n            idx += 1\n\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n                if max_height[i] > x:\n\n                    max_height[i] = x\n\n        total = sum(a*a for a in max_height)\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut this code handles multiple test cases, even if there are empty lines between them.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, etc. So for the first example, the code would read one test case, and output 14, and for the second test case, output 262.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, the code would process two test cases.\n\nBut the original problem may not have multiple test cases. However, given the sample input and output, it's better to assume that the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original statement may have only one test case, but the user's sample input shows two. However, the user's note says that the first example's input is the first case, and the second example's input is the second case. Hence, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code as written above is correct.\n\nBut for the problem's original input, which may have only one test case, this code will still work.\n\nThus, the code should be written as above.\n\nBut in the original problem's sample input, the first example's input is given as:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich would be read as one test case. Then, the second test case would be read next.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the output is a single integer. But if there are multiple test cases, then the code should print multiple integers, one per test case.\n\nBut the original problem's output says to print a single integer. However, the sample output shows two integers. So this suggests that the problem has multiple test cases. But the problem's original description may not mention this. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the user's sample input and output show multiple test cases, and the code must pass them, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the sample input may have been a single test case. However, the user's example shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as written above.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code accordingly.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first example's input is given as a single test case, and the second example's input is another test case. So the code should process both.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house can have a height between 0 and a specified maximum height, and there are zoning restrictions that limit the maximum height of houses in specific ranges. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array where each element represents the maximum possible height for each house, initially set to the given maximum height `h`.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowed height for the houses within the specified range to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        line = data[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        max_height = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if idx >= len(data):\n                break\n            l, r, x = map(int, data[idx].split())\n            idx += 1\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if max_height[i] > x:\n                    max_height[i] = x\n        total = sum(a * a for a in max_height)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize an array `max_height` with the maximum height `h` for each house.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate through the specified range and adjust the maximum height for each house in that range to ensure it does not exceed the restriction's limit.\n4. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the adjusted maximum heights.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit, leveraging the constraints efficiently to determine the optimal heights for each house.",
