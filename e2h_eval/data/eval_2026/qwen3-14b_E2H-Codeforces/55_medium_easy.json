    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. Let me think about how the allowed swaps affect the order of characters.\n\nFirst, let's understand the allowed operations. The swaps allowed are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So, 0s can move past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 1s can move past 2s, but not past 0s. Wait, no. Because if you can swap adjacent 0 and 1, then 0 can move left or right through 1s. But 0s can't swap with 2s. Similarly, 1s can move through 2s but not through 0s. So what does that imply about the relative order of the characters?\n\nLet me think: For example, a 0 can be moved past any number of 1s. So in the final string, all 0s can be arranged to be as left as possible, but they can't pass through 2s. Similarly, 1s can be moved past 2s, but not past 0s. So, the relative order between 0s and 2s is fixed. Because you can't swap 0 and 2. So, any 0s that are originally before 2s will remain before them. But 0s can be rearranged among themselves, and 1s can be rearranged among themselves, and 2s can be rearranged among themselves, but with some constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because 0s can move through 1s, and 1s can move through 2s. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, the 0 can move to the right past the 1, but then the 1 can move to the right past the 2. But the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 0 can be in front of the 1 and 2, but the 1 can be in front of the 2. But maybe the 1 can be moved to the right of the 2, but the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the 0s can be grouped to the left of the 2s, but their positions relative to each other can be adjusted, and the 1s can be grouped between 0s and 2s, but their positions can be adjusted as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is that the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because you can't swap 0 and 2. So any original 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string will still be before that 2 in the final string. Similarly, any original 2 that comes before a 0 will still be before it. So the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. However, the 1s can be moved around between the 0s and 2s, and also between 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s in such a way that:\n\n- All 0s are in their original relative order, but they can be arranged in any order among themselves? No, wait. Wait, because the 0s can be swapped with 1s. So, for example, if there are two 0s with some 1s between them, they can be swapped past the 1s. So the 0s can be reordered among themselves? No, because 0s can't be swapped with each other. Wait, the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So two 0s next to each other can't be swapped. So the relative order of 0s can't be changed. Similarly for 2s. But the 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So the 1s can be moved around freely between 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other.\n\nSo the overall approach would be to arrange the 0s, 1s, and 2s in such a way that:\n\n- The 0s appear in their original relative order, but can be moved as far left as possible, but not past the 2s. Similarly, 2s appear in their original relative order, but can be moved as far right as possible, but not past the 0s. The 1s can be arranged between the 0s and 2s, and can be ordered as desired.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way to model this is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. For example, if in the original string, a 0 comes before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must come before that 2. But the 1s can be placed anywhere else.\n\nSo, the idea is that the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string. But between them, we can arrange the 1s. Also, the 1s can be arranged in any order, but since they can be swapped with each other via the 0s and 2s? Wait, no. Wait, 1s can be swapped with adjacent 0s and 2s. So, for example, if you have a 1 and another 1, you can't swap them directly. But perhaps you can move them through 0s and 2s. But since 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s, perhaps you can arrange the 1s in any order. Wait, but if you have two 1s separated by a 0, you can move them past the 0 to swap their positions. For example, consider 1 0 1. You can swap the first 1 with the 0 (if they are adjacent) to get 0 1 1. Then the 1s are adjacent. So, perhaps all 1s can be moved around, but the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. Therefore, the 1s can be arranged in any order, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original relative order.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved through 0s and 2s. So, for example, if there are multiple 1s, they can be rearranged among themselves. Because they can be moved through 0s and 2s. So, for example, if you have a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0 (but wait, no. Because the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? Wait, the allowed swap is between 0 and 1. So if you have \"01\", you can swap them to \"10\". So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But then, if you have a 0 followed by a 1 followed by another 0, then the 1 can be moved between the two 0s. So the 1 can be moved left or right past 0s. Similarly for 2s. So, the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. Therefore, the 1s can be arranged in any order, as long as the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order.\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original relative order. So, for example, suppose the original string has a 0 at position i and a 2 at position j, where i < j. Then in the final string, that 0 must come before that 2. However, the 1s can be arranged in any order, and can be placed between the 0s and 2s, or even before the 0s or after the 2s, as long as the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nBut how do we arrange the 1s? Since they can be moved freely through 0s and 2s, perhaps we can collect all the 1s and arrange them in the positions between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. The 1s can be placed anywhere else, but their order can be adjusted. So the minimal lex string would be achieved by placing as many 0s as possible to the left, then 1s, then 2s. But how to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is formed by arranging all 0s, 1s, and 2s such that:\n\n- All the 0s are in their original order, but grouped as much as possible to the left. But since the 0s can't pass through 2s, but can pass through 1s, the 0s can be moved to the left of the 1s and 2s. But the 2s can't be moved to the left of the 0s. So the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order.\n\nSo, the process could be:\n\n- Collect all the 0s, 1s, and 2s in the original string. The 0s and 2s must be in their original relative order. The 1s can be arranged in any order, but to make the lex smallest string, we want the 1s to be as left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s are fixed.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the input example: '100210' → output is '001120'.\n\nOriginal string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe 0s are at positions 2,3,6. The 2 is at position 4. The original order of 0s and 2s is 0 (position 2) comes before 2 (position 4), then 0 (position 3) comes before 2 (position 4), and the 0 (position 6) comes after 2 (position 4). So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must be in the same relative order. So the 0s from original positions 2 and 3 must appear before the 2, and the 0 from position 6 must appear after the 2. But how to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\nSo, the 0s and 2s in the original string are in the order: 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the final string, these must be in the same order. But the 1s can be placed in between.\n\nSo the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but as early as possible, and the 1s in between. Wait, but how to arrange the 1s.\n\nIn the example, the original string has 1s at positions 1 and 5. The 1s can be moved around. So in the final string, the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s. But since the 1s can be arranged in any order, but we want the lex smallest, we can arrange them in sorted order (i.e., all 1s in order, but since they are all 1s, their order doesn't matter). So the minimal string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with all 1s placed between them, as much as possible.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 0s and 2s. For example, the original 0s and 2s are 0,0,2,0. So in the final string, those 0s and 2s must appear in that order. So the minimal string would be to arrange the 0s and 2s in that order, but inserting the 1s as much as possible to the left. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s. Since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s can't be moved past 2s. So the 0s can be moved as far left as possible, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can be moved as far right as possible, but not past 0s. The 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s, but can also be moved around freely. So the minimal string would be:\n\nAll 0s in their original order, but as left as possible, then all 1s in their original order (but since they can be rearranged, sorted?), then all 2s in their original order as right as possible. But that's not quite right, because the 0s and 2s can't be reordered relative to each other. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe 0s and 2s must be in the same order as in the original string. Between them, the 1s can be placed. But how to arrange the 1s. Since the 1s can be arranged in any order, but to minimize the lex order, we want to arrange them as early as possible. But since all 1s are the same, their order doesn't matter. So the minimal lex string would be to arrange all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and insert the 1s in between wherever possible.\n\nWait, but how to do that. Let's take the example of the first input: \"100210\" → output is \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0\n\nOriginal 0s and 2s are:\n\npositions 2 (0), 3 (0), 4 (2), 6 (0). So in the original order, they are 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the final string, these must be in that order. So the final string must have 0, 0, 2, 0 in that order. The 1s are at positions 1 and 5. So the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s, or before the first 0, or after the last 0. But since the goal is to make the lex smallest string, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But how to arrange the 1s.\n\nIn the example, the output is 001120. So the 0s are first, then 1s, then 2, then 0. But the 0s and 2s are in the original order. Let's see: the original 0s and 2s are [0, 0, 2, 0]. So in the output, the 0s and 2s are arranged as 0, 0, 2, 0. The 1s are inserted between the second 0 and the 2. So the 0s are first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. That makes sense.\n\nSo the idea is that the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. But how to arrange them optimally.\n\nAnother approach: The problem can be thought of as follows. The allowed swaps allow us to sort the 0s and 1s among themselves (but not the 0s and 2s). But since the 0s can be moved past 1s, and the 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So, the 0s can be arranged in any order as long as their relative positions to the 2s are maintained. Wait, no. The relative positions between the 0s and 2s are fixed. So for example, if in the original string, a 0 comes before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must still be before that 2. However, the 0s can be rearranged among themselves, as long as their relative positions to the 2s are maintained. Wait, but how can that be? For example, if there are two 0s and a 2 in the original string, like 0 2 0. Then the original order of 0s and 2s is 0, 2, 0. So in the final string, the first 0 must be before the 2, and the second 0 must be after the 2. So the 0s can't be swapped with each other if they are on different sides of the 2. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, and insert the 1s between them, but also before the first 0 and after the last 2. However, to make the lex smallest string, we want the 1s to be placed as early as possible. But since 1s are larger than 0s and smaller than 2s, inserting them between 0s and 2s may not be optimal. Wait, but the lex order is determined by the earliest differing character. So to minimize the lex order, we want as many 0s as possible at the start, then 1s, then 2s.\n\nBut given that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, how can we arrange the 1s optimally?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to separate the original string into three parts: the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering that the 0s and 2s must be in their original order. However, the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. But how to arrange them.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's collect all the 0s and 2s in the order they appear in the original string. Then, collect all the 1s. Then, the minimal string is formed by inserting the 1s into the positions between the 0s and 2s. However, the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s. But to get the lex smallest string, we should insert the 1s as early as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence of blocks. For example, the original 0s and 2s form a sequence like [0, 0, 2, 0]. Then, between each pair of consecutive elements in this sequence, we can insert some number of 1s. Also, before the first element and after the last element.\n\nTo make the lex smallest string, we want to place as many 1s as possible before the first 0, but that's not possible because 1 is larger than 0. So inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So, better to place the 1s between the 0s and 2s where they can be placed in positions that don't interfere with the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, for example, if we have a 0 followed by a 2 in the original sequence. We can insert 1s between them. But since 1 is less than 2, inserting 1s between the 0 and the 2 would help. For example, 0 followed by 2 can be turned into 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2.\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s, and also between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: the minimal string is formed by taking the 0s and 2s in their original order, and inserting all the 1s in between. But how to arrange the 1s between them.\n\nFor example, the original 0s and 2s sequence is S = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], where each a_i is either 0 or 2, and they are in the original order. Then, between each pair of consecutive elements in S, we can insert some 1s. Also, before the first element and after the last element.\n\nBut to make the lex smallest string, we should insert as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions where they can be placed without making the string worse. However, inserting 1s before the first element would be worse than inserting them after the first element, since the first element is 0. Inserting 1s before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we should not do that. Similarly, inserting 1s after the last element (after the last 2) would be better than not inserting them there, but since 1 is less than 2, inserting them before the 2s would be better.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2. So the idea is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s in the S sequence.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. Since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the elements of S, and we want the lex smallest string. The lex smallest string would be achieved by inserting all the 1s as early as possible. However, inserting them between elements of S where the previous element is 0 and the next is 2.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. Let me think of the S sequence as consisting of a series of 0s and 2s. For example, suppose S is [0, 0, 2, 0]. Then, between the first 0 and the next 0, inserting 1s would not help, since they are both 0s. But inserting between the 0 and the 2 would help. Inserting between the 2 and the 0 would not help, since the 2 is after the 0. Wait, but the 2 is in the original order. So in the S sequence, the 2 comes before the 0. Wait, no. In the example S is [0, 0, 2, 0]. So the third element is 2, and the fourth is 0. But according to the original relative order, that 2 must come before that 0. So in the final string, the 2 must come before that 0. So between the 2 and the 0, inserting 1s would be between 2 and 0, which would be 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since 2 is larger than 1 and 0, inserting 1s between the 2 and 0 would be better than leaving them as 2 followed by 0. Because 2 followed by 1 is better than 2 followed by 0. Wait, no. Because 2 is followed by 1 would be 21, which is worse than 20. Because '2' is larger than '0', so 20 is better than 21. Wait, but in this case, inserting the 1s between the 2 and the 0 would make the string have 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 2 followed by 0. Because 2 is followed by 1 is worse than 2 followed by 0. So that's not helpful. So inserting the 1s between the 2 and the 0 is not helpful.\n\nSo the conclusion is that inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is beneficial, but inserting between a 2 and a 0 is not. So how to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nSo, for each pair of consecutive elements in the S sequence, if the first element is 0 and the second is 2, then inserting 1s between them is good. If the first is 2 and the second is 0, inserting 1s between them would not be good. If the first is 0 and the second is 0, inserting 1s between them would not be helpful (since they are 0s, and 1 is larger than 0, inserting 1s between them would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than 00). Similarly for 2 followed by 2.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s between pairs of elements in the S sequence where the first element is 0 and the second is 2. Because inserting 1s there would make the sequence 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2. But how many such positions are there?\n\nBut how do I know which positions to insert the 1s? Because there might be multiple such positions.\n\nMoreover, if there are multiple such positions, inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions would be better. For example, inserting 1s between the first 0 and the first 2 in the S sequence.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the elements of S, but inserting them between 0 and 2 is beneficial, perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and insert them between the 0s and 2s in the S sequence. For example, for each occurrence of a 0 followed by a 2 in the S sequence, insert all the 1s between them. But if there are multiple such positions, which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, the 1s can be placed in all possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse. But how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the elements of S, but to minimize the lex order, we should insert them as early as possible. For example, between the first 0 and the first 2 in the S sequence.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: think of the entire string as being composed of the S sequence (the 0s and 2s in their original order) and the 1s. The 1s can be inserted into the S sequence. To make the lex smallest string, we want to insert the 1s as early as possible, but in positions where inserting them is beneficial.\n\nBut how to determine where to insert them.\n\nLet me think of the S sequence as a list. For example, S = [0, 0, 2, 0]. Then, the 1s can be inserted between elements of S. To make the lex smallest string, the 1s should be inserted between elements where inserting them would not increase the lex order. For example, inserting between 0 and 2 is beneficial. Inserting between 0 and 0 is not. Inserting between 2 and 0 is not. So in this case, the 1s should be inserted between the second 0 and the 2. Then, the resulting sequence would be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0]. Which is the example output.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the 0s and 2s in their original order (call this list 'fixed'), and collect all the 1s into a list 'ones'.\n\n2. Now, we need to insert the 'ones' into the 'fixed' list in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\n3. How to insert the 'ones'? We can insert them between the elements of 'fixed' where inserting them would not make the string worse. For example, between a 0 and a 2.\n\nBut how to find all possible positions where inserting 1s is allowed and beneficial.\n\nBut since the 'fixed' list consists of 0s and 2s, and the 'ones' are all 1s, the optimal insertion is to insert all the 1s between every 0 and 2 in the 'fixed' list. However, there may be multiple such positions. For example, if the 'fixed' list is [0, 2, 0, 2], then inserting 1s between 0 and 2, between 0 and 2 again, etc.\n\nBut since inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better than not inserting, we should insert all the 1s into those positions. However, how to choose which positions to insert the 1s into.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, inserting them into any of the possible positions between 0 and 2 would yield the same result. However, inserting them as early as possible would be better. For example, inserting them between the first 0 and first 2 would give more 1s earlier in the string, which is better.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Iterate through the 'fixed' list, and for each position where the current element is 0 and the next is 2, insert all the 1s here. But once inserted, we don't need to insert them again.\n\nWait, but there may be multiple such positions. So the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where inserting them is beneficial.\n\nBut how to find those positions.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be inserted anywhere between the elements of 'fixed', but inserting them between 0 and 2 gives a better lex order. So the idea is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions where the current element is 0 and the next is 2. Once inserted, we can leave the rest of the 1s to be inserted elsewhere.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the elements of 'fixed' where inserting them is allowed (i.e., between 0 and 2) and in the earliest possible positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother approach is to generate the final string by combining the 'fixed' list and the 'ones' list. The 'fixed' list is the 0s and 2s in their original order. The 'ones' can be inserted into the 'fixed' list in the following way:\n\nFor each position in the 'fixed' list, between the i-th and (i+1)-th element, if the i-th element is 0 and the (i+1)-th element is 2, then insert all the 1s here. But if there are multiple such positions, insert all the 1s in the first such position.\n\nBut why the first such position? Because inserting the 1s earlier in the string would give a lex smaller string.\n\nFor example, if the 'fixed' list is [0, 2, 0, 2], and we have two 1s to insert, inserting them between the first 0 and 2 would give 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2. Which is better than inserting them between the second 0 and 2, which would give 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2.\n\nYes, the first option is better.\n\nBut what if there are no such positions (i.e., no 0 followed by 2 in the 'fixed' list)? Then, inserting the 1s where?\n\nIn that case, inserting the 1s at the end of the 'fixed' list (after the last element) would be better than inserting them before the first element. Because inserting them at the end would have them after all the 0s and 2s. But since 1 is smaller than 2, inserting them before the 2s would be better. However, if there are no 0 followed by 2 in the 'fixed' list, then all the 0s come before the 2s, or all the 2s come before the 0s.\n\nWait, no. The 'fixed' list is the 0s and 2s in their original order. For example, if the original string had a 2 followed by a 0, then in the 'fixed' list, the 2 would come before the 0. But since the 0 can't be moved past the 2, that 2 would be before the 0 in the final string.\n\nIf the 'fixed' list is such that all the 0s come before the 2s, then inserting the 1s between the last 0 and the first 2 would be the best option. If all the 2s come before the 0s, then inserting the 1s between the last 2 and the first 0 would not be beneficial, since inserting them between 2 and 0 would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than 2 followed by 0. So in that case, the best option is to insert the 1s after the last 2 (since inserting them after the last 2 would be better than inserting them before the first 0, which would be worse).\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nSo, the steps I can think of are:\n\n1. Split the original string into two lists: 'fixed' (all 0s and 2s in original order) and 'ones' (all 1s).\n\n2. Now, find all the positions in 'fixed' where a 0 is immediately followed by a 2. For each such position, we can insert the 1s here. But since inserting them here is the most beneficial, we can insert all the 1s into the first such position.\n\n3. If there are no such positions, then we need to decide where to insert the 1s. If all the 0s are before the 2s, then inserting the 1s between the last 0 and first 2. If all the 2s are before the 0s, then inserting the 1s after the last 2 (since inserting them after the last 2 is better than inserting them before the first 0, which would be worse).\n\nBut how to check if there are any 0 followed by 2 in the 'fixed' list.\n\nOnce we have the 'fixed' list, we can iterate through it and find the first occurrence where a 0 is followed by a 2. Insert all the 1s there.\n\nBut what if there are multiple such positions? For example, the 'fixed' list is [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Then inserting the 1s between the first 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them between the second 0 and 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the first occurrence in the 'fixed' list where a 0 is followed by a 2. Insert all the 1s there.\n\n- If there are no such occurrences, then check if there are any 0s and 2s. If there are 0s and 2s, then all the 0s are before the 2s (or vice versa). For example, if all 0s are before 2s, then insert the 1s between the last 0 and first 2. If all 2s are before 0s, then insert the 1s after the last 2 (since inserting them after the 2s would be better than inserting them before the 0s).\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no 0 followed by 2 in the 'fixed' list, then the 1s can be inserted at the end of the 'fixed' list. Because inserting them after the 2s would be better than inserting them before the 0s (since inserting them after the 2s would be better).\n\nWait, but if all the 0s are before the 2s, inserting the 1s between the 0s and 2s would be better than inserting them after the 2s. So how to detect that.\n\nBut how to find whether there are any 0s followed by 2s in the 'fixed' list.\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nFirst, collect the 'fixed' list and the 'ones' list.\n\nThen, check if there is any occurrence of 0 followed by 2 in the 'fixed' list. If yes, insert all the 1s into the first such occurrence.\n\nIf not, then check if there are any 0s and 2s. For example, if the 'fixed' list is all 0s, then insert the 1s after the last 0. Or if the 'fixed' list is all 2s, then insert the 1s before the first 2 (but that's worse than inserting them after the 2s? Or not? Let's think. For example, inserting 1s before the first 2 would be 1... followed by 2s, which is worse than inserting after the 2s. So the better option is to insert after the 2s.)\n\nBut if there are 0s and 2s, but no 0 followed by 2, then all 0s are after the 2s.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped with each other, but '1's can be freely moved between them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Split the input string into two lists: one containing all '0's and '2's in their original order (fixed list) and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Identify Insertion Points**: Check for positions in the fixed list where a '0' is immediately followed by a '2'. These positions are optimal for inserting '1's because they help minimize the lexicographical order.\n3. **Insert '1's**: If there are such positions, insert all '1's at the first occurrence of a '0' followed by a '2'. If no such positions exist, insert all '1's at the end of the fixed list to maintain the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence where '0' is followed by '2'\n    insert_pos = -1\n    for i in range(len(fixed) - 1):\n        if fixed[i] == '0' and fixed[i+1] == '2':\n            insert_pos = i + 1\n            break\n    \n    if insert_pos != -1:\n        # Insert all ones at the position between fixed[insert_pos-1] and fixed[insert_pos]\n        result = []\n        for i in range(len(fixed)):\n            if i == insert_pos:\n                result.extend(ones)\n            result.append(fixed[i])\n        return ''.join(result)\n    else:\n        # No 0 followed by 2, append ones at the end\n        return ''.join(fixed) + ''.join(ones)\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for s in inputs:\n        print(minimum_ternary_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separating Characters**: We iterate through the input string to separate '1's from '0's and '2's. This helps us manage the '1's separately, which can be freely rearranged.\n2. **Finding Insertion Points**: By checking each adjacent pair in the fixed list, we identify the first position where a '0' is followed by a '2'. This is an optimal point to insert '1's as it helps in minimizing the lexicographical order.\n3. **Constructing Result**: If an optimal insertion point is found, all '1's are inserted there. If not, '1's are appended to the end of the fixed list, ensuring the smallest possible lexicographical order.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the resulting string is the smallest possible lexicographical order using the allowed swaps.",
