The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks. Since each task must be done in order, we have to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the distance between two points can be calculated as (target - current) % n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Wait, the houses are arranged in a circle. So moving clockwise from current to target.\n\nFor example, if current is 3 and target is 2, and n is 4. Then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But if current is 1 and target is 3, then moving clockwise is 2 steps.\n\nSo the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current. Otherwise, it's (n - current + target). Or more generally, (target - current) % n? Wait, no. Because for example, when target is less than current, (target - current) is negative. So mod n would give the correct positive value. Let me check:\n\nIf current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2-3) = -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) mod n. But wait, no. Because if current is 1 and target is 3, (3-1) is 2 mod 4 is 2. Which is correct. So yes, the distance is (target - current) mod n. But wait, if the target is same as current, the distance is zero. So that works.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, moving from a house to neighboring along the ringroad takes one unit of time. So the time is the number of steps between the two positions, moving clockwise. So the formula is (target - current) % n if moving clockwise. But since the movement is only allowed clockwise, that's the correct way to calculate the steps.\n\nSo for each task, we need to calculate the time to get from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the tasks are given in order. So the initial position is 1. Then for each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, we need to compute the distance from the previous position (which starts as 1) to the current a_i, add that to the total time, and update the previous position to a_i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. Like, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the time between them is zero. So that's handled automatically by the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = a_i\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test with the first example.\n\nFirst example input: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. distance is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. distance is (2-3) mod 4 = ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. So total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. distance is (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total_time becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, and the tasks are [2,3,3]. Let's see.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1. total_time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1.",
