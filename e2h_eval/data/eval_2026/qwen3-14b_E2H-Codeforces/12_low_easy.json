The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order (each task must be done after all previous ones), we need to process them in the order given.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. So for each task i (from 1 to m), she must be at a_i. But since she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house, like if a_i and a_{i+1} are same, then she doesn't need to move.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between consecutive tasks?\n\nLet me think. Let's say she is currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, we need to move from current_pos to a_i. The time taken for that movement depends on the direction. Wait, but the ringroad is clockwise. So movement can only be clockwise. So moving from current_pos to a_i requires moving clockwise, which could be either (a_i - current_pos) mod n steps if a_i is ahead, or (n - (current_pos - a_i)) steps if a_i is behind? Wait, no. Because moving clockwise, the distance between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i is larger than current_pos, but if a_i is smaller, then it's (n - current_pos + a_i). For example, if current_pos is 3, and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (n - current_pos + a_i) = 4 -3 +2 = 3. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) % n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Let's think: if current is 3 and target is 2, then (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n if we take modulo n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct distance.\n\nWait, but when you move clockwise, the number of steps needed to get from current to target is (target - current) if target is >= current, else (target - current + n). So for example, current=3, target=2, n=4: steps are 3 →4 (1 step), 4→1 (another step), 1→2 (third step). Total 3 steps. Which is (2-3 +4) = 3. So yes.\n\nSo for each consecutive task, we need to compute the steps from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So for the first task, she is at 1, and needs to go to a_1. Then for the second task, she is at a_1, and needs to go to a_2, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if a_1 is 3, a_2 is 3, then moving from a_1 to a_2 takes zero steps. So the total time for those two tasks would be the steps from 1 to 3 (which is 2 steps) plus zero steps for the second task.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute the distance from current_pos to a_i, add to total_time\n\n    set current_pos to a_i\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current_pos and a_i?\n\nAs discussed, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - current_pos) % n if the modulo is handled properly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. Let me check.\n\nFor example, (2-3) %4 is 3, which is correct. So yes,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the house where the task is located.\n3. **Calculate Distance**: The distance between two houses on a ringroad is calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Specifically, the distance from the current position to the target house is `(target - current) % n` if moving clockwise, which ensures correct handling of both forward and backward movements around the ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of house numbers where each task is located.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the distance from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n4. **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the time taken to move to each task's house.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, ensuring that the solution is optimal and runs in linear time relative to the number of tasks.",
