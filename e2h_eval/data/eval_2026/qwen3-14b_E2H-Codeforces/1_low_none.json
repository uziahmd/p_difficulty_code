    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded on a plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We need to add k rings of gilding. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we get the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the description says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, no, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let me rephrase: For the first ring (i=1), it's the outermost layer. The next ring (i=2) is two cells away from the edge, which would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's smaller by 2 cells on each side. Wait, but the formula given for the size of the rectangle for the i-th ring is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. But then the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. Then for i=2, the rectangle is (w-4) × (h-4), and the ring is its perimeter. But wait, how does that work? Because each ring is one cell thick. So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from the original edges. But how does that translate to the dimensions?\n\nLet me think about the perimeter of a rectangle. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side has length W or H, but the corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(W + H). So subtracting 4 (the four corners) gives 2*(W + H) - 4 = 2*(W + H - 2). Alternatively, think of it as the number of cells in the perimeter: for a rectangle, the perimeter cells are those in the first row, last row, first column, last column. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Because the first and last row contribute W each, and the columns between contribute (H-2)*2.\n\nSo for each ring, the number of cells is 2*( (current_width) + (current_height) - 2 ), where current_width is (w - 4*(i-1)), current_height is (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, but for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, the rectangle is w × h, and the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). That makes sense. Then for the second ring, i=2, the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) × (h - 4*(1)), which is (w-4) × (h-4). So the perimeter of that rectangle is 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) - 2 ) = 2*(w + h - 10). But wait, but that's the perimeter of that rectangle. However, we need to make sure that for each ring, the rectangle is big enough. For example, if the rectangle is too small, like if after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions, the rectangle is not at least 1x1. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7, min is 7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So for k=2, the second ring would be 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. So 3x3, which is okay. So the code can assume that for each i from",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it is one cell thick and positioned progressively inward from the edges of the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is the perimeter of the entire plate, the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells inward from the edges, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of width `w` and height `h`, the perimeter in terms of cells is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for all cells along the borders of the rectangle.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, we calculate the dimensions of the corresponding inner rectangle and then compute its perimeter. Summing these perimeters gives the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values for width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of rings (`k`) are read and converted to integers.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle considering the current ring's position.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)` and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n- **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing up their respective perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
