The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, and each ring is the border of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle would be 2 less in width and height. Wait, no. Let me think: the first ring is the outermost border. For example, if the plate is 3x3, then the first ring is all the cells around the edge. The perimeter of that would be 3*4 - 4 (since corners are counted twice?), wait no. Wait for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each side has length w or h, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, for 3x3, the perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if that rectangle is valid. But wait, the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, we can compute the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the perimeter? Let me think again. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in its border is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute W cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Alternatively, 2*(W + H) - 4, which is same as 2*(W + H - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, we compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size W_i = w - 4*(i-1) and H_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but what if the rectangle becomes invalid? Like, for example, when W_i or H_i becomes less than 1? But according to the constraints on k, the input ensures that k is such that for all i up to k, the rectangles are valid. Because the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check. Let's say min(w, h) is m. Then the maximum possible i is such that 4*(i-1) < m. Because for the i-th ring, the rectangle has dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). So for the rectangle to have at least 1 cell in each dimension, we need that w -4*(i-1) >=1 and h -4*(i-1) >=1. Since min(w, h) is m, then for the i-th ring, 4*(i-1) must be <= m -1. So i-1 <= (m-1)/4. So i <= (m-1)/4 + 1. Which is (m + 3)/4. So floor( (m + 1)/4 )? Wait the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(n, m) +1)/4 ), but maybe that's a typo. Well, regardless, the input ensures that k is valid. So for each i from 1 to k, the W_i and H_i are >=1.\n\nSo the approach is: for each i in 1..k, compute 2*(W_i + H_i - 2), and sum them all.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. Then W_1=3, H_1=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = ",
