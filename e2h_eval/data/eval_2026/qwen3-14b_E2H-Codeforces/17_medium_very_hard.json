He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of length 2n-2 where each character is P or S, indicating the classification of each input string. There might be multiple valid answers, and we can return any.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this. The key idea is that for the correct string s, each prefix of length k (for 1 ≤ k ≤ n-1) must be present in the input, and similarly for suffixes. However, since the input contains all these prefixes and suffixes, but mixed, we need to find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do we determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes? Well, the main thing is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must be compatible with each other. For example, the prefix of length k must be the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters of s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a way to assign each input string as a prefix or suffix such that there exists a string s of length n that satisfies all these assignments.\n\nBut how can we find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Find the correct string s. Once we have s, we can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that there may be multiple possible s that fit the given input. However, the problem says that Ivan has chosen a string s, and we need to output any assignment that is compatible with at least one such s.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find all possible candidate strings s that are compatible with the given input (i.e., their prefixes and suffixes are exactly the ones given), then for each such s, generate the corresponding P/S assignments, and pick one of them.\n\nBut how do we find such s?\n\nAlternatively, since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of some string s, perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking for the unique string that has all the given strings as its prefixes and suffixes. But how?\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input, the correct string is ababa. Let's see: for each length from 1 to 4, the prefixes and suffixes would be:\n\nLength 1: prefix is 'a', suffix is 'a' (but in the input, there are two entries for length 1: 'a' and 'a'? Wait the first sample input is:\n\nInput for first case:\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nWait, the input is 2n-2 = 8 lines. For n=5, the input has 8 strings. Let me count the lengths:\n\nThe given strings are:\n\n\"ba\" (length 2)\n\"a\" (1)\n\"abab\" (4)\n\"a\" (1)\n\"aba\" (3)\n\"baba\" (4)\n\"ab\" (2)\n\"aba\" (3)\n\nSo for each length from 1 to 4, there are exactly two strings.\n\nFor the correct s being \"ababa\", the prefixes are:\n\nlength 1: a\nlength 2: ab\nlength 3: aba\nlength 4: abab\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\nlength 1: a\nlength 2: ba\nlength 3: aba\nlength 4: baba\n\nSo the input strings include all these prefixes and suffixes. For example, the prefixes are a, ab, aba, abab. The suffixes are a, ba, aba, baba. Looking at the input strings, we have:\n\nprefixes: a (x2?), ab, aba (x2?), abab.\n\nBut in the input, for length 1, there are two a's. So that's the prefix and suffix. For length 2, there's 'ba' (suffix) and 'ab' (prefix). For length 3, there are two 'aba's (one prefix, one suffix). For length 4, 'abab' (prefix) and 'baba' (suffix).\n\nSo the correct s is ababa. Now, the problem is to assign each input string as P or S, such that for the correct s, the P's are the prefixes and S's are the suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the full string s must be such that:\n\n- The longest prefix (of length n-1) is a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is a suffix of s. Also, the longest prefix and suffix of length n-1 must overlap in a certain way. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then the full string s is P + last character, but also S starts with the first character (since the suffix of length n-1 is the entire string except the first character). Wait, no. For example, if the full string is s of length n, then the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have overlapping parts. So combining them, the full string s can be determined by taking the prefix of length n-1 and appending a character, but that character must be the same as the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Alternatively, the full string s is the concatenation of the prefix of length n-1 and the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But how to find which of the input strings are the prefix and suffix of length n-1?\n\nSo here's an idea: among the input strings, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. So for the correct s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the full string s can be formed by taking the prefix of length n-1 and appending the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But since the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], its last character is s[n-1], which is the last character of the full string. So the full string s is equal to the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1.\n\nBut since we don't know which of the two length n-1 strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, we can try both possibilities. For each possibility, we can construct the candidate s and check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each of the two possibilities (assuming one is the prefix of length n-1, the other is the suffix of length n-1), construct the candidate s as follows:\n\n   a. Take the first string as the prefix (length n-1), then the last character of the second string (the supposed suffix of length n-1) becomes the last character of s. So s = prefix + last_char_of_suffix.\n\n   b. Alternatively, take the second string as the prefix, and the last character of the first string as the last character of s.\n\n3. For each candidate s generated this way, check if all other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If yes, then this s is a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, we can then assign each input string as P or S based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nWell, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix of s (s ends with the string). However, since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for the candidate s, we can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix. But since there are exactly two strings of each length (from 1 to n-1), and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix, we need to make sure that for each length, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut perhaps during the checking process, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. If even one of them is neither, then the candidate s is invalid.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, we can proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each possible pair of length n-1 strings (there are two possibilities):\n\n   - Assume one is the prefix (length n-1), the other is the suffix (length n-1). Then construct s as prefix + [last char of suffix].\n\n   - Check if this s is valid (i.e., all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s).\n\n   - If valid, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can generate the answer.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple possible s? For example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\nn=2\n\ninput strings are 'a' and 'c'.\n\nSo the possible s could be 'ac' (then 'a' is prefix, 'c' is suffix) or 'ca' (then 'c' is prefix, 'a' is suffix). Both are valid. So the answer can be PS or SP, but the sample shows that PS is acceptable.\n\nSo our algorithm needs to find any valid s, and then assign the P/S accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this in code.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead n, then read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called inputs.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. Since there are exactly two of them.\n\nFor example, for n=5, the length is 4. So collect all strings of length 4 from inputs.\n\nOnce we have those two strings, say str1 and str2.\n\nThen, for each possible combination (str1 as prefix and str2 as suffix, and vice versa):\n\nConstruct candidate s as follows:\n\nCase 1: str1 is prefix of length n-1, str2 is suffix of length n-1.\n\nThen, the full string s should be str1 + (last character of str2). Because the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So the last character of the suffix is the last character of s. So s is prefix (length n-1) + last_char_of_suffix.\n\nSimilarly, case 2: str2 is the prefix, str1 is the suffix. Then s is str2 + last_char_of_str1.\n\nOnce we generate these candidates, we need to check if they are valid.\n\nHow to check validity:\n\nFor the candidate s, check for each input string whether it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Also, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there should be exactly two strings (one prefix and one suffix). However, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, perhaps the check is just that all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut for example, suppose there's an input string that is neither a prefix nor a suffix of s. Then this candidate s is invalid.\n\nOnce we find a valid s, then we can proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nOnce we have that, the problem becomes straightforward: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (then assign P) or a suffix (assign S). However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input where s is 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. But according to the problem statement, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. However, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of the correct s. But when there's ambiguity (like a string being both), how do we choose between P and S?\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment. So in such cases, we can choose either P or S, as long as the overall assignment is correct.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because for each length l, there are exactly two input strings, and one is a prefix and one is a suffix.\n\nBut if for a candidate s, a particular input string is both a prefix and a suffix, then for that length, the other input string must be the other one (but how?).\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be correct. So for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. So when we check for validity, we can just check that all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s. Once that is true, then for each length l, the two input strings of that length must be one prefix and one suffix. Because the input is constructed as the prefixes and suffixes of some s.\n\nSo once we find a candidate s that passes the check, we can proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nBut how to assign them? For each input string, if it is a prefix of s, assign P; else, assign S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix (like 'a' in the second example), then how do we decide? But in that case, since there are two strings of that length (for example, for l=1, in the second sample input, there are two 'a's. So for the correct s 'aaa', each of the two 'a's is both a prefix and a suffix. So for each of them, we can assign P or S. However, the problem requires that the number of P's and S's is equal. Since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the total number of P's must be n-1 and S's must be n-1. So for each input string, exactly one of P or S is assigned, but for the case when a string is both, we can choose either.\n\nBut in practice, for the candidate s, for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix (or both). However, for the case when a string is both, how to assign P/S? For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\nn=3, the input strings are a, aa, aa, a. The correct s is 'aaa'. The two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. The two 'aa's are prefixes (for length 2) and suffixes (for length 2). So for the two 'a's, one must be P and the other S. Similarly for the two 'aa's. So the assignment can be P and S for the two 'a's, and P and S for the two 'aa's. But the output is 'PPSS' or 'PSPS', etc.\n\nSo the approach is: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, if it is both, then we can choose either. But how to make sure that the counts are correct?\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, the number of P's and S's will be correct. Because for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, if a string is both, then for that length, the two strings are both prefixes and suffixes. Which would not be possible unless the two strings are the same. But the input says that for each length, there are exactly two strings. So if the two strings are the same (like in the second sample input), then for that length, both are prefixes and suffixes. But in that case, the problem statement says that the input is valid, so there exists a string s that has those as prefixes and suffixes. So for example, in the second sample input, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes, but for the correct s, each of them is a prefix and suffix. So when assigning, we can choose for each of them to be P or S, as long as the total counts are correct.\n\nBut in practice, when generating the assignment, for each input string, we can check whether it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, in the case when the string is both, then the code will assign P. But that may lead to more P's than needed. How to avoid that?\n\nWait, but the input is guaranteed to be correct, meaning that for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each input string, there must be exactly one of the two possibilities. However, in cases where the string is both, like when the string is the entire string (but since the length is less than n, that's not possible). Wait, for example, if the string is of length l < n, and it is both a prefix and a suffix of s. Then, for that length, the two input strings could be the same, and thus both are prefixes and suffixes. However, the problem says that for each length, there are exactly two strings. So for example, in the second sample input, for length 1, there are two 'a's. So for the correct s, both are prefixes and suffixes. So when assigning, we have to assign one as P and the other as S. But how?\n\nBut the code as described would assign both as P, because they are prefixes. Which would result in more P's than allowed. So this approach would not work.\n\nSo what's wrong here? How can we ensure that for each length, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P and the other as S?\n\nAh, the problem is that for some input strings, they can be both a prefix and a suffix. Therefore, the code's approach of checking if it's a prefix and assigning P, else S, may not work because for some strings, it's both, and thus the code may assign them as P, leading to more P's than allowed.\n\nSo how to resolve this?\n\nWe need to assign for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings as P and the other as S. However, if both are prefixes (or both are suffixes), then we need to choose one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, determine if it is a prefix or a suffix. However, for each length l, there are exactly two strings. For each such pair, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nOne way is to group the input strings by their length. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings. For each group, we need to decide which one is P and which is S.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in the case of the second sample input, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So for this group, we can choose one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to choose? Well, perhaps we can look for the longer strings. For example, for the group of length l, the longer strings (but since they are of the same length, perhaps not helpful).\n\nAlternatively, for each group, one of the strings must be a prefix and the other a suffix. So for the group, we can check which of the two is a prefix (and not a suffix) or vice versa. If both are prefixes and suffixes, then we can choose arbitrarily.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAn alternative idea is to process each group (each length l) and for each group, determine which of the two strings is a prefix (and not a suffix) or a suffix (and not a prefix), and assign accordingly. However, if both are both, then we can choose either.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother approach: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then it's a prefix. If it is not a prefix, then it must be a suffix. However, if it is both, then we need to decide whether to mark it as a prefix or suffix. But how?\n\nBut perhaps for the candidate s, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix. So for the group of length l, one of the two strings must be a prefix (and the other a suffix). However, if both are prefixes and suffixes, then for that group, both are both, but the problem says that the input is correct, so there exists a valid assignment. Thus, for that group, we can choose one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code? Maybe we can process each group, and for each group, check which of the two strings is a prefix (and not a suffix) or vice versa. If both are prefixes and suffixes, then we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nPerhaps for each group (same length), we can check if one of the strings is a prefix of s. For example, for the group of two strings, say s1 and s2. Check if s1 is a prefix. If yes, then assign P to s1, and S to s2. Else, check if s2 is a prefix, assign P to s2, and S to s1. If both are prefixes, then we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose?\n\nIn this case, since the group has two identical strings (like the two 'a's in the second sample), then we can assign one as P and the other as S. For example, in the second sample, the two 'a's are in the group of length 1. We can assign the first 'a' as P and the second as S, or vice versa. Either way, the total counts will be correct.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAn idea is:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. However, for each group (same length), we need to ensure that exactly one is marked as P and the other as S. So for each group, if both are prefixes, then we can assign one as P and the other as S. How?\n\nSo for each group (say, group of length l with strings a and b):\n\nCheck if a is a prefix of s. Check if b is a prefix of s.\n\nIf exactly one is a prefix, then assign that one as P, the other as S.\n\nIf both are prefixes, then assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nBut in this case, since both are prefixes, but the group must have one prefix and one suffix. So the other string must be a suffix. So for example, if both are prefixes, then the other string (which is the same as the first) must be a suffix. So in this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to determine which one is which?\n\nAlternatively, for each group, we can check if one of the strings is a suffix. For example, if both are prefixes, then one of them must be a suffix. Because the group must contain one prefix and one suffix.\n\nSo for the group, if both are prefixes, then one of them is also a suffix. So for example, in the second sample, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. So for the group, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to choose which one? Well, perhaps in the code, for each group, we can first check if one of the strings is a prefix. If both are, then we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which one to assign as P and which as S? Well, for example, we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. Or, for the group, we can check which of the two is a suffix. If both are, then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, once we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or suffix. But for the purpose of assignment, we can assign P if it is a prefix, else S. However, this may not work when the same string is both. But in that case, for the group of two identical strings, both would be assigned as P, which would cause the count of P's to be higher than n-1.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because for each length l, there are exactly two strings. For the correct s, exactly one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So if both are prefixes, then the other must be a suffix. But how?\n\nWait, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the correct s, each of the input strings is a prefix or a suffix. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Thus, for the group of two strings of length l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each group, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, when checking, for each string in the group, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for the group, if we check for each string whether it is a prefix, then exactly one will be a prefix and the other will not. Therefore, the code can safely assign P to the one that is a prefix, and S to the other.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Suppose that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. But for the group of length 1, there are two strings. For the correct s 'aaa', each of the two 'a's is a prefix and a suffix. So for each string in the group, it is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the previous logic, for the group, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Which contradicts this scenario.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The problem says that the input is guaranteed to be the set of all prefixes and suffixes of some s. So for that s, each of the input strings is either a prefix or a suffix. However, some of them may be both. But for the group of length l, there are two strings. For example, in the second sample input, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes of s. But for that group, there are two strings, and both are prefixes and suffixes. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct. But how does this fit into the requirement that for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix?\n\nAh, no. For a given s, for each length l, there is exactly one prefix (the first l characters) and exactly one suffix (the last l characters). However, the prefix and the suffix may be the same string. So for example, in the case of s = 'aaa', for l=1, the prefix and suffix are both 'a'. Thus, the input for l=1 has two 'a's. But the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings for each length. So in this case, the two 'a's are the same, but the input is correct.\n\nBut for the group of two 'a's, one is the prefix (the first l characters) and the other is the suffix (the last l characters). But they are the same string. So when we check for each string in the group, they are both prefixes and suffixes. Thus, for the group, both strings are both prefixes and suffixes. But for the assignment, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nThus, the previous approach of checking if a string is a prefix (and assigning P) would assign both as P, which would be incorrect.\n\nSo how to handle this case?\n\nThe problem is that when the same string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S, even though both are prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo how to do that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to group all input strings by their length. For each group (same length), we need to select one as P and the other as S. For this, we can check if one of the strings is the prefix of length l (i.e., the first l characters of s) and the other is the suffix of length l (the last l characters of s). Because for the correct s, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Even if they are the same string.\n\nFor example, in the case of the second sample input, the two 'a's are the prefix and suffix of length 1. So for the group, one of them is the prefix, the other is the suffix. But since they are the same string, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each group of strings with the same length l, we can find which of the two strings is the prefix of s (i.e., s[:l]) and which is the suffix of s (s[-l:]). Then assign P to the prefix and S to the suffix.\n\nBut how to do this? For each group of strings with length l, check if the string equals s[:l] (prefix) or s[-l:] (suffix). Then, for the group, the one that equals the prefix is assigned P, and the one that equals the suffix is assigned S.\n\nThis would work even if the prefix and suffix are the same string. For example, in the case where s[:l] == s[-l:], then the two input strings are both equal to that value. Thus, for the group, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So we can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second, or vice versa. But how to distinguish between them?\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two input strings are the same. So for the group, the two strings are the same. So for the group, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one? Since the input strings may have duplicates, but the order in which they appear in the input determines which one is which.\n\nBut the problem says that the output can be any valid assignment. So for the group, we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, regardless of their actual values.\n\nBut how to find which string in the group is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nFor example, for a group of two strings, say, both are 'a', and for the candidate s, the prefix of length l is 'a', and the suffix is also 'a'. So for this group, one of the two strings is the prefix, the other is the suffix. So we can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nFor each group (strings of same length l):\n\n   Check which of the two strings is equal to the prefix of length l (s[:l]).\n\n   Check which is equal to the suffix of length l (s[-l:]).\n\n   Assign P to the one that is the prefix, and S to the one that is the suffix.\n\nBut in the case where both are equal to the prefix and suffix (i.e., the same string), then we can assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nSo in code:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can group them by length. For each group (length l), we can get the two strings. Then, for each of the two strings, check if it is equal to s[:l] (prefix) or s[-l:] (suffix). Exactly one of the two will be the prefix, and the other will be the suffix. Because for the correct s, the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for the group, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nThus, for each group, we can find which one is the prefix and assign P, and the other is the suffix and assign S.\n\nSo in code, for each group:\n\n   strings_of_length_l = [s1, s2]\n\n   prefix_l = s[:l]\n\n   suffix_l = s[-l:]\n\n   for each string in strings_of_length_l:\n\n       if string == prefix_l:\n\n           assign P\n\n       elif string == suffix_l:\n\n           assign S\n\nBut since there are two strings, and exactly one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, this will work.\n\nBut how to handle when the two strings are the same as prefix and suffix?\n\nFor example, if prefix_l == suffix_l, then both strings are equal to that value. So for the group, both strings are the same. So in that case, one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. So for the group, we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to determine which one is which? Because the code would check for equality. For example, if the first string is equal to prefix_l (which is the same as suffix_l), then it's assigned P. The second string is also equal to prefix_l (so it would also be assigned P). But that would be wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the two strings are the same. So for the group, the two strings are both equal to the prefix_l and suffix_l. But for the correct s, one of the input strings is the prefix (so it should be assigned P), and the other is the suffix (assigned S). But how to tell which is which?\n\nAh, but the problem is that in this case, the code will check for equality with prefix_l and assign P, and then check for equality with suffix_l and assign S. However, since the two strings are equal to both, how to differentiate?\n\nThis suggests that the approach of checking for equality with the prefix and suffix is not sufficient in this case.\n\nSo what's the correct way to handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each group, the two input strings must consist of exactly the prefix and the suffix of length l. So for the group, one of the two strings is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. So for the group, we can check which of the two strings is the prefix, and assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to find which one is the prefix?\n\nWell, the prefix of length l is s[:l], and the suffix is s[-l:]. So for the group, exactly one of the two strings is equal to s[:l], and the other is equal to s[-l:]. So for example, if the two strings are the same, then both are equal to s[:l] and s[-l:], which are equal. Thus, for the group, both strings are the same as the prefix and suffix. So how to assign P and S?\n\nIn this case, since the two strings are the same, but one must be P and the other S, we can assign based on their positions in the input. For example, the first occurrence in the input is assigned P, the second S.\n\nBut how to track which strings belong to which group?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the better approach is, for each group, once we have the two strings, we can compare them to the prefix and suffix of length l. If one of them matches the prefix, then assign P. The other must match the suffix, so assign S.\n\nBut in the case where the prefix and suffix are the same, then both strings match both. How to handle this?\n\nBut in that case, the two strings are the same. So for example, the group has two copies of the same string. So for the group, we can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second occurrence.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can process them in groups of their length. For each group:\n\n   Collect the two strings.\n\n   Check which of them is the prefix (s[:l]).\n\n   Assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to find which one is the prefix?\n\nFor example, for the group, if the first string equals s[:l], then assign P. Else, assign P to the second string.\n\nBut what if both are equal to s[:l]? Then both are the prefix. But that's impossible, because for the correct s, the group must have exactly one prefix and one suffix. So this can only happen if the prefix and suffix are the same, and the two strings in the group are the same.\n\nIn that case, the code can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each group:\n\n   strings_in_group = [s1, s2]\n\n   prefix = s[:l]\n\n   suffix = s[-l:]\n\n   for each string in strings_in_group:\n\n       if string == prefix:\n\n           assign P\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\nBut wait, in the case where both strings are equal to prefix (which is also equal to suffix), the first string will be assigned P, the second will be assigned S.\n\nYes. Because the first string is checked first. If it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with this assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The key insight is that the longest proper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) can help us reconstruct the original string `s`. We consider both possible combinations of these two strings to form potential candidates for `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string formed from the longest proper prefix and suffix, check if all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, group the input strings by their lengths. For each group, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix of `s`, and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two candidates\n    for i in range(2):\n        # First candidate is prefix, second is suffix\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[0] if i == 0 else candidates[1]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1] if i == 0 else candidates[0]\n        \n        # Build possible s\n        s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        \n        # Check if all input strings are prefix or suffix of s\n        valid = True\n        for st in strings:\n            is_prefix = s.startswith(st)\n            is_suffix = s.endswith(st)\n            if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now, generate the answer\n        # Group the strings by their length\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        groups = defaultdict(list)\n        for idx, st in enumerate(strings):\n            l = len(st)\n            groups[l].append((st, idx))\n        \n        result = [''] * len(strings)\n        for l in groups:\n            group = groups[l]\n            prefix_l = s[:l]\n            suffix_l = s[-l:]\n            for st, idx in group:\n                if st == prefix_l:\n                    result[idx] = 'P'\n                else:\n                    result[idx] = 'S'\n        \n        print(''.join(result))\n        return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for forming the original string `s`.\n3. **Forming Candidate String**: Each combination of these two strings is used to form a candidate string `s` by appending the last character of the suffix candidate to the prefix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: For each candidate string `s`, we check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n5. **Generating Result**: Once a valid candidate is found, the input strings are grouped by their lengths. For each group, the correct prefix and suffix are identified, and the result is constructed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignments of prefixes and suffixes, leveraging the properties of string prefixes and suffixes.",
