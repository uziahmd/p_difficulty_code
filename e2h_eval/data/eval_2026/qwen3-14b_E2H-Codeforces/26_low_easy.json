Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with certain constraints on their sides. Let's think through the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem says that the triangle sides x, y, z must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold. For any triangle with sides a, b, c (sorted such that a ≤ b ≤ c), the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. So, in this case, since x ≤ y ≤ z (because x is up to B, y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C up to D), the condition is x + y > z.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that x ≤ y ≤ z? Because according to the constraints given:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts at B (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B) and up to C, and z starts at C (since y ≤ C and z ≥ C). So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, for each valid triplet (x, y, z), we need x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\n- x is in [A, B]\n- y is in [B, C]\n- z is in [C, D]\n- x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already ensured by the ranges)\n- x + y > z\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute this?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check if x + y > z. However, given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, this would be O(B * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)), which is way too slow. For example, if all values are 5e5, then B is 5e5, C is 5e5, D is 5e5. Then the loops would be O( (5e5)^3 ), which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Since x is between A and B, y between B and C, z between C and D. Also, x ≤ y ≤ z. So for each x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy z < x + y, and also z is in [C, D], and z ≥ y (since z ≥ C ≥ y, because y ≤ C). Wait, since y is up to C, and z starts at C. So z is ≥ C ≥ y. So for a given x and y, the z's must satisfy:\n\nz ≥ C (since it's in [C, D])\n\nand z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1) (since z must be less than x + y)\n\nBut since z has to be ≥ C and also ≤ x + y - 1, then the valid range of z is from max(C, ...) to min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, but since z must be ≥ C, and x + y must be larger than z. So for each x and y, the lower bound for z is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). But if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z. Otherwise, the number of z is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nSo for each pair (x, y), the count of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) ?\n\nYes. Because z must be between C and D, inclusive, and also less than x + y. So the maximum value of z is x + y - 1. So the valid z's are in the interval [C, min(D, x + y -1)].\n\nSo the count for each x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of the count of z's as computed above.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nThe question is, how to compute this sum without iterating all x and y, which could be up to (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) operations. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5",
