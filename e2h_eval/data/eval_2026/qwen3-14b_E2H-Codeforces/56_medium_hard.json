Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point here is that any two paths (lines) must not cross each other. So for any two pairs (ship A to base X) and (ship B to base Y), the lines AX and BY must not intersect. \n\nBut how do I check that? Well, since all points are in general position (no three collinear), any two lines will either intersect at a single point or not. But since the problem says that no two paths should intersect, even at a point, we need to ensure that for every pair of edges in the matching, they don't cross.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists a perfect matching between the R spaceships and B bases (assuming R = B, which the input requires because the first line has R and B, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. Wait, the first line says R and B, but the problem says that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So that implies that R must equal B. But looking at the input constraints, the first line has R and B, but in the sample input, the first example has 3 3, and the second has 2 1. Oh, but the second example's output is No, which makes sense because R and B are not equal. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given with R and B, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So that implies that R must equal B. However, the problem statement says that the input may have R and B not equal. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input says R and B can be between 1 and 10. But the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So for a perfect matching to exist, R must equal B. Therefore, in the code, the first thing to check is if R != B, then immediately output No. Because if there's no way to have a perfect matching if the numbers are different. So that's an initial check.\n\nSo the first step is: if R != B, output No.\n\nOtherwise, when R equals B, we need to check whether there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection between spaceships and bases) such that no two edges cross.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find such a matching. How?\n\nSince R and B are small (up to 10), perhaps we can generate all possible permutations of the bases and check for each permutation whether the corresponding matching (each spaceship assigned to a base in the permutation order) has non-crossing lines.\n\nBut wait, for R=10, the number of permutations is 10! which is about 3.6 million. That's manageable, right? Because 10! is around 3.6 million, which for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges to see if they cross. For each permutation, checking all pairs of edges would be O(R^2) operations. For R=10, that's 100 per permutation. So total operations would be around 3.6e8, which might be acceptable for Python, but maybe tight. However, considering that R is up to 10, and for each permutation, checking all pairs of edges for crossing, perhaps it's manageable. Let's think.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with others. But since the condition depends on the entire matching, not just individual edges, it's not straightforward. For example, two edges that cross can be part of different matchings. So perhaps generating all possible perfect matchings and checking for crossings is necessary.\n\nBut generating all perfect matchings for a bipartite graph with R=B=10 nodes would be 10! possibilities, same as the permutations approach. So the approach would be:\n\n- Check if R != B: output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of spaceships to bases).\n- For each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n- If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWait, the problem says that the paths are straight lines from the spaceship to the base. So for two pairs (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), their connecting lines are s1 to b1 and s2 to b2. We need to check whether these two lines intersect.\n\nBut how to determine if two line segments intersect?\n\nThere's a standard computational geometry approach for this. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the two line segments intersect properly (i.e., they cross each other, not just touching endpoints). However, in our problem, even if two lines share an endpoint (but that's not possible here since all points are distinct and no three are colinear). Wait, since all points are distinct and no three are colinear, two line segments can't share an endpoint unless they are from the same spaceship or base. But in the matching, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, so the line segments are between unique pairs. So two line segments in the matching would have distinct endpoints. So for two line segments (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), they can't share any endpoints. Thus, their intersection can only be a proper crossing (not touching endpoints).\n\nBut how to check if two line segments (s1, b1) and (s2, b2) intersect?\n\nWe can use the standard method of checking if the orientation of the four points changes. The steps are:\n\n- Check if the two line segments (AB and CD) intersect by using the following conditions:\n   a. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different.\n   b. The orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n   If both conditions are true, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nBut also, there's a case where one of the segments is colinear with the other. However, the problem states that no three points are colinear, so this case can't happen. Because if two line segments were colinear, then their endpoints would lie on a straight line, implying that three points are colinear. Since the problem says that no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. Therefore, the above condition is sufficient.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function that, given four points (s1, b1, s2, b2), returns True if the line segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 intersect.\n\nSo, first, implement the orientation function. The orientation of three points (p, q, r) is determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. If the cross product is zero, the points are colinear. But in our problem, since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. So for any three points, the orientation is either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nThe orientation function can be computed as follows:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clockwise or counter-clockwise\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the 0 case. So, for our problem, when checking two line segments, we can assume that the orientation is not zero.\n\nThen, the function to check if segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (endpoints on the other segment)\n    # But according to problem statement, no three points are colinear, so these cases can't happen?\n    # Because if a point is on the segment, then three points would be colinear. So since the problem says that no three are colinear, the endpoints cannot lie on the other segment. Hence, the only possible intersection is the general case.\n\n    # So, in our problem, the only way two segments can intersect is if the general case holds. So the above condition is sufficient.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the segments is entirely contained within the other? But that would require three points to be colinear. For example, if AB is a segment, and C is on AB. Then, points A, C, B are colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, such cases are impossible. So the function can be implemented as checking if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4.\n\nSo, the function segments_intersect returns True if the two segments cross each other.\n\nNow, for a given permutation of the bases, we can check all pairs of edges in the matching. For example, if the permutation is [b1, b2, b3], then the assignment is ship 1 to b1, ship 2 to b2, ship 3 to b3. Then, for each pair of edges (i < j), check if the segments between ship i and b_i, and ship j and b_j cross. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases:\n\n   For all i < j:\n\n      Check if the line between ship i and base perm[i] intersects with the line between ship j and base perm[j].\n\n   If none intersect, return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none satisfy the condition, return 'No'.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate all permutations of the bases. But note that the bases are given as a list. For example, in the first sample input, the bases are given as:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the code needs to read the R spaceships and B bases. But first, check if R != B, return No.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships).\n\nBut wait, the spaceships are ordered. For example, the first spaceship is assigned to the first base in the permutation, etc. So, the code would generate all possible permutations of the bases, and for each permutation, check if all pairs of edges in the matching are non-crossing.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, print No.\n\nElse:\n\n   Read R spaceships' coordinates into a list, say ships = [ (x1,y1), ... ]\n\n   Read B bases' coordinates into a list, bases = [ (x1,y1), ... ]\n\n   Generate all permutations of the bases list.\n\n   For each permutation:\n\n      For each pair of indices i < j:\n\n         Check if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between ships[j] and perm[j]\n\n         If any such intersection exists, break and try next permutation.\n\n      If no intersections found, return 'Yes'\n\n   After all permutations, if none found, return 'No'\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the bases. For example, if there are R=B=3, then each permutation is a rearrangement of the bases. Each permutation represents a possible matching: ship 0 is matched to bases[perm[0]], ship 1 to perm[1], etc. Wait, no. Wait, the permutation is of the bases. Let me think. Suppose the bases list is [b0, b1, b2]. A permutation could be [b1, b0, b2]. Then, the assignment is ship 0 to b1, ship 1 to b0, ship 2 to b2. So yes, generating all permutations of the bases list gives all possible ways to assign each ship to a unique base.\n\nBut in Python, itertools.permutations(bases) would generate all possible orderings. However, since the bases are stored as tuples, and the permutations are generated as tuples of those tuples. So, for each permutation in permutations(bases), the code can check for the matching.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all possible permutations of the bases. However, for R=10, that's 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking all pairs of edges (i < j) for intersections. For each permutation, the number of pairs is (R choose 2) = 45 when R=10. For each pair, the check is O(1) time. So total operations would be 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. Which in Python might be acceptable, but perhaps tight. However, given that R and B are up to 10, and the constraints of the problem, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize. For example, if during checking the pairs, we find an intersection early, we can break and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImport itertools.permutations.\n\nRead input:\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings? Or perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the user provides input as per the input format. For example, in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut that's probably a representation of the input. So, the actual input would be read as lines. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code needs to read from stdin. So, the code would read the first line as R and B. Then read R lines for the ships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # For this permutation, check all pairs of edges\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with ships[j] and perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, the permutations are generated for the bases list. However, the bases list is a list of tuples. But in Python, when you generate permutations, each element is a tuple. So, for example, if the bases are [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...], then perm is a tuple of those elements. So, for each i, perm[i] is the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nBut the code seems correct. Let's test against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSo ships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is the original order. Let's check for that permutation:\n\nFor each pair of i and j:\n\ni=0, j=1: check segment between (0,0) and (-2,1) vs (2,0) and (0,3). Do these cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1), C = (2,0), D = (0,3).\n\nCheck o1 = orientation(A,B,C) ?\n\nA is (0,0), B is (-2,1), C is (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, the formula is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nSo for p=A, q=B, r=C:\n\n(q.x - p.x) = (-2 - 0) = -2\n\n(r.y - p.y) = (0 - 0) = 0\n\n(q.y - p.y) = (1 - 0) = 1\n\n(r.x - p.x) = (2 - 0) = 2\n\nSo val = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2. Which is negative. So orientation returns 2.\n\nThen o1 is 2.\n\no2 is orientation(A,B,D) where D is (0,3).\n\nCompute for r=D (0,3):\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. Negative again. So o2 is 2.\n\nThus o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So segments_intersect returns false. So no intersection between these two edges.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs.\n\nIn the first sample, the code would find a permutation (the original one) where no intersections occur. Hence output Yes.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=2. Suppose ships are (0,0) and (0,1). Bases are (1,0) and (1,1). Then possible permutations are:\n\n[(1,0), (1,1)] → check if the lines (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1) cross. These are parallel lines, so no intersection. So valid. Output Yes.\n\nAnother case: ships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (1,1), (3,3). Then the lines are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3). These are colinear but since the problem says no three points are colinear. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So in this case, the ships and bases are arranged such that all four points are colinear. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed that no three points are colinear. So this case would not be present in the input.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code uses permutations of the bases. However, if there are duplicate bases (but the problem says that no two points coincide, so the bases are all distinct). So permutations are correct.\n\n- The code checks for all pairs of edges. For example, for a permutation, for each pair (i,j) where i < j, check if their edges cross. If any pair crosses, the permutation is invalid.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, the code loops over i from 0 to R-1, and j from i+1 to R-1. For each pair, check if the segments cross.\n\nNow, the code for segments_intersect may have a mistake. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code for segments_intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut according to the standard line segment intersection algorithm, this is correct. Because if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut what about the case when one of the endpoints is on the other segment? Well, according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So that case can't happen. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible error: the code passes the parameters to segments_intersect as (ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]). Which is correct: A is ships[i], B is perm[i], C is ships[j], D is perm[j]. Wait, no. The segments are between A and B (ships[i] to perm[i]), and between C and D (ships[j] to perm[j]). So the function is called with (A, B, C, D) as (ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]). So the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the first sample input.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when R=B=1. Then, output is Yes, since there's only one possible assignment, and no lines to cross.\n\nAnother case: R=B=2. Ships are (0,0), (0,1). Bases are (1,0), (1,1). The two possible permutations are:\n\npermutation 1: [(1,0), (1,1)] → edges (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel, no intersection. Valid.\n\npermutation 2: [(1,1), (1,0)] → edges (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These two lines cross. So in this case, the code would check for permutation 2 and find that the segments cross, thus invalid. But since permutation 1 is valid, the code outputs Yes.\n\nSo the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother case where R=B=2. Suppose ships are (0,0), (2,2). Bases are (1,1), (3,3). But according to the problem statement, this input is invalid, since the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) are colinear. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed that no three points are colinear. So such a case would not be present.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python, making sure to handle the input correctly.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read as splitlines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 3', then next three lines are the ships, then three lines are the bases.\n\nSo the code reads R and B, then R lines for ships, then B lines for bases.\n\nNow, in the code, when reading from stdin, the input is read with sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nBut in some cases, the input might be provided with multiple lines. So the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. However, there's a possible mistake in the way permutations are generated. For example, if the bases list is empty, but R=B=0. However, according to the problem statement, R and B are at least 1. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses permutations(bases), but bases is a list of tuples. Since tuples are hashable and can be elements of permutations.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the same base can be in multiple permutations, but since the bases are all unique, the permutations are all unique.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nThe code would generate all permutations of the three bases. One of them is the original order. For that permutation, the code checks all pairs. Let's take the first pair (i=0, j=1):\n\nShip 0 (0,0) to base (-2,1). Ship 1 (2,0) to base (0,3). Do these cross?\n\nAs calculated earlier, no.\n\nThen for i=0, j=2: ship 0 to base (-2,1), ship 2 (3,1) to base (2,2). Check if the segments cross.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1). C = (3,1), D = (2,2).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\no1 = orientation(A,B,C) → points A (0,0), B (-2,1), C (3,1).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (1 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (3 - 0) → (-2)(1) - (1)(3) = -2 -3 = -5. So orientation is 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → D is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (2 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) → (-2)(2) - (1)(2) = -4 - 2 = -6 → orientation 2. So o1 == o2 → no intersection.\n\nThen o3 and o4: orientation of C,D,A and C,D,B.\n\nC is (3,1), D is (2,2). A is (0,0).\n\norientation(C,D,A):\n\nval = (2-3)*(0-1) - (2-1)*(0-3) → (-1)(-1) - (1)(-3) → 1 +3 =4 → positive. So orientation is 1.\n\norientation(C,D,B): B is (-2,1). \n\nval = (2-3)*(1-1) - (2-1)*(-2 -3) → (-1)(0) - (1)(-5) → 0 +5 =5 → positive. So orientation is 1. So o3 == o4 → no intersection. So segments do not cross.\n\nSo this pair is okay.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs. So the code would find that this permutation is valid, hence output Yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 1 → output No.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Ships at (0,0), (0,1). Bases at (1,0), (1,1). The code would generate two permutations. The first permutation is [(1,0), (1,1)] → edges (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These are parallel, no intersection. So valid. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case where the permutation is [(1,1), (1,0)]. Then the edges are (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These two lines cross. So for this permutation, the code would detect the intersection and skip. But since there's another permutation that works, the code outputs Yes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses permutations from itertools. But for R=10, it's 10! permutations. However, in Python, permutations are generated as tuples of the elements. So for the bases list, which is a list of tuples, the permutations are generated correctly.\n\nAnother possible optimization: since checking all permutations may be time-consuming, but given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code should be written with proper imports and functions.\n\nPotential issues with code:\n\n- The code uses the orientation function, which returns 0 for colinear points. However, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, in the code, the segments_intersect function will not have to handle the case where o1 is 0. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, the code can safely assume that the orientation is not zero. However, in the code, the function segments_intersect is called with points that are from the input, which are guaranteed to have no three colinear. Thus, the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible mistake is that the code passes the parameters to segments_intersect in the wrong order. For example, the code calls segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]). Which corresponds to checking if the segment between ships[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between ships[j] and perm[j]. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the additional constraint that no two connecting paths (from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect in the 2D plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check**: If the number of spaceships (R) is not equal to the number of bases (B), immediately output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the bases, check if there exists a valid assignment where no two connecting paths intersect. This involves generating all permutations of the bases and verifying each permutation for non-intersecting paths.\n3. **Intersection Detection**: For each permutation, check all pairs of connecting paths to ensure they do not intersect using computational geometry principles. Specifically, we use the orientation of points to determine if line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                if segments_intersect(ships[i], perm[i], ships[j], perm[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Initial Check**: The first check ensures that the number of spaceships and bases are equal, as a perfect matching requires this.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n4. **Checking Intersections**: For each permutation, every pair of connecting paths is checked for intersections using the orientation method. This method determines if two line segments intersect by checking the orientation of points relative to each other.\n5. **Output Result**: If any valid permutation is found where no paths intersect, \"Yes\" is printed. If no valid permutation is found after checking all possibilities, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments while ensuring that no paths intersect, leveraging computational geometry principles for accurate intersection detection.",
