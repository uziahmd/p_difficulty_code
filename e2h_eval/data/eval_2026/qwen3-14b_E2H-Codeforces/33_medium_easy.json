You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements. Oh right, and the replacements can be done in any order, but each replacement uses one element from s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. To maximize the number, I should replace the leftmost digits as high as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. For example, if I have a number like 1024 and the sequence is 010, then the best is to replace the first 1 with 1 (no change?), but wait, the sequence has 0, 1, 0. Wait, maybe the example given is when the input is '1024' and s is '010'. Then the output is '1124'? Oh right, because the first digit is 1, and the s has digits 0,1,0. So the best is to replace the second digit (0) with 1. That would make 1124. Oh right, because the first digit is 1, and the next digits are 0, 2, 4. So replacing the 0 with 1 gives a higher value.\n\nSo the strategy is: sort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each digit in a from left to right, if the current digit is less than the largest available digit in s, replace it with that digit and remove that digit from s. Otherwise, leave it as is. But wait, we need to process the digits in a from left to right, and for each position, use the largest possible available digit in s that is larger than the current digit. Because replacing a digit with a larger one as early as possible gives maximum gain.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. For example, if s is '010', sorted descendingly becomes ['1', '0', '0'].\n\n2. Iterate through each digit in the original number a from left to right.\n\n3. For each digit in a, check if there's a digit in the sorted s list that is larger than the current digit. If so, replace it with the largest possible available digit (the first one in the sorted list), and remove that digit from the s list. Otherwise, leave the current digit as is.\n\nWait, but the sorted list is in descending order. So for each digit in a, we check if the first element in the sorted s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace and pop that element. Else, we can't improve this digit, so move on.\n\nThis way, we use the largest possible digits first on the leftmost positions where they can make a difference.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example.\n\nOriginal a is '1024', s is '010'.\n\nSorted s is ['1','0','0'].\n\nNow, iterate through each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. The first element in s is '1', which is equal. So no replacement here. Because replacing with same digit doesn't help. So we leave it.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. The first element in s is '1' which is larger. So replace it with '1'. Remove '1' from s. Now s is ['0','0'].\n\nThird digit is '2'. The first element in s is '0', which is smaller. So no replacement.\n\nFourth digit is '4'. Same as above. No replacement.\n\nResult is 1124. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: the input is '987' and s is '1234567'.\n\nSo sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nOriginal a is 987.\n\nCheck first digit '9'. The first element in s is 7, which is smaller. So no replacement. Second digit is '8', s's first is 7, again smaller. Third digit is '7', same as first element. So no replacement. So the result is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a is '123', s is '543'. Sorted s is ['5','4','3'].\n\nProcess first digit '1' -> replace with 5. Now s is ['4','3']. Next digit is '2' -> replace with 4. s is ['3']. Next digit is '3' -> replace with 3. So result is 543. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '999'. Then replace all digits, resulting in 999.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '99'. Replace first two digits, resulting in 991.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is a, which is a string. The second line is s, which is a string. Then, process as follows:\n\nSort the s in descending order. Then, for each character in a, check if the first element in the sorted s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace and pop the first element. Else, leave as is.\n\nBut how to handle the sorted s? Let's think in Python terms.\n\nFor example, s is a string, say '010'. We can convert it into a list, then sort in reverse order. So sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True). Then, for each digit in a, check if sorted_s is not empty and sorted_s[0] > current_digit. If so, replace and pop the first element.\n\nYes. So the code steps would be:\n\nRead a as a string.\n\nRead s as a string.\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\nThen, for each index in a:\n\n   if sorted_s is not empty and sorted_s[0] > a[i]:\n\n       replace a[i] with sorted_s[0], then pop the first element of sorted_s.\n\n   else:\n\n       leave as is.\n\nBut wait, since sorted_s is sorted in reverse order, and we want to use the largest possible digits first. So for each position, we check if the largest available digit is larger than current digit. If yes, replace. Else, no.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut in Python, popping from the front of a list is O(n) time. But since m can be up to 1e5, and n up to 1e5, then for each operation, popping from the front would be O(m) time. Which would lead to O(m^2) time in worst case. Which would be 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but for m up to 1e5, and for each step, popping from the front, which is O(1) if we use a deque. Wait, but in Python, popping from the front of a list is O(n) because it requires shifting elements. So using a deque would be better. Because deque.popleft() is O(1).\n\nSo perhaps, we should convert the sorted s into a deque, and then for each element in a, check if the deque is not empty and the first element is larger than current digit. If yes, replace and popleft(). Else, leave.\n\nYes. So that's more efficient.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read a as a string.\n\n- Read s as a string.\n\n- Convert s into a list, sort in descending order, then make a deque.\n\nWait, but sorted in reverse order. For example, '010' becomes ['1','0','0'].\n\nThen, deque is ['1','0','0'].\n\nSo, for each digit in a:\n\ncurrent_digit = a[i]\n\nif deque is not empty and deque[0] > current_digit:\n\n   replace a[i] with deque[0], then deque.popleft()\n\nelse:\n\n   do nothing.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\na_str = input().strip()\n\ns_str = input().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n\ns_deque = deque(sorted_s)\n\nresult = []\n\nfor digit in a_str:\n\n    if s_deque and s_deque[0] > digit:\n\n        result.append(s_deque.popleft())\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append(digit)\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. However, the original a does not have leading zeros. So, when replacing digits, can we introduce leading zeros?\n\nFor example, if a is '100' and s is '000'. Then the code would replace the first digit (1) with 0? Which would make the number 000, but the output should not have leading zeros. But according to the problem statement, the original a does not have leading zeros, but after replacement, could we have leading zeros?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output should not have leading zeros. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input a doesn't have leading zeros. But when we replace digits, for example, if the first digit is replaced with a zero, then the output would have leading zero. Which is not allowed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output must not have leading zeros. So, how to handle that?\n\nWait, but in the code above, the code would replace the first digit with a zero only if the first digit is smaller than the first element in the sorted s. For example, suppose a is '100', and s is '000'. Then the sorted s is ['0','0','0'], and the code would check for each digit:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. The first element in deque is '0' which is less than '1'. So no replacement. So the code leaves it as '1', then the rest digits are replaced with 0s. So the output is '100' which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a is '100', s is '000'. Then the code will not replace the first digit. So the output is 100. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a is '000' (but according to the problem statement, the input a doesn't have leading zeros, so this case is not possible). So the original a is not allowed to have leading zeros. So the code can assume that the original a is valid. But during replacement, can we have leading zeros?\n\nOnly if the first digit is replaced with a zero. But in that case, the code would have to avoid that. Wait, but the original a's first digit is non-zero. So, for example, if a is '100', and s is '0', then the code would check if the first digit (1) can be replaced with 0. Since 0 is less than 1, the code would not replace it. So the output is 100. So no leading zeros.\n\nAnother example: a is '100', s is '100'. Then sorted s is ['1','0','0']. So for first digit '1', the first element is '1', which is equal. So no replacement. So the code leaves it as '1', then the next digits are 0 and 0. So the output is 100. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the original a is '100' and s is '200'? Then sorted s is ['2','0','0']. The first digit is 1, which is replaced with 2. Then the next digits are 0 and 0, and the s deque is ['0','0']. So the output is 200. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a is '100', s is '100'. Then the code would not replace any digits. So the output is 100.\n\nSo the code is safe. Because the original a has no leading zeros. The code will not replace the first digit with a smaller digit. Because the code only replaces when the digit in s is larger than the current digit. So the first digit can only be replaced with a larger digit. So leading zeros can't be introduced. Because the original first digit is non-zero, and the code would only replace it with a larger digit (so non-zero). Or if the first digit is replaced with same digit (but that's not useful, but the code doesn't replace in that case). So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst case:\n\na is '1024', s is '010'\n\nsorted s is ['1', '0', '0']\n\nProcessing:\n\ndigit '1' → compare with '1' (equal), so no replacement. So append '1'.\n\ndigit '0' → compare with '1' (which is larger). So replace with '1', deque becomes ['0','0'].\n\ndigit '2' → compare with '0' (smaller). No replacement. Append '2'.\n\ndigit '4' → compare with '0' → no. Append '4'.\n\nResult is '1124', correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\na is '987', s is '1234567'.\n\nsorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing:\n\ndigit '9' → compare with '7' → no. Append '9'.\n\ndigit '8' → compare with '7' → no. Append '8'.\n\ndigit '7' → compare with '7' → equal. No replacement. Append '7'.\n\nResult is '987', correct.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nAnother test case: a is '123', s is '543'.\n\nsorted s is ['5','4','3'].\n\nProcessing:\n\ndigit '1' → 5>1 → replace. deque becomes ['4','3'].\n\ndigit '2' → 4>2 → replace. deque becomes ['3'].\n\ndigit '3' → 3 is equal. So no replacement. So result is 543.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a is '111', s is '999'.\n\nsorted s is ['9','9','9'].\n\nEach digit is replaced. Result is '999'.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '99'.\n\nAfter replacement, first two digits are replaced with 9, third remains. Result is 991.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '111'. Then the code will not replace anything. So output is 111.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead a_str and s_str.\n\nThen sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True). Then make a deque.\n\nBut in Python, deque is from collections.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\na_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ns_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\ns_deque = deque(sorted_s)\n\nresult = []\nfor digit in a_str:\n    if s_deque and s_deque[0] > digit:\n        result.append(s_deque.popleft())\n    else:\n        result.append(digit)\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nWait, but in the input, the first line is a, which is a positive integer, and the second line is s. So reading with readline().strip() is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\nWait, but in the actual input, the first line is the a, and the second line is the s. So for example, the first input line is '1024' followed by a new line, then the second line is '010'.\n\nBut in the code, the first readline() would get '1024\\n' (assuming that the input is read as per the problem's input description). Wait, but in the problem's input description, the first line is a, the second line is s. So in the code, the first line is read as a_str, the second line as s_str.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is written as two lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n1024\n\n010\n\nSo the code reads the first line as a_str, the second line as s_str.\n\nBut in the code, the code uses sys.stdin.readline().strip(), which would read the first line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline. So that's correct.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is given with multiple lines, perhaps the code needs to read two lines. So for example, in the sample input given, the first input is ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567'] — but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. The actual input is two lines, first line is a, second is s. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1024\n\n010\n\nThe code will read a_str as '1024', s_str as '010'.\n\nsorted_s is sorted in reverse order: ['1', '0', '0'].\n\nThen, the code processes each digit:\n\n1: deque[0] is '1', which is equal. So append '1'.\n\n0: deque[0] is '1' which is larger. So replace, append '1', deque becomes ['0','0'].\n\n2: deque[0] is '0' which is smaller. Append '2'.\n\n4: same as above. Append '4'.\n\nResult is '1124'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n987\n\n1234567\n\nsorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\n9: 7 < 9 → no replacement. Append '9'.\n\n8: 7 < 8 → no. Append '8'.\n\n7: 7 ==7 → no. Append '7'.\n\nResult is '987'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase where a is 1-digit, and s is longer. For example, a is '5', s is '999'. Then the code replaces '5' with '9', and the rest of s is ignored. Output is '9'.\n\nAnother edge case: a is '5', s is '4'. Then the code will not replace. Output is '5'.\n\nAnother edge case: a is '0' (but according to the problem statement, the input a doesn't have leading zeros. So this is allowed as a single digit. But according to the problem statement, the input a is a positive integer. So a can't be zero. So the code can assume that a is non-zero and has no leading zeros.\n\nBut in the code, even if a is '0' (but the problem says that it's not possible), the code would process it. But the problem says that the input a doesn't have leading zeros, so the code can proceed safely.\n\nAnother case: a is '1000', s is '9999'. Then sorted s is ['9','9','9','9'].\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst digit '1' is replaced with 9. Then the next three digits are 0, which are replaced with 9, 9, 9. So the result is 9999.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: a is '1000', s is '999'. Then the code replaces first three digits. The result is 9990.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits provided. The goal is to use the digits from the sequence in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible, without introducing leading zeros.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence Digits**: First, we sort the given sequence of digits in descending order. This allows us to use the largest available digits first, which is crucial for maximizing the number.\n2. **Iterate Through the Number**: For each digit in the given number, we check if the largest available digit from the sorted sequence can replace the current digit to make the number larger.\n3. **Use a Deque for Efficient Replacement**: Using a deque (double-ended queue) allows efficient removal of elements from the front, which is necessary as we process each digit of the number from left to right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n    s_deque = deque(sorted_s)\n    \n    result = []\n    for digit in a_str:\n        if s_deque and s_deque[0] > digit:\n            result.append(s_deque.popleft())\n        else:\n            result.append(digit)\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the integer `a` and the second line contains the sequence of digits `s`.\n2. **Sorting the Sequence**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order to prioritize using the largest digits first.\n3. **Processing Each Digit**: We iterate through each digit of the number `a`. For each digit, if the largest remaining digit from the sorted sequence is greater than the current digit, we replace it and remove that digit from the sequence. This ensures that we always use the most significant replacements first, maximizing the number's value.\n4. **Efficient Data Structure**: Using a deque allows efficient removal of the front element, ensuring that each replacement operation is done in constant time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently maximize the number by leveraging the largest available digits in the sequence while maintaining the constraints of no leading zeros and optimal performance.",
