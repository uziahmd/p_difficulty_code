In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The answer is the minimum number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output is the minimum number of tiles needed to draw to form a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each of the given three tiles, I need to check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal draws required.\n\nBut since there are three tiles, maybe they can be part of a mentsu with adding some more tiles. So for each possible way to form a mentsu, calculate how many tiles are needed to reach that state.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, check all possibilities of adding tiles to form a mentsu, and find the minimum required.\n\nBut how to check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me think. For the current three tiles, we can consider all possible ways to form a triplet or a sequence. For example, for triplet, check if there are three same tiles. But with three tiles, it's possible that two are same, and adding one more would make a triplet. Or maybe all three are different, but adding two more of the same.\n\nAlternatively, for sequences: the three tiles may form part of a sequence. For example, if they are 1s, 2s, 3s, then it's a sequence. If they are 1s, 2s, 4s, then adding a 3s would make a sequence. Or maybe adding another 1s and 2s? No, that's not helpful. Wait, the sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo the idea is: for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), determine how many tiles are needed to reach that mentsu, and take the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nSo first, for the current three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then for all possible mentsu that can be formed by adding some tiles, compute the required number of tiles to add, and choose the minimum.\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu that can be formed with the existing tiles plus some added ones?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: Forming a triplet (koutsu). For this, the triplet must consist of three identical tiles. So, for example, if the current tiles have two of the same tile, then we need to add one more. If there's only one, then add two more. If none, then add three. However, the existing tiles may have multiple copies. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, to form a triplet of 1m, you need to add one more. But maybe there's a better option.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows us to draw any tiles. So for the triplet case, the possible options are:\n\nCheck for all possible triplet types (each tile type). For each tile type, count how many of them are already present. Then, the number of tiles needed to form a triplet is 3 - count. But since the existing three tiles may have some of that tile.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles have two of a certain type, then adding one more gives a triplet. So for each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), calculate the required number of tiles to get three of them. Then take the minimum over all those possibilities.\n\nBut since the three tiles could have multiple counts of different types. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 1m, then the required is 0. If they are 1m, 1m, 2m, then for triplet of 1m, we need 1 more. For triplet of 2m, we need 2 more. For triplet of any other tile, like 3m, we need 3. So the minimum here is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, we can compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet. Then, compare that with the minimal number for sequences.\n\nCase 2: Forming a sequence (shuntsu). For this, the sequence must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, 1m, 2m, 3m. But",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a valid mentsu.
