His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to find the best and worst possible positions Vasya can have, given that his total is at least x.\n\nThe key here is that the participants are sorted by their total points (sum of first and second tour). If two have the same sum, the jury can assign their ranks in any way. So for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so he can be as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total (so others can have higher sums, pushing him down).\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let's think.\n\nFor the best possible rank: We need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible, but at least x. Then, count how many people have a total strictly greater than that value. The best rank would be that count plus 1. Because if there are k people with higher totals, then Vasya is at position k+1. But since the jury can arrange same totals, if there are others with same total as Vasya, they can be placed after him, so the best rank is when he has the maximum possible sum, and others with same sum are considered lower.\n\nWait, no. For best case, we want to maximize Vasya's sum (so that as few as possible people are above him). So the best possible scenario is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Then, the number of people with sum strictly greater than that is the number of people who are definitely above him. Then his best possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank: we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as low as possible (but still at least x). Then, the worst rank would be the number of people with sum strictly greater than that, plus the number of people with same sum as Vasya (since the jury can arrange them to be placed before him). Wait, no. Because if there are people with same sum as Vasya, the jury can place them before or after him. So for the worst case, we want to maximize the number of people who are either strictly better than him or same as him. So the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than his sum plus the number of people with sum equal to his sum (since in that case, they can be placed before him, making his rank worse).\n\nBut how do we find the best and worst possible scenarios?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible sum s that is >=x. Then, count how many people have sum strictly greater than s. Then the best rank is that count + 1.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible sum s for Vasya? Since Vasya's sum can be any a_i + b_j (but it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists with sum >=x). So to maximize s, we need to take the maximum possible a_i + b_j, but ensuring that it's >=x. Wait, no. Because if the maximum possible sum is higher than x, then that's the best. But if the maximum possible sum is less than x, then it's impossible. However, the problem says that it is guaranteed that there is at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nSo, for the best case, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + b_j, but considering that it must be >=x. Wait, no. Because Vasya's actual sum is at least x, but the maximum possible sum he could have is the maximum of all a_i + b_j. Because the teacher has to consider that Vasya could have any pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for best rank, we want to choose the maximum possible sum (so that as few people as possible are above him). So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but only considering pairs that are >=x. However, since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, but the maximum a_i + b_j could be higher than x. So for best case, the best possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible (a_i + b_j) over all possible pairs, but only those that are >=x. Wait, but why would we not take that maximum? Because if the maximum is higher",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the maximum and minimum possible sums Vasya could have and then determining how these sums affect his rank relative to other participants.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we maximize Vasya's total score. This is done by considering the maximum possible sum of scores from both tours for any participant. We then count how many participants have a higher total score than this maximum value.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it meets the minimum requirement. This is done by considering the minimum possible sum of scores from both tours that is at least the given minimum. We then count how many participants have a higher total score and add those with the same total score (since they can be placed before Vasya).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # For best place: find max possible sum >=x\n    max_sum = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s >= x:\n                if s > max_sum:\n                    max_sum = s\n    # Now count how many have sum > max_sum\n    count_best = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            if ai + bi > max_sum:\n                count_best += 1\n    best_place = count_best + 1\n    \n    # For worst place: find min possible sum >=x\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s >= x:\n                if s < min_sum:\n                    min_sum = s\n    # Now count how many have sum > min_sum and how many have sum == min_sum\n    count_worse = 0\n    equal_count = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s > min_sum:\n                count_worse += 1\n            elif s == min_sum:\n                equal_count += 1\n    worst_place = count_worse + 1 + equal_count\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into relevant parts for processing.\n- **Best Place Calculation**: The maximum possible sum Vasya can have is determined by iterating through all possible pairs of scores from the two tours. The number of participants with a higher total score than this maximum is counted to determine the best possible rank.\n- **Worst Place Calculation**: The minimum possible sum Vasya can have (while still meeting the minimum requirement) is determined. The number of participants with a higher total score and those with the same total score is counted to determine the worst possible rank.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve based on the given constraints.",
