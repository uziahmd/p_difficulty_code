She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So the goal is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the scenario. Initially, there are n tabs. The cursor is at pos. She needs to close all tabs not in [l, r]. So, the remaining tabs are exactly l to r. So, the problem is to find the minimal steps to reach a state where only those tabs are open.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], maybe there's nothing to do? Well, no, because there might be tabs outside that range that need to be closed. But how?\n\nWait, the closing operations can be done by moving to a certain position and then closing left or right. For instance, if she wants to close all tabs to the left of some position, she can do that in one second. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the key is to find the optimal way to close the left and right parts. Let's think about what needs to be closed. The tabs to the left of l (if any) and the tabs to the right of r (if any). So, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, then any tabs before 2 (like 1) and after 4 (like 5,6) need to be closed.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me consider the steps required. For example, suppose we need to close tabs on both sides. Let's take the first sample input: 6 3 2 4. So initial tabs are 1-6. pos is 3. Need to leave 2-4. So tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nThe optimal steps are:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second?), then close all left (which would close tab 1). Then move to tab 3 (maybe?), then move to tab 4 (another step), then close all right (tabs 5 and 6). So total steps: moving from 3 to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec), move to 3 (but maybe already there?), then move to 4 (another 1 sec?), then close right (another 1 sec). That's 1+1+1+1 = 4? But the sample output says 5. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: shift to 2 (1 sec?), close left (1 sec), then shift to 3 (another sec?), then to 4 (another sec?), then close right (another sec). Total 1+1+1+1+1=5. Oh right. So the steps are movement and actions. Each movement is a second. Each close is a second.\n\nSo, each operation (move left/right, or close left/right) takes one second. So, for example, moving from position 3 to 2 is one second. Then closing left is another second. So each action is one second.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal steps to perform the necessary closes, considering that you have to move to the correct positions to perform the closes.\n\nNow, the main idea is to determine whether we need to close the left side (i.e., tabs before l) and/or the right side (tabs after r). Let's think about the cases:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then no tabs need to be closed. So answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left side needs to be closed. For example, l=2, r=6. Then we need to close tabs to the left of l (i.e., tab 1). How to do that? We need to move to a position where we can close the left. For example, if the current position is at 3, then moving to position 2 (takes 1 sec) and then closing left (1 sec). But perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe we can close left from a higher position? Wait, no. Because closing left from position i closes all tabs from a to i-1. So, if we are at position l, then closing left would close all tabs from a (the min index) up to l-1. So, if l is 2, and the current position is 2, then closing left would close tabs from 1 to 1 (assuming a is 1). So that's correct.\n\nSo, to close the left part (tabs before l), we need to be at position l, and then close left. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs after",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Necessary Closures**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Cursor Position Analysis**: Calculate the movements required to reach the optimal positions for closing tabs on both sides of the segment [l, r].\n3. **Optimal Moves Calculation**: Compute the minimal steps required to move the cursor to the correct positions for closing the left and right tabs, considering whether the cursor is already within the target segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current segment is already the required one, no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine if we need to close left (tabs before l) and/or right (tabs after r)\n    close_left = l > 1\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    # Calculate steps needed\n    steps = 0\n\n    # If we need to close left, we need to move to l and close left\n    if close_left:\n        # Move to l from current pos\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps += 1\n\n    # If we need to close right, we need to move to r from the current position (after possible left close)\n    # But after closing left, the current position is at l. So from there, move to r\n    # Or if we didn't close left, we are still at pos\n    # So need to calculate the movement from the current position (after any left moves) to r\n    # Also, if we need to close right, we have to move to r and then close right\n    if close_right:\n        # The current position after handling left is l (if we closed left), else pos\n        if close_left:\n            steps += abs(l - r)\n        else:\n            steps += abs(pos - r)\n        steps += 1\n\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Immediate Case**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Closures Needed**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n3. **Calculate Movement Steps**: \n   - If closing tabs to the left is needed, move the cursor to `l` and close the left side.\n   - If closing tabs to the right is needed, move the cursor to `r` from the current position (after any left closure) and close the right side.\n4. **Sum Steps**: Sum the movement steps and the closing operations to get the total minimum seconds required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps by focusing on the necessary movements and closures, leveraging the allowed operations optimally.",
