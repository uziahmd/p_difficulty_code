The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. But wait, how?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say:\n\n- EvenChests: number of chests with even a_i.\n- OddChests: number of chests with odd a_i.\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\n- EvenKeys: number of keys with even b_j.\n- OddKeys: number of keys with odd b_j.\n\nNow, for each even chest, we need an odd key. For each odd chest, we need an even key. \n\nBut the problem is that the number of even chests might be more than the number of odd keys, or vice versa. So the maximum possible for even chests is the minimum between EvenChests and OddKeys. Similarly, for odd chests, it's the minimum between OddChests and EvenKeys. \n\nWait, yes! So the total maximum chests is min(EvenChests, OddKeys) + min(OddChests, EvenKeys). \n\nThat makes sense. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, but only up to the number of available odd keys. Similarly for the other case. \n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the answer. \n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parities:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So EvenChests = 3 (14,6,2), OddChests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So EvenKeys = 3 (8,4,20), OddKeys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(EvenChests=3, OddKeys=1) is 1. Then min(OddChests=2, EvenKeys=3) is 2. Total 3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So EvenChests=5, OddChests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So EvenKeys=0, OddKeys=1. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So EvenKeys=4, OddKeys=0. So min(EvenChests=1, OddKeys=0) is 0. min(OddChests=0, EvenKeys=4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches.\n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Count even and odd in chests.\n- Count even and odd in keys.\n- Compute min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count even and odd.\n\nCalculate the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple keys and chests? Like, if there are more keys than needed. But since each key can be used once, and each chest once, the min is correct. Because for example, if there are 5 even chests and 3 odd keys, you can only open 3 of them. Similarly for the other way.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, for handling",
