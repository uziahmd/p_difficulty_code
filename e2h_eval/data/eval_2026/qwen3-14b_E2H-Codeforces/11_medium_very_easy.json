A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input consists of n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl milliliters. Because each of them has to have nl for their toast. Similarly for the salt: each toast requires n * np grams of salt. And each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total drink available: k * l milliliters. Then, how many toasts can be made based on drink? Each toast requires n * nl ml. So total toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n2. Calculate total lime slices available: c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So total toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Calculate total salt available: p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum possible is the minimum of the three possible numbers.\n\nWait, let me check the example given. First input example:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends. \n\nDrink total is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per the problem statement: each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So per toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. \n\nIn the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So total toasts from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222... which floored to 2. Which matches the note's explanation. Then the limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666, floored to 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, the note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So for the first example, n=3, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices divided by 3 per toast gives 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that doesn't add up. Wait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 80 / 3 = 26.666. So why does the note say that?\n\nWait wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for the first example, 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 / 3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts. But in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That seems conflicting. Wait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? Because the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, it's 80 slices divided by 3 per toast. So 26.666. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misread the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. But the note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires one slice. So maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". So that's 80 slices. Which would be possible if each toast requires one slice. But that would be for one friend. But there are three friends. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait no, the problem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So the note's explanation seems incorrect. But according to the note's example, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. Which gives 2. Which is correct. But why is the limes 80 toasts? Because in that case, the limes would be sufficient for 80 toasts, but that would require that each toast uses one slice. But then, for three friends, each toast would need three slices. So the note's explanation seems to have an error.\n\nBut that's not possible. Let me think again. Maybe the note is correct and I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs one slice of lime. Therefore, for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for the first sample, 3 friends. Each toast requires 3 slices. So with 80 slices, the number of toasts possible is 80//3 = 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the number of toasts is 80. That implies that the per toast requirement is 1 slice. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How is that possible?\n\nWait the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. So the total slices is 80. So if each toast requires 1 slice, then 80 toasts can be made. But that would be for one person. But the problem says that all friends make the same number of toasts. So, for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, there are n slices required. Hence, the number of toasts possible from the limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the first sample, (10 * 8) // 3 = 80 //3 = 26. So the note's explanation must be wrong? But that's impossible. Let me check the note again. Oh, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Which implies that the limes are 80 toasts. But according to our calculation, the limes are 26 toasts. So that suggests that the note is considering the limes as 80 toasts. So what's the correct way here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\" So the note is taking the three values as 6, 80, 100, and then dividing by 3. But that would be wrong. Because the actual numbers should be 6 toasts from drink, 26 from limes, and 100 from salt. The minimum is 6, so the answer is 6 divided by 3? No, that would be 2. Which matches the answer. But why is the note saying that the limes are enough for 80 toasts? That seems like a mistake. Unless the problem is different than what I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts is determined per friend. So the total toasts per friend is t. Then, for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So total slices needed is n * t. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, and each toast requires one slice. So total slices needed is n * t.\n\nBut the total available is c*d. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n. So in the first sample, (10 * 8) //3 = 80//3=26. So the maximum t is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if the total slices required is t. So that would be if each toast requires one slice regardless of the number of friends. Which would be wrong.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3. So that suggests that the original values are 6, 80, 100. Then, the minimum is 6, divided by 3 gives 2. Which is the correct answer. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So per toast, per friend. So for one toast, each friend has one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So total slices needed is n * t. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut according to the note's explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that t is 80. Which would mean that the total slices required is 80. Which would be if t is 80, and n is 1. But in the first sample, n is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo why does the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is that the toasts are counted per friend. Like, the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t per friend. So for the limes, the total number of slices needed is t * n. So the maximum t is (c*d) // (n). So for the first sample, 80//3=26. So the note's explanation is wrong. But according to the sample input, the answer is 2. Which is min(6, 26, 100) =6. So the answer is 6. Which is the same as the note's explanation. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2. Which would be wrong. But the sample output is 2. So that suggests that the note is correct. How?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me re-calculate the first sample according to the note's explanation.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo:\n\nTotal drink: 4 *5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 friends *3ml per toast per friend =9ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Wait that's 20 divided by 3. Which would be if each toast requires 3ml total. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1ml. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for nl=3, each friend needs 3ml per toast. So for one toast, 3 friends *3ml =9ml. So 20ml would allow 2 toasts (2*9=18ml), with 2ml left. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be 6 *3ml = 18ml. So that would be if each toast requires 3ml total. Which would be if nl is 1ml per friend. But in the input, nl is 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nBut why is that? Because 20 divided by 3 is 6.666. So how does that relate to the drink?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem is that the total number of toasts is t, and each toast requires nl * n milliliters. Because for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. So the total drink available is k*l. So the number of toasts possible is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, that would be 20/(3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2 toasts. But according to the note, it's 20/3 =6. So this suggests that the formula is (k*l) // nl. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666 →6. Which would be the case if each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but for all friends. But that's not possible. \n\nThis is very confusing. How can the note's explanation be correct?\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. The first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'. The output is 2. According to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. So that suggests that the three values are 6, 80, 100. Which would be:\n\n- For drink: 20 /3 =6.666 →6. So the drink allows 6 toasts. \n\nBut why is that? How is that calculated? If each toast requires nl per friend, but for all friends, then the total per toast is nl * n. So in this case, 3 *3 =9. So 20 /9 = 2.222 → 2. So the note's explanation must be wrong. But the sample output is correct. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is different than what I thought. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: \n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for one toast, each friend drinks nl milliliters. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666 →6. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml of drink. Which would be if per toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if nl is 1 ml per friend. But in the input, nl is 3. \n\nThis is very confusing. How can the note's explanation be correct?\n\nWait perhaps the problem is that the friends make t toasts, and each toast is per friend. So for example, if there are 3 friends, and they each make t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t per friend. So the total amount of drink needed is t * n * nl. Because each toast per friend requires nl. So the total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the available drink is k * l. So t can be at most (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note's explanation, the drink is 20ml, and they say that it's enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink needed is 3 * t. So that would be if the total is t * nl. Which would be if per toast, the total is nl. But that would be if per toast, each friend has 1 toast. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts is t, and each toast is for all friends. For example, each toast is a round where all friends take part. So for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nIn that case, the first sample's drink is 20ml. So t is 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3 *3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2. Which is the correct value. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the denominator is 3 instead of 9. So why is the note's explanation like that? \n\nThis suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Not per friend. \n\nBut the problem statement says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each friend gets their own portion. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that the total drink per toast is 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 ml. So for 6 toasts, 18 ml. Which is possible. But why would that be the case?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the note. Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the sample input again. The first sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1. \n\nSo the drink is 4 *5 =20 ml. \n\nIf the number of toasts is t, then each toast requires for all friends: t * n * nl ml. So for t=2, that's 2*3*3=18 ml. Which fits into 20. \n\nBut according to the note, they say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which would be 6 *3*3=54 ml, which is more than 20. That's impossible. \n\nSo the note's explanation must be wrong. But the sample output is 2, which is correct. \n\nBut according to the note, they say that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. So the three numbers are 6, 80, 100. Which would be the drink, limes, and salt. \n\nSo let's think: what would give those numbers?\n\nDrink: 20 / (nl) = 20/3=6.666 →6. So that would be if the drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. \n\nLimes: c*d = 80. Divided by 1, giving 80. So that would be if the number of toasts is t, and each toast requires one slice per friend. But that would be n slices per toast. So the number of toasts would be (c*d) /n. \n\nSalt: p / (np) = 100 /1=100. Which would be if the salt is divided by np, not by n*np. \n\nSo this suggests that the three values are:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // nl \n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // 1 \n\nsalt_toasts = p // np \n\nThen, the answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts) //n \n\nBecause each toast requires n slices, and n * np grams of salt. \n\nBut that would be the case if the initial calculations were wrong. \n\nLet me try this for the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 /3 =6.666 →6. \n\nlime_toasts = 80 /1 =80. \n\nsalt_toasts = 100/1=100. \n\nThen, the min is 6. Then, divide by n=3 →6/3=2. Which is the sample output. \n\nThat would explain the note's explanation. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me re-express the problem. \n\nThe problem says that each friend needs to make t toasts. So for each friend, they need t toasts. \n\nFor each toast, each friend needs:\n\n- nl milliliters of drink. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl. Total for all friends: n * t * nl. \n\nBut the total drink available is k*l. So n*t*nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend has t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. Which must be ≤ c*d. So t ≤ (c*d) / n. \n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * np grams. Total for all friends: n * t * np. Which must be ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np). \n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np). \n\nBut in the note's explanation, they seem to calculate (k*l)/nl, (c*d)/1, p/np, and then take the minimum and divide by n. \n\nWhich would give the same result as the above. \n\nBecause:\n\n(k*l)/(n*nl) = ((k*l)/nl)/n. \n\nSimilarly for the others. \n\nSo, the note's explanation is taking the three values as (k*l)/nl, (c*d)/1, p/np, then taking the minimum of those three, and dividing by n. \n\nWhich is the same as the correct approach. \n\nSo, the correct way to compute t is to take the minimum of:\n\n- (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\n- (c*d) // n \n\n- p // (n * np)\n\nBut the note's explanation seems to take the first as (k*l) // nl, then divide by n. \n\nBut mathematically, both approaches are equivalent. \n\nBecause (k*l) // (n * nl) = floor( (k*l)/ (n * nl) ), which is equal to floor( ( (k*l)/nl ) /n ). \n\nBut since integer division is involved, it's possible that the two approaches could yield different results. However, in the first sample, the note's approach gives the correct answer. \n\nSo perhaps the way to compute it is:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum number of toasts possible, then take the minimum of those. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me re-calculate the first sample using the correct approach. \n\nFor drink: total is 20. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 *3 =9. So 20//9 =2. \n\nLimes: c*d=80, divided by n=3 → 80//3=26. \n\nSalt: p=100, divided by (n * np) =3*1=3 → 100//3=33. \n\nThe minimum of 2,26,33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nBut the note's explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, which is (k*l)/nl =20/3=6.666 →6. Then divided by n=3 gives 2. \n\nWhich is the same as the correct approach. \n\nSo the note's explanation is taking the three values as (k*l)//nl, (c*d)//1, p//np, then taking the minimum of those and dividing by n. \n\nBut why is that correct? \n\nBecause:\n\nThe maximum number of toasts per friend is t. \n\nThe drink required is n * t * nl <= k*l → t <= (k*l) / (n * nl) → t_max_drink = floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nBut (k*l) / (n * nl) = (k*l / nl) /n → t_max_drink = floor( (k*l / nl) /n )\n\nWhich is the same as floor( (k*l / nl) ) //n ?\n\nNo, not exactly. For example, if (k*l / nl) is not an integer, then floor((k*l / nl)/n) may be different from floor(k*l / nl) //n. \n\nBut in practice, since we are doing integer division, perhaps the two approaches are equivalent. \n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, the correct way is to calculate each of the three resources' maximum t as described earlier. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l \n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d \n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(total_drink_toasts, total_lime_toasts, total_salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes, that's the correct approach. \n\nLet me test this against the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2 \n\ntotal_lime_toasts= 80//3=26 \n\ntotal_salt_toasts= 100//(3*1)=33 \n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Correct. \n\nThe note's explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, which is 20//3=6. Then divided by 3 gives 2. Which is the same as the correct approach. \n\nSo the code should be written as follows:\n\nRead the input values n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. \n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l \n\ndrink_toasts = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d \n\nlime_toasts = lime_total // n \n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's test the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000. \n\ndrink_toasts = 1000 / (5*4) = 1000/(20) =50. \n\nlime_total =1 *19=19. lime_toasts =19//5=3. \n\nsalt_toasts: p=90, divided by (5*3)=15 → 90//15=6. \n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3. \n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1,000,000. \n\ndrink_toasts = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000. \n\nlime_total =25 *23=575. lime_toasts =575 //10 =57. \n\nsalt_toasts: p=1, divided by (10 *1) =10 → 1//10=0. \n\nso min(2000,57,0) →0. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows. \n\nRead the input line as integers. Then compute the three values and take the minimum. \n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input line. Split into integers. \n\nFor example, in Python:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l \n\ndrink_toasts = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d \n\nlime_toasts = lime_total // n \n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. \n\nNow, testing the first sample:\n\nInput line is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → drink_total=4*5=20, n=3, nl=3 → 3*3=9 → 20//9=2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nNow, edge cases. What if any of the denominators is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero. \n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. Like the third sample. \n\nAnother case: when all three are zero. But since inputs are positive, probably not. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Toast Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend.\n   - **Lime Slices Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available, considering each toast requires one slice per friend.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering each toast requires a specific amount of salt per friend.\n3. **Determine Minimum Limit**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum of the three calculated limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as `k * l`, where `k` is the number of bottles and `l` is the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Drink Limit for Toasts**: The number of toasts possible with the available drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast, which is `n * nl` (where `n` is the number of friends and `nl` is the milliliters per toast per friend).\n3. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d` (where `c` is the number of limes and `d` is the number of slices per lime). The number of toasts possible with these slices is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast, which is `n`.\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is `p` grams. The number of toasts possible with this salt is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast, which is `n * np` (where `np` is the grams of salt per toast per friend).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum of the three limits calculated above, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts each friend can make.",
