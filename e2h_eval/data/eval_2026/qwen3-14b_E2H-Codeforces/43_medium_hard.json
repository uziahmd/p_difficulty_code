He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nFirst, A has a string of some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the number of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have:\n\n- All 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. Like, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's not possible.\n\nSo first check: the string must consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So the characters must be in order a...ab...bc...c. So any deviation from that order is automatically a NO.\n\nFor example, the second example input is 'bbacc'. Let's see: the order is b, then a, which is invalid. Because after B appends the b's, the string is all a's followed by b's. Then C appends c's. So the order must be a's then b's then c's. So any occurrence of a 'b' followed by an 'a' would be invalid. Similarly, any 'c's before the end would be invalid.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do that?\n\nWe can check the order by looking at the transitions between characters. For example, the string should have a's first, then once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no more a's. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no more a's or b's.\n\nSo for the string S:\n\n- All a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. So the string should be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo first, check that the string is in this format. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then proceed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem statement, after B appends the b's, the string has some a's and b's. Then C appends c's. The number of c's must be equal to the number of a's (original count) or the number of b's (original count). But wait, when C appends the c's, the number of a's and b's in the string is the same as before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after.\n\nSo the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But since the original count_a is the same as the count_a in the final string (since no a's are added after), and same for count_b.\n\nWait, yes. Because the original count of a's is count_a, and the original count of b's is count_b. Then, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's remains the same. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the initial steps: the original string (before adding c's) must have at least one a and one b. Because B made sure that after appending the b's, there's at least one a and one b. So the count_a and count_b must be at least 1. However, since the final string has count_a and count_b as the same as before adding the c's, then the count_a and count_b in the final string must be >=1. But the count_c can be zero? No, because C appends some number of c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of c's must be at least 1. Because \"some number\" implies that it's at least one. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nSo the number of c's added must be equal to count_a or count_b (from before adding the c's). But since the count of a's and b's in the string before adding c's is at least 1 (because B made sure that after appending the b's, there's at least one a and one b), then the number of c's added is at least 1. Therefore, the count_c in the final string must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original), and count_c must be >=1. However, the original count_a and count_b are at least 1, so count_c will be at least 1.\n\nBut in the final string, count_c is equal to count_a_original (which is count_a in the final string) or count_b_original (which is count_b in the final string). So, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n1. The string must be in the form a*b*c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n3. Also, count_a must be >=1 and count_b >=1. Because B made sure that after appending the b's, there's at least one a and one b. So even if the original string was just a single a, then B added at least one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. So in the final string, count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 'aabbc', then count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 1. Then, count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b. So it's invalid. But if the string is 'aabcc', then count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) or count_b (2). So it's valid.\n\nSo, steps to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, check the order of the string. Are all a's first, then b's, then c's?\n\nHow to check that? Well, we can iterate through the string and make sure that once a 'b' is encountered, there are no more 'a's. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there are no more 'a's or 'b's.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into parts. For example, the string should have a section of a's, then a section of b's, then a section of c's. So, the string can be divided into three parts. So, for example, the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then the rest are c's.\n\nSo, perhaps we can check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. How?\n\nWe can check that the string does not have any 'a's after the first occurrence of 'b', and no 'b's after the first occurrence of 'c'.\n\nAnother way: the string must be in the form a*b*c*. So, for example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, here's a way to check:\n\nCheck that the string is made up of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts:\n\n- All a's (possibly zero length?), but no, wait. Because the original string from A is some number of a's. Then B appends some number of b's. So the original string before adding c's has at least one a and one b. So the count_a and count_b in the final string are at least 1. So the string must have at least one a and one b. So the count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Also, count_c >=1, since C appends some number of c's.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_a, count_b, count_c must all be >=1?\n\nWait, no. Because the count_c is the number of c's added. Which is equal to count_a or count_b (from before adding the c's). So count_c is at least 1. So the final string must have count_c >=1.\n\nSo in the final string, the counts are:\n\ncount_a >=1 (since original A's string had some a's, and B didn't add any a's. Then C didn't add any a's.)\n\ncount_b >=1 (since B added some number of b's, ensuring that there's at least one.)\n\ncount_c >=1 (since C added some number of c's.)\n\nSo the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Wait, no. Wait, the original string before adding c's has at least one a and one b. Then C adds some c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So the total string must have at least one of each. So if the string has no c's, then it's invalid. But according to the problem statement, the C appends some number of c's, which must be at least one. So the final string must have at least one c.\n\nTherefore, in the final string, count_a, count_b, count_c must all be >=1.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a*b*c*, i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n2. Check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n3. Check that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is a's followed by c's? For example, 'aacc'? Well, in that case, the string would not have any b's. So count_b is zero. Which violates condition 2. So that would be invalid.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck that the string is in order a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be split into three parts. So, the first part is all a's, then the next part is all b's, then the rest are all c's.\n\nSo, for example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's. And the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, let's find the positions where the characters change.\n\nAnother approach: check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the order a < b < c. So, for example, each character must be >= the previous one. Because a comes first, then b, then c. So, the string must be such that each character is not less than the previous one. For example, 'aaabbbccc' is okay. 'aabbc' is okay. But 'abba' is not, because after the first 'b', there's an 'a'.\n\nSo, for the string to be in order, for every i from 1 to len(S)-1, S[i] must be >= S[i-1].\n\nYes. Because if the string is in order a's followed by b's followed by c's, then each character is >= the previous one. So checking that the string is non-decreasing in terms of the order a < b < c would ensure that.\n\nSo, for example, 'aabbc' is okay, 'aabbcc' is okay, 'abac' is not (since after the 'a' comes 'b', then 'a' again which is less than 'b').\n\nSo, the first check is that the string is non-decreasing in the order a < b < c.\n\nSo, code for that:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return NO\n\nBut how to check that? For example, 'a' is allowed? Well, no, because in that case, count_b is 0, count_c is 0. But according to the problem, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So, the string must have all three.\n\nSo, the first check is that the string is non-decreasing (so the order is correct), and that the counts of a, b, c are all at least 1.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nOnce that is checked, then check the counts.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing (each character is >= previous).\n\nCheck that the counts of a, b, c are all >= 1.\n\nThen check that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? Then count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So count_c is equal to both count_a and count_b. Which is allowed.\n\nAnother example: 'aaabbbccc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3 → yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc'? count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is not equal to either count_a or count_b. So answer is no.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing in terms of a < b < c.\n\nCheck that counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nCheck that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all of these are true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSecond example input: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than the previous 'b' → the string is not non-decreasing. So the first check fails. Hence output is NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. The string is a a b c → non-decreasing. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So yes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these examples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. count_c is 1 which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nCase 2: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. count_c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nCase 3: 'aabcc' → a=2, b=1, c=2. count_c equals a (2). So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a=1, b=3, c=1. count_c equals a (1). So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → the string is non-decreasing, but count_c is zero. So the check for counts would fail. So output is no.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → the string is non-decreasing (a followed by c). But there are no b's. So count_b is zero. So check fails.\n\nSo the code would correctly output no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts are a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nWhat about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc'? counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' → counts are a=2, b=2, c=1. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nSo the code would return no.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the string S.\n\nThen, check that the string is non-decreasing.\n\nWe can loop through each character from index 1 to end, and check if current character is less than previous. If any such case, then return NO.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that each count is >=1.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nThen check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck for order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit.\n\nThen count a, b, c.\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'?\n\ncount_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So the code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1). So yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'abbcc' → count_a is 1, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaabbbcc' → counts a=3, b=3, c=2. So count_c is neither equal to a nor b. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, read the input string.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S. So in the example, the input is given as ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'] but that's probably for the sample input. But in reality, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single string. The sample input shows that the user provided a list of strings, but that's probably for the example. For example, in the sample input, the first example input is 'aaabccc', which is the string. So the code must read a single string.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the input is a single string. The sample input shows that in the example, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably a mistake in formatting. Probably, the actual input is a single string. For example, the first example input is 'aaabccc', and the output is 'YES'.\n\nSo the code should read a single string from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is written as a list, but that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So the code should read one line from input, and process it.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead S = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed with the checks.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check order\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\n# Count a, b, c\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'abba'? The code would check for order. The first character is 'a', then 'b' (ok), then 'b' (ok), then 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the loop would detect that and print 'NO'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? The code would pass the order check, counts are all >=1, and count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2). So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? Then the order check would fail. Because after the first two a's, then two b's, then a 'a' comes again. So the code would detect that and return no.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a. So output is YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', ... which is invalid. So code returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. So passes. count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. count_c equals count_b. So output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → count_c is 0. So code returns no.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → count_b is 0. So code returns no.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So 1 is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbc'?\n\nThe order is a's, then b's, then c's. So the code passes the order check. count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 1. So count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, think about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So yes.\n\nBut what about when the count_c equals both count_a and count_b? That's allowed.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about when the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc'? counts are 4,4,4. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbcc' → count_a=4, count_b=3, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all the cases.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order.
