The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts have much larger values. Therefore, ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. But the challenge is ensuring that they are all connected. Because if you remove some lower-numbered districts, maybe you can keep the higher ones connected.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Let me think. The tree structure is given. Since the districts are connected in a tree, removing some districts would split the tree into parts. But the president wants the remaining districts to be connected. So the problem reduces to choosing a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i for those nodes is maximized. Then, the districts not in this subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree?\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the highest possible numbers, perhaps we should prioritize keeping the largest-numbered districts. However, we need them to be connected. So maybe the approach is to start with the largest districts and then add their necessary connections.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes. To maximize the sum, we need to select the nodes with the highest possible values. But since the tree is connected, we need to ensure that these nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since the value of each node is 2^i, the sum is maximized when we include the nodes with the largest i's possible. So the optimal strategy would be to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and exclude the lower ones. However, the problem is that including those high-numbered nodes may require that certain lower-numbered nodes are included to connect them.\n\nFor example, suppose there's a tree where node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1. If we want to keep node 6, we might have to include node 2, and maybe node 1. But if we can remove node 1, then we can have node 2 and 6 connected. But if we have to remove k nodes, perhaps we can choose to remove the lower-numbered ones that are not needed for connecting the higher ones.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to perform a greedy selection: we want to keep the largest nodes, but we need to make sure that they are connected. How can we do that?\n\nAnother idea: The optimal subtree will consist of the nodes with the largest possible numbers, but possibly excluding some lower-numbered nodes that are not necessary for connectivity. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to select the nodes with the largest values, and then check if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes that connect them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing which nodes to exclude. We need to exclude k nodes, such that the remaining nodes are connected. The way to maximize the sum is to exclude the nodes with the smallest values possible, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but the sum is the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes. So the sum is maximized when we keep the nodes with the highest possible i's. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting (n -k) nodes with the highest possible i's, and ensuring that they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to find the minimal set of nodes (with lower i's) to add to connect them, but that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that the highest nodes are connected. For example, suppose we have nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's say we want to keep nodes 6,5,4,3,2, and remove 1. But if node 6 is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 1, then removing node 1 would disconnect node 2 from the rest. Wait, no. If the tree is structured such that node 2 is connected to node 6 and node 1. So if we remove node 1, then the remaining nodes (including 2 and 6) are connected. So maybe the problem is that if the highest-numbered nodes are connected through some lower-numbered nodes, but those lower-numbered nodes are not part of the kept set, then they would be disconnected.\n\nBut how to ensure that the kept nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nAn alternative approach: Think of the problem as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. The way to do this is to start with the highest-numbered node, and then add nodes in a way that connects them.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe using a priority queue approach where we select the nodes with the highest values, and then check if they are connected. But that seems computationally intensive for large n.\n\nAlternatively, since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and their values are 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i. So the optimal solution must include the highest possible nodes, but possibly exclude some lower ones. So, the idea is to select the nodes with the highest possible numbers, and then find the minimal set of lower-numbered nodes that are required to connect them.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe need to select a subset S of size (n -k) nodes, which is connected. To maximize the sum, S should contain the nodes with the largest possible numbers. Therefore, the optimal S is the set of (n -k) nodes with the largest numbers, but adjusted to be connected.\n\nBut how to adjust them. Suppose that the nodes with numbers from (k+1) to n are not connected. Then, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nWait, but the initial selection of the top (n -k) nodes may not be connected. So the problem is to find which nodes to include from the lower numbers to connect them.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother thought: The optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number, because otherwise, if we exclude it, we could include it and exclude a lower-numbered node, which would give a higher sum. So the highest-numbered node must be in the optimal subtree. Similarly, the next highest, etc., but only if they can be connected.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a tree where we want to keep the highest nodes, and for each node, decide whether to include it or not based on whether it's necessary for connectivity.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a priority-based approach, using a maximum spanning tree concept. Wait, but perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: Since the tree is connected, and we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, perhaps we can use a greedy approach where we start from the highest-numbered node and perform a traversal (like BFS or DFS), adding nodes in order of their value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting which nodes to remove. The nodes to remove are the ones with the smallest values, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this is not straightforward because removing a low-value node may not affect connectivity. But how to find which ones to remove.\n\nWait, but the problem is similar to finding a spanning tree with certain constraints. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the nodes that must be kept. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, the optimal solution is to keep all nodes except for the k smallest ones, but only if they form a connected component. However, that may not be the case. For example, if the k smallest nodes are spread out in the tree such that removing them leaves the rest disconnected.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nLet me take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nThe nodes are numbered 1-6. The desired output is to remove 1,3,4. So the kept nodes are 2,5,6. Which are connected via 2-6 and 6-5. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nBut if we had kept the top 3 nodes (6,5,4), but they are not connected. Because node 4 is connected to node 2, which is connected to 6, but node 4 is not connected to 5 or 6 unless node 2 is present. So to have 4,5,6 connected, we need node 2. But then that's 4 nodes. But in the sample, they remove 3 nodes, so kept 3 nodes. So the optimal is to keep 2,5,6, which are connected.\n\nSo the idea is that the nodes to keep are the ones with the highest values, but including some lower-numbered nodes that are necessary to connect them.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the approach is to perform a priority-based selection. Start with the highest node, then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes with size (n -k) that is connected, and has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes' numbers, we can model this as selecting the nodes with the largest possible numbers, and ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal set of nodes (with the largest numbers) that form a connected subtree. To do this, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach where we start with the highest node, and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a reverse process. We need to remove k nodes. The nodes to remove are those with the smallest numbers, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this is not directly applicable because removing some small nodes may not disconnect the tree.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to remove the k nodes with the smallest numbers that are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, but how to determine which nodes are necessary. For example, if you have a tree where node 1 is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 3. If you want to keep nodes 2 and 3, you can't remove node 1. But if you want to keep node 2 and 3, you can do that by removing node 1. Wait, no. Because node 2 and 3 are connected directly. So if node 2 is connected to node 3, then removing node 1 would leave nodes 2 and 3 connected. So in that case, node 1 can be safely removed.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to selecting the nodes to keep as follows: keep all nodes except the k smallest ones, but if that set is connected. If it's not connected, then we need to find which nodes to remove (from the smaller ones) to allow the rest to be connected.\n\nBut how to check if the set of nodes with numbers from (m) to n is connected. For example, m is the smallest number in the kept set. But that may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the following: the optimal set of nodes to keep is the set of all nodes except the k nodes with the smallest values, but adjusted to ensure that the set is connected. So, if the set of nodes with numbers from (s) to n (where s is the smallest number in the kept set) is connected, then that's the optimal. Otherwise, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible numbers. So we can use a priority queue (max heap) approach, starting with the highest node, and then adding nodes that are connected to the current set, choosing the next highest possible node.\n\nThis sounds like a modified BFS or DFS approach, where we always pick the next highest node that is connected to the current set.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize a set of kept nodes as empty. Start with the highest-numbered node (n). Add it to the kept set. Then, for each step, find the highest-numbered node not yet in the kept set, and check if it is connected to the kept set. If yes, add it. If not, then we need to find a way to connect it. But how?\n\nWait, but how to check if a node is connected to the current kept set. That would require knowing the paths between nodes, which could be time-consuming for large trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph traversal where we keep track of the nodes that are part of the kept set, and for each node not in the set, we check if any of its neighbors are in the set. If so, then we can add it.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nWe want to select (n -k) nodes. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. We start with the highest-numbered node (n) as part of the kept set.\n\n2. Then, we look for the next highest-numbered node that is adjacent to the current kept set. We add it to the kept set.\n\n3. Repeat this until the kept set has (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the next highest node adjacent to the kept set.\n\nThis sounds like a priority queue approach. Here's the idea:\n\n- Maintain a priority queue (max heap) of candidate nodes that can be added to the kept set. Initially, the queue contains the highest node (n).\n\n- Also maintain a visited set of nodes that are already in the kept set.\n\n- While the size of the kept set is less than (n -k):\n\n   - Extract the node with the highest number from the priority queue.\n\n   - Add it to the kept set.\n\n   - For each neighbor of this node, if it hasn't been added to the kept set, add it to the priority queue.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are always adding the highest possible nodes that are connected to the kept set. Because once a node is added to the kept set, its neighbors are considered for addition.\n\nBut wait, this is exactly Prim's algorithm for finding a maximum spanning tree. Because we are building a tree (the kept set) by greedily adding the highest possible nodes connected to the existing set.\n\nYes! So, the problem can be viewed as finding a maximum spanning tree (MST) where the edge weights are not important, but the node weights are. Wait, but MST is about edges. However, here, the goal is to select a connected subtree with as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut in this case, the approach of Prim's algorithm can be adapted. Because the priority is on the nodes, not the edges. So, the algorithm builds a tree by selecting the highest-numbered nodes first, and adding their neighbors to the priority queue.\n\nThis way, the kept set forms a connected subtree, and contains the highest possible nodes.\n\nOnce we have this kept set of (n -k) nodes, the nodes not in this set are the ones to be removed. And since we selected the highest possible nodes, the sum is maximized.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Use a max-heap (priority queue) to select nodes in order of their value.\n\n- Start with the highest node (n).\n\n- For each step, extract the node with the highest value from the heap. Add it to the kept set.\n\n- Then, for all its neighbors, if they are not yet in the kept set, add them to the priority queue.\n\n- Repeat until the kept set has (n -k) nodes.\n\nOnce we have this set, the nodes not in it are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut wait, how does this ensure that we get the maximum sum? Because each time we add the highest possible node that is connected to the current set. This way, we are always including the largest possible nodes first, which would maximize the sum.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Because if you have two nodes A and B, where A has a higher value than B, and both are connected to the current set, you would choose A first, which contributes more to the sum.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe need to represent the tree as an adjacency list. For each node, store its neighbors.\n\nWe need a priority queue (max heap) that holds candidate nodes. However, since Python's heapq module is a min-heap, we can simulate a max-heap by inserting negative values.\n\nBut also, we need to avoid adding the same node multiple times to the heap. For example, when a node is added to the heap, but hasn't been processed yet. Once it's processed (i.e., added to the kept set), we don't want to process it again.\n\nSo, we can have a visited array (or set) that keeps track of nodes that have been added to the kept set.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the n-1 edges and build an adjacency list.\n\nInitialize a max-heap. Since Python's heapq is min-heap, we can push negative numbers.\n\nStart with node n. Push it into the heap.\n\nInitialize a visited array (size n+1, since nodes are 1-based). Mark node n as visited.\n\nkept_count = 1.\n\nresult = a list to collect the nodes to remove.\n\nWhile kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current_node = pop the max from the heap (using heappop on the negative values)\n\n   for each neighbor of current_node:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         mark as visited\n\n         add to the heap\n\n         increment kept_count by 1?\n\nWait, no. Because when we add a neighbor to the heap, it's not yet processed. The processing happens when we pop it from the heap.\n\nSo the kept_count is incremented only when we pop a node from the heap.\n\nWait, the initial kept_count is 1 (node n). Then, for each iteration, we pop a node from the heap (which is added to the kept set), and then add its neighbors to the heap if not visited.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nInitialize the heap with node n. Mark it as visited. kept_count = 1.\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current_node = heappop (max node)\n\n   for neighbor in adj[current_node]:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         visited[neighbor] = True\n\n         heappush(neighbor)\n\n         kept_count +=1\n\nWait, no. Because the neighbor is added to the heap, but it's not processed until popped. So, the kept_count is incremented when the node is popped. So the code is:\n\nInitially, the heap has node n. visited[n] = True. kept_count = 1.\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current_node = heappop (max node)\n\n   for each neighbor in adj[current_node]:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         visited[neighbor] = True\n\n         heappush(neighbor)\n\n         kept_count +=1 ?\n\nNo, because when you add the neighbor to the heap, you haven't processed it yet. So the kept_count is incremented when the node is popped from the heap. So the code should be:\n\nInitially, the heap has node n. kept_count = 1.\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current_node = heappop()\n\n   for each neighbor:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         visited[neighbor] = True\n\n         heappush(neighbor)\n\n   kept_count +=1 ?\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because the current_node is being added to the kept set. So, when we pop the node from the heap, we add it to the kept set. So the kept_count increases by 1 each time we pop.\n\nSo, the initial kept_count is 1 (node n). Then, each time we pop a node, we add it to the kept set, and increment kept_count by 1. But how do we know when to stop? We need to pop (n -k -1) times. Because initially, we have 1 node. We need to reach (n -k) nodes. So, we need to perform (n -k -1) pops.\n\nWait, for example, if n -k is 3, and initially, kept_count is 1. Then, we need to pop 2 more nodes to reach 3.\n\nSo the loop runs while kept_count < (n -k). Each iteration, we pop a node and add it to the kept set, thus increasing kept_count by 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nheap = [ -n ] (since we use min heap to simulate max heap)\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nkept_count = 1\n\nwhile kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            visited[neighbor] = True\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n            kept_count +=1\n\nWait, no. Because when you pop the current node, you have to process its neighbors. However, the current node is added to the kept set. But in the code above, the kept_count is incremented when you add the neighbor. But that's not correct. Because the current node was popped from the heap, which means it's added to the kept set. So, the code should be:\n\nInitially, kept_count is 1.\n\nEach time you pop a node from the heap, you add it to the kept set. So, the loop runs (n -k -1) times. Because you start with one node, and need to add (n -k -1) more.\n\nBut how to track that. Let me think:\n\nThe loop condition is while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   pop a node (current) from the heap. This node is added to the kept set. So kept_count +=1.\n\n   then, for each neighbor of current, if not visited, add to heap and mark as visited.\n\nWait, no. Because when you pop the node, you have to add it to the kept set. So the code would be:\n\nInitially, the heap contains the first node (n). visited is marked as True. kept_count is 1.\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current = heappop (the max node)\n\n   for each neighbor:\n\n      if not visited:\n\n         mark as visited\n\n         push to heap\n\n   kept_count +=1 ?\n\nNo. Because the current node was popped from the heap, but it's already in the kept set. So, the kept_count is incremented when we process the node. But when we start, the kept_count is 1. Then, for each iteration of the loop, we process a node (pop it from the heap) and increment kept_count by 1. So the loop runs (n -k -1) times.\n\nWait, here's the correct logic:\n\nWe need to collect (n -k) nodes. Initially, we have 1 node (n). We need to collect (n -k -1) more nodes.\n\nSo the loop runs (n -k -1) times. Each time, we pop a node from the heap (which is part of the kept set), and then add its neighbors to the heap (if not visited). But how does that work?\n\nWait, no. The popped node is part of the kept set. But the code for adding the neighbors is done after popping the node. So the code would be:\n\nheap = [ -n ]\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nkept_count = 1\n\nwhile kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            visited[neighbor] = True\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    kept_count +=1 \n\nWait, but this code would increment kept_count by 1 each time. But the current node is being added to the kept set. But how? Because the current node was already in the visited set. Because when we pushed it into the heap, it was already marked as visited. So, the code is not adding the current node to the kept set again. Hmm, this seems incorrect.\n\nWait, the initial node is added to the visited set. Then, the heap contains it. When we pop it from the heap, we process it. But in the code above, the kept_count is incremented by 1, but how is that connected to the processing of the current node?\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from what the 'kept_count' represents. The 'kept_count' is the number of nodes that have been added to the kept set. Initially, it's 1 (node n). Then, each time we pop a node from the heap, we add it to the kept set. So, for each iteration of the loop, we process a node (current) and add it to the kept set. Thus, the code should be:\n\nInitially, the heap has node n (pushed as -n). visited[n] = True. kept_count = 1.\n\nBut then, the loop runs (n -k -1) times. Because we need to add (n -k -1) nodes to reach a total of (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to do that? Because the code above increments kept_count by 1 each time, but that's not correct. Because when we pop the node from the heap, that node is added to the kept set. So the code should be:\n\nInitially, kept_count = 1 (node n is in the kept set).\n\nThen, for each iteration:\n\n   pop a node (current) from the heap. This node is now added to the kept set. So, kept_count +=1.\n\n   then, for each neighbor of current, if not visited, mark as visited and add to the heap.\n\nBut how does this work? Because the initial node is already in the kept set. Then, the first iteration of the loop would pop it again? No. Because the initial node was pushed into the heap once. When it's popped, it's processed. But how is it added to the kept set again?\n\nWait, this seems to be a mistake in the logic. Because the initial node is already in the kept set. Then, when we pop it from the heap, we are processing it again. But that's not right.\n\nAh, the problem is that the initial node is in the heap, but it's already in the kept set. So the code needs to be adjusted. The correct approach is:\n\nThe heap contains nodes that can be added to the kept set. But once a node is added to the kept set, it's not processed again.\n\nWait, the correct algorithm is:\n\nWe use the priority queue to select the next node to add to the kept set. Initially, the kept set contains node n. The priority queue contains nodes that can be added to the kept set. But how?\n\nActually, the priority queue is used to find the next node to add to the kept set. The kept set starts with node n. Then, the priority queue contains the neighbors of node n. Because those are the nodes that can be added next. But how to manage this.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWe use a priority queue (max heap) that contains all nodes that can be added to the kept set. Initially, the kept set is empty. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the initial kept set is {n}, and the priority queue contains the neighbors of n. But this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as building the kept set. The initial kept set is {n}. The priority queue contains all nodes adjacent to the kept set. But how to track which nodes are adjacent.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is that the code I thought of earlier is not correctly tracking which nodes are added to the kept set. The code I had earlier was:\n\nheap = [ -n ]\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nkept_count = 1\n\nwhile kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            visited[neighbor] = True\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    kept_count +=1 \n\nBut this code is wrong. Because the current node is popped from the heap, but it's already in the visited set. So when you process it, you are looking at its neighbors and adding them to the heap. However, the kept_count is incremented by 1 each time. But why is that? Because the current node is being added to the kept set. But in reality, the current node was already added to the kept set when it was first visited. So this code is incorrect.\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the logic. The initial node is in the visited set, and the heap contains it. When you pop it from the heap, you're processing it, but you're not adding it to the kept set again. So the code is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nThe correct approach is that the heap contains candidate nodes that are not yet in the kept set. When you pop a node from the heap, you add it to the kept set, and then add its neighbors to the heap (if they are not in the kept set).\n\nBut how to initialize this. Initially, the kept set is empty. Then, you need to select the first node. But since we want to maximize the sum, the first node should be the highest-numbered node (n). So:\n\nInitialize the heap with node n. Mark it as visited. kept_count = 1.\n\nThen, for each iteration:\n\n   Pop the node from the heap (this is the next node to add to the kept set).\n\n   Add it to the kept set. (But it's already in the visited set?)\n\nWait, no. The visited array marks whether the node is in the kept set or not. So the process is:\n\nInitially, the heap contains node n. The visited array for node n is True (meaning it is in the kept set). kept_count is 1.\n\nThen, the loop runs while kept_count < (n -k). For each iteration:\n\n   Pop the node from the heap. (But it's already in the kept set.)\n\n   This is not correct. So perhaps the heap should contain nodes that are not yet in the kept set. But how?\n\nLet me re-express the algorithm:\n\nThe kept set starts empty. We want to add nodes to it. The first node to add is the highest-numbered node (n). Once added, we look for the next highest node that is adjacent to the kept set.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize the kept set as empty.\n\nAdd node n to the kept set. Mark it as visited.\n\nAdd all its neighbors to the priority queue.\n\nThen, while the kept set has less than (n -k) nodes:\n\n   Pop the node with the highest value from the priority queue.\n\n   Add it to the kept set.\n\n   Add its neighbors to the priority queue (if not visited).\n\nThis way, the priority queue contains nodes that are adjacent to the kept set, and not yet in the kept set.\n\nBut how to implement this. Because initially, the kept set has node n. The priority queue contains its neighbors. Then, when we pop the highest neighbor, add it to the kept set, and add its neighbors to the queue.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nInitialize a max heap.\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\nkept_count = 0\n\n# Start with the highest node, n.\n\n# Add it to the kept set.\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nkept_count += 1\n\n# Push its neighbors into the heap.\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    if visited[current] is False:\n\n        visited[current] = True\n\n        kept_count += 1\n\n        # Push its neighbors into the heap.\n\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    else:\n\n        # This node was already processed. Do nothing.\n\n        pass\n\nBut this is not correct. Because when we push the neighbors of node n into the heap, they are candidates for being added to the kept set. When we pop them, we check if they are visited. If not, add to kept set and process.\n\nThis seems correct. So the initial code is:\n\nStart with node n. Mark it as visited, kept_count = 1.\n\nPush all its neighbors into the heap.\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n   current = -heappop(heap)\n\n   if not visited:\n\n       mark as visited, increment kept_count.\n\n       push its neighbors into the heap.\n\nThus, this way, the heap contains nodes that are adjacent to the kept set, and not yet added. And we process them in order of their value.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. So n-k = 3. We need to select 3 nodes.\n\nInitially, node 6 is the highest. Let's see:\n\nadj for node 6: according to the first sample input, the edges are:\n\n2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3.\n\nSo the adjacency list for node 6 is [2,5].\n\nSo when initializing, node 6 is added to the kept set. kept_count = 1. Then, its neighbors (2 and 5) are pushed into the heap. The heap contains -2, -5. Since it's a min-heap, the smallest negative is -5 (which is 5), then -2 (which is 2). So the next node to be popped is 5 (the largest value).\n\nProcessing node 5: not visited. Mark as visited. kept_count becomes 2. Then, push its neighbors. Node 5's neighbors are 6 (already visited) and possibly others? In the first sample, node 5 is connected to 6. So adj[5] is [6]. So pushing nothing new.\n\nNow, the heap contains -2.\n\nNext iteration: kept_count is 2, need to reach 3. Pop -2 (value 2). Check if visited. Initially, node 2 is not visited. So mark as visited, increment kept_count to 3. Now, we have selected nodes 6,5,2. These are connected. The kept_count reaches 3, which is n -k = 3. So the kept set is {2,5,6}.\n\nThe nodes not in this set are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, this works. So the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nInitialize visited as a list of booleans.\n\nInitialize heap as empty.\n\nkept_count = 0.\n\nBut wait, initial step: select node n. So:\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nkept_count = 1\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nthen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    if not visited[current]:\n\n        visited[current] = True\n\n        kept_count +=1\n\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nOnce this is done, the nodes not in the visited array are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to collect them. Because the visited array marks which nodes are kept. So the nodes to remove are all nodes not in visited (i.e., visited[i] is False), and we need to collect them, sort them, and output the first k of them? Wait no. Because the kept_count is (n -k), so the number of nodes not in the visited array is k. Because total nodes is n.\n\nSo the nodes to be removed are those with visited[i] == False.\n\nSo collect all such nodes, sort them, and output them in increasing order.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the visited array would have True for nodes 2,5,6, and False for 1,3,4. So the nodes to be removed are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the visited array is filled, collect all nodes where visited[i] is False. Sort them, and output them.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently, considering n up to 1e6.\n\nBut what about the time complexity?\n\nEach node is pushed and popped from the heap once. For each node, we process its edges. So the total time is O(n log n), which should be acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nBut note that for large n (up to 1e6), using a list for adjacency is feasible.\n\nBut in Python, using heapq for 1e6 elements may be slow, but given that the problem constraints are tight, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead n-1 edges.\n\nBuild adjacency list as a list of lists.\n\nInitialize visited as [False] * (n+1).\n\nThen:\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\nheap = []\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nkept_count = 1\n\nThen, while kept_count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heappop(heap)\n\n    if not visited[current]:\n\n        visited[current] = True\n\n        kept_count +=1\n\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number. Our goal is to remove exactly $k$ districts while ensuring the remaining districts are connected and maximize the sum of their fan counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fan Count**: Since the fan count for a district $i$ is $2^i$, higher-numbered districts have exponentially more fans. Thus, we should aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Greedy Selection with Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always select the next highest-numbered district that can be connected to the current set of kept districts. This ensures we build a connected component with the highest possible fan count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n\n    # Start with node n\n    visited[n] = True\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    kept_count = 1\n\n    while kept_count < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if not visited[current]:\n            visited[current] = True\n            kept_count += 1\n            for neighbor in adj[current]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    # Collect all unvisited nodes\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts $n$ and the number of districts to remove $k$. The tree structure is represented using an adjacency list.\n2. **Initialization**: We start with the highest-numbered district $n$ as part of our connected component. This district is marked as visited.\n3. **Priority Queue**: Using a max-heap (simulated with negative values in Python's min-heap), we push all neighbors of the starting district into the heap.\n4. **Greedy Selection**: We repeatedly extract the highest-numbered district from the heap, check if it can be added to our connected component, and if so, add it and push its neighbors into the heap. This ensures we always expand our connected component with the highest possible districts.\n5. **Result Collection**: After processing, the districts not marked as visited are the ones to be removed. These are collected, sorted, and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maintain a connected component with the maximum possible fan count by leveraging a greedy algorithm with a priority queue, achieving an efficient solution suitable for large inputs.",
