Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated, but here the angle in question isn't necessarily an interior angle. Wait, the angle mentioned here is formed by three vertices where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on the sides. So, for example, if you pick three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when considering angles formed by three vertices, perhaps there's a formula for that. For example, in a regular polygon, if you have three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the middle one, then the angle at v2 depends on how many edges are between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of sides between them.\n\nLet me think: suppose we fix v2 as a vertex. Then, the other two vertices v1 and v3 must be such that they are on the perimeter of the polygon. For a regular polygon, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, the angle would depend on how many steps you take from v2 to reach v1 and v3.\n\nWait, for example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if I take v2 as a vertex, and v1 is adjacent to v2 (one step away) and v3 is two steps away from v2 (so that there's one vertex between v2 and v3). Then, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arcs between these points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the angle at v2 when choosing k steps between v1 and v2 and m steps between v2 and v3. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle depends only on the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is convex, the angle is determined by the arc lengths.\n\nWait, here's a thought. In a regular polygon, the measure of an inscribed angle depends on the arc it subtends. But maybe for a triangle formed by three vertices, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of sides between the points.\n\nLet me try to find the formula for the angle. Let me consider that in a regular polygon with n sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians, or 360/n degrees. Now, if we have three vertices v1, v2, v3 arranged such that between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the actual positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 will determine the angle.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 would be determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Wait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when going through the other side. Let me think of a specific case. For example, in a square (n=4), if we take three vertices where v2 is one vertex, and v1 and v3 are adjacent to it. Then the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. If we take v1 and v3 as opposite vertices (but that's not possible in a square because there's only two steps between them, but in that case, the angle would be 180 degrees, but that's not possible since the square's vertices are only connected by edges. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the angle in question is the angle formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. So, in a regular polygon, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. For a regular n-gon, each internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But when v1 and v3 are not adjacent to v2, the angle changes.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think of a regular pentagon. Suppose v2 is a vertex. Then, if I take v1 as the next vertex clockwise, and v3 as the vertex two steps counter-clockwise from v2. Then, the angle at v2 would be... Hmm, maybe I need to find a general formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v3 when you go around the polygon. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps when moving clockwise. Then, the angle at v2 would be (k-1)* (180/(n)) ? Not sure.\n\nWait, here's a resource I remember: in a regular polygon, the measure of an angle formed by three vertices where the vertex is at the center is equal to the central angle. But when the vertex is not the center, like in our problem, the angle depends on the arcs.\n\nAnother approach: For a regular polygon, the angle at v2 between two other vertices can be found using the formula. Let me imagine that the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. The coordinates of the vertices can be represented as points on the circle. Then, the angle between two vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 can be calculated using vector math.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler formula. Let me think. For a regular polygon with n sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Suppose that between v1 and v2, there are k steps clockwise. Similarly, between v2 and v3, there are m steps clockwise. However, since the polygon is convex, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 (clockwise) would be k + m. But since the polygon is cyclic, the actual arc between v1 and v3 could be either k + m steps or n - (k + m) steps, depending on which direction you take. However, in the problem statement, the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 lying on the sides of the angle. So, perhaps the angle is determined by the arc that is opposite to the angle. \n\nWait, here's a formula I found in some geometry references: in a regular polygon, the angle formed at a vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 is equal to ( (k) * (180) ) / n, where k is the number of sides between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in one direction. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. In a regular pentagon (n=5), if I choose three consecutive vertices, like 1,2,3. The angle at vertex 2 is the internal angle of the pentagon, which is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. Now, if I take vertices 1,2,4. What's the angle at 2? Let's imagine the pentagon. The angle between the lines from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. How can I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2. Let me think that in a regular polygon, if between v1 and v2 there are i steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are j steps clockwise. Then, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the angle at v2 is equal to ( (number of steps between v1 and v3) * 180 ) / n. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a square (n=4). If v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (i.e., steps are 1 and 1), then the angle is 90 degrees. If the steps between v1 and v3 are 2 steps (like in the case of v1 and v3 being opposite vertices), but then the angle would be 180 degrees. However, in a square, if you take v1 and v3 as opposite vertices, then the angle at v2 would be 180 degrees. But that's only possible if v2 is adjacent to both, which isn't possible. Wait, no. For example, in a square, if you have vertices 1, 2, 3, 4. If you take v2 as 2, and v1 as 1, v3 as 3. Then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. If you take v1 as 1 and v3 as 4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees? No, that's not right. Because the line from 2 to 1 is adjacent, and the line from 2 to 4 is adjacent in the other direction. Wait, the angle between those two lines would be 90 degrees again. Wait, no. Wait, in a square, each internal angle is 90 degrees. So if you take v1 and v3 as adjacent to v2, the angle is 90 degrees. If you take v1 as adjacent to v2 and v3 as two steps away (like in a square, v2 is 2, v1 is 1, and v3 is 3, then that's adjacent. But if v3 is 4, then the line from 2 to 4 is a diagonal. So the angle between 1-2 and 2-4 would be 45 degrees? Or wait, no. The internal angle of the square is 90 degrees. But if you take a triangle formed by 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 is between the edge 1-2 and the diagonal 2-4. How much is that angle?\n\nLet me calculate. In a square with coordinates: 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1). The line from 2 to 1 is towards left, and the line from 2 to 4 is upwards. The angle between those two vectors is 90 degrees. Wait, because the vector from 2 to 1 is (-1, 0), and the vector from 2 to 4 is (0,1). The angle between (-1,0) and (0,1) is 90 degrees. So in that case, the angle is 90 degrees. But that's the same as the internal angle. Hmm, so maybe my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the angle formed by three vertices where the two sides of the angle are not edges of the polygon. For example, in a square, taking vertices 1,2,3 gives an internal angle of 90 degrees. Taking vertices 1,2,4 gives an angle of 45 degrees? Or not?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the internal angle with other angles. The internal angle of a polygon is the angle between two adjacent edges. However, when considering three vertices that are not adjacent, the angle formed can be different. For example, in a square, if you take vertices 1, 2, 4. Then the angle at 2 is between the edge from 1-2 and the diagonal from 2-4. What's that angle?\n\nIn the square example, the vector from 2 to 1 is (-1, 0), and the vector from 2 to 4 is (0,1). The angle between them is 90 degrees. So that's still 90 degrees. Wait, but that's the same as the internal angle. So what's the case when you take vertices that are further apart?\n\nLet me take a regular hexagon (n=6). Let's take vertex 2 as the center. Suppose I take v1 as 1 and v3 as 4. The angle at 2 between 1-2 and 2-4. The hexagon has internal angles of 120 degrees. But the angle between 1-2 and 2-4 would be larger? Let me imagine the coordinates. In a regular hexagon, each vertex is 60 degrees apart. So, if the hexagon is centered at the origin, and vertex 1 is at (1,0), vertex 2 is at (cos(60°), sin(60°)), which is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), vertex 3 is (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), vertex 4 is (-1, 0), etc. So the vector from 2 to 1 is (1 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The vector from 2 to 4 is (-1 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt(3)/2) = (-1.5, -sqrt(3)/2). The angle between these two vectors can be calculated using the dot product. But maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, the angle between the two vectors from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. Since the hexagon is regular, the arc between 1 and 4 is 3 steps (each step is 60 degrees), so the central angle is 180 degrees. But the angle at vertex 2 is not the central angle. Wait, but maybe there's a formula for that.\n\nI think I need to find a general formula for the angle at v2 when given two other vertices. Let me think about the regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Let’s denote the center of the circle as O. Let’s assume that the polygon is centered at the origin, and that the vertices are placed at angles θ_i = 2π(i-1)/n radians, for i from 1 to n.\n\nSuppose we have three vertices: v1, v2, v3. Let's assume that v2 is fixed. Let’s say that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise. Similarly, between v2 and v3, there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the actual positions of v1 and v3 are determined by these steps. However, the angle at v2 between the lines v2v1 and v2v3 depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, that's similar to the inscribed angle theorem. For example, in a circle, the angle formed by two chords at a point on the circumference is equal to half the measure of the arc that the angle subtends. So if the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 would be x/2 degrees.\n\nYes! That seems familiar. So, for example, in the square case where v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is opposite, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 270 degrees (since the square has 4 sides, each arc between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees). Wait, no. Wait, in the square, if v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is opposite, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 180 degrees. Because in a square, the arc between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. So between v1 and v3, if they are opposite, the arc is 180 degrees. Then the angle at v2 would be half of that, which is 90 degrees. Which matches our previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: in a regular pentagon (n=5), if v1 and v3 are two steps apart from each other (so the arc between them is 2*72=144 degrees), then the angle at v2 (which is not on that arc) would be 72 degrees. Wait, but how does that relate to the steps between v1 and v3?\n\nSo, the formula would be: the angle at v2 is equal to (arc_length / 2), where arc_length is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. But how do I calculate that arc length?\n\nThe arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is equal to (number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc) * (360/n). Let me think. For example, in the square, if v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is opposite, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is two steps (since the square has four vertices, the arc from v1 to v3 is two steps, which is 180 degrees). So the angle at v2 would be 180/2 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the key idea is that for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. The length of that arc is (k * 360 /n) degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc. Then the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but how do we find k? Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 depends on their positions. Let's think: for any two vertices v1 and v3, there are two arcs between them. The one that contains v2 and the one that doesn't. But since the polygon is convex, the arc that does not contain v2 must be the smaller one? No, not necessarily. For example, in a square, if v1 and v3 are adjacent, then the arc that does not contain v2 is 1 step (90 degrees), but if v2 is not on that arc. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the angle at v2 to be formed with v1 and v3 on its sides, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the one that is subtended by the angle. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (some value), and the angle is (steps * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how to find the steps for a given v1, v2, v3?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that excludes v2. But how?\n\nPerhaps, given that v1 and v3 are chosen such that they are on the sides of the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is determined by the number of steps between them. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps along the arc that does not contain v2. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how to find k given that v2 is the vertex of the angle?\n\nAlternatively, since v2 is the vertex, and v1 and v3 are on the sides of the angle, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is \"opposite\" to v2. Therefore, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - 2) - (steps between v1 and v2) - (steps between v2 and v3). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of a way to model this.\n\nLet me think that for a given v2, the other two vertices v1 and v3 must be such that they are on different sides of the polygon. For example, if I fix v2, then v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (k + m) steps. Therefore, the angle at v2 would be (k + m) * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k + m. So the angle is (k + m) * 180 / n degrees.\n\nWait, but in the square example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (k=1) and v3 is also adjacent (m=1), then the angle is (1+1) * 180 /4 = 360/4 = 90 degrees. Which matches the internal angle. If v1 is adjacent to v2 (k=1) and v3 is two steps counter-clockwise (m=2), then the angle would be (1+2)*180/4 = 540/4 = 135 degrees. But that seems impossible, since in a square, the maximum angle possible is 180 degrees. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (say, v2 is vertex 2, v1 is vertex 1), and v3 is two steps counter-clockwise from v2 (vertex 4?), then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 3 steps (from 1 to 4, going through 3, which is three steps). Then the angle would be (3 * 180)/4 = 135 degrees. Let me check that.\n\nIn the square, the coordinates of v1 (1) is (1,0), v2 (2) is (0,1), v3 (4) is (0,-1)? Wait, no, perhaps I need to reorient. Let me think of a square with vertices labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 in clockwise order. So if the square is centered at the origin, then:\n\nVertex 1: (1, 1)\nVertex 2: (-1, 1)\nVertex 3: (-1, -1)\nVertex 4: (1, -1)\n\nNo, that's not a standard coordinate system. Alternatively, think of the square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), but that's a square rotated 45 degrees. Maybe it's easier to use a unit circle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not get bogged down with coordinates and just trust the formula.\n\nIf the formula says that the angle at v2 is (k + m) * 180 / n, where k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 clockwise, and m is the number of steps from v2 to v3 counter-clockwise (so that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k + m steps), then for any triplet of vertices, the angle depends on the sum of those steps. However, since the polygon is regular, the steps between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3 can vary, but the sum k + m determines the angle.\n\nBut in that case, for a given n, the possible angles are determined by the possible values of (k + m) * 180 / n. However, since k and m are positive integers (since v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and each other), the sum (k + m) can range from 2 to (n-2). Because if k + m is 2, then the angle is 2*180/n. For example, in a square (n=4), that would be 90 degrees. Which is correct. If k + m is 3, then 3*180/4 = 135 degrees. Which for the square would be possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the value of (k + m) such that the angle (k + m)*180/n is as close as possible to a given a. Once we find the best (k + m), then we can choose any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k and m.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal (k + m)?\n\nLet me think: For each possible value of s = k + m, where s ranges from 2 to n-2, compute the angle theta = s * 180 / n. We want to find the s that minimizes |theta - a|. Once we find the optimal s, we can construct any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that s.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal s?\n\nLet me note that the possible values of s are integers between 2 and n-2 inclusive. Because, for example, if s is 2, then k=1 and m=1 (so v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 on either side). For s= n-2, then k + m = n-2. Which would mean that one of k or m is n-2 - the other. For example, if k = 1 and m = n-3, then the arc between v1 and v3 is 1 + (n-3) = n-2 steps. Which would make the angle (n-2)*180 /n.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For the given n and a, compute the possible s values (from 2 to n-2) and find the s that makes theta = s * 180 /n as close as possible to a.\n\nOnce we have the optimal s, we can select any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that s.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nLet me think: the optimal s is the integer closest to (a * n)/180. Because theta = s * 180 /n → solving for s gives s = (theta * n)/180. So for theta = a, the ideal s is (a * n)/180. But since s must be integer between 2 and n-2, we can compute the candidate s values around this ideal value.\n\nBut we need to handle cases where the ideal s is not integer, and also ensure that s is within the valid range.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 15. n=3, a=15.\n\nThe possible s values are from 2 to 1 (since n-2 is 1). Wait, but 2 to n-2 is 2 to 1, which is invalid. So for n=3, the minimal s is 2, but n-2 is 1. That suggests that there are no possible s values. But that can't be right. Wait, what's the possible s for n=3?\n\nWait, for a triangle (n=3), any three distinct vertices must be all three vertices. So for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is the internal angle of the triangle. Which is (3-2)*180/3 = 60 degrees. So in this case, the angle is always 60 degrees regardless of the choice of triplet. So for n=3, the only possible s is 1? But according to our earlier logic, s is k + m. How does that fit?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine.\n\nEarlier assumption: s = k + m, where k is steps from v2 to v1 clockwise, m is steps from v2 to v3 counter-clockwise. But for n=3, if v2 is fixed, then the only possible positions for v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. So k=1 and m=1, leading to s=2. Then theta = 2 * 180 /3 = 120 degrees. But that contradicts the known internal angle of 60 degrees. So clearly, there's a mistake in the formula.\n\nThis indicates that my earlier reasoning was incorrect. So I need to re-examine the formula for theta.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the formula is theta = (s-1) * 180 /n ?\n\nIn the case of the triangle, with s=2, that would give (2-1)*180/3 = 60 degrees. Which matches the internal angle. For the square, when s=2, (2-1)*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which would correspond to the angle formed by two adjacent vertices and the next one. Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that the angle was 90 degrees. So this is conflicting again.\n\nHmm, clearly, I need to re-derive the formula properly.\n\nLet me consider that in a regular polygon, the internal angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n. For example, triangle: (3-2)*180/3 = 60 degrees. Square: (4-2)*180/4 = 90 degrees. Pentagon: 108 degrees, etc.\n\nNow, when we have three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle at v2 is the internal angle. So, in this case, the formula must yield that internal angle. Let's see what value of s would produce that.\n\nIf the formula is theta = (s) * 180 /n, then for the triangle, the internal angle is 60 degrees. For s=1, that would be 180/3=60. So s=1. But earlier thinking said that s was k + m, which would be 2 for adjacent vertices. So perhaps the correct formula is theta = (s) * 180 /n, where s is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But for the case of adjacent vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (since there are two steps between them in the other direction). For example, in a triangle, if v1 and v3 are adjacent, then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 is 1 step. Hence, s=1. So theta = 1 * 180 /3 = 60 degrees. Which is correct. \n\nIn the square, if v1 and v3 are adjacent, then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 is 1 step. So theta is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. But earlier calculation suggested that the angle is 90 degrees. This is conflicting. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, let's take the square example again. Suppose v2 is vertex 2. v1 is vertex 1, and v3 is vertex 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 3 via 4?), or 1 step (from 1 to 3 directly)? Wait, in a square, the arc between v1 and v3 can be two steps (clockwise) or two steps (counter-clockwise). But since the polygon is convex, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the shorter arc. But in this case, if v2 is vertex 2, then the arc between v1 (1) and v3 (3) that does not contain v2 would be the arc from 1 to 3 passing through 4. That's two steps. Hence, s=2. Then theta would be 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which matches the internal angle. \n\nSo why did I think earlier that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step? Probably a mistake. So the correct formula is that the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is s, and the angle is (s * 180)/n degrees. So for the square, when v1 and v3 are adjacent (like 1 and 2?), no. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is vertex 1, v3 is vertex 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc going from 1 to 3 via vertex 4. That's two steps. Hence, s=2. So the angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Correct.\n\nAnother example: in the square, if v1 is vertex 1, v2 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is from 1 to 4 via 3. That's three steps? No, from 1 to 4 in a square: clockwise, it's 3 steps (1→2→3→4). Counter-clockwise, it's 1 step (1→4). But since v2 is vertex 2, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the one that goes from 1 to 4 via 3, which is 3 steps. But that's longer than the other arc. But according to the earlier logic, the angle is determined by the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, but in this case, the arc from 1 to 4 that contains v2 is 1→2→3→4 (three steps), and the arc that does not contain v2 is 1→4 (one step). So s=1, which would give angle 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. But what is the actual angle?\n\nIn this case, the angle at v2 between v1 (1) and v3 (4). The vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. In the square, assuming coordinates:\n\nAssume square with vertices:\n\n1: (1,1)\n\n2: (-1,1)\n\n3: (-1,-1)\n\n4: (1,-1)\n\nThen, vector from 2 to 1 is (1 - (-1), 1 - 1) → (2, 0). Vector from 2 to 4 is (1 - (-1), -1 - 1) → (2, -2). The angle between these two vectors can be computed with the dot product.\n\nDot product: (2)(2) + (0)(-2) = 4.\n\nLength of first vector: sqrt(2² + 0²) = 2.\n\nLength of second vector: sqrt(2² + (-2)^2) = sqrt(8) = 2√2.\n\nSo cos(theta) = 4/(2 * 2√2) ) = 4/(4√2) = 1/√2 → theta is 45 degrees. Which matches the formula. So in this case, the angle is 45 degrees, which is indeed (s=1)*180/4=45 degrees.\n\nSo the formula holds. So the number of steps s between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is the key. And the angle is s * 180 /n degrees.\n\nSo, for the square, when v1 and v3 are adjacent (like 1 and 2), the arc that does not contain v2 (say, v2 is 3) would be... Wait, I think I need to clarify how to compute s for any given triplet.\n\nBut regardless, the formula is that for any three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is equal to s * 180 /n degrees, where s is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: find the value of s (an integer between 1 and n-2) such that the angle s * 180 /n is as close as possible to a.\n\nWait, why between 1 and n-2? Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can have a length of s steps, which must be at least 1 (since v1 and v3 are distinct) and at most n-2 (because if s were n-1, then the arc would contain v2).\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), the maximum s is 2 (n-2=2). Because if s is 3 steps, then the arc would contain v2.\n\nThus, the possible values of s are from 1 to n-2 inclusive.\n\nSo the problem now is:\n\nGiven n and a, find s in [1, n-2] that minimizes |s * 180 /n - a|.\n\nOnce we find the optimal s, we need to find any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that s.\n\nNow, how to find the optimal s?\n\nLet me think: the ideal value of s is (a * n) / 180. But since s must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the closest integer(s) to this value and check them.\n\nFor example, in sample input 2: 4 67. n=4, a=67.\n\nIdeal s is (67 *4)/180 = 268 / 180 ≈ 1.488. So the",

The solution involves calculating the optimal angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and selecting appropriate vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular polygon with `n` sides, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not include the vertex of interest.
