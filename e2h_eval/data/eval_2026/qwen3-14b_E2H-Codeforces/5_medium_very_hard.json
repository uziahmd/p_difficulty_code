Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. Each character in l represents a left boot's color, and each in r represents a right boot's color. The problem requires pairing them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One idea is to first pair the specific colors where they match. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we should:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have specific colors matching. For example, if l has 'a' and r has 'a', pair them. But since there could be multiple instances, we need to track which ones are already paired.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find these matches? Maybe using counts for each color. For example, count how many left boots have each color (excluding ?), and similarly for right boots. Then, for each color, the number of possible pairs is the minimum of the left count and the right count. However, this might not account for overlapping uses of question marks.\n\nWait, but question marks can be used as any color. So maybe we should first pair the non-? colors where they match, then use the remaining ?s to pair with any remaining non-? or ?.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left and right boots that have specific colors (non-?) and match. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. This would be min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. But how to track which indices are used?\n\nBut tracking indices is tricky because we need to actually select which left and right boots are paired. So maybe we need to collect lists for each color.\n\nFor example, for each color c (excluding ?), collect all the indices in l where the color is c, and same for r. Then, pair them in some way, like taking the first available from each list. Once paired, those indices can't be used again.\n\nThen, after that, we have remaining left and right boots with ? or unpaired specific colors. Now, we can use the ?s to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a bipartite graph where each left boot is connected to right boots that are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching. But for n up to 150,000, that's impossible with standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp, which is O(E√V). So we need an efficient way.\n\nSo, we need a greedy approach. Let's think again.\n\nThe main idea is to first pair the non-? boots where possible, then use the ?s to cover the rest.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding ?), collect the list of left boots with color c and the list of right boots with color c. Pair each left with a right of same color. For example, for color 'a', take the first m elements from left list and first m elements from right list, where m is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)). These pairs are added to the answer. Also, mark these indices as used.\n\n2. Then, collect all remaining left boots (those not yet paired) and remaining right boots. These can be either:\n\n   a. Left boots with color ?, or specific colors that couldn't be matched (e.g., left has 'a' but no right 'a' left)\n\n   b. Right boots with color ?, or specific colors that couldn't be matched.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining boots. Since ? can be matched with anything, we can pair them.\n\nBut how to maximize the pairs here. Let's think:\n\nWe can have two groups:\n\nLeft_remaining: left boots that are not yet paired. They can be either specific colors or ?.\n\nRight_remaining: right boots that are not yet paired. Same.\n\nWe need to pair them such that each pair is compatible. Since ? can be used as any color, the best way is to pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n- For each left boot in left_remaining, if it's a ?, pair it with any available right boot (could be ? or specific). Similarly, if the right boot is ?, pair it with any available left boot.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: collect all the left_remaining and right_remaining. Then, pair as follows:\n\n- First, pair the left ?s with right ?s. Because they can be matched with each other. Then, pair the left ?s with right non-?s, and vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair all the left ?s and right ?s first, and then pair the left ?s with the right non-?s and vice versa. However, how to do this without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of possible pairs in this phase is the minimum of the number of left_remaining and right_remaining. Because each left can be paired with one right, and each right can be paired with one left. But this is only possible if there's at least one compatible pair. However, since ? can match anything, the only way a pair is not possible is if there are no left and right boots left. So, in this case, the maximum possible is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, if there are left ? and right non-?s, we can pair them. Similarly, left non-? and right ?. But how to do that.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nCollect all the left boots that are not paired yet. Let's call them L. Similarly, collect R.\n\nNow, for each left in L, and right in R, if they are compatible, pair them. However, doing this naively would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=150,000.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to pair them.\n\nLet me think. Since ? can be matched with anything, perhaps we can pair as follows:\n\nFirst, pair left ?s with right ?s. Then, pair left ?s with right non-?s. Then, pair right ?s with left non-?s. Wait, but that may not be optimal. For example, if there are more left ? than right ?, but some left ? can pair with right non-?s, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining L and R, we can pair as follows:\n\nFor each left in L, if it's a ?, pair it with any available right in R (since ? can match anything). For each right in R, if it's a ?, pair it with any available left in L. But how to do this without overlapping.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nWe can create two lists:\n\nleft_question = list of left boots that are ?, and not yet paired.\n\nright_question = list of right boots that are ?, and not yet paired.\n\nleft_specific = list of left boots that are not ?, and not yet paired.\n\nright_specific = list of right boots that are not ?, and not yet paired.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs possible here would be:\n\n- Pair left_question with right_question: min(len(left_question), len(right_question)).\n\n- Then, pair left_question with right_specific: the number is min(len(left_question_remaining), len(right_specific)).\n\n- Then, pair right_question with left_specific: min(len(right_question_remaining), len(left_specific)).\n\nWait, but that may not be correct. Because once you pair left_question with right_specific, you can't use those right_specific again. So the order in which you pair them affects the total.\n\nBut what's the optimal way? Well, since ? can be used to match any specific, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\nmin(len(left_question) + len(left_specific), len(right_question) + len(right_specific)) )\n\nBut since each pair must be between left and right. So the maximum possible pairs here is min( len(L), len(R) ), where L is the remaining left boots, R is the remaining right boots.\n\nBut how to achieve that.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, suppose there are some left ? and some right non-?.\n\nWe can pair each left ? with a right non-? (if available). Similarly, pair right ? with left non-?.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAn efficient way is to pair all left ? with right non-? first, then pair the remaining right ? with left non-?.\n\nAlternatively, we can pair as follows:\n\nLoop through all left boots in L (remaining) and all right boots in R (remaining), and pair them if possible. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\nWe can collect all left_remaining and right_remaining. For each left in left_remaining, if it's a ?, we can pair it with any right in right_remaining that hasn't been paired yet. Similarly, for right that are ?, pair with any left not yet paired. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut perhaps, for the remaining left and right, the best way is to pair the left ?s with right non-?s first, then pair the right ?s with left non-?s, and finally pair the remaining ?s with each other.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of an example:\n\nSuppose left_remaining has 3 left ?s and 2 left a's.\n\nright_remaining has 1 right ? and 3 right a's.\n\nIn this case, the left ?s can pair with the right a's (3 pairs). Then, the right ? can pair with the left a's (but there are 2 left a's left, so 1 pair). Total 4 pairs.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible.\n\nAnother example: left has 2 ? and 1 a, right has 1 ? and 1 a.\n\nPairing the ?s first: 1 pair. Then, the remaining left ? can pair with the right a. Then, the left a can pair with the right ?. So total 3 pairs. Which is possible.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor the remaining left and right boots:\n\n1. Pair left ? with right non-? (specific). For each left ? in left_remaining, pair it with a right non-? (specific) that hasn't been paired yet. The number of such pairs is min(number of left ?, number of right non-?).\n\n2. Then, pair right ? with left non-? (specific). The number of such pairs is min(number of right ?, number of left non-?).\n\n3. Finally, pair the remaining ?s (left and right) with each other.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, during step 1, we can collect all left ? and right non-?.\n\nLet me think of data structures.\n\nWe can have:\n\n- left_questions: a list of indices of left boots that are ?, not yet paired.\n\n- right_questions: a list of indices of right boots that are ?, not yet paired.\n\n- left_specc: a list of indices of left boots that are not ?, not yet paired.\n\n- right_specc: a list of indices of right boots that are not ?, not yet paired.\n\nSo, step 1: pair left_questions with right_specc.\n\nWe can take the first min(len(left_questions), len(right_specc)) pairs. For example, pair each left_q with a right_specc. Then, remove those from their respective lists.\n\nSimilarly, step 2: pair right_questions with left_specc.\n\nTake min(len(right_questions), len(left_specc)) pairs.\n\nThen, step 3: pair left_questions and right_questions. Take min(len(left_questions), len(right_questions)) pairs.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut how do we track which left and right boots are already paired?\n\nSo, the initial approach would be:\n\n- Create two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False. These indicate whether a left or right boot is already used in a pair.\n\nThen, for the first step (matching specific colors):\n\nFor each color c (not ?), collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used, and all right indices where r[j] == c and not used. Then pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can use dictionaries to map colors to lists of indices.\n\nSo, for example, we can have:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can pair as many as possible between left and right. But how to do that.\n\nBut for each color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_color_map[c]), len(right_color_map[c])).\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, for color 'a', take the first x elements from left and the first x elements from right, where x is min(len(left), len(right)).\n\nBut to do this, we can iterate through each color, and for each, pair the left and right indices.\n\nOnce paired, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. For example, when we pair the left and right indices, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut the problem is that the same index can be in multiple color maps. For example, if a left boot is 'a', it's in the left_color_map['a'] list. Once paired, we need to mark it as used, so it's not considered again.\n\nSo, the algorithm for the first part (specific color matching) is:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nFor each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map:\n\n    while there are left indices in left_color_map[c] and right indices in right_color_map[c] that are not used:\n\n        take the first left index from left_color_map[c], and first right index from right_color_map[c]\n\n        pair them.\n\n        mark used_left[left_index] = True\n\n        mark used_right[right_index] = True\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but the left_color_map and right_color_map are built with all indices. However, once a left index is used, it's not available anymore. So, perhaps we can process each color's left and right lists, and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut for this, perhaps for each color c, we can take the list of left indices (for that color) and the list of right indices (for that color), and pair them up to the minimum of the two lengths.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color c, left_list = left_color_map[c], right_list = right_color_map[c]. Then, the number of pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)). So, for each i in 0 to (min - 1), pair left_list[i] with right_list[i].\n\nBut this would work only if the left and right lists are not modified during the process. However, once we pair them, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut this approach would not account for the fact that some indices in left_list may have already been used. For example, if a left index was already paired in a previous color. So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, right! Because when building the left_color_map and right_color_map, they contain all indices. But during the pairing, some of them may have already been used in earlier pairings. Therefore, this approach would not work.\n\nSo, we need a way to process the colors in a way that ensures that we don't reuse indices that are already paired.\n\nThis suggests that we need to process the color pairs in a way that for each color, we pair the available left and right indices for that color, which haven't been used yet.\n\nAn alternative approach is to first process all colors, and for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right, but considering that some indices may have been already used.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nHmm. Perhaps for each color c, we can collect the list of left indices (not used) and the list of right indices (not used). Then, pair them up to the min(len(left), len(right)).\n\nBut how to collect the lists of available indices for each color.\n\nThis seems computationally expensive if done naively. Because for each color, we need to scan all the left and right indices again. But for n up to 150,000, and 26 letters, this would be manageable.\n\nWait, but the number of possible colors is 26 letters. So for each color, we can loop through all the left and right indices once. But that would be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5 (about 3.9e6 operations).\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each color, the list of left indices and right indices, and then process them.\n\nBut how to track which are used. Let's think:\n\nInitially, all left and right indices are unused.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    collect all left indices with color c that are not used. Let's call this left_available_c.\n\n    collect all right indices with color c that are not used. Call this right_available_c.\n\n    pair as many as possible: min(len(left_available_c), len(right_available_c)).\n\n    for each pair (i,j) in left_available_c[0..m-1] and right_available_c[0..m-1], mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect left_available_c and right_available_c quickly.\n\nThis would require for each color c, to have a list of indices, and then iterate through them, checking if they are used. However, this would take O(n) time per color, which is O(26n) total.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, we can keep track of pointers for each list, indicating up to which index we have already processed. For example, for left list of color c, we can have a pointer that starts at 0 and increments as we pair indices. However, this approach would require that the indices in the list are not already used. Which is not the case, since the same index may have been used in another color's pairing.\n\nWait, no. Because if a left index is of color c, then during the processing of color c, it's only considered if it hasn't been used before. So, perhaps we can pre-process the lists for each color, and for each color, process them once, and during that processing, mark the indices as used if they are paired.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = list of indices where l[i] == c.\n\n    right_list = list of indices where r[i] == c.\n\n    for i in 0 to len(left_list)-1:\n\n        if used_left[left_list[i]] is False:\n\n            for j in 0 to len(right_list)-1:\n\n                if used_right[right_list[j]] is False:\n\n                    pair them, mark as used, increment counters.\n\nBut this would be O(n^2) in worst case, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each color c, pair as many left and right indices as possible, but only once. So, for each color c, we can have pointers into the left and right lists. For example, for color c, we have left_list and right_list. We can process them in a way that for each left in left_list, if not used, and for each right in right_list, if not used, pair them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAnother approach: For each color c, the number of possible pairs is the minimum between the number of available left boots (with color c and not used) and available right boots (with color c and not used). To find that, we can count the available left and right for each color.\n\nBut how to count them. Well, for each color c, the available left is the count of l[i] == c and not used. Similarly for right.\n\nBut to compute this, we need to know how many are available for each color. However, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the colors in a certain order. For example, process colors that have both left and right counts, and pair them greedily.\n\nBut I'm stuck on this.\n\nMaybe we can think of the following:\n\nWe can first pair all left and right boots with specific colors, regardless of their order, by using two pointers for each color. For example, for color 'a', we can iterate through the left and right lists, and pair them as long as they are not used.\n\nBut to avoid re-checking, perhaps we can have for each color c, a list of left indices and a list of right indices, and for each color, we can pair as many as possible by iterating through the left and right lists, and for each left index not used, find a right index not used and pair them.\n\nBut this seems like O(n^2) again.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: for each left boot that is not a '?', we can try to find a right boot with the same color that is not used. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps using a dictionary to track available right boots for each color.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize a dictionary for right boots, which maps colors to a deque of indices. Initially, for each color c, the deque contains all the right indices with color c.\n\nThen, for each left boot in the left string, if it's not '?', and not used, we check if the color exists in the right dictionary, and if there are any indices in the deque for that color. If so, take the first one from the deque, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nThis way, we can process all left boots with specific colors, and pair them with available right boots.\n\nSimilarly, we can process the right boots with specific colors, but I think this approach may not capture all possibilities. However, this seems manageable.\n\nWait, but this approach would process left boots in order. For example, for each left boot in order 0 to n-1:\n\nif it's not used and not '?', then check if there are any right boots with the same color not used. If yes, pair them.\n\nBut this may miss some cases. For example, if a right boot is paired with a later left boot, but the earlier left boot could have used it. However, this approach would pair the earliest possible left boot with the earliest available right boot.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach, and it's possible that this gives the maximum number of pairs. Because for each left boot, we pair it with a right boot of the same color if possible, which is optimal for that particular color.\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose left has two 'a's and right has two 'a's. Processing left in order, the first left 'a' pairs with the first right 'a', and the second left 'a' pairs with the second right 'a'. Which is correct.\n\nIf the right boots have more 'a's than left, then all left 'a's are paired with right 'a's.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nInitialize for the right boots, a dictionary that maps color to a deque of indices. For example, right_color_deques = { 'a': deque([0, 2, 5]), ... }\n\nThen, for each left index i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    if l[i] is not '?' and not used_left[i]:\n\n        color = l[i]\n\n        if color is in right_color_deques and len(right_color_deques[color]) > 0:\n\n            j = right_color_deques[color].popleft()\n\n            pair (i+1, j+1) (since indices are 1-based in output)\n\n            mark used_left[i] = True\n\n            mark used_right[j] = True\n\nSimilarly, for right boots with specific colors, but maybe that's not needed here. Because the above step pairs left boots with right boots of same color. Then, the remaining right boots are either ? or have colors that were not matched by any left boots.\n\nWait, but what about right boots with specific colors that are not matched by any left boots? For example, if there are more right 'a's than left 'a's. Those right 'a's are not used and will be handled later when pairing with ?s.\n\nBut this approach handles the pairing of left and right boots with specific colors.\n\nThen, after that, we process the remaining left and right boots (those not used) which can be ? or specific colors that couldn't be paired.\n\nNow, for the remaining left and right boots, we need to pair them using ?s.\n\nSo, the next step is to collect all left ? and right ?.\n\nLet me think about how to collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nOnce the first phase is done, we can collect:\n\nleft_questions = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_questions = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nleft_others = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_others = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nNow, the left_others and right_others are the specific colors that couldn't be paired with their counterparts. But since we've already processed the left boots with specific colors (pairing them with right boots of same color), the left_others are left boots with specific colors that have no matching right boots (because the right boots of that color were already used up).\n\nSimilarly for right_others.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair these remaining boots, using ?s.\n\nSo, for the remaining pairs, we can:\n\nFirst, pair left ? with right others (specific colors). Since ? can match any specific color.\n\nSecond, pair right ? with left others (specific colors).\n\nThird, pair left ? with right ?.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the following approach:\n\nWe can collect all the left ?s and right ?s, and then:\n\n- For each left ? in left_questions, try to pair it with any available right in right_others (specific) or right_questions (but not yet used).\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nAn efficient way is:\n\nFor the left_questions and right_questions:\n\nWe can first pair as many left ?s with right_others as possible. Then pair the remaining left ?s with right ?s.\n\nSimilarly, pair right ?s with left_others.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe can have:\n\nleft_questions = list of indices of left boots with ? and not used.\n\nright_questions = list of indices of right boots with ? and not used.\n\nleft_others = list of indices of left boots with specific colors and not used.\n\nright_others = list of indices of right boots with specific colors and not used.\n\nThen:\n\nWe can first pair left_questions with right_others.\n\nFor each left in left_questions:\n\n    if there are any right_others not yet paired, pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for right_questions with left_others.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nAn efficient way is to pair as follows:\n\nTake the left_questions and right_others.\n\nThe number of pairs possible is min(len(left_questions), len(right_others)).\n\nWe can pair them by taking the first x elements from left_questions and first x elements from right_others.\n\nThen, the remaining left_questions can be paired with right_questions.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining right_questions can be paired with left_others.\n\nWait, but after pairing left_questions with right_others, the remaining left_questions can be paired with right_questions.\n\nBut also, the remaining right_questions can be paired with left_others.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible between left_questions and right_others. The number of pairs is min(len(left_questions), len(right_others)).\n\n   For example, take the first m elements from left_questions and the first m elements from right_others, where m is min(len(left_questions), len(right_others)).\n\n   For each pair (l, r), add to the answer.\n\n2. Then, pair as many as possible between right_questions and left_others. The number of pairs is min(len(right_questions), len(left_others)).\n\n3. Finally, pair the remaining left_questions and right_questions. The number of pairs is min(len(left_questions), len(right_questions)).\n\nBut how to track the remaining elements after each step.\n\nThis can be implemented as follows:\n\nFor step 1:\n\nm = min(len(left_questions), len(right_others))\n\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n\n    pair left_questions[i] with right_others[i]\n\nThen, the left_questions list is now left_questions[m:], and right_others is now empty (assuming we took all of them).\n\nWait, but right_others may have more elements than left_questions. So after step 1, the remaining right_others is right_others[m:].\n\nBut since step 1 is to pair left_questions with right_others, after that, the right_others are those not used. However, for the purpose of this step, we can just pair as much as possible, and then move on.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used.\n\nWait, but during this phase, the left_questions and right_others are lists of indices that are not yet used. So, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used.\n\nSo, the code for this step would be:\n\nfor i in range(m):\n\n    l_idx = left_questions[i]\n\n    r_idx = right_others[i]\n\n    add (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) to the answer.\n\n    mark used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n    mark used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the other steps.\n\nBut how to get the left_questions and right_others lists.\n\nSo, after the first phase (specific color pairing), we collect left_questions, right_questions, left_others, right_others as lists of indices.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nWe can create a new list for left_questions and right_others, and pair them.\n\nBut to do that, perhaps we can take the first m elements from left_questions and the first m elements from right_others.\n\nOnce paired, those indices are marked as used, and removed from the lists.\n\nBut in practice, we can iterate through the lists and pair them.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut since the left_questions and right_others are lists of indices not yet used, we can proceed as follows:\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nAfter phase 1:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\nleft_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_other = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for phase 2:\n\nWe can pair left_q and right_other.\n\nm = min(len(left_q), len(right_other))\nfor i in range(m):\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n    r_idx = right_other[i]\n    add pair (l_idx+1, r_idx+1)\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, after this, the left_q is left_q[m:], and right_other is right_other[m:].\n\nThen, we can pair right_q with left_other:\n\nm2 = min(len(right_q), len(left_other))\nfor i in range(m2):\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n    l_idx = left_other[i]\n    add pair (l_idx+1, r_idx+1)\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other:\n\nm3 = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(m3):\n    l_idx = left_q[i]\n    r_idx = right_q[i]\n    add pair (l_idx+1, r_idx+1)\n    used_left[l_idx] = True\n    used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, after the first step, the left_q and right_other are processed. However, in the code above, the left_q and right_other are lists that are being iterated. But after pairing, the indices are marked as used, so they won't be considered again.\n\nBut this approach is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the left_q and right_other are lists that are generated once, and the code above is pairing the first m elements. However, this assumes that the order of the elements in the list doesn't matter, which is acceptable since any valid pairing is acceptable.\n\nYes, because the problem allows any valid pairing as long as it's maximum.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False]*n.\n\nProcess phase 1: pairing specific colors.\n\nTo do this, we can use a dictionary for right_color_deques, which maps color to deque of indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nright_color_deques = defaultdict(deque)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_deques[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each left index in 0 to n-1:\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n\n        color = l[i]\n\n        if color in right_color_deques and len(right_color_deques[color]) > 0:\n\n            j = right_color_deques[color].popleft()\n\n            add pair (i+1, j+1)\n\n            mark used_left[i] = True\n\n            mark used_right[j] = True\n\nWait, but this approach processes the left boots in order. For example, for each left index, if it's not used and not a ?, we check if there is a right boot of the same color available, and pair them.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nBut what about the right boots that have specific colors but are not paired with any left boots? For example, if there are more right boots of color 'a' than left boots. They will remain in the right_color_deques, but they are not processed here. However, those right boots will be handled in phase 2.\n\nOnce phase 1 is done, we collect the left_q, right_q, left_other, right_other as described.\n\nThen phase 2 as discussed.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', ...]\n\nBut perhaps the first example is:\n\nInput:\nn = 10\nl = \"codeforces\"\nr = \"dodivthree\"\n\nBut let's think of the code for this.\n\nBut regardless, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, what about the case where there are multiple colors?\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=1\n\nl = \"a\"\n\nr = \"a\"\n\nPhase 1: process left index 0. It is 'a', and right_color_deques has 'a' with [0]. So pair (1,1). All used. Output is 1.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"?a\"\n\nPhase 1: process left index 0, which is 'a'. right_color_deques for 'a' is [1]. So pair (1,2). Then, left index 1 is '?', which is skipped in phase 1.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nleft_q is [1], right_q is [0], left_other is empty, right_other is empty.\n\nThen, step 1: pair left_q (len 1) and right_other (empty) → m=0.\n\nstep 2: pair right_q (len 1) with left_other (empty) → m2=0.\n\nstep 3: pair left_q and right_q → m3=1. So pair (2,1). So total 2 pairs.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"b?\"\n\nPhase 1: left index 0 is 'a', right_color_deques for 'a' is empty (since r is \"b?\"). So no pairing. left index 1 is '?', skipped.\n\nPhase 2:\n\nleft_q is [1], right_q is [1].\n\nstep 1: pair left_q with right_other. right_other is empty (since r[0] is 'b' and not used. Wait, let's see:\n\nAfter phase 1, used_left is [False, False], used_right is [False, False].\n\nleft_other is [0], since l[0] is 'a' and not used.\n\nright_other is [0], since r[0] is 'b' and not used.\n\nSo phase 2:\n\nstep 1: left_q is [1], right_other is [0]. m=1. Pair (2,1). Mark used_left[1] = True, used_right[0] = True.\n\nstep 2: right_q is [1] (original right_q was [1], but after step 1, right_q is still [1]? No, because in phase 2, right_q is collected as [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?'].\n\nAfter phase 1, used_right[0] is False (since in phase 1, we didn't pair it). But during step 1 of phase",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. A color is compatible if it is the same or if one of them is a wildcard ('?'). The solution involves efficiently pairing boots with specific colors first and then using wildcards to maximize the remaining pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, pair left boots with specific colors (non-'?') with right boots of the same color. This is done by maintaining a deque for each color in the right boots to efficiently find matching pairs.\n2. **Handle Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, handle the remaining boots that either have wildcards or could not be paired due to lack of matching specific colors.
