Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another same color or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'.\n\nSo the challenge is to pair as many left and right boots as possible under these rules. And we have to output the actual pairs too, not just the count.\n\nLet me think about the steps required here. Maybe we can approach this by first handling the pairs where both are specific colors. Then handle the ones involving question marks.\n\nBut how to maximize the pairs? Let's think in terms of greedy algorithms. Maybe we can first pair the left and right boots that have the same specific color. Then, for the remaining question marks, pair them with any available boots that are not yet paired.\n\nWait, but there's also the case where a left boot is a '?' and a right boot is a '?'. Those can be paired together, but maybe it's better to use them to pair with specific colors if that allows more total pairs.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots with that color. For each color c, the number of pairs possible is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. We can pair those directly. Then, subtract those counts from the respective left and right arrays.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining question marks. The remaining left '?'s can be paired with any remaining right boots (including those that are '?'), and vice versa. But since both can be '?', we need to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but after step 1, the remaining left and right boots would have:\n\n- Left boots that are either '?' or specific colors that couldn't be matched (because their corresponding right boots were already used up).\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nFor left: some number of '?' and some specific colors that have no matching right boots.\n\nFor right: same.\n\nNow, the remaining question marks can be used to pair with any available boots. However, since each '?' can be used to match with any, perhaps we can pair as many as possible between the remaining left '?'s and right '?'s, and then use the remaining '?'s to pair with the specific color boots that are left.\n\nWait, but how to maximize the total pairs?\n\nLet me think: suppose after step 1, we have L_q left question marks, R_q right question marks, and some specific colors left. Let's say we have L_s left specific colors and R_s right specific colors. But those specific colors can't be paired with anything else except if they have a matching '?'.\n\nWait, no. For example, a left boot with color 'a' (specific) that wasn't paired in step 1 because there were no right 'a's. But if there's a right '?' boot, then this left 'a' can be paired with that right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right 'b' can be paired with a left '?'.\n\nSo perhaps the next step is to pair the remaining specific color boots with the opposite '?'s.\n\nSo the plan could be:\n\n- First, pair all same-color specific pairs (step 1).\n- Then, pair left specific colors with right '?'s (if possible).\n- Then, pair right specific colors with left '?'s (if possible).\n- Finally, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the specific colors first, then use the '?'s to cover the rest.\n\nAnother approach is to collect all the left and right boots, and for each possible pair, try to pair them in a way that maximizes the count.\n\nBut given the constraints (n up to 150,000), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), count how many left and right boots there are. For each c, take min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. These are direct matches. Record these pairs.\n\n2. After that, for the left and right boots, we have remaining:\n\n   - Left boots with color c (specific) that weren't matched (i.e., left_count[c] - matched_count[c]).\n   - Similarly for right boots.\n   - Also, the '?'s in both left and right.\n\n3. Now, for the remaining left boots (specific colors) and right '?'s:\n\n   For each left boot that has a specific color, we can pair it with any unpaired right '?'.\n\n   Similarly, for each right boot with a specific color, pair it with any unpaired left '?'.\n\n   Then, the remaining '?'s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think about data structures.\n\nWe can collect all the indices of left boots that are specific colors (non-?), and similarly for right. Then, for the left specific colors, we can try to pair them with right '?'s. Similarly for right specific colors with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to manage that? Let's think:\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\nLeft boots that are not paired yet:\n\n- Some left boots with specific colors (call them left_specific)\n- Some left boots with '?'\n\nSame for right boots.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Collect all left '?'s and right '?'s.\n\n- For the left specific boots (those not matched in step 1), we can pair them with right '?'s. For example, for each left boot with color c (specific), if there's a right '?' available, pair them. Then, the right '?' is used up.\n\nSimilarly, for right specific boots (those not matched in step 1), pair them with left '?'s.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining '?'s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Because we need to track which boots are already paired.\n\nBut for the purpose of pairing, perhaps we can:\n\n- Create two lists:\n\n   left_unpaired: list of left boots not yet paired. Each entry is (color, index)\n\n   right_unpaired: same for right.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, we can create for the left and right:\n\nleft_questions = list of indices where l[i] is '?'\n\nright_questions = list of indices where r[i] is '?'\n\nThen, after step 1, we can process:\n\nFor each left boot with a specific color (not paired yet), try to pair with a right '?'. For example, for each such left boot, take one from right_questions and pair them. Once that's done, the right '?' is used up.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot with a specific color (not paired yet), pair with a left '?'.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right '?'s can be paired between each other.\n\nBut how to collect the specific left and right boots that are not yet paired?\n\nWait, during step 1, when we pair same-color specific boots, we can track which ones are used. So for example, for each left boot, we can track whether it's used or not. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nInitialize two arrays (used_left and used_right) of booleans, indicating whether a boot is already paired.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nFor each color c (from a-z), collect the list of left indices with color c, and the list of right indices with color c. Then, pair as many as possible (min(len(left_list), len(right_list))). For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, iterate through the left and right boots, and pair them. But for large n, this may be time-consuming if done naively.\n\nBut perhaps using dictionaries to count the frequencies and then process them.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following steps:\n\n1. Read n, l, r.\n\n2. Initialize used_left and used_right arrays of size n, all False.\n\n3. For each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   a. Collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i].\n\n   b. Collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i].\n\n   c. Take the minimum of the two lists, and pair them. Mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these indices? For example, for each color c, we can precompute the list of left and right indices. But for n up to 1.5e5, this is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to create for each color, a list of indices for left and right.\n\nBut even better, for each color c, create a list of left indices (for l), and a list of right indices (for r). Then, for each color c, pair the left and right lists as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for color 'a', suppose we have left_a = [indices of left boots with 'a'], right_a = [indices of right boots with 'a'].\n\nThen, the number of pairs is min(len(left_a), len(right_a)).\n\nFor each i from 0 to min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) - 1:\n\n   pair left_a[i] with right_a[i]\n\nMark them as used.\n\nThis would be O(n) time overall, since each boot is processed once.\n\nOnce this is done, we can proceed to process the question marks.\n\nSo after step 1, the remaining left and right boots are those that are not used, and their colors are either '?' or specific colors that couldn't be paired (because the other side didn't have enough of the same color).\n\nNow, for step 2: process the left '?'s with right specific boots and vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For the remaining left boots (not used) that are '?', we can pair them with any right boots (not used) that are specific or '?'. But we want to maximize the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is:\n\n- For each left '?' not used, try to pair with any right boot not used. But how to choose which ones?\n\nAlternatively, first pair the left '?'s with the right specific boots (so that those specific boots can be used, and the '?'s are used up). Then, pair the remaining '?'s with each other.\n\nSimilarly, pair the right '?'s with the left specific boots.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. For the left '?'s, we can collect all of them (unpaired) into a list. Similarly for the right '?'s.\n\nThen, for each right boot that is not used and is a specific color, check if there is a left '?' available. If so, pair them. Similarly for left boots with specific colors and right '?'s.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all unpaired left boots and unpaired right boots.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect all unpaired left boots with color '?', call them left_q.\n\nCollect all unpaired right boots with color '?', call them right_q.\n\nCollect all unpaired left boots with specific colors (non-?), call them left_s.\n\nCollect all unpaired right boots with specific colors, call them right_s.\n\nNow, for each left_s boot (specific color), we can pair it with any right_q boot. So for each left_s, if there are right_q available, pair them. Similarly, for each right_s boot, pair with left_q.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think of the following steps:\n\nFor each left_s boot (specific color, not used):\n\n   if there are any right_q (unpaired), take one and pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for each right_s boot (specific color, not used):\n\n   if there are any left_q (unpaired), take one and pair them.\n\nOnce that is done, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available? For example, for right_q, we can have a list of indices, and for each left_s, take the first element of the right_q list, and remove it.\n\nBut for this, perhaps we can use queues or stacks. For example, for right_q, we can have a list, and for each left_s, we can pop an element from the right_q list if it exists.\n\nSimilarly for left_q and right_s.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired. Since each '?' can be paired with any other '?', we can pair them in any way (like pairing the first left_q with the first right_q, etc.)\n\nBut how to collect all these?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nFirst, for step 1, we can process all same-color pairs.\n\nThen, for step 2:\n\nCollect all left_q (unpaired left '?'), and right_q (unpaired right '?').\n\nAlso collect left_s (unpaired left specific colors), and right_s (unpaired right specific colors).\n\nThen:\n\nProcess left_s with right_q:\n\nFor each left in left_s:\n\n   if right_q is not empty:\n\n       pair them, mark both as used.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in right_s:\n\n   if left_q is not empty:\n\n       pair them, mark both as used.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as follows:\n\nTake min(len(left_q), len(right_q)), and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect these left_s, right_s, left_q, right_q?\n\nWell, perhaps during step 1, we can collect the indices of left and right boots that are not used. Then, for those, we can separate into specific and question marks.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of the code steps.\n\nAfter step 1, for all i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if not used_left[i], then add to left_unpaired.\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for left_unpaired, we can split into left_q and left_s.\n\nSame for right_unpaired.\n\nSo:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nOnce we have these four lists, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for processing left_s with right_q:\n\nfor each index in left_s:\n\n   if right_q is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from right_q, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for processing right_s with left_q:\n\nfor each index in right_s:\n\n   if left_q is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from left_q, pair them.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, the order in which we process left_s and right_s may affect the total pairs. For example, if we process left_s first, then right_s, or vice versa. Which is better?\n\nProbably, it doesn't matter, as long as we pair as much as possible. But perhaps the best way is to process both directions.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nWe can process left_s and right_q first. Then process right_s and left_q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can have a list of left_s and a list of right_q.\n\nFor each left in left_s:\n\n   if there are any elements in right_q, take one and pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in right_s:\n\n   if there are any elements in left_q, take one and pair them.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nleft_s and right_q are lists. So we can iterate over left_s, and for each, if right_q is not empty, take the first element (pop from the front, or back? It doesn't matter, as long as we take one). Similarly for right_s and left_q.\n\nBut popping from the front of a list is O(n) time. So for large lists, this is not efficient.\n\nAh, but for Python, if we use deque, then popping from the front is O(1). So perhaps we should convert the right_q and left_q into deques.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nright_q_deque = deque(right_q)\nleft_q_deque = deque(left_q)\n\nThen, for each left in left_s:\n\n   if right_q_deque is not empty:\n\n       pair left with right_q_deque.popleft()\n\nSimilarly for processing right_s and left_q_deque.\n\nOnce this is done, the remaining left_q_deque and right_q_deque can be paired.\n\nBut then, how to pair them? For example, if left_q_deque has m elements, and right_q_deque has k elements, then the number of pairs is min(m, k). So for each i in 0 to min(m, k)-1:\n\n   pair left_q_deque[i] with right_q_deque[i].\n\nBut since we have deques, perhaps we can iterate over the deques.\n\nWait, but after the previous steps, the left_q_deque and right_q_deque may have some elements left. So for example, after processing left_s and right_s, the remaining left_q_deque and right_q_deque are those that couldn't be paired with specific colors. Now, we can pair them with each other.\n\nSo for that, take the minimum of the lengths of the two deques, and pair the first min elements.\n\nBut how to get the elements? Well, for example, for the first min(len(left_q_deque), len(right_q_deque)) elements, pair each left with a right.\n\nBut since the deques are ordered, perhaps we can just pair them in order.\n\nSo, for example, we can take the first x elements from left_q_deque and the first x elements from right_q_deque, and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect these pairs? Let's think of code steps:\n\nAfter processing left_s and right_s, the remaining left_q_deque and right_q_deque can be paired as follows:\n\nx = min(len(left_q_deque), len(right_q_deque))\n\nfor i in range(x):\n\n   left_idx = left_q_deque.popleft()\n\n   right_idx = right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n   pair them.\n\nBut this would take O(x) time.\n\nPutting all this together, the code would generate all possible pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is how to collect all the pairs during this process.\n\nSo, the code will have to collect all pairs generated in each step.\n\nBut how to track the used_left and used_right arrays? Because once a boot is paired, it cannot be used again.\n\nBut in the steps above, when we pair a left and right boot, we have to mark them as used in the used_left and used_right arrays.\n\nBut during step 1, we already marked them as used. For the steps after that, when we process left_s and right_q, etc., we need to make sure that we don't reuse the same boots.\n\nBut the way we collect left_q and right_q is by checking if they are not used. So during the initial collection of left_q, right_q, etc., they are not used. Then, when we pair them, we have to mark them as used.\n\nWait, but in the code steps above, after collecting left_q, right_q, etc., they are not used. Then, when we pair them, we have to mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track that? Because when we process the left_s and right_q, we pair them, and need to mark them as used.\n\nBut during the initial collection of left_q and right_q, we have the indices of the boots that are not used. Then, when we pair them, we have to mark them as used.\n\nSo, during the code:\n\nWe have used_left and used_right arrays. Initially, they are filled with False.\n\nIn step 1, when we pair boots, we mark used_left[i] and used_right[j] as True.\n\nIn step 2:\n\nFor example, when pairing a left_s (say index i) with a right_q (index j):\n\n   mark used_left[i] = True\n\n   mark used_right[j] = True\n\nSame for other pairings.\n\nBut during the processing of left_s and right_q, we need to make sure that the right_q indices are not used again.\n\nBut since the right_q list was collected as the unpaired right boots (with '?'), and during the processing, we are taking them from the deque, which is built from that list, and once taken, they are marked as used.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nCollect all the left and right unpaired indices.\n\nThen, for each left_s in left_s list:\n\n   if right_q_deque is not empty:\n\n       take j = right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n       pair (left_s, j)\n\n       mark used_left[left_s] = True\n\n       mark used_right[j] = True\n\nSimilarly for other steps.\n\nSo, the code needs to collect all these pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic efficiently.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures. For example, for step 1, how to collect the same-color pairs.\n\nAn efficient way is to create for each color, a list of left and right indices. Then, for each color, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nFor example, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))\n\n   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n       pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_indices[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_indices[i]] = True\n\nBut this would be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5, since 1.5e5 * 26 is around 4 million.\n\nBut this approach would require for each color, to scan all the left and right boots. However, that may be inefficient. Alternatively, we can pre-process for each color, the list of left and right indices, and then process them.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, the above approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each color, during step 1, we have to process all the left and right boots. That would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, during the initial processing, we can collect for each color, the list of left and right indices. But that would take O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, during step 1, for each color, we can collect the indices once. For example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, process the pairs.\n\nBut this is O(n) time.\n\nBut then, during step 1, for each color c, we can take the min of the left and right counts, and pair them. But how to track which ones are already used?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial left_color_map and right_color_map contain all the indices of the left and right boots with color c. However, during step 1, we need to pair them, but we have to avoid reusing the same indices. However, the initial approach of processing all colors and pairing the left and right indices for each color would not account for the fact that some of those indices may have been already used in previous pairings.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if we process color 'a' first, pair some left and right 'a's, then when processing color 'b', the same left or right indices might be considered again. But that's incorrect.\n\nAh, right! So the initial approach of building the color maps once and then processing them is wrong. Because once a boot is paired, it should not be considered again. Therefore, the approach of building the color maps once and then processing them would not work, because during step 1, we need to process the colors in a way that ensures that once a boot is used, it's not considered again.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial approach of processing step 1 as follows is better:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as False arrays.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices i where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices j where r[j] == c and not used_right[j]\n\n   pair as many as possible (min of the two lists), and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect those lists?\n\nFor each color c, we can loop through all the left boots and check if they are not used and have color c. But for n=1.5e5 and 26 colors, this is O(26n) time.\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nSo, code for step 1:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_list.append(i)\n    # pair them\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        # record this pair\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this would be O(26n) time. For n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut this approach is O(26n) time. But perhaps there's a better way. For example, for each left boot, if it's not used, and its color is not '?', we can add it to a temporary structure. Then, for each color, process the pairs.\n\nBut regardless, this seems manageable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then step 2 proceeds as described earlier.\n\nNow, after step 1, the used_left and used_right arrays are updated. Then, collect the unpaired left and right boots.\n\nOnce that is done, collect left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nThen, process left_s with right_q, and right_s with left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nNow, the code for this part would be something like:\n\nleft_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\nright_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_q = []\nleft_s = []\nfor i in left_unpaired:\n    if l[i] == '?':\n        left_q.append(i)\n    else:\n        left_s.append(i)\n\nright_q = []\nright_s = []\nfor i in right_unpaired:\n    if r[i] == '?':\n        right_q.append(i)\n    else:\n        right_s.append(i)\n\nThen, convert right_q into a deque and process left_s:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nright_q_deque = deque(right_q)\nleft_q_deque = deque(left_q)\n\nfor idx in left_s:\n    if right_q_deque:\n        j = right_q_deque.popleft()\n        pairs.append( (idx+1, j+1) )\n        used_left[idx] = True\n        used_right[j] = True\n\nfor idx in right_s:\n    if left_q_deque:\n        j = left_q_deque.popleft()\n        pairs.append( (j+1, idx+1) )\n        used_left[j] = True\n        used_right[idx] = True\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n\nremaining_left = list(left_q_deque)\nremaining_right = list(right_q_deque)\n\nmin_len = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    pairs.append( (remaining_left[i]+1, remaining_right[i]+1) )\n\nWait, but after processing left_s and right_s, the left_q_deque and right_q_deque have the remaining '?'s. But when we process left_s and right_s, we may have modified the left_q_deque and right_q_deque. So perhaps after the above steps, the remaining elements in left_q_deque and right_q_deque can be paired.\n\nBut in the code above, after processing left_s and right_s, the left_q_deque and right_q_deque may have some elements left. For example, after processing left_s with right_q, the right_q_deque may have some elements left. Then, when processing right_s with left_q, the left_q_deque may have some elements left. Then, the remaining elements can be paired between left_q_deque and right_q_deque.\n\nBut how to collect them? Because in the code above, after processing left_s and right_s, the left_q_deque and right_q_deque are modified. So, perhaps after that, we can take the remaining elements in left_q_deque and right_q_deque and pair them as follows:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q_deque), len(right_q_deque))):\n\n    left_idx = left_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nwhile left_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n\n    left_idx = left_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut this would pair them all.\n\nBut why not? Because for the remaining left_q_deque and right_q_deque, they are all '?', so any pairing between them is allowed. So pairing them in any order is acceptable.\n\nSo the code for this part would be:\n\nwhile left_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n\n    left_idx = left_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n    pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\nThis way, all possible pairs are formed.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\npairs = []\n\nProcess step 1: same-color pairs.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_list and right_list.\n\n   pair as many as possible.\n\nThen, collect unpaired left and right boots.\n\nProcess step 2:\n\nCollect left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nProcess left_s with right_q.\n\nProcess right_s with left_q.\n\nProcess remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, and handle the input and output correctly.\n\nBut what about the indices? The problem says that the input strings l and r are given, and the output requires the indices of the boots (1-based).\n\nNow, considering that the code needs to read input from stdin. The input format is:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nBut looking at the example input given in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut that seems to be a list of test cases. However, the actual input format for the problem is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is l, third line is r. So for each test case, the input is three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input is for a single test case. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nSo the code should read three lines: n, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the user is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, but the original problem's input is for one test case. Wait, no. The problem's input is for a single test case. The sample input seems to be multiple test cases, but perhaps that's an error in formatting. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains l.\n\nThe third line contains r.\n\nBut the sample input shows something different. Wait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nBut this seems to be four test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is for one test case. Therefore, the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the user provided a sample input that seems to be four test cases, but perhaps that's a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem's input is for a single test case. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So the code must read exactly three lines: n, l, r.\n\nAssuming that the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. Therefore, the code should read n, l, r.\n\nNow, the code must process a single test case.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead l from input.\n\nRead r from input.\n\nThen process as per the steps above.\n\nNow, the code must handle the pairs and output them.\n\nNow, the code must collect the pairs in a list, then output the count followed by the pairs.\n\nNow, considering the time constraints.\n\nFor n=1.5e5, the code must run in O(n) time.\n\nBut the step 1 is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, loops can be slow. However, given that 26*1.5e5 is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # However, the input is read as three lines: n, l, r.\n    # So perhaps read via input() function.\n    # But for cases where input is given with multiple lines, perhaps read via sys.stdin.\n\n    # Read n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: pair same color\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n                left_list.append(i)\n        right_list = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c:\n                right_list.append(i)\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: process unpaired\n    # collect unpaired left and right\n    left_unpaired = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            left_unpaired.append(i)\n    right_unpaired = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            right_unpaired.append(i)\n\n    # split into q and s\n    left_q = []\n    left_s = []\n    for i in left_unpaired:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_s.append(i)\n    right_q = []\n    right_s = []\n    for i in right_unpaired:\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_s.append(i)\n\n    # process left_s with right_q\n    dq_right = deque(right_q)\n    dq_left = deque(left_q)\n\n    for idx in left_s:\n        if dq_right:\n            j = dq_right.popleft()\n            pairs.append( (idx + 1, j + 1) )\n            used_left[idx] = True\n            used_right[j] = True\n\n    # process right_s with left_q\n    for idx in right_s:\n        if dq_left:\n            j = dq_left.popleft()\n            pairs.append( (j + 1, idx + 1) )\n            used_left[j] = True\n            used_right[idx] = True\n\n    # process remaining dq_left",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors.
