Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built incrementally by appending 0s and 1s. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. The tricky part is that some Morse code strings are invalid (the four given ones), and we have to exclude those.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly constitutes a valid Morse code string. The problem says that any string of length 1-4 made of 0s and 1s is a possible Morse code for a letter, except those four specific ones. So for each substring of S, if its length is between 1 and 4, we check if it's one of the invalid ones. If not, then it represents a valid letter. But the question isn't about counting the number of valid substrings; it's about counting the number of non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting some substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Hmm. Oh right, the way this works is that each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substring \"111\" can be split as one letter (111), or as two letters (1 and 11), or as three letters (1, 1, 1). But each of these splits would count as different sequences. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each occurrence of a valid Morse code in a substring contributes to the count. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note. In the first sample input, after appending three 1s, S is \"111\". The answer is 7. The explanation lists all the possible sequences. For example, \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"O\" (from \"111\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\" split into two 1s), etc. So each time a substring can be split into valid Morse code letters, each split gives a different sequence. But how do we count all possible such sequences?\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to split any substring of S into valid Morse code letters, considering all possible substrings and all possible splits of those substrings into valid codes. Each split corresponds to a sequence of letters. And each such split is counted once.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, we can track the number of valid sequences that end at that position. Then, for each new character added to S, we can look back up to 4 positions (since Morse code letters are up to 4 characters) and see if any of those substrings ending at the current position are valid. Then, for each valid substring, we can add the number of ways to form sequences ending at the previous positions plus one (for the new single-letter sequence).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid sequences that can be formed using the first i characters of S. Then, when we add a new character (so the string becomes length i+1), we can check for each possible j from i down to i-3 (since the maximum length is 4, but we need to check up to 4 characters back). For each possible k (length of the current code), if the substring ending at i of length k is valid, then we can add dp[i -k] + 1 (the +1 is for the case where the current substring is a single letter). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence relation for dp[i] could be: dp[i] = sum(dp[i - k] for each valid k-length substring ending at i) + 1 (if the current single character is valid). Wait, no. Because for each valid k (1<=k<=4), if the substring S[i-k+1..i] is valid, then the number of sequences ending at i is the sum of dp[i -k] (the number of sequences before that substring) multiplied by 1 (adding this new code) plus 1 if the substring itself is a valid code (as a single element). Or perhaps dp[i] represents the total number of sequences that can be formed in the entire string up to i, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to track for each position, the number of valid sequences that end at that position. Let's think",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The string `S` is built incrementally by appending either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1'), and after each append, we need to compute the count of valid sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. The invalid strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n3. **Incremental Update**: For each new character appended to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, update the DP array by considering sequences formed by extending previous valid sequences or starting new sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:]\n    \n    # Precompute the invalid codes\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] will represent the number of valid sequences ending at position i (0-based)\n    # We'll use a list where index corresponds to the length of S\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[0] is for empty string, not used\n    s = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = ops[i - 1]\n        s.append(c)\n        current_length = i\n        \n        total = 0\n        # Check for substrings ending at current position with length 1 to 4\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n            if current_length - k >= 0:\n                substr = ''.join(s[current_length - k:current_length])\n                if substr not in invalid:\n                    if current_length - k == 0:\n                        # This is a single character, add 1\n                        total += 1\n                    else:\n                        # Add dp[current_length - k] which is the number of sequences before this substring\n                        total += dp[current_length - k]\n                    total %= MOD\n        dp[i] = total\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        print(dp[i] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Invalid Morse Codes**: A set of invalid Morse code strings is precomputed for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is used to track the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`.\n4. **Substring Checks**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, update the count of valid sequences using previously computed values from the `dp` array.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required counts incrementally, ensuring that each update operation is handled in constant time relative to the length of the string, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
