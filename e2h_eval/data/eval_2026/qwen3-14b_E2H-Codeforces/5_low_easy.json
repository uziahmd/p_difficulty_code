Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) must be the same, and a question mark can match any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. For each position, we have a left boot and a right boot. But we can't just pair them directly unless their colors are compatible. Also, since each boot can be in at most one pair, we need to find an optimal way to match them.\n\nLet me think of possible strategies. Maybe we can first try to pair the left boots with the right boots where both have specific colors and are the same. Then handle the question marks.\n\nWait, but question marks can be flexible. So perhaps we should first pair as many specific colors as possible, and then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots with that color. For example, if there are 3 left boots with color 'a' and 2 right boots with color 'a', we can pair 2 of them. The leftover left 'a's would need to be paired with question marks on the other side, or maybe the other way around.\n\nBut then, after pairing specific colors, we have left some left and right boots with '?' or leftovers from specific colors. How to pair those?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\n- First, pair the left boots with specific colors with right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c, take the minimum of the count of left c and right c. Then subtract those from the counts. This gives us the maximum possible pairs for specific colors.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be either '?' or leftovers from specific colors), we can pair them using the question marks. However, since '?' can be matched with anything, we need to pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks optimally? Let's think: suppose after the first step, there are some left boots with '?' and some right boots with '?'. Also, there might be some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired because there were not enough on the other side. Similarly for right boots.\n\nSo, for example, if there are x left '?' and y right '?', then the maximum number of pairs between them is min(x, y). But also, the left '?' can pair with right specific colors that are unpaired, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any other. So maybe the second step is to pair the remaining left boots (including those with specific colors that couldn't be matched) with the right boots (including those with specific colors that couldn't be matched) using the '?'s.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. For all specific colors (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can track which left and right boots are used here.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Because we need to output the actual indices.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of counting, maybe we can process the counts first, and then for the actual pairing, we can collect the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first collect all the left and right boots that can be paired with specific colors. Let me think of the following steps:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts. For each color (excluding '?'), count how many times they appear in l and r. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Summing over all c gives the initial number of pairs.\n\nBut then, after that, the remaining left boots with specific colors are left_counts[c] - min(...), and similarly for the right. Then, for the question marks, we can pair the remaining left '?' with the remaining right '?' and also with the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that when we have left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (because there were not enough on the right), they can be paired with right boots that have '?'. Similarly, right boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired can be paired with left '?'.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\nAfter pairing the specific colors, we have:\n\n- Some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (call this L_remaining)\n- Some right boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (call this R_remaining)\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors, where a color can be a specific lowercase letter or a wildcard ('?'). The wildcard can pair with any color, including another wildcard.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair left boots with right boots of the same color. This ensures we maximize the use of specific color matches first.\n2. **Track Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, track the remaining left and right boots that could not be paired due to insufficient matches.\n3. **Use Wildcards for Remaining Boots**: Use wildcards to pair the remaining left boots with remaining right boots. This includes pairing:\n   - Left wildcards with right specific colors.\n   - Right wildcards with left specific colors.\n   - Left wildcards with right wildcards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_pairs = []\n    right_pairs = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    left_count = defaultdict(int)\n    right_count = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Collect positions for each color\n    left_pos = defaultdict(list)\n    right_pos = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            left_count[c] += 1\n            left_pos[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            left_pos['?'].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        if c != '?':\n            right_count[c] += 1\n            right_pos[c].append(i)\n        else:\n            right_pos['?'].append(i)\n    \n    # Pair specific colors\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    for c in left_count:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c in right_count:\n            min_val = min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n            # Pair them\n            for i in range(min_val):\n                left_idx = left_pos[c][i]\n                right_idx = right_pos[c][i]\n                left_pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                used_left.add(left_idx)\n                used_right.add(right_idx)\n    \n    # Now, collect remaining left and right\n    remaining_left = []\n    remaining_right = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?' and i not in used_left:\n            remaining_left.append((l[i], i))\n        elif l[i] == '?':\n            remaining_left.append(('?', i))\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] != '?' and i not in used_right:\n            remaining_right.append((r[i], i))\n        elif r[i] == '?':\n            remaining_right.append(('?', i))\n    \n    # Now, pair remaining using wildcards\n    # Create lists for left and right with '?'\n    left_wild = []\n    left_spec = []\n    for color, idx in remaining_left:\n        if color == '?':\n            left_wild.append(idx)\n        else:\n            left_spec.append((color, idx))\n    \n    right_wild = []\n    right_spec = []\n    for color, idx in remaining_right:\n        if color == '?':\n            right_wild.append(idx)\n        else:\n            right_spec.append((color, idx))\n    \n    # Pair left_spec with right_wild\n    for color, idx in left_spec:\n        if right_wild:\n            pair_idx = right_wild.pop(0)\n            left_pairs.append((idx + 1, pair_idx + 1))\n    \n    # Pair right_spec with left_wild\n    for color, idx in right_spec:\n        if left_wild:\n            pair_idx = left_wild.pop(0)\n            left_pairs.append((pair_idx + 1, idx + 1))\n    \n    # Pair remaining wilds\n    min_wild = min(len(left_wild), len(right_wild))\n    for i in range(min_wild):\n        left_pairs.append((left_wild[i] + 1, right_wild[i] + 1))\n    \n    print(len(left_pairs))\n    for pair in left_pairs:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Counting Positions**: We count the positions of each color (including wildcards) in both left and right boot strings.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: We first pair left and right boots with the same specific color, ensuring we use as many direct matches as possible.\n4. **Handling Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots by using wildcards to pair with any remaining specific colors or other wildcards.\n5. **Output**: The results are printed, showing the maximum number of pairs and their respective indices.",
