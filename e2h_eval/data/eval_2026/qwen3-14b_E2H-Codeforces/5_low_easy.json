Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks. And we need to output the pairs as well.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes two colors compatible. From the description, two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can pair with any color, including another question mark. So for example, a '?' on the left can pair with any right boot, and vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. So we need to find an optimal way to match them.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One idea is to first match the non-question marks that can be matched directly. Then handle the question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor each color (excluding '?'), we can count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. For example, if there are 3 'a's on the left and 5 'a's on the right, we can pair 3 of them. But once those are paired, those boots can't be used again.\n\nBut then, after handling all the specific colors, the remaining question marks can be matched with any remaining boots (either left or right, but considering that they might have been used already).\n\nWait, but how do we manage the question marks? Because they can be matched with any other boot, but we need to maximize the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first pair the left and right boots that have matching specific colors. Then, use the question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a bipartite graph where left boots are on one side, right boots on the other. An edge exists between a left and right boot if their colors are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach here.\n\nSo the key is to find a greedy strategy that gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nLet me think again. Here's an idea:\n\nFirst, for each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right boots as possible. For example, for color 'a', take the left boots with 'a' and the right boots with 'a'. Pair them up. Once they are paired, they can't be used again.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that were not matched in the first step), we can use the question marks. Since '?' can match with any, we can pair them with any available boots.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks optimally?\n\nBut maybe the order matters. For example, perhaps we should first pair the left question marks with right non-question marks, and then pair the remaining question marks with each other. Or perhaps pair left question marks with right question marks first, but that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- First, pair left and right boots with the same specific color. That's straightforward.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots, pair the left question marks with right non-question marks (if possible), and then pair the remaining question marks with each other.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of data structures. For each color, track the count of left and right boots. But also track which ones are used.\n\nBut since we need to output the actual pairs, we need to track which positions are used.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries for left and right boots, counting the number of each color. But perhaps we need to track the indices of the boots for each color.\n\nBut for the first step, we can process each color (excluding '?') and pair left and right boots of that color.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   Take the left boots with color c that are not yet paired, and the right boots with color c that are not yet paired. Pair them as much as possible. For each pair, record the indices.\n\nOnce that's done, we have some left and right boots left (which are either '?' or not yet paired because their color didn't match).\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we need to pair the '?'s with any available boots.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can collect all the left boots that are not yet paired, and all the right boots that are not yet paired. Then, for each left '?' boot, pair it with any available right boot (non-paired). Similarly, for each right '?' boot, pair it with any available",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by specific colors matching or a question mark ('?') being able to match with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Direct Color Matching**: First, we match left and right boots that have the same specific color (excluding '?'). This is done by counting occurrences of each color on both left and right sides and pairing them up.\n2. **Question Mark Matching**: After handling direct color matches, we handle the remaining boots that are either '?' or not matched yet. We use the flexibility of '?' to match with any remaining boots. Specifically, we pair left '?' boots with non-question mark right boots first, then remaining '?' boots with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left_pairs = [False] * n\n    right_pairs = [False] * n\n    result = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors\n    color_count_left = defaultdict(list)\n    color_count_right = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            color_count_left[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            color_count_right[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    for color in color_count_left:\n        if color in color_count_right:\n            left_list = color_count_left[color]\n            right_list = color_count_right[color]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not left_pairs[left_idx] and not right_pairs[right_idx]:\n                    result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    left_pairs[left_idx] = True\n                    right_pairs[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Match left '?' with right non-?\n    left_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_pairs[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?' and not right_pairs[i]:\n            right_non_q.append(i)\n\n    # Pair left ? with right non-?\n    for i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q))):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n        result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n        left_pairs[left_idx] = True\n        right_pairs[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining ? with ?\n    left_q_remaining = []\n    right_q_remaining = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_pairs[i]:\n            left_q_remaining.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_pairs[i]:\n            right_q_remaining.append(i)\n\n    min_len = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q_remaining[i]\n        right_idx = right_q_remaining[i]\n        result.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n        left_pairs[left_idx] = True\n        right_pairs[right_idx] = True\n\n    print(len(result))\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Matching**: We first count occurrences of each specific color (excluding '?') on both left and right boots.
