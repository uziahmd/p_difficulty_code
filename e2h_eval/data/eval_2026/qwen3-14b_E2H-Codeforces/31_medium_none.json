Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards have numbers within -x to x, and he can use any of those numbers as needed. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. Then, the required sum is zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards that sum up to -S, with each card's value between -x and x.\n\nWait, but since we can choose any numbers (as long as their absolute value is <=x), how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the target sum is T = -S. We need to find the minimal number of cards that sum to T. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, then the minimal number of cards is ceiling(T / x). Because each card can contribute at most x. Similarly, if T is negative, then the minimal number is ceiling( |T| / x ), since each card can contribute at most -x (so you need to take |T| divided by x, rounded up).\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose T is 3 and x is 2. Then, each card can contribute up to 2. So 3/2 is 1.5, so we need 2 cards. Which would be 2 + 1, but since the maximum is 2, maybe 2 + 1? Wait, but the cards can have any value between -x and x. So for T=3, the minimal number is 2 cards: 2 and 1. But wait, 2 + 1 is 3. But the maximum allowed is x=2. So yes, possible. So the minimal count is ceil(3/2) = 2.\n\nAnother example: T is 2 and x is 2. Then one card is enough. So ceil(2/2) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, if T is 5 and x is 2: 5/2 is 2.5 → ceil is 3. So 2+2+1 = 5. So three cards.\n\nSo the general approach is: compute T = -sum_of_found_cards. Then, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So that's the case.\n\nWait, but what about when T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call it current_sum. Then T is -current_sum. If T is zero, answer is zero. Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, take the ceiling of that. That's the minimal number of cards.\n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause each card can contribute up to x (or down to -x). So, for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T/x). Similarly for negative T, since the absolute value is the same.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nif T == 0: 0\n\nelse: ceil( abs(T) / x )\n\nBut how to compute the ceiling of division in Python?\n\nIn Python, for positive integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nYes. So for example, 3 / 2 → (3 +2-1) //2 =4//2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute current_sum = sum of the list.\n\nT = -current_sum.\n\nif T is zero: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nresult = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\noutput result.\n\nWait, but let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. So abs_T is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1)//2 → 3//2 = 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. abs_T is 4. x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 → 6/3=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is zero, output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 2. (5 +2-1)/2 →6/2=3. Correct.\n\nWhat if T is 0? Then output 0.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nThen read the list of numbers.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum of the list.\n\nt = -current_sum\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1) // x )\n\nWait, but what if x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. Because input constraints say x is between 1 and 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nYes. So that's the solution.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1,1,2 → sum is 2. t=-2. abs_t is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 → 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: n=2, x=3, numbers are -2,-2. sum is -4. t=4. (4 +3-1)/3 → 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother example: sum is 3, x=3. Then (3 +3-1)/3 →5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 →6/3=2. Which is correct, since 3+1=4 (but 1 is allowed as x=3, so two cards).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is two integers n and x. Second line is n integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and x.\n\nThen read the second line, split into list of integers.\n\nsum_current = sum of the list.\n\nt = -sum_current.\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1) // x )\n\nThat's the code.\n\nSo for the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\nsum is 2 → t is -2. abs_t is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1.\n\nSecond case: sum is -4 → t is 4. (4 +3-1)//3 = 6//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase where sum is zero: output 0.\n\nCase where t is exactly divisible by x: e.g., t=6, x=3 → 6/3=2 → 2 cards.\n\nAnother case where t is 1, x=1 → 1/1=1 → 1 card.\n\nAnother case where t is 1, x=2 → (1 +2-1)/2 → 2/2=1 → 1 card. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",

The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum required to balance the found cards to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value x, rounding up to ensure we use the minimum number of cards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\nt = -current_sum\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    print((abs_t + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by a list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Current Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we compute the minimum number of cards required by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by `x`, adjusting for ceiling division using the formula `(abs_t + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
