They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find all integers x that can be the winning team given the tournament structure and the string s which dictates the rules for each phase. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. The tournament has 2^n teams, and each phase halves the number of teams. For each phase, depending on whether the character is 0 or 1, the matches are decided by lower or higher skill levels. \n\nThe key here is to figure out, for each possible x (from 1 to 2^n), whether there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. But since p is a permutation, each value from 1 to 2^n appears exactly once. However, the problem says that x is winning if such a permutation exists. \n\nBut how do we model the tournament? Let's think recursively. For each phase, the way teams are paired and who wins depends on the current phase's rule. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. The winners proceed to the next phase. Then in phase 2, they are paired again in the same way, but with the winners from previous rounds. \n\nBut the problem is that the actual arrangement of the teams in the bracket depends on the initial permutation. Wait, no. Wait, the initial arrangement of the teams is fixed? Or can the permutation p be arranged in any way? Wait, the permutation p is given, but the problem says that we can choose any permutation p such that x is the winner. So our job is to find all x where there exists some permutation p (with p being a permutation of 1..2^n) such that when the tournament is run according to the rules in s, x ends up as the winner. \n\nSo the challenge is to model the tournament for any possible permutation p, but find for which x there exists at least one p that allows x to win. \n\nBut how can we model this? Because the permutation p determines the initial positions of the teams. For example, if x is to be the winner, it must be placed in the bracket in such a way that it can win all the required matches according to the rules of each phase. \n\nWait, perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary tree. Each round is a level of the tree. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final winner. \n\nBut the problem is that the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket affects their path through the tournament. For example, in the first round, each team is paired with the next one. So, for a team to reach the final, it must win its matches in each round. \n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily, perhaps we can arrange the teams in such a way that x is positioned in the bracket so that it can win each round according to the rules. \n\nSo, the idea is to find for each x, the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to win each round, considering the rules of each phase. \n\nWait, but how does the phase rules affect the matches? For example, during phase i (the i-th phase in the tournament), which is the (n - i + 1)-th round? Let's clarify the phases. \n\nThe tournament has n phases. For example, when n=3, there are 3 phases. The first phase has 2^(3-1) = 4 games (since 2^3 teams, first phase reduces to 2^2 teams). Then phase 2 has 2^(3-2) = 2 games, then phase 3 has 1 game. \n\nEach phase corresponds to a round. For each round, the matches are determined by grouping the teams into pairs. For example, in the first phase, the first two teams are paired, then the next two, etc. The winners of these matches proceed to the next phase. \n\nSo, for a team to win the tournament, it must win each of the n phases. \n\nNow, for each phase, the way the team wins depends on the rule (s[i] is 0 or 1). For example, in phase i (starting from 1?), during that phase, in each match, the team with lower or higher skill level wins. \n\nBut the problem is that during each phase, the team's opponents depend on the initial arrangement. However, since we can choose the permutation p, perhaps we can arrange the initial positions so that in each phase, the team x faces opponents that it can beat according to the rules of that phase. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for a team to win the tournament, it must be able to win each round. For each round, depending on the rule (0 or 1), the team needs to have a certain relationship with the other teams in its bracket. \n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), the rule is s[0] (assuming 0-based index). If s[0] is '1', then in each match, the higher skill level team wins. So, for x to win this phase, it must be that in its initial match, it is the higher-skilled team. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the initial positions. So, for example, if the rule in phase 1 is '1', then x must be placed in a pair where the other team has a lower skill. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange that. However, in subsequent phases, the opponents depend on the previous rounds. \n\nBut perhaps we can model for each x, what is the minimal and maximal possible rank (in terms of skill) that x must have in order to pass each round. \n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team must be able to win its match according to the rule of that round. \n\nBut how do the opponents in each round look like? For example, in the first round, the team x is in a pair with another team. The winner proceeds to the second round. In the second round, the winner is paired with another winner from another pair, etc. \n\nBut since we can arrange the initial positions, perhaps we can arrange that in each round, x's opponents are as weak as possible (if the rule is that higher skill wins) or as strong as possible (if the rule is lower skill wins). \n\nWait, but the rules for each round are fixed. Let's think for each round. \n\nSuppose that during round i (the i-th phase), the rule is s[i-1] (assuming 0-based string). \n\nIn order for x to win this round, when it's playing against an opponent, the rule determines which one wins. \n\nSo, for x to survive round i, it must be that either:\n\n- If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), x's skill is higher than the opponent's.\n\n- If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), x's skill is lower than the opponent's.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial permutation, perhaps we can arrange that in each round, x's opponents are such that this condition holds. \n\nBut how do we determine what is the minimal and maximal possible values of x's skill that would allow it to pass all rounds?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the opponents in each round are not arbitrary. For example, in the first round, x's opponent is someone else. Then, in the second round, the opponent is the winner of another match. So, the opponents in each round depend on the structure of the tournament bracket. \n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, perhaps we can arrange the initial bracket such that in each round, x's opponents are as weak as possible (if the rule for that round is '1') or as strong as possible (if the rule is '0'). \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. \n\nLet me consider that for each round, the team x needs to be able to beat all possible opponents in that round. \n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. Let's suppose that the rule is '1'. Then, x must be stronger than the team it's facing. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can arrange that the other team is the weakest possible. However, in the next rounds, the opponents may be the winners of other matches. \n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's skill level based on the rules of each phase?\n\nAnother approach: think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each match is a node, and the leaves are the initial teams. For x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all matches along the path from the leaf to the root. \n\nBut the problem is that the structure of the tree depends on the initial arrangement of the teams. However, since we can arrange the initial positions, perhaps we can arrange the tree such that in each round, the opponents that x faces are the ones that can be beaten according to the rules of that round. \n\nLet me think of the following: For each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. For x to win the tournament, during each round i, x must be able to beat its opponent. \n\nBut what determines the opponent in each round? Well, in the first round, x is paired with another team. In the second round, x is paired with the winner of another match. \n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange that in each round i, the opponent that x faces is the minimal possible (if the rule for that round is '1') or maximal possible (if the rule is '0'), allowing x to pass. \n\nSo, for each round, the required condition is that x's skill is sufficient to beat the opponent, which is determined by the rule. \n\nBut how to compute the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have to satisfy all rounds?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each round, the number of teams that x must have beaten in that round is determined by the rules. \n\nFor example, during the first round, x must beat one team. During the second round, x must beat another team (the winner of another match). And so on. \n\nBut to model this, perhaps for each round, we can determine the number of teams that must be \"weaker\" or \"stronger\" than x. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a set of constraints on x's value. For example, for each round i, depending on the rule, x must be either higher or lower than a certain number of teams. \n\nLet me try to think of the constraints. \n\nLet's imagine that during round 1 (the first phase), the rule is s[0]. Suppose s[0] is '1' (higher skill wins). Then, in order for x to win this round, x must be stronger than the team it's facing. Since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose that team to be the weakest possible. However, in the next rounds, the opponents will be the winners of other matches, which may require x to be stronger than more teams. \n\nBut perhaps, for each round, the number of teams that x must be stronger than (or weaker than) depends on the rules of that round and the previous rounds. \n\nWait, here's an idea. For each round i (starting from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's think about how many teams x must have beaten in that round. \n\nIn the first round, x beats 1 team. In the second round, it beats another team. And so on. So, in total, x must have beaten n teams (since there are n rounds). However, each of these teams is the winner of their own bracket. \n\nBut how can we model the minimal and maximal possible values of x? \n\nAnother approach: For x to be the champion, it must be the case that in each round i, the rule s[i-1] allows x to win its match. To ensure that, we need to have that x is either higher or lower than all the teams that could possibly be in its path. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the rule determines whether x must be the strongest or weakest in its group. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for each round, the number of teams that x must have beaten in that round's bracket depends on the rules. \n\nFor example, during the first round (phase 1), the rule is s[0]. Suppose it's '1', meaning higher skill wins. So x must be stronger than the team it faces. Then, in the next round (phase 2), the rule is s[1]. Suppose it's '0', meaning lower skill wins. So, in that round, x must be weaker than the team it faces. Wait, but that's impossible unless x is weaker than the opponent. But how can that happen if x was stronger than the team it faced in the first round? \n\nAh, but this is a contradiction. Therefore, x cannot be the winner in this scenario. \n\nWait, but that depends on how the opponents are arranged. For example, in phase 2, x's opponent is the winner of another match. So, perhaps in that other match, the winner is a team that is even stronger than x, and the rule in phase 2 is that lower skill wins. So x would lose. But that's not allowed. \n\nSo, in order for x to win, during phase 2, the rule is '0' (lower skill wins). Therefore, x must be the lower-skilled team in that match. Which implies that the opponent is stronger than x. But how can x have won the previous rounds? Because in the first round, x had to be stronger than its opponent. Then, in the second round, x is facing a team that is stronger than x. But how did that team get there? \n\nThis suggests that the rules for different rounds can impose conflicting constraints on x's skill level. \n\nBut how to resolve this? \n\nMaybe the solution is to find for each x the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to pass all the rounds. \n\nLet me think of the following: For each round i, the rule is s[i-1]. Let's imagine that during round i, x must be the minimum or maximum in a group of size 2^{i} teams. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach. For each round, the number of teams that x must be compared against depends on the round. For example, in the first round, x is in a group of 2 teams (so, x must be the min or max of that group). In the second round, x is in a group of 4 teams (so, x must be the min or max of that group, depending on the rules of the rounds). \n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps there's a pattern here. \n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. The root is the final match, which requires that the two finalists have passed through their respective subtrees. \n\nBut how to model the constraints on x's skill? \n\nAn alternative approach comes to mind. Since the permutation can be chosen arbitrarily, we can arrange the initial bracket such that x's path through the tournament is as favorable as possible. \n\nFor example, in each round i, the rule is s[i-1]. For x to win that round, during that round, x must be the winner of its match. Depending on the rule, this means that x is the strongest (if rule is 1) or weakest (if rule is 0) in that match. \n\nBut in order for x to reach the next round, the opponents in each round must be arranged in such a way that x can win. \n\nSo, for each round, the number of teams that x must be stronger than (or weaker than) depends on the rules of the rounds. \n\nLet me think of the following: For each round i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's imagine that during round i, x must be the minimum or maximum in a group of size 2^{i} teams. \n\nWait, for example, in round 1, the group is 2 teams. In round 2, the group is 4 teams. In round 3, 8 teams, etc. \n\nBut why? Because in each round, the number of teams that x must have beaten in order to reach that round is 2^{i-1} teams. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: \n\nThe first round (phase 1) has 2^{n-1} games. Each game reduces the number of teams by half. So, to reach the final (the nth round), x must have won n rounds. \n\nBut in each round, the number of teams in the bracket that x is part of doubles. For example, in round 1, the bracket is 2 teams. Round 2, it's 4 teams. Round 3, 8 teams, etc. \n\nTherefore, for x to win the tournament, during each round i, it must be the best (according to the rule) in its bracket of 2^i teams. \n\nWait, but how does this work? \n\nFor example, in the first round, x is in a bracket of 2 teams. If the rule is '1', x must be the stronger of the two. Then, in the second round, x is in a bracket of 4 teams. But in that bracket, x must be the stronger of the two teams that made it to the second round. But how? Because the other team in the second round bracket is the winner of another match. \n\nSo, for x to be the winner of the second round, it must be that in that round's match, x is better than the other team. Which depends on the rule for that round. \n\nSo, for each round, the rule determines whether x must be the maximum or minimum in its bracket. \n\nThus, for each round i, the bracket size is 2^i teams, and x must be the max or min in that bracket, depending on the rule for that round. \n\nIf that's the case, then the constraints on x's value would be that:\n\n- For each round i, x must be the max (if s[i-1] is '1') or min (if s[i-1] is '0') in the bracket of size 2^i teams. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nLet me think. For example, if in all rounds, the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in all brackets. So, the maximum of the entire tournament (since the last bracket is all teams). Hence, x must be the maximum possible value, which is 2^n. \n\nBut in the sample input, when n=1 and s is '1', the output is 2. Which matches this. \n\nAnother example: sample input 2 is n=2 and s is '01'. Output is 2 3. \n\nLet me see. For n=2, there are 4 teams. The tournament has 2 phases. \n\nPhase 1 (i=1) rule is '0', meaning lower skill wins. Phase 2 (i=2) rule is '1', higher skill wins. \n\nFor x to be the winner, during phase 1, x must be the minimum in its bracket of 2 teams. Then, during phase 2, x must be the maximum in its bracket of 4 teams. \n\nSo, how can this be possible? \n\nLet me think. For phase 1, x must be the minimum in a pair. So, there's another team in that pair with higher skill. Then, in phase 2, x is matched against the winner of another pair. The rule for phase 2 is higher skill wins. So, x must be higher than that opponent. \n\nBut how can x be the minimum in its initial pair, but then be the maximum in the entire bracket of 4 teams? \n\nWell, let's say x is 2. Then, in phase 1, the other team in the pair must be higher than 2 (say, 3 or 4). Then, in phase 2, the other team is the winner of another pair. For x to win, that other team must be lower than 2. But since x is the minimum in its initial pair (so it's 2, and the other is higher), but the other bracket must have a winner that is lower than 2. That's only possible if that other bracket's winner is 1. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the initial bracket for x is (2 vs 3), and the other bracket is (1 vs 4). Then, in phase 1, 2 wins (because rule is 0, lower skill wins). The other bracket, 1 wins (since 1 is lower than 4). Then, in phase 2, rule is 1 (higher skill wins), so 2 vs 1: 2 wins. Thus, x=2 is a valid solution. \n\nSimilarly, x=3. For phase 1, x must be the minimum in its bracket. So, the other team must be higher than 3. So, in phase 1, x=3 would have to be paired with 4. Then, in phase 2, x=3 must be the maximum in the bracket of 4 teams. The other bracket would have to be (1 vs 2). The winner is 1 (because rule is 0, lower skill wins). Then, in phase 2, 3 vs 1: 3 wins (rule is 1, higher skill wins). So x=3 is also valid. \n\nThus, the output is 2 and 3. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo, the approach seems to be that for each round i, x must be the minimum or maximum in a bracket of size 2^i teams. \n\nSo, for each x, the constraints are:\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n):\n\n- If the rule in round i is '1', then x must be the maximum in the bracket of size 2^i teams.\n\n- If the rule in round i is '0', then x must be the minimum in the bracket of size 2^i teams.\n\nBut how do we translate this into constraints on x's value? \n\nLet me think. For example, in the first round (i=1), the bracket is of size 2. So, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in this bracket. Which implies that there is exactly one team in the bracket with higher skill than x. But since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can choose the other team to be higher. But for the next rounds, the constraints are that in the bracket of size 2^2, x must be the maximum if the rule for i=2 is '1', etc. \n\nBut how can we find for x the minimal and maximal possible values that satisfy all these constraints? \n\nLet me think of the constraints as follows:\n\nFor each round i, the rule determines whether x must be the maximum or minimum in a group of size 2^i. \n\nBut for this to be possible, x must be able to have enough teams that are either all smaller or larger than it. \n\nFor example, for the first round (i=1), if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum of 2 teams. So, there must be at least one team that is smaller than x. \n\nFor the second round (i=2), if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum of 4 teams. So, there must be at least 3 teams that are smaller than x. \n\nBut for all rounds, the constraints accumulate. \n\nSo, for each round i, depending on the rule, the number of teams that must be less than or greater than x depends on the rules of the previous rounds. \n\nWait, but how do the rules of different rounds interact? \n\nFor example, suppose in round 1, the rule is '1' (x must be max of 2 teams). In round 2, the rule is '0' (x must be min of 4 teams). How can x be the max in 2 teams and the min in 4 teams? \n\nThat would require that in the 4 teams, x is the smallest. But in the first round, x was the max of 2 teams. Which implies that there's another team in that first bracket that is smaller than x. But then, in the second round's bracket of 4 teams, x is the smallest. Which implies that all other 3 teams in that bracket are larger than x. But one of them is the team that was smaller than x in the first round. Contradiction. \n\nSo, how can this be possible? It's not possible. Therefore, such x cannot be a winning integer. \n\nBut this suggests that the constraints for different rounds must be compatible. \n\nSo, the key is to find for x the minimal and maximal number of teams that must be less than or greater than x, based on the rules of the rounds. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor each round i, the rule determines whether x must be the maximum or minimum in a group of 2^i teams. \n\nLet me define for each round i:\n\n- If the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in that group. Therefore, in that group, there are (2^i - 1) teams that are less than x. \n\n- If the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in that group. Therefore, in that group, there are (2^i - 1) teams that are greater than x. \n\nBut since the groups for different rounds are nested (each group for round i+1 includes the group for round i plus another group from the same round), the constraints must be compatible. \n\nWait, but how? For example, in round 1, the group is 2 teams. In round 2, the group is 4 teams. So, the group for round 2 includes the group of round 1 and another group of 2 teams. \n\nThus, for x to be the maximum in the group of 2 teams (round 1) and also the maximum in the group of 4 teams (round 2), then all teams in the 4-team group must be less than x. \n\nWhich implies that in round 2's group, x is the maximum. \n\nSimilarly, if in round 1, x is the maximum of 2 teams, and in round 2, x is the minimum of 4 teams, then that's impossible, because the group of 4 teams includes the 2 teams from round 1, and x is the maximum of those 2 teams, but must be the minimum of the 4 teams. So, there must be teams in the other 2 teams that are smaller than x, but that's impossible because x was already the maximum in its own 2 teams. \n\nThus, the constraints for different rounds must be compatible. \n\nTherefore, for x to be a valid winning integer, the following must hold:\n\nFor each round i, the required number of teams that are less than x (if rule is '1') or greater than x (if rule is '0') must be compatible with the constraints from all previous rounds. \n\nSo, how can we model this? \n\nLet me think about the cumulative constraints. Let's process the rounds from first to last. \n\nLet's consider that for each round i, the rule is r_i (s[i-1]). \n\nFor each round, the number of teams that must be less than x (if r_i is '1') or greater than x (if r_i is '0') is (2^i - 1). \n\nBut how do these numbers add up? \n\nFor example, if in round 1, the rule is '1', then x must have at least 1 team less than it. \n\nIn round 2, if the rule is '1', then x must have at least 3 teams less than it. \n\nBut since the 3 teams include the previous 1 team, this is compatible. \n\nIf in round 2, the rule is '0', then x must have at least 3 teams greater than it. However, in round 1, x had 1 team less than it. So, how can this be possible? \n\nBecause in the 4-team group for round 2, x must be the minimum. Which implies that all other 3 teams are greater than x. So, in the first round, the group of 2 teams must have x as the maximum (so one team less than x). But in the second round's group of 4 teams, the other 2 teams (from the other bracket) must be greater than x. \n\nSo, x has 1 team less than it (from its own bracket) and 3 teams greater than it (from the other brackets). But how can that be possible? \n\nYes. For example, x is 2, and the teams are 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nIn round 1, x (2) is paired with 1. Rule is '1', so x must be the maximum. Which it is. Then, in round 2, the other bracket is 3 vs 4. The winner is 3 (since rule is '0', lower skill wins? No, wait the rule for round 2 is '0' in this hypothetical case. Wait, no. Let me rephrase. \n\nLet me take an example where for round 1, rule is '1', and for round 2, rule is '0'. \n\nThen, for x to be the winner:\n\nIn round 1, x is the maximum in a group of 2 teams. So, there's one team less than x. \n\nIn round 2, x is the minimum in a group of 4 teams. So, there are three teams greater than x. \n\nBut the group of 4 teams includes the group of 2 teams (x and one team less than x) and another group of 2 teams. \n\nIn the other group of 2 teams, the winner must be greater than x. \n\nSo, the other group must have two teams where the winner (based on the rule of round 1) is greater than x. \n\nBut the rule for round 1 is '1', so the winner is the higher-skilled. \n\nSo, for the other group of 2 teams, the winner is the higher-skilled. To have that winner be greater than x, both teams in that group must be greater than x. \n\nSo, x must have 1 team less than it (from its own group) and 2 teams greater than it (from the other group). \n\nBut the round 2 requires that x is the minimum of the 4 teams. Which means all 3 other teams are greater than x. Which is satisfied here. \n\nSo, in this case, x must be such that there are 1 team less than it (from round 1) and 3 teams greater than it (from round 2). \n\nBut how can that be possible? Well, the total number of teams is 4. So, x must be such that there is exactly 1 team less than it and 3 teams greater than it. That's possible only if x is the second smallest team. For example, x=2 in the 4 teams [1, 2, 3, 4]. \n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- For round i, if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than (2^i - 1) teams.\n\n- If the rule is '0', then x must be less than (2^i - 1) teams.\n\nBut how can we combine these constraints across all rounds?\n\nLet me think that for each round, the required number of teams less than or greater than x is (2^i - 1). \n\nBut for different rounds, the required numbers may vary. \n\nFor example, if the rule for round 1 is '1', then x must have at least 1 team less than it. For round 2, if the rule is '1', then x must have at least 3 teams less than it. \n\nSo, the maximum of these numbers is the total number of teams that x must be greater than. \n\nSimilarly, if for some round, the rule is '0', then x must be less than (2^i - 1) teams. \n\nBut how to combine these constraints?\n\nLet me think that for each round i, the required number of teams that must be less than x is the sum of the required for '1' rules, and the required number of teams that must be greater than x is the sum for '0' rules. \n\nNo, that's not correct. Because each round's requirement is about a specific group of teams. \n\nWait, but the groups are nested. For example, the group for round i is 2^i teams. The group for round i+1 is 2^{i+1} teams, which consists of two groups of 2^i teams. \n\nSo, the constraints for each round i are cumulative. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nLet's process the rounds from first to last. For each round, we can calculate the minimal number of teams that must be less than x (call it L) and the minimal number of teams that must be greater than x (call it G). \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each round, depending on the rule, we can calculate the required number of teams that x must be greater than or less than. \n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nlow = the minimal number of teams that must be less than x.\n\nhigh = the minimal number of teams that must be greater than x.\n\nInitially, low = 0 and high = 0.\n\nFor each round i from 1 to n:\n\n   if the rule is '1' (max in group of 2^i teams):\n\n      then, in this group, there are (2^i - 1) teams less than x. \n\n      But since this group is part of the larger groups in subsequent rounds, we need to ensure that the current low is updated to be at least (2^i - 1).\n\n      However, if in previous rounds, there were constraints that required more teams to be less than x, then this new constraint may be redundant.\n\n      For example, if in a previous round, the required number of teams less than x was 3, and now for this round, it's 1, then the current constraint is already satisfied.\n\n      So, for each '1' rule, the required number of teams less than x is (2^i - 1). So, low must be at least (2^i - 1).\n\n   else (rule is '0' (min in group of 2^i teams)):\n\n      then, there are (2^i - 1) teams greater than x. So, high must be at least (2^i - 1).\n\nBut how do these constraints accumulate? \n\nFor example, suppose that in round 1, the rule is '1' (so low must be >= 1). In round 2, the rule is '1' (so low must be >= 3). Then, the total low is 3. \n\nBut if in round 2, the rule is '0', then high must be >= 3. \n\nSo, after processing all rounds, the total number of teams that must be less than x is low, and the total number of teams that must be greater than x is high. \n\nBut since the total number of teams is 2^n, we have:\n\nlow + high + 1 (for x itself) = 2^n.\n\nBut for x to exist, we must have low + high + 1 <= 2^n. Which it always is. \n\nBut the constraints are that:\n\nlow must be the maximum of all (2^i - 1) for rounds where the rule is '1'.\n\nhigh must be the maximum of all (2^i - 1) for rounds where the rule is '0'.\n\nOnce we compute low and high, then x must be such that:\n\nlow <= (x - 1) (since there are at least low teams less than x)\n\nand \n\nhigh <= (2^n - x) (since there are at least high teams greater than x).\n\nBut wait, the number of teams less than x is (x-1) if all numbers are unique. Similarly, the number of teams greater than x is (total_teams - x). \n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, as long as there are enough teams less than x and enough teams greater than x, we can arrange the permutation. \n\nTherefore, for x to be a winning integer, it must satisfy:\n\nlow <= x - 1 \n\nand \n\nhigh <= (2^n - x)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nx >= low + 1 \n\nand \n\nx <= (2^n - high)\n\nSo, combining these two inequalities, the valid x's are those in the interval [low + 1, 2^n - high], inclusive. \n\nBut how do we compute low and high?\n\nLet me think. For each round i, if the rule is '1', then we have to take the maximum between current low and (2^i - 1). Similarly for '0' and high.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n101\n\nSo n=3, s is '101'.\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: rule '1' (s[0] is '1')\n\nRound 2: rule '0' (s[1] is '0')\n\nRound 3: rule '1' (s[2] is '1')\n\nFor each round, compute the (2^i - 1) value:\n\nRound 1: i=1, 2^1 -1 = 1\n\nRound 2: i=2, 2^2 -1 = 3\n\nRound 3: i=3, 2^3 -1 =7\n\nNow, for low, which is the maximum of all (2^i -1) for rounds with '1' rules. \n\nRounds with '1' are round 1 and 3. Their values are 1 and 7. So low =",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves analyzing the constraints imposed by each phase's rule and determining the valid range of skill levels that can satisfy all these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and $n$ phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' or '1') determining whether the team with the lower or higher skill level wins each match.\n3. **Constraints Calculation**: For each phase, depending on the rule, we calculate the minimum number of teams that must be either less than or greater than the winning team. This is done by considering the size of the bracket in each phase.\n4. **Determine Valid Range**: Using the calculated constraints, we determine the valid range of skill levels that can potentially win the tournament by ensuring there are enough teams both below and above the candidate skill level.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    low = 0\n    high = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        phase = i + 1\n        size = 2 ** phase\n        required = size - 1\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            if required > low:\n                low = required\n        else:\n            if required > high:\n                high = required\n    \n    min_x = low + 1\n    max_x = total_teams - high\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_x, max_x + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer $n$ and a string $s$ representing the rules for each phase.\n2. **Total Teams Calculation**: The total number of teams is $2^n$.\n3. **Constraints Calculation**: For each phase, based on the rule ('0' or '1'), we calculate the required number of teams that must be either less than or greater than the winning team. These values are stored in `low` and `high`.\n4. **Valid Range Determination**: The valid skill levels $x$ must be within the range $[low + 1, total_teams - high]$, ensuring there are enough teams both below and above $x$ to satisfy all phase constraints.\n5. **Output**: The valid skill levels are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the valid skill levels by leveraging the constraints derived from each phase's rules, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
