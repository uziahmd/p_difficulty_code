He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the string must have a certain structure. Let's break down the conditions.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of some 'a's followed by some 'b's followed by some 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order is important. Like, the 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. So if the string has any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, that's invalid. Similarly for 'b's after 'c's.\n\nSo first thing to check: the string should be in the form of a bunch of a's, then b's, then c's. So the characters should be in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Like, all a's first, then b's, then c's. So if there's a 'b' followed by an 'a', that's invalid. Or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo the first check is to make sure that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. How can I check this?\n\nFor example, in the sample input 'bbacc' is invalid because after the 'b's, there's an 'a' which is not allowed. So the order is wrong.\n\nSo the first step is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters must be in order. So, for example, the string should not have any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, and no 'b's after 'c's.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has some a's and b's. Then C appends c's equal to either the count of a's or the count of b's in that string (before adding the c's). So when C adds the c's, the count of c's must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But wait, the count of a's and b's before adding c's is the same as the count in the entire string, because the c's are added after.\n\nWait, the original string before adding c's is the string from A and B. So the count of a's and b's in that string is count_a and count_b. Then C adds count_c = count_a or count_b. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b (from the original a and b counts).\n\nBut in the final string, the count of a's is the same as the original (since C added only c's). Similarly for b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the condition is: count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. Also, since after B's step, there is at least one a and one b. So the original string (before adding c's) must have at least one a and one b. Which implies that the original string (the a's and b's part) must have count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. But since the final string includes those, then in the final string, count_a and count_b must be at least 1. So in the final string, count_a >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c >=1 (since C added some c's, but according to the problem statement, C appends some number of c's. However, the problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the count_c can't be zero. Wait, but the problem says that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string (before adding c's). Since the original string (after B's step) has at least one a and one b, so the count_c must be equal to count_a (which is >=1) or count_b (>=1). Therefore, count_c must be >=1. So the final string must have at least one c as well. So the total counts must satisfy count_a >=1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of appending characters. The string must start with some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before the 'c's were appended.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and then a block of 'c's. This ensures that the order of characters is correct.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. Also, ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    prev_char = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char < prev_char:\n            return False\n        prev_char = char\n    \n    # Count the number of a's, b's, c's\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there is at least one a, one b, and one c\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(input_str):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The loop iterates through each character in the string to ensure that the characters are in non-decreasing order (i.e., all 'a's first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's).\n2. **Count Validation**: After counting the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c', we check if there is at least one of each character. This ensures that the string meets the initial conditions set by A and B.\n3. **C Count Check**: Finally, we verify if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the string was formed correctly according to the problem's constraints.",
