Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about Homer and Marge choosing turns to take digits from a number A such that each makes exactly n moves (since the total digits are 2n). The goal is to maximize their total prize, which is S1 + S2. And we need to output the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the selection works. Each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit and appends it to their number. So the order of taking digits depends on the sequence of H and M choices. For example, if the sequence is HHMM, then Homer takes first two digits, Marge the next two.\n\nThe challenge is to choose the order of H and M such that when all digits are taken, the sum of their numbers is maximized. But since both players are trying to maximize their own total, but here we need to maximize the sum of both, not individual gains. Wait, but how does that work? Because if one player takes a higher digit, that might leave lower digits for the other. But since the total is S1 + S2, which is the sum of all digits taken by both. Wait wait! Wait a minute: the sum S1 + S2 is just the sum of all digits in A multiplied by their respective place values. Wait no, because each digit is added to either S1 or S2. But the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are taken. For example, if a digit is taken earlier, it contributes more to the number. Like, if you take a digit first, it's the most significant digit in your number.\n\nSo, the problem isn't simply about maximizing the sum of digits, but the sum of the numeric values of S1 and S2. Which is the same as the sum of all digits multiplied by their position in the respective numbers. For example, the first digit taken by Homer is the 10^{n-1} place in his number, the second is 10^{n-2}, etc. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut how can we model this? Since each choice affects the positions of digits in both players' numbers. The key is to find the sequence of H and M moves that maximizes the sum of S1 + S2.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming. Let's think about the state. At any point, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. Also, the number of moves Homer has made so far and Marge has made so far. Let me think: since each player must make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of moves Homer has made, m is the number of moves Marge has made. Since the total moves is h + m = k, and the remaining digits are 2n - k. Also, the initial state is (0, 0), and the final state is (n, n).\n\nBut how do we decide whether to take H or M next? For each state (h, m), we can consider the next move. If h < n, Homer can take the next digit, otherwise it's Marge's turn. Wait no, because the choice of who takes the next digit is determined by the sequence. So for each state (h, m), the next move can be H if h < n, or M if m < n. However, the choice of which to take depends on which option leads to the maximum total sum.\n\nBut how do we calculate the value of choosing H or M at a certain step?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a certain number of digits left in A, and the current state (h, m). The current A is some string. But since the digits are taken from the left, the order of the digits is fixed. So, the current A is determined by the number of digits already taken. For example, if the original A is 'abcd', and two digits have been taken, then the current A is the remaining two digits. Therefore, the state can be represented by the current position in the original string, and the counts h and m.\n\nBut since the original A is fixed, the current position can be calculated as (h + m) digits taken. So, the current digit to take is the (h + m)-th digit (starting from 0?), or maybe (h + m)th index. For example, if h + m = 0, the first digit is A[0]. Then, after taking that digit, the next is A[1], etc. So, for a given state (h, m), the next digit is the (h + m)-th digit of A. So, the state is (h, m), and the next digit is known.\n\nNow",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (the sum of their respective numbers) is maximized. The key challenge is to decide at each step whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit from the given number A, ensuring both players make exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use a recursive approach with memoization to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently. The state of our recursion will be defined by the number of moves each player has made so far (h for Homer and m for Marge).\n2. **Greedy Choice with Backtracking**: At each step, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and choose the one that leads to the maximum total prize. This decision is based on evaluating the future outcomes recursively.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, we cache results of subproblems using memoization.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        # Determine possible next moves\n        choices = []\n        if h < n:\n            # Homer takes the next digit\n            new_h = h + 1\n            new_m = m\n            # Calculate the value contributed by this digit in Homer's number\n            # The position in Homer's number is (n - new_h) digits from the end\n            # So the place value is 10^(n - new_h)\n            place_value = 10 ** (n - new_h)\n            value = current_digit * place_value\n            next_val, next_seq = dp(new_h, new_m)\n            total_value = value + next_val\n            choices.append((total_value, 'H' + next_seq))\n        if m < n:\n            # Marge takes the next digit\n            new_h = h\n            new_m = m + 1\n            # Calculate the value contributed by this digit in Marge's number\n            place_value = 10 ** (n - new_m)\n            value = current_digit * place_value\n            next_val, next_seq = dp(new_h, new_m)\n            total_value = value + next_val\n            choices.append((total_value, 'M' + next_seq))\n        # Choose the option with maximum total value\n        # If multiple options have same value, pick the lex smallest or any (as per problem statement)\n        max_val = max(choices, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        return max_val\n\n    result = dp(0, 0)[1]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming State**: The function `dp(h, m)` returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding sequence of moves starting from the state where Homer has made `h` moves and Marge has made `m` moves.\n- **Recursive Decision Making**: For each state, we evaluate both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively determine the optimal sequence for the resulting states.\n- **Memoization**: The `@functools.lru_cache` decorator is used to store results of previously computed states, significantly reducing the number of redundant calculations and improving efficiency.\n- **Place Value Calculation**: Each digit's contribution to the total prize is calculated based on its position in either Homer's or Marge's number, considering the place value (powers of 10).\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently and select the one that maximizes the total prize, adhering to the constraints of the problem.",
