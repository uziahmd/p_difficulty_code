Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of such cards.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to achieve this. Let's consider the maximum possible sum per card. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, we need to find some number of cards whose total is T. The minimal number would be the ceiling of T divided by x. Because each card can contribute up to x. Similarly, if T is negative, then we can take the absolute value and divide by x, but since each card can contribute up to -x, the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). Wait, but maybe there's some cases where it's possible with fewer cards?\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. For example, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. But since each card can be up to 2, yes. So the minimal number is ceil(T / x). But wait, if T is 3 and x is 2, then 3/2 is 1.5 → ceil is 2. Which would be 2 + 1, but that's two cards. But 2+1 is allowed. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if T is 0? Then no cards needed. But that's already handled.\n\nSo the general approach would be:\n\nCompute T = -sum(found_cards).\n\nIf T is zero, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCalculate the minimal number of cards required to reach T, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe minimal number of cards is determined by the maximum possible contribution per card. For example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly, if T is negative, then each card can contribute up to -x. So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). Because for example, if T is -5, and x is 2, then each card can contribute -2. So you need 3 cards (since 5/2 is 2.5 → ceil to 3). But wait, in this case, the sum would be -2 * 3 = -6, which is less than -5. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, the target T is -5. So the sum of the new cards must be -5. So for example, if T is -5, then we need to find cards that add up to -5. Each card can be as low as -x. So the maximum absolute value per card is x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but perhaps there's a way to adjust.\n\nWait, let's take T = -5 and x = 2. So the sum of new cards must be -5. How can we get that with minimal cards?\n\nEach card can contribute up to -2. So if we take two cards: -2 and -2. Their sum is -4. That's not enough. So we need three cards. For example, -2, -2, -1. Sum is -5. So that's three cards. Which is ceil(5/2) = 3. So yes, that works. So in general, for any T, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero.\n\nWait, but what if T is 3 and x is 2. Then |T| is 3, x is 2. Ceil(3/2) is 2. So two cards. For example, 2 + 1. Which is allowed. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if T is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is exactly 2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to be: the minimal number of cards is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because the total sum of all cards (found and new) must be zero.\n3. **Handle Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For non-zero targets, determine the minimum number of cards required by considering the maximum absolute value each card can contribute (which is x). The minimum number of cards is derived by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by x and taking the ceiling of the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(nums)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        # Calculate minimal number of cards\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. Each line is processed to extract the number of cards, the maximum absolute value on a card, and the list of found card values.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found card values is computed. The target sum for the new cards is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Zero Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, it means the sum of found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For non-zero targets, the minimum number of cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum possible value per card (x), using the ceiling of the division result to ensure we account for any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging mathematical properties of division and ceiling functions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
