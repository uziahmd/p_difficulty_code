The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all tasks before it), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4→1 (another), then 1→2 (another). Total of 3 steps. So total time now is 2+3=5.\n- Third task is at 3 again. She's at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each task, we need to calculate the time it takes to get from the previous position to the current task's house, moving clockwise. And accumulate all those times.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two points. Suppose current position is pos_prev, and next task is at pos_curr. How many steps does it take to move clockwise from pos_prev to pos_curr?\n\nWell, if pos_prev is less than pos_curr, then the steps are pos_curr - pos_prev. But if pos_prev is greater than pos_curr, then it's (n - pos_prev) + pos_curr. For example, if pos_prev is 3 and pos_curr is 2, with n=4: 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps. Which is (4-3) + 2 = 1+2=3.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate this is (pos_curr - pos_prev) mod n? No, because mod can give negative numbers. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, when moving clockwise, the distance between a and b is (b - a) if a < b, else (n - a + b). So the formula can be written as (b - a) if b >= a else (n - a + b). Alternatively, (b - a + n) % n. Because if b >=a, then (b-a) mod n is same as b -a. If b <a, then (b -a +n) mod n is (n -a +b). So yes, the distance is (current_pos - previous_pos) mod n? Wait no, wait. Wait the distance is (current_pos - previous_pos) if moving clockwise? Or is it (previous_pos - current_pos) mod n?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose previous position is 3, current is 2. The clockwise distance is 3 steps. Let's compute (current - previous) mod n. (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance is (current - previous) mod n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values for negative numbers, but in Python, (-1) %4 is 3. So if I compute (current - previous) %n, that gives the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, but for example, if previous is 1 and current is 3, then (3-1) mod4 is 2, which is correct. If previous is 3 and current is 2, (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4=3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between previous and current is (current - previous) mod n. But since in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results when the denominator is positive, so this formula works.\n\nSo, for each task, we can compute the distance from the previous position to the current task",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks in a clockwise direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. The movement between houses is clockwise, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The time to move from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. For two positions `prev` and `curr`, the distance is `(curr - prev) % n` if `curr >= prev`, otherwise `(n - prev + curr)`. This can be simplified using the formula `(curr - prev) % n` which handles both cases correctly due to Python's modulo operation.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the next task's position, and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current_pos = 1  # Starting at house 1\n    \n    for ai in a:\n        # Calculate the distance from current_pos to ai clockwise\n        distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n        total_time += distance\n        current_pos = ai\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single block and split into individual components for processing.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this distance into the total time.\n- **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the task's house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the total time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
