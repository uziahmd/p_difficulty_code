The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). But wait, how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nWait, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So moving from house x to house y clockwise takes (y - x) mod n steps if y >=x? Or maybe (y - x + n) % n? Wait, no. For example, if x is 3 and y is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - x + y) steps. Because moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would go through 4, 1, 2. So for n=4, that's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4 = 3 mod4 = 3.\n\nSo the general formula for moving from current position to next position is (next_pos - current_pos) if next_pos >= current_pos, else (next_pos - current_pos + n). But that's equivalent to (next_pos - current_pos) % n. Wait, no. Because if next_pos is less than current_pos, then (next_pos - current_pos) is negative. For example, if current is 3 and next is 2, then (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. Which is correct. So the time between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current + n) % n. Because (next - current) could be negative, but adding n and mod n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nBut since the movement is always clockwise, the time between current position and next position is (next - current) mod n. But wait, let's check:\n\nIf current is 1, next is 3. Then (3-1) = 2 steps. Correct. If current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) = -1 mod 4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is (next - current) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results for negative numbers, perhaps we need to adjust. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, (2-3) is -1. In Python, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (next - current) % n would give the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, when next is equal to current, the time is zero. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo the problem is to process the list of tasks, and compute the total time taken to move between them, considering that each task must be done in order, and that Xenia starts at position 1.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. So the time from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Or (a_1 - 1) if a_1 >=1, else ... Well, since a_1 is between 1 and n, so (a_1 -1) is correct. But for example, if a_1 is 1, then the time is zero.\n\nBut the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if the tasks are [1,1,1], then the time between them is zero. So the total time would be the time from 1 to 1 (zero) plus the time from 1 to 1 (zero) etc. So the total time is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n    compute the time to move from current_position",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a circular ringroad, considering she starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a specific order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia moves clockwise around a ringroad with `n` houses. Moving from house `x` to house `y` takes `(y - x) % n` units of time if `y >= x`, otherwise it wraps around the circle, which is handled by the modulo operation.\n2. **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n3. **Task Order**: Each task must be completed in the given order. For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the task's house and accumulate this time.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating through each task and updating the current position after each move, we can efficiently compute the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for next_house in a:\n        diff = (next_house - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = next_house\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the time needed to move from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After each move, update the current position to the task's house.\n- **Output Total Time**: The accumulated total time is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that each move is calculated optimally, considering the circular structure of the ringroad, and efficiently processes all tasks in linear time relative to the number of tasks.",
