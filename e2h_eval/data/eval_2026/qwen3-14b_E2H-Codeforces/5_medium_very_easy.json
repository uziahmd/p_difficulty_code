Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. The task is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors have to be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks, which are compatible with anything.\n\nHmm. So the main idea is to pair as many as possible. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the compatibility rules. Two colors are compatible if either both are specific and same, or one is a question mark. So for example, a left boot with 'a' can pair with a right boot with 'a' or '?'. Similarly, a '?' can pair with any.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about how to model this. It feels like a bipartite graph matching problem, but with n up to 150,000. That's way too big for standard algorithms like Hungarian, which are O(n^3) or something. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a greedy way to do this. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that each left boot can be paired with a right boot. But since each boot can be used once, we need to assign them optimally.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, process all the pairs where both are specific and match. Like, for example, if a left boot is 'a', and a right boot is 'a', then they can be paired. Then, for the remaining ones, use the question marks to fill in.\n\nBut how to manage that efficiently?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. Count the number of specific colors on left and right. For each color, track how many left and right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the number of pairs possible is the minimum of left and right counts. But that's only for specific colors. However, the question marks can be used to pair with any.\n\nBut wait, the question marks can be used in two ways: either paired with specific colors (if they are not used for other question marks), or paired with other question marks.\n\nBut how to prioritize?\n\nMaybe first pair the specific colors. Then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors, and then pair the remaining question marks among themselves.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think in terms of data structures.\n\nFirst, create two dictionaries:\n\n- left_count: counts for each color (excluding ?) how many left boots are there.\n- right_count: same for right boots.\n\nFor each color c (not ?), the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But when you pair those, you can subtract those counts from the left and right counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including those with ?) can be handled by pairing with ?s.\n\nBut wait, the ? can be used to pair with any other boot. So perhaps the best way is:\n\nFirst, pair all specific colors (non ?) between left and right. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots (including those with ?). Then, pair the remaining left ? with the remaining right non-? boots (if any), and then pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- For each left boot, we can try to pair it with a right boot that is compatible. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first pair all the left boots with specific colors with the right boots with specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those that are not matched yet), we can use the ? to pair with any.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair all specific colors between left and right.\n\nFor example, for each color c in 'a' to 'z', take the number of left boots with color c, and the number of right boots with color c. The minimum of these two is the number of pairs we can make here. We can subtract these from both counts.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already paired? Because the problem requires us to output the actual indices.\n\nAh, but the problem says that the output needs to list the pairs. So we need to track which boots are used.\n\nSo perhaps, we need to process the left and right boots, and for each color, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut for that, maybe we can use queues or lists for each color. For example, for each color c (excluding ?), we can have a list of left boots with color c, and a list of right boots with color c. Then, for each such color, we can pair them one by one, taking the first elements from each list and adding them as a pair.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet) will be either ? or some color that didn't have a match.\n\nThen, for the remaining boots, we can pair the ?s with any available boots. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's collect all the remaining left boots (those not paired yet) and the remaining right boots.\n\nFor the left boots, we can have:\n\n- Some that are ?, and others that are specific colors (but couldn't be paired because the other side didn't have enough).\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nNow, the ? can be used to pair with any of the other boots. So, for example, if there's a left ? and a right 'a', they can be paired. Also, a left 'a' and a right ? can be paired. Also, two ? can be paired.\n\nSo the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots, using the ?s.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAn approach would be:\n\n- First, pair all left ? with right non-? boots. Because this uses up the right non-? boots, which can't be paired otherwise (since they can't be paired with other non-? boots if they don't match). Wait, no. The right non-? boots that are not matched yet may have their color not present in the left boots. So pairing them with left ? is better than pairing them with other ?s.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nMaybe:\n\n1. For the remaining left boots, collect all the left boots that are not paired yet. Similarly for the right.\n\n2. For each left boot that is not ?, check if there's a right boot (not paired yet) with the same color. If yes, pair them. But since we already did that in step 1, perhaps this is not needed. Wait, no. Because in step 1, we processed the specific colors. But maybe there are some left and right boots with specific colors that weren't matched because they were not in the same color. For example, if there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then after pairing the min, the remaining left 'a's would not be paired. But those can be paired with right ?s.\n\nSo perhaps the initial step is not sufficient. Maybe the approach should be:\n\nFirst, for all left and right boots, we need to pair as follows:\n\nFor each left boot, if it's a specific color, try to pair it with a right boot of the same color. For each right boot, if it's a specific color, try to pair it with a left boot of the same color. But how to manage this without overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach:\n\nWe can think of the problem as follows. Each left boot can be matched to a right boot if their colors are compatible. We need to find a maximum matching.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1.5e5), we need an efficient way.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if their colors are compatible. Then, finding maximum bipartite matching. But for n=1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be O(E√V), which might be feasible if E is manageable. However, for n=1.5e5, even O(n) is acceptable, but Hopcroft-Karp would be O(n^1.5) which might be too slow. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternative approach: Greedy algorithm.\n\nLet me think again. The key is that the question marks can be used as wildcards. So the optimal strategy is to pair as many specific colors as possible, then use the ?s to pair with the remaining.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Create for each color (excluding ?) a list of left boots with that color and a list of right boots with that color.\n\n2. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take the min of the number of left and right boots, and pair them. For each pair, add to the result. Then, remove these from the left and right lists (so that they are not considered again).\n\n3. Now, collect all remaining left boots (those not paired yet) and all remaining right boots (same).\n\n4. For the remaining left and right boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n   a. For each left boot with a specific color, pair it with a right boot that is a ?. Or vice versa.\n\n   b. Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about step 4. Let's collect all the remaining left boots and right boots. Let's say:\n\nleft_remain = list of left boots not yet paired.\n\nright_remain = list of right boots not yet paired.\n\nNow, for these, we can:\n\n- For each left boot in left_remain, if it is a ?, we can pair it with any right boot in right_remain (as long as it hasn't been paired yet). Similarly for right boots with ?.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAn efficient way is:\n\n- First, pair all left ? with right non-? boots. Because pairing a ? with a non-? is better than pairing two ?s, as it uses up the non-? boots which can't be used otherwise.\n\nWait, but if a right boot is non-?, then it can only be paired with a left boot that is same color or a ?. So if there are any left ?s, we can pair them with the right non-? boots.\n\nSimilarly, for right ?s, pair them with left non-? boots.\n\nSo here's a way:\n\n- Collect all left ?s and right non-?s. Pair them as much as possible.\n\n- Then collect all right ?s and left non-?s. Pair them as much as possible.\n\n- Finally, pair the remaining ?s (both left and right) with each other.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ncount_left_q = number of left ?s remaining after step 1.\n\ncount_right_q = number of right ?s remaining after step 1.\n\ncount_left_nonq = number of left non-?s remaining after step 1.\n\ncount_right_nonq = number of right non-?s remaining after step 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to process the remaining left and right boots as lists.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect all left boots not yet paired into left_unpaired.\n\nCollect all right boots not yet paired into right_unpaired.\n\nNow, process left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nWe can iterate through left_unpaired and right_unpaired, and pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left boot in left_unpaired:\n\n   if it is a ?, then find a right boot in right_unpaired that is not a ? (i.e., a specific color). If found, pair them, and remove from both lists.\n\nOnce all such pairings are done, then for the remaining left_unpaired and right_unpaired:\n\n   For each right boot in right_unpaired:\n\n       if it is a ?, find a left boot in left_unpaired that is not a ?. Pair them.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots are both ?s. Pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nBut for the problem, we need to output the actual indices, so we can't just count. We need to track which boots are available.\n\nSo perhaps, during the first step, we can collect for each color (non-?) the list of left and right boots, then pair them. Then, for the remaining, collect all left boots into a list, and all right boots into another list.\n\nThen, for the remaining, we can:\n\n- For each left boot in left_remain:\n\n   if it's a ?, then look for any right boot in right_remain that is not a ?. Once found, pair them and remove from both lists.\n\nSimilarly, for each right boot in right_remain that is a ?, look for any left boot in left_remain that is not a ?.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nBut since we need to pair as much as possible, perhaps the order doesn't matter. For example, we can:\n\nCollect all left ?s and right non-?s. Pair them. Then collect all right ?s and left non-?s. Pair them. Then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_remain = list of left boots not yet paired.\n\nright_remain = list of right boots not yet paired.\n\nNow, create two lists:\n\nleft_q = [boot for boot in left_remain if boot.color == '?']\nleft_nonq = [boot for boot in left_remain if boot.color != '?']\n\nright_q = [boot for boot in right_remain if boot.color == '?']\nright_nonq = [boot for boot in right_remain if boot.color != '?']\n\nNow, pair left_q with right_nonq as much as possible. The number of possible pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq)). For each pair, take one from left_q and one from right_nonq, and add to the result.\n\nThen, pair right_q with left_nonq as much as possible. Again, min(len(right_q), len(left_nonq)).\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q. The number of pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut how to track the indices and the actual boots?\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the way to handle this is:\n\nWe can have for each left and right boot, track whether they are already used. So, for example, during step 1, we pair them and mark them as used. Then, for the remaining steps, we can collect the unused ones.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can represent each left boot as a list of (index, color), and same for the right.\n\nBut for the code, let's think of the steps in code:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize arrays to track which left and right boots are used.\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nThen, for the first step, process specific colors:\n\nCreate a dictionary for left colors (excluding ?) and for right colors (excluding ?).\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map:\n\n    if c is in right_color_map:\n\n        # number of pairs is min(len(left_color_map[c]), len(right_color_map[c]))\n\n        # pair them\n\n        for i in range(min(len(left_color_map[c]), len(right_color_map[c]))):\n\n            left_idx = left_color_map[c][i]\n\n            right_idx = right_color_map[c][i]\n\n            # add to the answer\n\n            # mark as used\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            # record the pair\n\nBut wait, this would pair the first elements of each list. However, this may not be the best way, but since we need any maximum pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the order in which we process the colors matters. For example, processing colors in order from 'a' to 'z' or any order. But since the problem allows any valid pairing, the order is not important.\n\nOnce this is done, the remaining left and right boots are those not marked as used.\n\nThen, for the second step, collect all the remaining left boots (not used) and right boots (not used).\n\nNow, for the remaining left and right boots, we need to pair them as per the rules.\n\nLet me think of creating two lists:\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nNow, for these remaining boots, we can process as follows:\n\nWe can create two separate lists for left and right, based on their color.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in remaining_left if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in remaining_left if l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in remaining_right if r[i] == '?']\n\nright_nonq = [i for i in remaining_right if r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair left_q with right_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq))):\n\n    pair left_q[i] with right_nonq[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, pair right_q with left_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_q), len(left_nonq))):\n\n    pair right_q[i] with left_nonq[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n    pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nBut in code, we need to track the indices. Let's think:\n\nOnce we have the remaining_left and remaining_right, we can process them as follows.\n\nBut the code would need to collect all the left and right boots that are not used, and then process them.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q and left_nonq?\n\nIn code:\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen:\n\nleft_q = []\nleft_nonq = []\nfor idx in remaining_left:\n    if l[idx] == '?':\n        left_q.append(idx)\n    else:\n        left_nonq.append(idx)\n\nright_q = []\nright_nonq = []\nfor idx in remaining_right:\n    if r[idx] == '?':\n        right_q.append(idx)\n    else:\n        right_nonq.append(idx)\n\nThen, pair left_q with right_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq))):\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n    right_idx = right_nonq[i]\n    # mark as used\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    # add to the answer\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_q with left_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_q), len(left_nonq))):\n    left_idx = left_nonq[i]\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    # add to answer\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    # add to answer\n\nBut wait, after the first two steps, the left_q and right_q may have some elements left. For example, after pairing left_q with right_nonq, the remaining left_q are those that couldn't be paired because there were not enough right_nonq. Similarly for the other steps.\n\nBut the code above for the first two steps would pair as much as possible.\n\nBut in code, when you process the left_q and right_nonq, you need to take elements from left_q and right_nonq. However, the code as written would take the first elements of each list. But since the order is arbitrary, this is acceptable.\n\nBut how to track which elements are left after each step?\n\nWait, in the code above, the left_q and right_nonq are lists of indices. After pairing them, we need to mark those indices as used. However, the code above is just looping through the indexes and marking them. But the code for the first step (pairing left_q with right_nonq) is:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq))):\n\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n    right_idx = right_nonq[i]\n\n    mark them as used.\n\nBut after that, the left_q and right_nonq lists are not modified. So, in the next steps, the code may process the same indices again. But no, because in the next steps, the code checks for the used flags. Wait, no. Because the code for the second step is:\n\npairing right_q with left_nonq. But the left_nonq is from the original remaining_left. However, after the first step, some of the left_nonq may have been used. But no. Because the left_nonq is the list of indices in remaining_left that are not ?, and the first step pairs left_q (which are ?) with right_nonq. So the left_nonq is not modified here. So the code would process the same left_nonq elements again. Which is wrong.\n\nAh! There's a problem here. Because after pairing left_q with right_nonq, the left_q and right_nonq elements are marked as used. But the code for the second step (pairing right_q with left_nonq) is using the same left_nonq list, which includes indices that may have been used in the first step. No, because the left_nonq list is built from remaining_left, which are the indices not used before. But after the first step, some of the left_q and right_nonq are marked as used. However, the left_nonq list is not modified, and the code for the second step (pairing right_q with left_nonq) would process the same left_nonq indices again. But those indices are not marked as used yet. So this is a mistake.\n\nAh, right! Because the code for the first step (pairing left_q and right_nonq) marks those indices as used, but the code for the second step (pairing right_q and left_nonq) is using the same left_nonq list, which contains indices that may have been used in the first step.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_nonq list is built from the remaining_left, which are the indices not used before. But during the first step, the code pairs left_q (from remaining_left) with right_nonq (from remaining_right). So after that, those indices are marked as used. But the left_nonq list is not modified. So, when the code proceeds to the second step (pairing right_q with left_nonq), the left_nonq list contains indices that may have been used in the first step. But since the code is using the same left_nonq list, which was created before any of the pairing steps, those indices are still in the list, but may have been marked as used.\n\nThis is a problem. Because when we process the second step, the code would try to pair right_q with left_nonq indices that may have already been used.\n\nThus, the approach is flawed.\n\nHow to fix this?\n\nThe problem is that after pairing some elements in the first step, the left_nonq and right_nonq lists are not updated. Therefore, when processing the second step, those elements may have been already used.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should process the remaining_left and remaining_right in a way that allows for dynamic updates.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of creating separate lists, process the remaining_left and remaining_right as queues, and for each step, take elements that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: for the second step, collect all the left boots (not used) and right boots (not used) again. But that's not efficient. However, given that the code is O(n), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but the code is already O(n) time. Because the steps are:\n\n- Step 1: O(n) time.\n\n- Then, for the second step, collect the remaining_left and remaining_right again, and process them.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to re-collect the remaining_left and remaining_right after each pairing step.\n\nBut that seems computationally expensive, but for n up to 1.5e5, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the pairing steps, we can process the lists by checking if they are used.\n\nBut that would complicate the code.\n\nAlternative approach: for the second step, collect all the left boots that are not used and have color not ?, and same for right.\n\nBut perhaps during the second step, we can collect the current remaining left and right boots again.\n\nSo, after step 1, the code proceeds as:\n\nCollect all left boots not used (remaining_left), and same for right.\n\nThen, for the second step, collect left_q and left_nonq again, but only considering the ones not used yet.\n\nWait, but how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can process the remaining_left and remaining_right in the following way:\n\nAfter step 1, for the remaining_left and remaining_right, we can:\n\n- For each left boot in remaining_left, if it's a ?, and for each right boot in remaining_right, if it's not ?, pair them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, for the second step, we can:\n\n- Iterate through the remaining_left and for each left boot that is a ?, try to find a right boot that is not ? and not used yet. Once found, pair them.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with two pointers or queues.\n\nAnother idea: for the second step, collect all the left ?s and right non-?s. For each left ?, pair with the first available right non-?.\n\nSimilarly for the third step.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nWe have used_left and used_right arrays.\n\nNow, create two queues:\n\nleft_q_queue = deque()\n\nright_nonq_queue = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n\n        left_q_queue.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_nonq_queue.append(i)\n\nThen, pair as many as possible:\n\nwhile left_q_queue and right_nonq_queue:\n\n    left_idx = left_q_queue.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_nonq_queue.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    add to answer.\n\nSimilarly, then:\n\ncreate left_nonq_queue and right_q_queue:\n\nleft_nonq_queue = deque()\n\nright_q_queue = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_nonq_queue.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n\n        right_q_queue.append(i)\n\nthen pair them:\n\nwhile left_nonq_queue and right_q_queue:\n\n    left_idx = left_nonq_queue.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q_queue.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    add to answer.\n\nFinally, collect the remaining left ?s and right ?s:\n\nleft_q_queue = deque()\n\nright_q_queue = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n\n        left_q_queue.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n\n        right_q_queue.append(i)\n\nthen pair as many as possible:\n\nwhile left_q_queue and right_q_queue:\n\n    left_idx = left_q_queue.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q_queue.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    add to answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that during each step, the queues contain only the available boots not yet used. This way, we avoid processing used boots again.\n\nThis seems correct. And this approach is O(n) time overall.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as False arrays.\n\nProcess step 1: pair specific colors.\n\nFor each color c (a-z), collect left and right indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_dict[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_color_dict[r[i]].append(i)\n\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n\n    if c in right_color_dict:\n\n        # pair as much as possible\n\n        left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n\n        right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n        cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(cnt):\n\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            add to the answer list.\n\nThen, process step 2: pair left ? with right non-?.\n\nAs explained with the queues.\n\nThen process step 3: pair right ? with left non-?.\n\nThen process step 4: pair ? with ?.\n\nSo, the code would have:\n\nanswer = []\n\nThen, during step 1, append the pairs (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) since the problem uses 1-based indices.\n\nThen, during steps 2-4, append the pairs similarly.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nBut for the first step, the code for pairing the specific colors:\n\nBut what about when a color is present in left and right, but in different counts. For example, left has 3 'a's, right has 2 'a's. Then we pair 2 of them.\n\nBut in the code, the way to do this is:\n\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n\n    if c in right_color_dict:\n\n        left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n\n        right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n        for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n            pair left_list[i] and right_list[i]\n\nBut the problem is that for the same color, the code may process it multiple times. For example, if the same color is processed in different loops. However, since we are iterating over the keys in left_color_dict, and for each color, we process it once, this is okay.\n\nBut how to collect the left_color_dict and right_color_dict?\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the order of processing colors? For example, if a color is processed and some of the left and right boots are paired, then in other steps, they are marked as used. So in the subsequent steps, they are not considered again.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing step 1.\n\nBut in Python, the defaultdict is used.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can loop through each character in the left and right strings, and build the left_color_dict and right_color_dict.\n\nOnce that is done, for each color in left_color_dict, check if it exists in right_color_dict, and pair them.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nans = []\n\n# Step 1: Pair specific colors\n\nleft_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color_dict[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_color_dict[r[i]].append(i)\n\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n\n    if c in right_color_dict:\n\n        left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n\n        right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n        cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(cnt):\n\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n            ans.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n# Step 2: Pair left ? with right non-?\n\n# Build queues for left ? and right non-?\n\nleft_q = deque()\n\nright_nonq = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n\n        left_q.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_nonq.append(i)\n\n# Pair them\n\nwhile left_q and right_nonq:\n\n    left_idx = left_q.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_nonq.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    ans.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n# Step 3: Pair right ? with left non-?\n\nleft_nonq = deque()\n\nright_q = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_nonq.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n\n        right_q.append(i)\n\nwhile left_nonq and right_q:\n\n    left_idx = left_nonq.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    ans.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n# Step 4: Pair left ? with right ?\n\nleft_q = deque()\n\nright_q = deque()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n\n        left_q.append(i)\n\n    if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n\n        right_q.append(i)\n\nwhile left_q and right_q:\n\n    left_idx = left_q.popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_q.popleft()\n\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    ans.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\nprint(len(ans))\n\nfor a, b in ans:\n\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same color is processed multiple times in step 1? For example, suppose color 'a' is processed in left_color_dict and right_color_dict. But what if there are multiple entries for the same color? Well, the code processes each color once, and pairs the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. Which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, the first input is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nThe first line is 10, then l is codeforces, r is dodivthree.\n\nBut the sample output for that case is 5 pairs.\n\nBut according to the code, let's think.\n\nFor the first case:\n\nn = 10\n\nl = 'codeforces' → characters are c o d e f o r c e s\n\nr = 'dodivthree' → d o d i v t h r e e\n\nProcessing step 1: pair specific colors.\n\nFor each color in left (excluding ?), which are all letters.\n\nFor example, for 'c' in left: positions 0, 7.\n\nIn right, 'd' occurs at 0, 2; 'o' occurs at 1; 'i' at 3; 'v' at 4; 't' at 5; 'h' at 6; 'r' at 7; 'e' at 8,9.\n\nSo for each color in left:\n\nFor example, 'c' in left: left has 0,7. Right has none (since r is dodivthree, which is d o d i v t h r e e. So no 'c's. So no pairing here.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nSo step 1 would pair nothing, because there are no matching colors between left and right.\n\nThen, step 2: pair left ? with right non-?.\n\nBut in this case, the left has no '?', since l is codeforces (no ?). So step 2 does nothing.\n\nStep 3: pair right ? with left non-?.\n\nBut r is dodivthree, which has no '?'. So step 3 does nothing.\n\nStep 4: pair ? with ?. None. So total is 0. But the sample output for this case is 5. Wait, but the sample input may be different. Oh wait, the first input in the example is:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nBut according to the sample output, the first output is 5. But according to the code, the answer would be zero. Which suggests that I have misunderstood the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input given in the problem statement is:\n\nThe example input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the outputs are:\n\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nSo the first input is:\n\nn=10, l=codeforces, r=dodivthree.\n\nBut according to the code, the answer is zero. But the sample output for the first case is 5. So clearly, there's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each boot can be a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, with each boot being used at most once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, we pair boots with specific colors that match exactly. For each color present in both left and right boots, we pair them as much as possible.\n2. **Pair Indefinite with Specific**: After pairing specific colors, we use the indefinite boots ('?') to pair with remaining specific colored boots.
