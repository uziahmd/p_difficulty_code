Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) must be the same, and a question mark can match any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. For each position, we have a left boot and a right boot. But we can't just pair them directly unless their colors are compatible. Also, since each boot can be in at most one pair, we need to find an optimal way to pair them.\n\nLet me think of a strategy. Maybe we can first pair the left boots with specific colors with the right boots that have matching colors. Then handle the question marks.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair all the left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same color. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a', find a right boot with 'a' and pair them. But since there could be multiple such pairs, we need to count how many of each color exist on both sides.\n\nWait, but since each boot can only be used once, we need to track which ones are already paired.\n\nSo maybe we can use frequency counts for each color. For example, for each color c (excluding ?), count the number of left boots with color c and the number of right boots with color c. The minimum of these two would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\nBut then, after handling all specific colors, we can handle the question marks. However, the question marks can be paired with any remaining boots (either specific or ?). But how?\n\nWait, but the question marks can be paired with any other boots. So, after pairing the specific colors, we can pair the remaining question marks. But here's the thing: the question marks on the left can be paired with any remaining right boots (including ?), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs? Let's think:\n\nSuppose after pairing all possible specific color pairs, we have some left ? and right ?. Let's say there are L ?s on the left and R ?s on the right. The maximum possible pairs here is min(L, R). Because each ? can pair with any other. So, adding that to the previous count gives the total.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are some left ? and some right specific colors that are not yet paired? For example, if there are some right boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired because there were no left 'a's. But then, the left ? can pair with those right 'a's.\n\nAh, right! So maybe the initial approach of pairing specific colors first isn't optimal. Because perhaps using some ? to pair with specific colors could allow more overall pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n- First, pair as many as possible between left and right specific colors. For each color c, take the minimum of the count of left c and right c, and add that to the total. Then, subtract those counts from the respective left and right counts.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which may include ?), pair the left ? with the right non-? (if possible), and then pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nWait, but how to manage that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is:\n\nWe can first pair the left boots with specific colors with the right boots that have the same color. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which may have ?), we can pair the left ? with the right non-? (but only if they are compatible). Wait, but the right non-? can be paired with left ?.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better idea:\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count. These will track the number of each color (excluding ?) on left and right.\n\n2. For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), the number of pairs that can be made between left and right is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Add this to the total. Then, subtract those from left_count and right_count.\n\n3. Now, we have some left and right ?s. Let's say the number of left ?s is L and right ?s is R. Then, the maximum number of pairs we can form here is min(L, R). So, add that to the total.\n\nBut wait, that's not considering that the left ?s can also pair with the right non-?s that were not matched earlier. Because perhaps, there are some right boots with color 'a' that weren't matched because there were no left 'a's. But then, the left ? can pair with those right 'a's.\n\nAh, right! So the initial approach is wrong. Because the first step only pairs same-color specific boots, but the left ?s could pair with any right boots (specific or ?), and the right ?s could pair with any left boots (specific or ?).\n\nSo, the initial approach is missing those possibilities.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFirst, process all the specific colors, but not in a way that uses up the specific colors. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nLet's consider that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. So, the problem is similar to bipartite matching. But given the size of n (up to 150,000), we can't do a standard bipartite matching algorithm like Hungarian, which is O(n^3) or something worse.\n\nThus, we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again. How can we maximize the pairs?\n\nThe key is to pair the specific colors first. But when there's a mismatch between left and right counts for a color, the excess can be paired with ?s.\n\nSo here's a better approach:\n\nFor each color c (not ?), we can pair as many left c with right c as possible. Let's say there are x left c and y right c. The number of pairs is min(x,y). Then, the remaining left c (x - min(x,y)) and right c (y - min(x,y)) can't be paired with same color. But they can be paired with ?s.\n\nThen, after handling all specific colors, we can pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right boots (specific or ?), and the remaining right ?s with the remaining left boots.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, here's a better way:\n\nWe can first pair all left and right boots with specific colors. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, the leftover left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired with same color) can be paired with ?s.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan:\n\n- For all left boots that are not ?, collect their color counts. Similarly for right boots.\n\n- For each color c, the number of pairs between left and right is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Let's say we pair those, and subtract them from the left and right counts. But after that, the left and right counts for each color c (not ?) would be zero, except for the cases where left_count[c] > right_count[c], or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose left has 3 'a's and right has 2 'a's. Then, we pair 2 pairs. Left now has 1 'a' left, right has 0 'a's. Those remaining left 'a's can't be paired with any right 'a's. But they can be paired with right ?s.\n\nSimilarly, the right 'a's that are not matched (if any) can be paired with left ?s.\n\nSo, after this step, we have for each color c:\n\nleft_remaining[c] = left_count[c] - pairs_made (for that color)\n\nright_remaining[c] = right_count[c] - pairs_made (for that color)\n\nBut then, the left_remaining and right_remaining are for the colors that are not ?.\n\nThen, we can collect all left_remaining (for non-? colors) and right_remaining (for non-? colors) and see how they can be paired with ?s.\n\nSo, for example, the left_remaining 'a's can be paired with right ?s. Similarly, the right_remaining 'a's can be paired with left ?s.\n\nBut how to count this.\n\nSo, after pairing same-color specific boots, the next step is:\n\n- For all left boots that are not ?, but could not be paired (i.e., left_remaining[c] > 0), they can be paired with right ?s.\n\nSimilarly, for all right boots that are not ?, but could not be paired (i.e., right_remaining[c] > 0), they can be paired with left ?s.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet's collect the number of left ?s and right ?s.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nleft_question = number of left boots with ?\n\nright_question = number of right boots with ?\n\nNow, after pairing the same-color specific boots, we have:\n\nFor each color c (not ?), the left_remaining[c] is the number of left boots with color c that couldn't be paired with a right boot of same color. Similarly for right_remaining[c].\n\nThese left_remaining[c] can be paired with right_question (since ? can match any color). Similarly, right_remaining[c] can be paired with left_question.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs here is min( sum(left_remaining[c] for all c), right_question ) + min( sum(right_remaining[c] for all c), left_question )\n\nBut wait, no. Because each left_remaining[c] can be paired with a right ?.\n\nSo, for example, if sum(left_remaining) is the total number of left non-? boots that couldn't be paired with same color, then each of them can be paired with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, sum(right_remaining) is the total number of right non-? boots that couldn't be paired with same color. Each of them can be paired with a left ?.\n\nBut we have to take care that the right_question and left_question are sufficient.\n\nSo, the number of pairs here is:\n\npairs_left_question = min( sum(left_remaining), right_question )\n\npairs_right_question = min( sum(right_remaining), left_question )\n\nBut wait, after that, the remaining left_question and right_question would be:\n\nleft_question_remaining = left_question - pairs_right_question\n\nright_question_remaining = right_question - pairs_left_question\n\nThen, the remaining question marks can be paired between left and right, which is min( left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining )\n\nSo total pairs is:\n\nsame_color_pairs + pairs_left_question + pairs_right_question + min( left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining )\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Because the left_remaining and right_remaining are the numbers of non-? boots that couldn't be paired with same color. So, for each of these, they can be paired with ?s on the opposite side.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of pairs that can be formed between non-? and ? is:\n\nsum_left_remaining = sum of left_remaining[c] for all c (non-?)\n\nsum_right_remaining = sum of right_remaining[c] for all c (non-?)\n\nThe number of pairs that can be formed between left_remaining and right_question is the minimum of sum_left_remaining and right_question.\n\nSimilarly, the number of pairs between right_remaining and left_question is the minimum of sum_right_remaining and left_question.\n\nBut once we take those pairs, the remaining ?s can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is correct. Let's try to model it.\n\nSo, same_color_pairs = sum for each color c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\nThen, after that:\n\nleft_remaining_non_question = sum over c (left_count[c] - same_color_pairs for c) ?\n\nWait, no. For each color c, the same_color_pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). So, after that, the left_remaining for c is left_count[c] - same_color_pairs, but only if left_count[c] > right_count[c]. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, no. For example, if left_count[c] is 3 and right_count[c] is 2, then same_color_pairs for c is 2. So, left_remaining is 1. If left_count[c] is 2 and right_count[c] is 3, same_color_pairs is 2, left_remaining is 0.\n\nSo, sum_left_remaining is sum over all c (left_count[c] - same_color_pairs_c) ?\n\nBut same_color_pairs_c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nBut left_count[c] - same_color_pairs_c is max( left_count[c] - right_count[c], 0 )\n\nSimilarly for sum_right_remaining.\n\nSo, sum_left_remaining = sum( max( left_count[c] - right_count[c], 0 ) for all c )\n\nsum_right_remaining = sum( max( right_count[c] - left_count[c], 0 ) for all c )\n\nSo, then, the number of pairs that can be formed between left_remaining and right_question is min( sum_left_remaining, right_question )\n\nSimilarly, pairs between right_remaining and left_question is min( sum_right_remaining, left_question )\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left_question and right_question would be:\n\nleft_question_remaining = left_question - pairs_right_question\n\nright_question_remaining = right_question - pairs_left_question\n\nThen, the remaining pairs is min( left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining )\n\nSo total pairs is same_color_pairs + pairs_left_question + pairs_right_question + remaining_pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut how to track which boots are actually being paired. Because the problem requires us to output the actual pairs.\n\nSo, the above approach gives the maximum number of pairs, but how to find the actual pairs.\n\nThis seems complicated. So perhaps the first step is to find the maximum number of pairs, and then find a way to generate the pairs.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each color c (non-?), pair as many left and right as possible.\n\n   For example, for each c, we can pair the left and right boots of that color.\n\n   But how to track which ones are paired.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid pairing, perhaps we can proceed greedily.\n\nBut for the actual pairing, perhaps we need to process the boots in some order, and pair them.\n\nBut given that n is up to 150,000, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nLet me think of the steps again.\n\nFirst, process the same-color pairs.\n\nFor each color c (non-?), collect all left boots with color c, and all right boots with color c.\n\nPair them up. For example, take the first m boots, where m is min(len(left_c), len(right_c)).\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can use arrays to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut for large n, we need efficient data structures.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can create a list of indices for left boots and right boots. Then, for each color, pair the first k elements, where k is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\nOnce paired, mark those indices as used.\n\nThen, after that, process the ?s.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the ?s, the remaining left ?s can be paired with any right boots that are not yet paired, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to find those.\n\nSo, perhaps after pairing the same-color pairs, we can collect the left ?s and right ?s, and then pair them with any available right or left boots.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nWe can process the same-color pairs first, then for the left ?s, pair them with right boots that are not yet paired and have any color (including ?). Similarly for the right ?s.\n\nBut again, how to track which boots are available.\n\nBut perhaps the following steps:\n\n- Create two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False. These track whether a boot is already used in a pair.\n\n- For each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   - collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   - collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   - pair them up, up to the minimum of the two lists.\n\n   - mark those indices as used.\n\n- Then, for the left ?s and right ?s, collect the unused ones.\n\n   - For each left ? not used, try to pair with any right not used (could be any color, including ?). Similarly for right ?s.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut for the second part, we can collect all the unused left ?s and unused right ?s, and pair them in any way.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nBut since the ? can be paired with any, the maximum number is the minimum of the number of left ?s and right ?s.\n\nBut then, there may be some left ?s and right non-?s that are not paired yet.\n\nWait, but after the first step, all the non-? boots that could be paired with same color are already paired. So, the remaining non-? boots (on left or right) can't be paired with same color. But they can be paired with ?s.\n\nSo, for example, if there is a left boot with color 'a' that was not paired (because there were no right 'a's), then it can be paired with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, a right boot with color 'b' that wasn't paired can be paired with a left ?.\n\nSo, after the first step, we can collect all the left non-? boots that are not used, and pair them with right ?s (if any are left). Similarly for the right non-? boots.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nSo, for the second phase:\n\nCollect all left non-? boots that are not used. Let's call them left_available.\n\nCollect all right non-? boots that are not used. Call them right_available.\n\nThen, for each left_available, we can pair them with a right ? that is not used.\n\nSimilarly, for each right_available, pair with a left ? not used.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nBut perhaps, after the first phase, we can collect the left_available and right_available.\n\nThen, for each left_available (color c), we can pair with any right ? that hasn't been used yet. So, for each left_available, if there are any right ?s left, pair them.\n\nSimilarly for right_available.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining ?s (on left and right) can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, here's a possible code outline:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as False arrays.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   collect right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))\n\n   for i in 0 to num_pairs-1:\n\n       pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_indices[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_indices[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect all left ?s not used: left_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\ncollect all right ?s not used: right_q = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]]\n\nNow, collect all left non-? not used: left_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_nonq.\n\nNow, for each left_nonq, we can pair with any right_q that's not used yet. So, take the first len(left_nonq) elements from right_q, and pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for each right_nonq, pair with any left_q not used.\n\nOnce that's done, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nAfter the first phase, we can:\n\n1. Pair left_nonq with right_q:\n\n   for each index in left_nonq:\n\n       if there are any right_q left, take one and pair them.\n\n       mark both as used.\n\n   Similarly for right_nonq with left_q.\n\nBut how to track which ones are left.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ncurrent_right_q = list of right_q.\n\nfor i in left_nonq:\n\n   if current_right_q is not empty:\n\n       take the first element from current_right_q, pair with i.\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for right_nonq and left_q.\n\nThen, the remaining elements in current_right_q and current_left_q can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nBut perhaps, after that, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired in any way.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to collect left_nonq and right_nonq.\n\nBut perhaps, during the first phase, we can process all colors except '?', then collect the left and right non-? that are not used.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nBut for code, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, and per character processing, it's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that for each color, collecting all the indices may be time-consuming if done naively. For example, for each color, looping through the entire string.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, and 26 letters, that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps, we can pre-process the left and right indices for each color.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, we can have a list of indices.\n\nBut let's think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_used = [False]*n\n\nright_used = [False]*n\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] is the color and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] is the color and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to collect those indices.\n\nBut in practice, for each color, we can loop through the entire string once.\n\nBut that would be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5 (about 3.9e6 operations).\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to pre-process for each color, a list of indices.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c]\n\n   then, for each pair in left_list and right_list, up to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), pair them.\n\nBut this would not account for the used flags. So this approach would not work, since once a boot is used, it can't be used again.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the first phase, we need to process the colors, and for each color, collect the available left and right indices (not yet used), pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect those indices.\n\nAn alternative approach is to iterate through all the left and right boots, and for each, check if they are not used and their color is c.\n\nBut that would be O(n) per color, leading to O(n*26) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 1.5e5 * 26 = 3.9e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color, we can loop through all the left boots once, and collect the indices where the color is c and not used.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_candidates.append(i)\n    right_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_candidates.append(i)\n    # pair them\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n        right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n        # add to the result\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this would work, but for each color, it loops through the entire array. Which is O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, that's acceptable.\n\nOnce this is done, then process the ?s.\n\nSo, after that, collect the left ?s that are not used, and right ?s that are not used.\n\nThen, collect left_nonq (non-? not used) and right_nonq (non-? not used).\n\nThen, for each left_nonq, pair with right ?s (if any left).\n\nSimilarly for right_nonq.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to collect left_nonq and right_nonq.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_nonq = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?':\n        left_nonq.append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_nonq.\n\nThen, for each i in left_nonq:\n\n   if there are any right ?s not used, pair them.\n\nBut how to track the right ?s.\n\nSo, collect right_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nSimilarly for left_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nThen, for the left_nonq:\n\nfor i in left_nonq:\n\n   if there are any elements in right_q:\n\n       take the first element from right_q, pair with i.\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, for the right_nonq:\n\nfor i in right_nonq:\n\n   if there are any elements in left_q:\n\n       take the first element from left_q, pair with i.\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nFor example:\n\nremaining_left_q = [ ... ]\n\nremaining_right_q = [ ... ]\n\nthen, for i in range( min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) ):\n\n   pair them.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining ones.\n\nBut during the previous steps, the right_q and left_q are modified as we pair them.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\n# Pair left_nonq with right_q\nfor idx in left_nonq:\n    if right_q:\n        pair_idx = right_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (idx+1, pair_idx+1) )\n        right_used[pair_idx] = True\n\n# Pair right_nonq with left_q\nfor idx in right_nonq:\n    if left_q:\n        pair_idx = left_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (pair_idx+1, idx+1) )\n        left_used[pair_idx] = True\n\n# Now, pair the remaining left_q and right_q\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q), len(right_q) ) ):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\nBut wait, after pairing left_nonq with right_q, the remaining right_q are those not used. Then, pairing right_nonq with left_q, and then the remaining left_q and right_q are paired.\n\nBut this seems correct.\n\nBut what about the order in which we process left_nonq and right_nonq?\n\nFor example, if there are left_nonq and right_nonq, which one should be processed first?\n\nIn the code above, left_nonq is processed first. So, any left_nonq (non-? boots) are paired with right_q (the ?s). Then, the right_nonq are paired with left_q (the ?s). Then, the remaining ?s are paired between themselves.\n\nThis should maximize the number of pairs.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nProcess same-color pairs.\n\nProcess left_nonq with right_q.\n\nProcess right_nonq with left_q.\n\nProcess remaining ?s.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code needs to collect the left_nonq and right_nonq.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nIn code:\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nBut for large n, this is O(n) time.\n\nOnce this is done, the rest is as above.\n\nSo, putting all this together.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the actual pairs.\n\nBut for the code, this approach should work.\n\nNow, testing this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, but the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the original problem statement.\n\nThe sample input shows four different test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nOutput: 5 and some pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the user provided multiple examples, but the actual problem is to read a single input. However, the original problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains n, then the second line is l, third is r.\n\nSo, the sample input provided in the problem seems to be a list of test cases. However, the user probably intended that the code should handle a single test case. But the note says that the problem is very easy, so perhaps the code should read the input as per the problem's original description.\n\nBut the user's sample input seems to be a list of test cases, but perhaps that's a mistake. Anyway, the code should read the input according to the problem's description.\n\nNow, for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l.\n\nRead r.\n\nProcess as per the steps above.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nRead n.\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nThen, proceed as per the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut for large n, creating lists for each color may be time-consuming. But in Python, for n=1.5e5, even with O(n) steps, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_candidates.append(i)\n    right_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_candidates.append(i)\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n        right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect left_nonq and right_nonq.\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nCollect left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, process left_nonq with right_q:\n\nfor idx in left_nonq:\n    if right_q:\n        pair_idx = right_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (idx+1, pair_idx+1) )\n        right_used[pair_idx] = True\n\nThen, process right_nonq with left_q:\n\nfor idx in right_nonq:\n    if left_q:\n        pair_idx = left_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (pair_idx+1, idx+1) )\n        left_used[pair_idx] = True\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range( min( len(left_q), len(right_q) ) ):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\nWait, but after the previous steps, the left_q and right_q may have been modified. So, in the code above, after processing left_nonq and right_nonq, the left_q and right_q are the ones that are not used yet. So, pairing them in the same way.\n\nBut in the code above, after processing left_nonq, the right_q is modified. Then, processing right_nonq, the left_q is modified. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q are paired.\n\nBut this seems correct.\n\nBut for example, after pairing left_nonq with right_q, the right_q list is reduced. Then, when processing right_nonq, the left_q is checked.\n\nBut this approach may miss some possibilities. For example, if a right_nonq is paired with a left_q, but there may be more pairs if we pair left_nonq with left_q first, but I think the order is arbitrary here since the goal is to pair as much as possible.\n\nBut regardless, this approach should give a maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet me see what the code does.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let's proceed with writing the code.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 1.5e5, the code may be too slow. Because for each of the 26 letters, we are looping through the entire n-length string. For 26 * 1.5e5 = 3.9e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps it's better to pre-process the positions for each color. However, for the sake of time, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut also, note that the code must read the input correctly. For example, the input is given as three lines: first n, then l, then r.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False] * n\nright_used = [False] * n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_candidates.append(i)\n    right_candidates = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n            right_candidates.append(i)\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_candidates), len(right_candidates))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_candidates[i]\n        right_idx = right_candidates[i]\n        pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nfor idx in left_nonq:\n    if right_q:\n        pair_idx = right_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (idx + 1, pair_idx + 1) )\n        right_used[pair_idx] = True\n\nfor idx in right_nonq:\n    if left_q:\n        pair_idx = left_q.pop(0)\n        pairs.append( (pair_idx + 1, idx + 1) )\n        left_used[pair_idx] = True\n\n# Pair remaining ?s\nremaining = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(remaining):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i] + 1, right_q[i] + 1) )\n\nprint(len(pairs))\nfor a, b in pairs:\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but this code may have an error in the way left_q and right_q are handled. Because after the first two loops (processing left_nonq and right_nonq), the left_q and right_q may have been modified. But when we collect left_q and right_q, they are the lists of unused ?s. But during the processing of left_nonq, we modify the right_q (popping elements). Similarly, during processing of right_nonq, we modify left_q.\n\nBut in the code above, after collecting left_q and right_q, the code processes left_nonq with right_q, and then processes right_nonq with left_q. But in this case, the left_q and right_q are modified during the processing.\n\nBut the code is correct in that sense.\n\nBut let's think of an example where a left_nonq is paired with a right_q. Once that is done, the right_q list is reduced. Then, when processing right_nonq",

The compatibility rules are such that specific colors must match exactly, while a question mark ('?') can match any color, including another question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, we pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots of the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and matching available left and right boots of that color.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots that have question marks.
