They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find all integers x that can be the winning team given the tournament structure and the string s which dictates the rules for each phase. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. The tournament has 2^n teams, and each phase halves the number of teams. For each phase, depending on whether the character is 0 or 1, the matches are decided by lower or higher skill levels. \n\nThe key here is to figure out, for each possible x (from 1 to 2^n), whether there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. But since p is a permutation, each value from 1 to 2^n appears exactly once. However, the problem says that x is winning if such a permutation exists. \n\nBut how do we model the tournament? Let's think recursively. For each phase, the way teams are paired and who wins depends on the current phase's rule. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. The winners proceed to the next phase. Then in phase 2, they are paired again in the same way, but with the winners from previous rounds. \n\nBut the problem is that the permutation p determines the skill levels of the teams. However, the actual arrangement of the teams in the initial bracket matters. Wait, but the problem says that the permutation p is given, but we have to find for which x there exists some permutation where x wins. \n\nWait, but the tournament structure is fixed. The initial bracket is fixed: team 1 plays team 2, then 3 vs 4, etc. So the structure of the tournament is fixed, but the actual skill levels (the p array) can be arranged in any way. But the question is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x ends up being the champion. \n\nSo, the challenge is to model for each possible x, whether there's a way to arrange the skills in the bracket so that x can win according to the rules given by the string s. \n\nHmm. How can we model this? Let's think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each round, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winner proceeds. The rules for each round are determined by the string s. \n\nFor example, in the first phase (i=1), the rule is s[0] (assuming 0-based index). For the second phase (i=2), it's s[1], etc. \n\nSo, for each round, when two teams meet, the winner is determined based on their skill levels. For example, if the phase is 0, the lower skill level wins; if it's 1, the higher one. \n\nNow, the question is: for a given x, can we assign the skill levels (permutation p) such that x can win all the required matches in each round. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Let's think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to be the champion, it must win in each round. \n\nIn each round, x must be in a position where it can win against its opponent, considering the rule of that round. \n\nBut the opponents depend on the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first round, x is in a pair with another team. The winner of that pair proceeds to the next round. Then, in the next round, that winner is paired with another winner, and so on. \n\nBut since we can choose the permutation p (arrange the skill levels), perhaps we can model the possible ranges of values that x can have in each round. \n\nWait, here's an idea. For each round, we can determine what's the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have in order to be able to proceed through that round. \n\nLet me think about this. Let's imagine that during each round, the way x can proceed depends on the rule of that round. \n\nFor example, suppose in a certain round, the rule is 1 (higher skill wins). Then, in that round's match, x must have a higher skill than the opponent. But since we can arrange the permutation, maybe we can choose the opponents' skills to be lower than x. However, we also need to ensure that the opponents in previous rounds are arranged such that they can reach that round. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each round, the possible range of x's value. For example, in the first round (phase 1), if the rule is 1 (higher skill wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. But since we can arrange the opponents, maybe we can set the opponent's value to be lower than x. However, in the next round, the opponent would be someone else, and",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can potentially win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The rules dictate whether the team with the higher or lower skill level wins each match in a given phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and proceeds through $n$ phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains.\n2. **Skill Level Determination**: For each phase, the winner is determined by either the higher or lower skill level based on the input string `s`.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each team to be a potential champion, we need to ensure that it can win all matches in each phase. This involves calculating the minimum and maximum possible skill values that a team can have to proceed through each phase successfully.\n4. **Recursive Range Adjustment**: Starting from the last phase and moving backwards, adjust the ranges of possible values for the team based on the rules of each phase. This ensures that the team can always win its matches by having the appropriate skill level relative to its opponents.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    size = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    min_val = [1] * (n + 1)\n    max_val = [size] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # higher skill wins\n            min_val[i] = min_val[i+1] + 1\n            max_val[i] = max_val[i+1]\n        else:\n            # lower skill wins\n            min_val[i] = min_val[i+1]\n            max_val[i] = max_val[i+1] - 1\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        if min_val[0] <= x <= max_val[0]:\n            result.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` which dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament.\n2. **Initialization**: Arrays `min_val` and `max_val` are initialized to track the minimum and maximum skill values a team must have to proceed through each phase.\n3. **Backward Calculation**: Starting from the last phase and moving backwards, the ranges for each phase are adjusted based on the rule (higher or lower skill wins). This ensures that the ranges are valid for all previous phases.\n4. **Result Collection**: After determining the valid ranges for the initial phase, all integers within this range are collected as potential winning teams and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the possible winning teams by leveraging range adjustments based on the tournament rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
