            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which might be Roman numerals. So first, I need to parse the input correctly.\n\nLet me think about the steps. The input gives me a number c in base a. I need to convert it to base b. But if b is 'R', then I have to convert it to Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's a regular base conversion.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read a and b (could be 'R').\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b, or to Roman if b is 'R'.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. But wait, the input for c may have letters like A, B, etc., if a is larger than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits could go up to 'B' (for 11). So when parsing the input, I need to handle letters as digits beyond 9.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input c is in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input may have letters. However, the problem statement says that the input for c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, the note says that for Roman numerals, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. For other cases, it's up to 1e15.\n\nSo step 3: converting c from base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each character in the string c, I need to get its value. For example, if the character is 'A', it represents 10. So I can create a mapping for each digit. For example, for digits in base a, each digit is a character. So for a given digit, if it's a digit (0-9), then its value is int(digit). If it's a letter (like A, B, etc.), then its value is 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. So for example, base 12 would have digits 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the input c's digits can be letters, but the case? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string, but in the examples, for instance, the third input is '5 R\\n4' which outputs 'IV' (which is 4 in roman). But in the sample input, the fifth example is '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A' (since A in base 12 is 10 in decimal, converted to base 13 is A again).\n\nSo for the input c, the digits can be 0-9 and letters A-Z (uppercase?), but the problem says that the input is given as a string. So during parsing, we need to process each character of the input string as a digit in base a.\n\nSo for the conversion from base a to decimal:\n\nInitialize a variable value = 0.\n\nFor each char in c:\n\ndigit_value = int(char) if it's a digit, else 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\nThen, value = value * a + digit_value.\n\nBut wait, the input c may have letters in lowercase? Probably not, since the problem says that the input is given as per standard representations. For example, the sample input has 'A' in one of the cases. So I'll assume that the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9.\n\nSo the first step is to process the input string c into a decimal number.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then I need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is 'R'.\n\nNow, handling the case where b is 'R' requires converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo for that, I need a function that takes an integer and returns its Roman numeral representation.\n\nBut what about the constraints? The problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 and not zero. So the input for Roman conversion will be between 1 and 3000 inclusive.\n\nSo for the Roman conversion, I can use the standard approach. Let me think about how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of tuples, each containing a value and the corresponding Roman numeral. Then, subtract the largest possible value each time.\n\nFor example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (90",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a Roman numeral system. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals if specified.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number to Decimal**: \n   - Parse the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves handling digits beyond 9 using letters (A-Z) for bases greater than 10.\n   \n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**:\n   - If the target base `b` is not 'R', convert the decimal number to base `b` using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined set of value-symbol pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            digit = int(c)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + ord(c.upper()) - ord('A')\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(inputs), 2):\n        line1 = inputs[i]\n        line2 = inputs[i+1]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        c_str = line2\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion from Base `a` to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string `c` and converts it to its corresponding decimal value by iterating through each digit and accumulating the result.\n\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Base `b`**: The function `decimal_to_base` handles the conversion of a decimal number to any base up to 25, using letters for digits beyond 9. This function constructs the result by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders.\n\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals by using a list of value-symbol pairs. It repeatedly subtracts the largest possible value from the number and appends the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and large numbers, ensuring accurate conversion between different numeral systems.",
