    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how many?\n\nWait, the example given is m=1. The output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5!, the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1, and 6/25 is 0). Similarly up to 9. Then at 10!, it's 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So between 5 and 9, inclusive, there are 5 numbers. So the count is 5.\n\nBut how do I find for a general m?\n\nThe approach here is probably to find the possible n's that would give exactly m trailing zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, let's think. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So m=5 would have no solutions. Hence, the output would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's. Let's think about how the count of trailing zeros increases. For each n, the count increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes by more (like when it's a multiple of 25, etc). But the count is non-decreasing as n increases. So for a given m, the possible n's would form a contiguous range. Wait, but maybe not? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose m is 5. Let's check for n=25. The count is 6. For n=24, it's 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0. So for some m, there are no solutions.\n\nBut for other m's, there may be one or more n's. So the idea is to find the minimal n where the count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. For a given m, find the smallest n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Let's call this n_min.\n\n2. Then check if there exists n's where the count is m. If there are none, return 0.\n\n3. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is m. Let's call it n_max. Then all numbers from n_min to n_max will have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is n_max - n_min + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_min and n_max?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the possible n's. Let's think about binary search.\n\nThe count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n's that produce exactly m.\n\nWait, but how do we find if there exists any n that gives exactly m?\n\nLet me think. Let's first find the minimal n where the count is >=m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. But if it is, then find the minimal n where count is m, and the next n where count increases beyond m. Then the numbers between those two points would be the possible n's.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFirst, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\nThen check if count_zeros(low_n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nIf it is, then find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_n. Then the numbers from low_n to high_n-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is high_n - low_n.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the example. For m=1, the low_n would be 5, since count_zeros(5)=1. Then high_n is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. That would be 10. So the range is 5 to 9 (since 10-1=9). So the count is 5 numbers, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's find low_n. Let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So when m=5, the low_n is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is higher than m. So there's no solution.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this n_high.\n\n- The numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the possible n's. So the count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut how to compute count_zeros(n)?\n\nThat's straightforward. The function would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to find n_low and n_high using binary search.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on n. Since for n=0, count is 0. For n=1, 0, etc. For larger n, count increases.\n\nThe possible range for binary search would be from 0 to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms add more). So for example, m=1, 5*1=5, which gives count 1.\n\nBut maybe 5*m is not the tightest upper bound. But for binary search purposes, it's acceptable.\n\nSo for the binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nSimilarly, for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, then check if count_zeros(n_low) ==m. If yes, then the answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1. So the count is (n_high - n_low). But if count_zeros(n_low) is not m, then there is no solution.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1, so that's not an issue here.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, let's handle the edge cases. For example, when m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) !=m. If so, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThe answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\nSo the count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut let's test this with the example.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nn_low is 5 (count is 1). Then n_high is the minimal n where count >=2. Let's compute for m+1=2.\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\nLet's think. For n=5, count is 1. For n=10, count is 2 (10//5=2, 10//25=0). So the minimal n is 10. So n_high is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute n_low for m=5.\n\nLet me think. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=25, count is 6. For n=24, count is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 =4. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is more than 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. For n=25, count is 6. So n_low is 25. Then n_high is the minimal n where count >=7. Let's compute that.\n\nFor n=25, count is 6. For n=25+1=26, count is same as 25. For 29, same. For 30, count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → total 7. So n_high is 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29. That's 5 numbers. So the answer is 5, and the numbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo that works.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut first, handling the input. The input is a single integer m. But looking at the sample input, the first example is ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But in the sample input, the first input is '1' and the second is '5'? Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the only line containing an integer m. But the sample input shows two lines, but perhaps that's part of a test case where the input is read as multiple lines? Or perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single input.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as a single integer m. The sample input shows for example, input is ['1', '5'], which perhaps is a list of test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. But looking at the example:\n\nIn the first sample input, the input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, and output is 0. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. But the sample input shows two lines, perhaps indicating that the code should read multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases. However, the problem's sample input and output shows that for input 1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", and for input 5, the output is \"0\".\n\nBut the original problem's input is a single integer. So the code should read one integer m from stdin. However, the sample input shows two test cases. That suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nThis suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple lines. But the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the problem's original input is a single integer. So the code should read m from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input says that the input is a single integer. So there's a contradiction here. However, looking at the problem's note, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output 0. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input says that the input is a single integer.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the actual code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate m value.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single integer. However, in the sample input, there are two entries. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich implies that the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that's not clear.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line, which is m. But the sample input shows two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. However, the original problem's note says that the first sample input is 1 and output is 5... So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. But the code should read one m per line.\n\nBut given that the original problem's input is a single integer, perhaps the code is supposed to process one m. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate m, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. Given that, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process a single m. But the sample input shows two test cases. But the problem's output for the first sample input is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is the output for m=1. The second output is for m=5. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single integer. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the original problem says that the input is a single integer. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m...\n\nSo the code should read a single integer. Therefore, the sample input must be a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case. However, the sample output shows two outputs. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should read a single m, and output the answer. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process one m.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input says that the input is a single integer. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut since the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout, and the sample shows that for input 1 and 5, the outputs are as shown, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that it's a single integer. So this is a problem.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should process a single test case. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code would read m from input, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse compute n_high as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThe answer is the list of numbers from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\nThe count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nSo the code would generate that list, then print the count followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search.\n\nImplementing the binary search function.\n\nLet's write a helper function called find_min_n(target), which returns the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound. For example, for target m, the upper bound can be 5*m. But for large m, like 1e5, 5*m is 5e5. But even for m=1e5, 5*m is manageable.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible n? For m=1e5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is around 5*m, but perhaps higher. Wait, for example, for m=1e5, the count_zeros(5*1e5) is 1e5 /5 + 1e5/25 + ... which is 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 24999. Which is less than 1e5. So 5*m is not sufficient. Oh wait, this suggests that my initial upper bound is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So for target m, how to choose the upper bound for binary search?\n\nBecause for m=1e5, the minimal n could be larger than 5*m. So how to find a proper upper bound?\n\nLet me think. The count_zeros(n) is equal to floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... which is less than n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... which is a geometric series with ratio 1/5. The sum is n/5 * (1/(1-1/5)) ) = n/4. So count_zeros(n) < n/4. So for count_zeros(n) >= m, we need n/4 >= m → n >=4m. So the upper bound can be set to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least 5m/5 = m. But earlier calculation shows that for m=1e5, 5m is 500,000, and count_zeros(500,000) is:\n\nLet's compute 500000//5 = 100000\n\n500000//25 = 20000\n\n500000//125 = 4000\n\n500000//625 = 800\n\n500000//3125= 160\n\n500000//15625= 32\n\n500000//78125= 6\n\n500000//390625= 1\n\nTotal is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,999. Which is larger than m=1e5. So for m=1e5, the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo the upper bound for binary search can be set to 5*m.\n\nBut for m=0, but m starts from 1.\n\nSo the binary search function can be implemented with low=0, high=5*m.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, find n_low as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nImplement binary search for that.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut for target= m.\n\nOnce n_low is found, check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find n_high as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers?\n\nFor example, if the count is k, then the numbers are [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1].\n\nSo the code can generate that list, then print the length followed by the elements.\n\nBut for large m, say 1e5, the list could be up to 5 elements (as in the first example), but maybe more?\n\nWait, for example, if m is such that there's a range of numbers where count_zeros(n) is m. How long can that range be?\n\nWell, for example, when m is 24, let's see:\n\nLet me think. For n= 99, count_zeros is 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → total 22. For n=100, count_zeros is 20 +4 + 0 =24. So for m=24, the minimal n is 100. Then for n=100, count is 24. For n=101, same. Up to n=104. Then for n=105, count_zeros(105) is 21 + 4 + 0 = 25. So the range is 100-104, which is 5 numbers. So again, 5 numbers. So why is that?\n\nBecause when you have a number that is not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't increase the count. But when you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. So the maximum possible number of n's for a given m is 5. Because between multiples of 5, there are 4 numbers that don't add to the count. So for example, if the minimal n is a multiple of 5, then the next numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) will have the same count. But when you reach n+5, which is the next multiple of 5, the count increases by 1 (or more if it's a multiple of higher powers).\n\nWait, but in the example where m=24, the minimal n is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then for 101, 102, 103, 104, the count remains 24. For 105, count_zeros(105) is 25. So the range is 5 numbers (100-104). So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the maximum number of possible n's is 5. So the list can be up to 5 elements. Which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can generate the list as [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1], which is (n_high -n_low) elements.\n\nSo the code:\n\nOnce n_low and n_high are found, the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(n_low, n_high)).\n\nBut for large ranges, this could take time. But given that the maximum possible range is 5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. Let's assume that input is read via input().strip().\n\nBut for the sample input, when m is 1, the code should output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So for the first case, the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. However, the code above prints len(numbers) followed by the numbers. So for the first case, len(numbers) is 5, then the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the sample input m=1, the code would generate numbers = list(range(5, 10)), which is [5,6,7,8,9]. So yes.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are 5 elements. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the numbers are 0 elements? Well, that's handled by the first condition.\n\nBut let's test for m=5. The code would find n_low as find_min_n(5). Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n with count_zeros(n)>=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=24, count_zeros(24) is 4. For n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the code would find low=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nSo the code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code would find n_low=25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then find n_high as find_min_n(7). Let's compute find_min_n(7):\n\nWe need the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nFor n=25, count is 6. For n=29, same. For n=30, count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → total 7. So the minimal n is 30. So numbers = list(range(25, 30)) → 25,26,27,28,29. Which is 5 elements. So the output is 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about when there is only one n? For example, m=24, which for n=100, count_zeros(100)=24. Then find_min_n(25) would be 105. So the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers. So code is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So the output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one n? For example, m=24, but suppose that the next count is 25. But in the case of m=24, there are 5 numbers. So when does there exist only one n?\n\nHmm, perhaps when the next count increases by more than 1. For example, m=24. Suppose that for n= some number, the count is m, and the next count is m+2. Then the numbers would be from n_low to n_high-1, which would be n_low, since n_high is the first n with count >= m+1. For example, if m=24, and n_high is 100 (but that's not possible). Let's think of a scenario where count_zeros(n) jumps from m to m+2.\n\nLet me think. Let's take n=24, count is 4. n=25, count is 6. So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=4, the numbers are from 20 to 24 (assuming that count_zeros(20) is 4, and count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, the n_low is 20. n_high is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So numbers are 20-24 → 5 numbers. So for m=4, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo when can there be only one n?\n\nIt's possible only if the count_zeros increases by more than 1 when moving from n to n+1. For example, if there's a number n where count_zeros(n) = m, and count_zeros(n+1) = m +k, where k>1. But how?\n\nFor example, let's imagine m=5. Suppose that there is no solution, but for m=6, there is a solution. But how?\n\nBut in any case, the code will handle it.\n\nBut according to our code, the numbers between n_low and n_high-1 will have exactly m trailing zeros. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=1 → output 5 numbers.\n\nCase 2: m=5 → output 0.\n\nCase 3: m=6 → output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So code doesn't have to handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: m=24999. Let's imagine that the code would find n_low and n_high properly.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large m, like 1e5, the code should be efficient. The binary search runs in O(log(5*m)) steps, and each step calls count_zeros which is O(log n). So overall, it's O(log m * log m), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is 0, but the problem says m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut what if m is very large, say 1e5? Let's see.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is 1, the code returns the correct answer.\n\nAnother thing: the code for the sample input would print the numbers as space-separated. For example, the first sample outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, after printing len(numbers), the code prints the numbers as a space-separated string. However, in Python, when you print the list, you need to join them with spaces. The code does that correctly with ' '.join(...).\n\nBut when the numbers is empty, the code would print 0, and nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nThe code would output 5 followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSample input 5: m=5. Output 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=24.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(24). Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So n_low is 100. Then n_high is find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. So find_min_n(25) would find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\nFor n=100, count is 24. For n=105: count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So n_high is 105. Thus, numbers is 100-104 → 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $, we use binary search. Similarly, we find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m + 1 $ to determine the upper bound of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If the count of trailing zeros at the lower bound is not exactly $ m $, there are no valid $ n $ values. Otherwise, the valid $ n $ values lie between the lower and upper bounds found using binary search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. The upper bound for binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is sufficiently large to ensure the correct value is found.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code reads the input $ m $, finds the lower bound $ n_{\\text{low}} $ where the trailing zeros count first meets or exceeds $ m $, and checks if this count is exactly $ m $. If not, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds the upper bound $ n_{\\text{high}} $ where the count first exceeds $ m $, and prints all integers between $ n_{\\text{low}} $ and $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
