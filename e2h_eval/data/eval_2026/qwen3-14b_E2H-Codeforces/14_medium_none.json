    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nWait, the key here is that the function that counts trailing zeros is non-decreasing. As n increases, the count of trailing zeros either stays the same or increases. So for example, when you go from 4! to 5!, the count increases by 1. Then from 5! to 6!, it increases by another 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1, but 6/25 is 0, so total is 1+...). Wait no, wait for 5! it's 1, 6! is 1 (since 6/5 is 1, 6/25 is 0. So total is 1). Wait, no, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (still 1 zero). Then 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. Wait, no, 10/5 is 2, 10/25 is 0. So total is 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Then at 10, it jumps to 2.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros would be a consecutive range of numbers. But how to find that range?\n\nBut how can there be multiple n's? For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So five numbers. So for m=1, the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, but 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1), 8! is 40320 (1), 9! is 362880 (1). Then 10! is 3628800 (two zeros). So yes, the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. So that's five numbers.\n\nSo the approach is: find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nThe problem is that for some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m=5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, let's check. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24: count is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. For n=25, it's 25//5 + 25//25 =5 +1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether there exists any n that gives exactly m trailing zeros. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find the range of n's.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there's a range of numbers where the count remains m. The number of such numbers is the answer.\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal n that have exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the count is m.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since the count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function, for a given m, we can find the first n where the count is >=m, and then check if that count is exactly m. But how to find the range.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the smallest n where the count is m, and then find the largest n where the count is m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the possible answers.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the maximum n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the answer. However, if there is no such n (like when m=5 in the example above), then output 0.\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the lower bound of n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's think about using binary search to find the first occurrence of m.\n\nWait, here's an idea: The count_zeros function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, the set of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros is a contiguous range. So if there exists any n with count_zeros(n) = m, then there is a range of numbers [low, high] such that for all n in [low, high], count_zeros(n) = m. And for numbers less than low, count_zeros is less than m. For numbers higher than high, count_zeros is higher than m.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the maximal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it high.\n\nIf low doesn't exist (i.e., there is no n with count_zeros(n) = m), then output 0.\n\nElse, the answer is high - low + 1 numbers, and they are from low to high.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, since count_zeros is non-decreasing, for a given m, the first occurrence of m is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. The last occurrence is the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how to find these?\n\nLet me think about binary search for the first occurrence.\n\nFor example, for the first occurrence of m, we can search for the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, that's the first occurrence.\n\nSimilarly, for the last occurrence, we can search for the largest n where count_zeros(n) <= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for a given m, the count_zeros(n) can jump over m. For example, if m=5, and the count_zeros(n) jumps from 4 to 6. Then, there's no n with count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it lower.\n\n- Find the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it upper.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then no solution. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this y. Then the numbers from x to y-1 will have count_zeros equal to m. So the count is y -x.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the count_zeros(x) is m. Then the next number where count_zeros increases is y. So all numbers between x and y-1 have count_zeros equal to m.\n\nSo for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nFind x as the first n where count_zeros(n) >=1. That's 5. Then find y as the first n where count_zeros(n) >=2. That's 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems like a solid approach.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find x = the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n2. Find y = the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n3. If count_zeros(x) != m, then there are no solutions. So output 0.\n\nElse, the numbers from x to y-1 are all the possible n's. The count is y -x.\n\nSo the answer is the list of numbers from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to implementing two binary searches: one for x and one for y.\n\nNow, how to implement count_zeros(n)?\n\nThat's straightforward. We can write a helper function that, given n, returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the binary search part. How to find x, the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search for x can be done between 0 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound? Well, for m up to 1e5, the maximum possible n that could have m trailing zeros is 5*m. Because, for example, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So 5*m would have at least m zeros. But perhaps that's not tight. But for binary search, even a high upper bound is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. But for example, the count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5 /5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is more than 1e5. So the upper bound can be 5*m. But maybe even 5*m is not enough. Wait, but for m=1, the upper bound would be 5*1=5. Which is correct. For m=5, the upper bound would be 25. Let's check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is higher than 5. But the actual n that would have count_zeros(n) =5 is not present. So in that case, the binary search would find x as the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for any m, the count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. Because for each 5 in 5*m, you get one count. So 5*m//5 = m. Then adding higher terms. So count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. So for the binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, even 5*m is not enough. Wait, no. For example, m=1, 5*m is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. Which is exactly m. So that's correct. For m=2, 5*2=10. count_zeros(10) is 2. So yes. For m=5, 5*5=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find x as the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see.\n\nBut in this case, what is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 5 + 1 =6. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So in this case, the answer would be 0. Because the count_zeros(x) is not equal to m.\n\nThus, the approach would correctly return 0 for m=5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform binary search to find x (the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m).\n\nThen perform binary search to find y (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1).\n\nThen check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0. Else, the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid n's.\n\nNow, how to perform the binary search for x.\n\nThe binary search for x:\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m (or some upper bound). But wait, 5*m may not be sufficient? Wait, for example, if m is 1e5, then 5*m is 5e5, but count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 8e2 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124999 (approximate). So for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which gives count_zeros of ~1.25e5, which is more than m. So the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps even higher. But for the sake of code, let's use 5*m as upper bound.\n\nWait, but what if m is zero? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo, the binary search for x:\n\nlow = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nBut for some m, the required x may be higher than 5*m? Let's think. For example, m=1, 5*m=5, which is the correct value. For m=6, the count_zeros(25) is 6. So 5*m is 30. But 25 is less than 30. So the upper bound is sufficient.\n\nSo the binary search can proceed with high = 5*m.\n\nSo the code for binary search:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly for find_min_n(m+1).\n\nOnce we have x = find_min_n(m), and y = find_min_n(m+1), then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, the numbers from x to y-1 inclusive are the answer.\n\nSo the number of such numbers is y -x.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nx is find_min_n(1) = 5. y is find_min_n(2) = 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So y -x is 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would be 25. find_min_n(7) would be 25? Or 25's count is 6, so for m+1=7, find_min_n(7) would be 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is 6. ... count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So find_min_n(7) would be 30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would return y -x = 30 -25 =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input. Then:\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m)\n\nCompute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nElse: the numbers are from x to y-1 inclusive. So the count is y -x. Then output that count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut how to generate the list of numbers from x to y-1?\n\nFor example, if x is 5 and y is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the list is [x, x+1, ..., y-1].\n\nSo in code, the list is list(range(x, y)).\n\nBut for large ranges, generating the list could be time-consuming. However, given that m is up to 1e5, and the maximum possible y-x is 5 (as in the first example), but maybe in some cases, it's more. Wait, for example, when m is 24, what happens?\n\nLet me think. Let's take m=24. Let's find x and y.\n\nThe count_zeros(n) for n=99 is 99//5 + 99//25 + 99//125 = 19 + 3 + 0 = 22. For n=100: 20 +4 + 0 =24. So count_zeros(100) is 24. So x is 100. Then for m+1=25, find_min_n(25) would be 100? Or higher?\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So for m+1=25, find_min_n(25) would be the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is 24. ... count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 21+4=25. So find_min_n(25) is 105. So x is 100, y is 105. So the numbers from 100 to 104 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code would generate that list.\n\nSo the code would generate the list as range(x, y), which is correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m)\n\nCompute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   the numbers are x to y-1 inclusive. So the count is y -x.\n\n   output the count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: m=1, which returns 5 numbers.\n\nEdge case 2: m=5, which returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: m=24, which returns 5 numbers (as in the example above).\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see:\n\nx is find_min_n(2). Let's find the minimal n with count >=2.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So x is 10. y is find_min_n(3). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So find_min_n(3) is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So 10,11,12,13,14. So output 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nBut let's check count_zeros(10) is 2. Yes. count_zeros(14) is 14//5=2 + 14//25=0 = 2. So yes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Let's see. The x is 25, y is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So output 5 followed by 25-29.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, let's implement the code.\n\nBut first, the helper function count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, the binary search functions.\n\nBut in Python, we can implement the binary search as follows.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for target= m, which could be up to 1e5. Then 5*target could be 5e5. For m=1e5, 5*target is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut what if the required n is larger than 5*target? Let's think. Suppose target is m, and the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) >= m is larger than 5*m. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, m=1. 5*m is 5. The minimal n is 5, which is exactly 5*m. For m=2, 5*2=10, which is the minimal n. For m=3, 5*3=15. count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0. So 3). So yes, the minimal n is 15. Which is 5*3.\n\nBut what about m=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 25. So for target=25, the minimal n is 105. 5*target is 125. So 105 is less than 125. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother example: m= 100000. Let's see, the upper bound is 5*1e5=500000. But the actual minimal n for count_zeros(n) >= 1e5 could be less than 500000. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if the minimal n is larger than 5*m? Let's think. Let's take m= 1e5. Let's say that the count_zeros(5*m) is less than m. Then the code would fail. But is that possible?\n\nWell, count_zeros(5*m) is equal to:\n\nsum_{i=1}^k (5*m / 5^i) )\n\nWhich is sum_{i=1}^k (m / 5^{i-1} )\n\nWhich is m + m/5 + m/25 + ... \n\nWhich is m * (1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = m * (1/(1-1/5)) ) = m * 5/4 = 1.25 m.\n\nSo count_zeros(5m) is at least m. So for any m, the count_zeros(5m) >= m. Thus, the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient. Therefore, the binary search will find the correct x.\n\nSo the code for find_min_n is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead m from input. Let's note that the input is given as a list, but the sample input shows that for example, the first input is ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the sample input shows something else. Wait, looking back:\n\nSample input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is that the input is read from stdin, but in the sample input, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows something else. Oh, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which perhaps is two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Or perhaps the sample input is given as a list of inputs, and the output is a list of outputs. For example, the first input is 1, output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and the second input is 5, output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents two separate test cases. But the code should read a single integer m from standard input.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which perhaps is a mistake. But according to the problem's note, the first sample input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code must process a single m.\n\nSo the code should read m from input. So for example, in the first case, input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nThus, the code should read m as input().strip().\n\nBut in the sample input given, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So the code should read one line, which is m.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer. So the code should read a single integer m.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute x and y as discussed.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m)\n\nCompute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nCheck if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0. Else, output the count (y -x) followed by the numbers from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nBut in code:\n\nBut for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all that.\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = y -x\n        print(k)\n        if k >0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nBut wait, for k=0, but that's impossible because if count_zeros(x) ==m, then y is the first n with count >=m+1. So x is the first n with count >=m, and count_zeros(x) is m. So y is the first n with count >=m+1. So x must be less than y. Because for x, count_zeros(x) is m. So for y, count_zeros(y) is >=m+1. So y is at least x+1. So k = y -x is at least 1. So the code can safely print the range.\n\nBut in code, for example, when m=1, x=5, y=10. So range(5,10) is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(x, y) includes x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers. For example, m=2, the code would output 5 numbers (10-14).\n\nBut let's test for m=5:\n\nx = find_min_n(5). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find low=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nThus, the code would output 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. x is 25, count_zeros(25)=6. y is find_min_n(7) which is 30. So the numbers are 25-29. So output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the case where the output is 0, the code prints 0. For other cases, it prints k followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 5, it prints 5 followed by the numbers. So the code would print '5' followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the print(k) is followed by the numbers. However, when k is 0, the code prints 0. Otherwise, when k>0, it prints k, then the numbers.\n\nBut for the case where k=0, the code is handled by the first condition.\n\nBut the code is:\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute y, etc.\n\nBut in the else part, k is y -x, which is >=1?\n\nYes, because if count_zeros(x) is m, then for y = find_min_n(m+1), count_zeros(y) >= m+1. So x must be less than y. Because if x is such that count_zeros(x) is m, then for x, count_zeros(x) < m+1. So the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 is y >=x+1. So y -x >=1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1\n\nx = find_min_n(1) = 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\ny = find_min_n(2) = 10. So k = 5. Output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 5: m=5. x is find_min_n(5) = 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nNow, code for the problem.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, sometimes there may be leading or trailing whitespaces. But using int(sys.stdin.readline().strip()) would be safe.\n\nBut the code uses m = int(sys.stdin.readline()), which is okay.\n\nBut for cases where the input is read as a string, but in the problem statement, the input is a single integer.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut for the case where the output is 0, the code prints 0. For example, when m=5, the code prints 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second case is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = y - x\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output for the first case is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The code would print 5 followed by the numbers. But the code's print(k) and print('...') would produce two lines. For example, for the first case, the code would print:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct. Because the first line is k, and the second line is the numbers.\n\nBut the sample output shows that the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is exactly what the code does.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 5, it prints 5, then prints the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when k is zero? The code prints 0, and no other line. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second case outputs 0. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are zero? Well, the problem says n is a positive integer, so n can't be zero. But the code's logic ensures that x is such that count_zeros(x) is m, which for m >=1, x is at least 5 (for m=1). So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nx = find_min_n(2) = 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. y = find_min_n(3) = 15. So the numbers are 10-14. The code outputs 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. x=25, y=30. Output 5 numbers 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. x= 100, y=105. Output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=25. Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(25) is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(100) = 24. count_zeros(105) is 25. So x=105. Then y is find_min_n(26). Let's compute count_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22 + 110//25=4 + 110//125=0 → 26. So y is 110. So the numbers are 105-109. Which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 followed by 105 106 107 108 109.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the code would read m=0, but according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest and largest values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in quickly narrowing down the range of possible values for `n`.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest `n` (let's call it `x`) where the number of trailing zeros is at least `m`, and the smallest `n` (let's call it `y`) where the number of trailing zeros is at least `m+1`, the valid values of `n` lie between `x` and `y-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = y - x\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing up the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently determining the lower bound of valid `n` values.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input value `m`, uses `find_min_n` to determine the smallest `n` with at least `m` trailing zeros (`x`) and the smallest `n` with at least `m+1` trailing zeros (`y`). If `x` does not yield exactly `m` trailing zeros, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid `n` values and the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of `n` values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
