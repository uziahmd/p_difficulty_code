He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. But since there are multiple possibilities, how can I find a valid assignment?\n\nLet me think about the possible approach. Since the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct way is to find which of the input strings can be prefixes and which can be suffixes, ensuring that there's a common string s that satisfies all the assignments.\n\nBut how do I find that s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unique way to determine the correct assignments based on the longest possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. But since the input has two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and one is the suffix. So, for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, these two strings must be present in the input. Also, the original string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 are present in the input.\n\nBut how can I find which of the input strings of length n-1 are the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. For them to be the prefix and suffix of s, they must overlap correctly. Because the original string s is of length n. So, the prefix of length n-1 (A) and the suffix of length n-1 (B) must satisfy that their overlap is the original string. Wait, the original string s would be A + last character, but also B's first character is s[1], so the first character of B is s[1], and the last character of A is s[n-2]. So, the original s would be A concatenated with some character, and also B concatenated with some character (but that's not helpful).\n\nAlternatively, the original string s must be such that A is its prefix (so s starts with A), and B is its suffix (so s ends with B). So, the first n-1 characters of s are A, and the last n-1 characters are B. Therefore, the first character of B must be the same as the second character of A. Because the first character of B is s[1], and the second character of A is s[1] as well. So, A[1] = B[0].\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, the one that is the prefix (A) and the one that is the suffix (B) must satisfy A[1] == B[0]. Then, the original string s would be A + (B[-1])? Or wait, let me think:\n\ns is of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is A, which is s[0..n-2]. The suffix of length n-1 is B, which is s[1..n-1]. So, the first character of B is s[1], which is the second character of A. Therefore, B[0] must be equal to A[1]. Also, the last character of A is s[n-2], and the first character of B is s[1], but that's not directly related except for overlapping.\n\nSo, if we have two strings of length n-1, say X and Y, then if X is the prefix and Y is the suffix, then X[1] must equal Y[0]. Similarly, if Y is the prefix and X is the suffix, then Y[1] must equal X[0].\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, there must be one pair where this condition holds. Once that's determined, we can get the original s as follows: s is X concatenated with Y[-1], because X is the prefix of length n-1, and the suffix of length n-1 is Y. So, the original s is X + (Y's last character). But also, since Y is the suffix of length n-1, the original s must end with Y. So, the original s is Y[0 ... n-2] + Y[-1]? No, wait. The original s is of length n. The suffix of length n-1 is Y, which is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original s is s[0] + Y. But since X is the prefix of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], then X is the first n-1 characters of s. So, the original s is X + (s[n-1]). But since the suffix of length n-1 is Y, then s[1..n-1] = Y. Therefore, the original s is s[0] + Y. Also, X is s[0..n-2], which is the first n-1 characters. So, X is s[0] followed by Y[0..n-2-1] ?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think that the original s is X concatenated with Y's last character. Because:\n\nX is the prefix of length n-1. So, X is s[0 ... n-2]. The suffix Y is s[1 ... n-1]. So, the last character of Y is s[n-1]. Therefore, the original s is X[0 ... n-2] + Y[-1], and also Y is s[1 ... n-1]. So, the first character of Y is s[1], which is X[1].\n\nTherefore, if we have X and Y as the two strings of length n-1, and X is the prefix, Y is the suffix, then the original s is X + Y[-1], and Y must be s[1 ... n-1], which is (X[1 ... n-2] + Y[-1]) ?\n\nWait, let me take an example. Let's say n=5, and X is \"abab\" (length 4). Then, the original s would be X + c, where c is the last character. And Y is the suffix of length 4, which is s[1..4], which is \"babc\". So, the original s is \"ababc\".\n\nIn this case, X is the prefix of length 4, which is \"abab\", and Y is the suffix of length 4, which is \"babc\". So, X[1] is 'b', which is Y[0], which is correct.\n\nSo, the original s can be built by taking X (prefix of length n-1) and adding the last character of Y (the suffix of length n-1). However, this last character must be such that Y is the suffix of s. So, the original s is X concatenated with Y's last character. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is Y, which is s[1..n-1]. So, the first character of Y is s[1], which is the second character of X. Which is why X[1] must equal Y[0].\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B.\n\n2. Check which of the two pairs (A is prefix, B is suffix) or (B is prefix, A is suffix) satisfies the condition that the first character of the suffix equals the second character of the prefix.\n\n   For example, if A is prefix and B is suffix, then check if A[1] == B[0]. If yes, then the original s is A + B[-1]. Then, we can use this s to check all other input strings to see which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\n   If neither of the two possibilities works, then there's a problem, but according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one possibility.\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, we can check all the input strings and assign P or S based on whether they are a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how to find which of the two possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or vice versa) is correct?\n\nLet me take the first example from the problem:\n\nInput is:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe two strings of length 4 (n-1=5-1=4) are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nCheck if 'abab' is prefix and 'baba' is suffix. Then, check if abab[1] == 'b' equals 'baba'[0] which is 'b'. Yes. So that's valid. Then the original s would be 'abab' + 'a' (since the last character of 'baba' is a). So s is 'ababa'.\n\nCheck if that's correct. The prefixes of s (length 1-4):\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nThe suffixes of s (length 1-4):\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ba'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: 'baba'\n\nLooking at the input strings, the given strings are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nWhich correspond to the prefixes and suffixes. So the correct assignment would be that abab is a prefix, baba is a suffix. Then, the other strings can be checked against s.\n\nSo, once we find the correct s, we can process all input strings and check if they are a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them long1 and long2.\n\n- Check if long1[1] == long2[0]. If yes, then the original s is long1 + long2[-1].\n\n- Else, check if long2[1] == long1[0]. If yes, then original s is long2 + long1[-1].\n\nOnce we have the original s, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (then assign 'P') or a suffix of s (assign 'S'). However, note that there may be duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, there are two 'a's and two 'aa's. So, when checking, we need to make sure that for each input string, we correctly assign it as either prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because for example, if two input strings are the same and both are prefixes, but in the actual s, there's only one prefix of that length. Wait, but the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length, there are two strings. But for the original s, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix of each length. Therefore, for each length, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, once we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s (of some length) or a suffix. However, since there are two strings per length, for each length, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (for its length) or a suffix of s (for its length). Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input, the string is \"aaa\". For length 2, the prefix is \"aa\" and the suffix is \"aa\". So the two input strings for length 2 are \"aa\" and \"aa\". So in this case, both are prefixes and suffixes. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there's at least one possible assignment. So in this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can assign them as needed. For example, in the sample input, the output could be PPSS or SPSP, etc., as long as for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (for its length) or a suffix. If it's both, then we can choose either. However, since for each length, exactly one of the two strings must be a prefix and the other a suffix, we need to make sure that for each length, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but there's another string of the same length which is also both, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can process all the input strings and for each, check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. If not, assign S. However, this might not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. But in that case, since there are two strings of the same length, and both are both prefix and suffix, then one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nWell, perhaps the way to do it is:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for a given length, if both strings are prefixes (which can happen if they are same as the prefix of that length), then this approach will assign P to both, which is invalid. But that can't happen because for a given length, there's exactly one prefix. So, for a given length, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix. So, for example, if the two input strings for a certain length are the same as the prefix of that length, then both would be considered as prefixes, but according to the problem statement, the input is generated from a valid string. Therefore, this situation can't happen. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose the original string is \"aaa\" (n=3). Then, the prefixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\". The suffixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\". So for the input, the two strings for length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\", and for length 2 are \"aa\" and \"aa\". So, in this case, for each length, the two input strings are the same. So, when checking for a given input string, it will be a prefix (and a suffix). So, how to assign P and S for each of them?\n\nIn this case, for each length, we have two strings. We need to assign one as P and one as S. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So, for example, for the two \"a\" strings (length 1), we can assign one as P and the other as S. Similarly for the two \"aa\" strings (length 2). So, how can we do that in code?\n\nBut how can we know which one to assign as P and which as S? Well, perhaps the way to do it is to process the input strings, and for each length, track which ones are already assigned as P or S. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can just assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa. However, this depends on how the input is ordered.\n\nBut in code, how to handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: Once we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, for a given length, there should be exactly one string that is a prefix. Therefore, for each length, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, the code would work.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, the original string is \"ababa\", and for length 3, the prefix is \"aba\" and the suffix is \"aba\". Then, the two input strings for length 3 are \"aba\" and \"aba\". In this case, both are prefixes and suffixes. But according to the problem statement, the input is generated from a valid string. So, in this case, the two input strings are the same. So, when checking if it is a prefix, it is. So, the code would assign P to both. Which is invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is generated from a valid string. However, in this case, the input would have two identical strings. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, the code needs to handle this.\n\nWait, but in this case, the two input strings for length 3 are the same. So, when processing them, the code would check if each is a prefix. Both are. So, the code would assign 'P' to both, but that's invalid because for each length, there must be exactly one P and one S.\n\nSo, how to resolve this?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code as described would fail in this case. Therefore, the approach of checking if the input string is a prefix is not sufficient. Because for a given length, there are two input strings, both of which are prefixes (and suffixes), but we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nThe solution is to realize that for each length, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So, even if both are the same as the prefix, but the problem states that the input is generated from a valid string. So, in reality, the input strings are the prefixes and suffixes of the original string. So, for each length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So, even if they are the same, but in that case, both are prefix and suffix. But how can that happen?\n\nFor example, in the sample input 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe output is PPSS, but other options are possible. The original string is \"aaa\". For length 1, the prefix is \"a\" and the suffix is \"a\". For length 2, the prefix is \"aa\" and the suffix is \"aa\". So, the input strings are two \"a\" and two \"aa\". So, when processing each input string, the code must assign one of the \"a\" as P and the other as S. Similarly for the \"aa\" strings.\n\nBut how can the code know which to assign?\n\nIn this case, the code needs to assign for each length, exactly one P and one S. Therefore, for each length, we need to count how many of the input strings are already assigned as P, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate for each input string, whether it is a prefix or suffix. But for those that are both, we need to decide which to assign. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can assign all such cases as P first, and then for the same length, assign the others as S. But how to track that?\n\nBut how to find for each length, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWell, the original string s has exactly one prefix and one suffix of each length. So, for each length l, the prefix of length l is s[0..l-1], and the suffix is s[n-l..n-1]. Therefore, for each input string of length l, if it is equal to the prefix of length l, then it's a prefix. If it is equal to the suffix of length l, then it's a suffix. However, for some l, the prefix and suffix may be the same string. Therefore, for each input string of length l, if it is equal to the prefix, then it's a prefix. Otherwise, it's a suffix. But if there are two input strings of length l that are both equal to the prefix (i.e., same as the prefix), then we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because the original string's prefix and suffix of length l are unique. So, for example, for l=1, the prefix is s[0], and the suffix is s[n-1]. If s[0] = s[n-1], then both input strings of length 1 are equal to s[0], so both are prefix and suffix. But in that case, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to choose which one?\n\nThe problem allows any valid assignment. So, perhaps we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. But how to track that in code.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it is equal to the prefix of its length. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, for cases where both input strings of a certain length are equal to the prefix (and thus also the suffix), we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that.\n\nBut how can we know which one is which? Well, perhaps for each length l, we can count how many input strings are equal to the prefix of l. Since there are exactly two input strings of length l, and exactly one of them is the prefix and one is the suffix. So, if the two input strings are equal to the prefix, then that implies that the suffix for length l is also equal to the prefix. So, for that length, both input strings are the prefix and the suffix. Therefore, in this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to choose which one?\n\nIn code, perhaps we can process the input strings and for each length, track how many times we've assigned P. For example, for each length l, we can have a list of the input strings. For each string in that list, check if it is the prefix. If it is, and we haven't assigned a P yet for this length, assign P. Otherwise, assign S.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, here's the idea:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s of its length, or a suffix of s of its length. For each length l, there are exactly two input strings. So, for each l, we can collect the two strings. Then, for each of the two strings, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut since the original s is fixed, for each l, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix, and exactly one is the suffix. Therefore, for each string, if it is the prefix, assign P; else, assign S.\n\nBut how to check if it is the prefix. For example, for a string of length l, check if it equals s[0:l]. Similarly, check if it equals s[-l:].\n\nBut in cases where the string is both, then how to decide?\n\nIn such cases, the string is both a prefix and a suffix. However, since there are two input strings of the same length, and for that length, one must be a prefix and one a suffix. So, if the two strings are the same (and equal to the prefix and suffix), then we can assign one as P and the other as S. However, the code would need to do that.\n\nBut how to do this in practice. For example, for the two strings of length l, both are equal to the prefix. Then, when checking for the first string, we see that it's a prefix, assign P. For the second string, we see that it's also a prefix, but since we already assigned a P for this length, we assign S.\n\nBut how to track that in code.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each input string, we can check whether it's a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P, but only if we haven't already assigned a P for that length. Otherwise, assign S.\n\nBut how to track that. So, for each length l, we can have a counter indicating how many P's have been assigned for that length. For example, create a dictionary, say, prefix_count, where prefix_count[l] is the number of P's assigned for that length. Initially, 0.\n\nThen, for each input string:\n\n- Get its length l.\n\n- Check if it is equal to the prefix of s of length l. If yes:\n\n   - If prefix_count[l] is 0, assign 'P' and increment prefix_count[l].\n\n   - Else, assign 'S'.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Assign 'S'.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings will be the prefix. So, for the first occurrence of the prefix string, we assign P. For the second occurrence (if it's the same as the prefix), we assign S. For the other input string, which is the suffix, we assign S.\n\nBut how does this work for the case where the two input strings are the same and are both the prefix and suffix?\n\nLet's take the example where s is \"aaa\", and the two input strings for length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\".\n\nProcessing the first \"a\": check if it's the prefix (yes). Assign P, increment prefix_count[1] to 1.\n\nProcessing the second \"a\": check if it's the prefix (yes). Now, prefix_count[1] is 1, so assign S.\n\nSo, for that length, one P and one S. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the two \"aa\" strings for length 2:\n\nFirst \"aa\" is checked. It is the prefix (yes). Assign P. Second \"aa\" is checked. It is the prefix (yes). Assign S.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose for length l, the two input strings are the prefix and the suffix. For example, the prefix is \"ab\", and the suffix is \"ba\". Then, the first input string is \"ab\" (prefix), assigned P. The second input string is \"ba\", which is not the prefix, so assigned S. Correct.\n\nThus, this approach seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called inputs.\n\n3. Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them long1 and long2.\n\n4. Determine which of the two is the prefix and which is the suffix. For this, check if long1[1] == long2[0]. If yes, then the original s is long1 + long2[-1]. Else, check if long2[1] == long1[0]. If yes, then original s is long2 + long1[-1]. \n\n   But what if both are true? Well, that's impossible. Because for the original s, the two strings of length n-1 are the prefix and the suffix. So, exactly one of the two possibilities must be valid.\n\n   For example, in the first case, when we have long1 and long2, one of the two possibilities must hold. Because the original s has a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1. So, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n   For the two strings of length n-1, check if long1[1] == long2[0]. If yes, then s is long1 + long2[-1]. Else, check if long2[1] == long1[0], then s is long2 + long1[-1]. \n\n   But what if neither of these conditions is met? According to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one valid possibility. So, the code can safely assume that one of the two conditions holds.\n\n5. Once s is determined, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s (for its length). Then, assign P or S as per the earlier approach (tracking prefix_count per length).\n\nNow, how to implement step 3.\n\nTo find the two strings of length n-1:\n\nLoop through all the input strings, and collect those with length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\nOnce we have them, check the two possibilities.\n\nOnce s is determined, proceed to process all input strings.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read 2n-2 lines. Let's read them into a list called inputs.\n\nThen, find the two strings of length n-1.\n\nFor example:\n\nlong_candidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nlong1, long2 = long_candidates[0], long_candidates[1]\n\nBut need to check if long1 and long2 are the two.\n\nThen, check if long1[1] == long2[0]. If yes, then s_candidate = long1 + long2[-1]. Else, check if long2[1] == long1[0]. If yes, then s_candidate = long2 + long1[-1].\n\nBut what if the two candidates are the same? Like, for example, if the two strings of length n-1 are the same. Then, long1 and long2 are same. Then, the check for long1[1] == long2[0] would be same as long1[1] == long1[0]. Which may or may not be true.\n\nBut regardless, the code proceeds.\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, then for all input strings, check whether they are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nNow, implement the code for assigning P/S.\n\nInitialize a dictionary, prefix_count, which maps length l to the number of P's assigned so far for that length.\n\nThen, for each input string in the original order, process it:\n\nfor string in inputs:\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    if string == s_candidate[:l]:\n\n        if prefix_count.get(l, 0) == 0:\n\n            result.append('P')\n\n            prefix_count[l] = 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result.append('S')\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append('S')\n\nBut wait, what if the string is not a prefix, but is a suffix? Because in that case, it should be assigned 'S'. However, the code checks if it is a prefix. If not, assign 'S'. But how do we know that it is a suffix?\n\nBecause according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. Therefore, if it is not a prefix, then it must be a suffix. So, the code can safely assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nYes. Because for the input, the given strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of some valid string s. Once we have found s_candidate, which is derived from the two long strings, it's possible that s_candidate is the correct string. Thus, every input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as above.\n\nBut let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, inputs are:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nThe two long strings are 'abab' (len 4) and 'baba' (len 4). Check if abab[1] == 'b' equals baba[0] which is 'b'. Yes. So s_candidate is 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'.\n\nNow, for each input string:\n\nCheck if it is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\nFor example, first input string is 'ba' (len 2). s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → 'ba' != 'ab', so assign 'S'.\n\nSecond input is 'a' (len 1). s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → assign 'P'. prefix_count[1] becomes 1.\n\nThird input is 'abab' (len 4). s_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → assign 'P'. prefix_count[4] becomes 1.\n\nFourth input is 'a' (len 1). Now, prefix_count[1] is 1. So assign 'S'.\n\nFifth input is 'aba' (len 3). s_candidate[:3] is 'aba' → assign 'P' (prefix_count[3] is 0). Now, prefix_count[3] is 1.\n\nSixth input is 'baba' (len 4). s_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → not equal. So assign 'S'.\n\nSeventh input is 'ab' (len 2). s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → assign 'P' (prefix_count[2] is 0 → becomes 1).\n\nEighth input is 'aba' (len 3). s_candidate[:3] is 'aba' → prefix_count[3] is 1, so assign 'S'.\n\nSo the result is S P P S P S P S → which is SPPSPSPS, which matches the first sample output.\n\nYes! So this approach works.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is:\n\nn=3, inputs are ['a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a']\n\nThe two long strings are of length 2. They are 'aa' and 'aa'.\n\nCheck if long1[1] == long2[0]. Since long1 is 'aa', long2 is 'aa', long1[1] is 'a', long2[0] is 'a'. So yes. So s_candidate is 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa'.\n\nNow, for each input string:\n\ninput order: 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'.\n\nFor the first 'a' (len 1): s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → assign P. prefix_count[1] = 1.\n\nSecond input is 'aa' (len 2): s_candidate[:2] is 'aa' → assign P. prefix_count[2] = 1.\n\nThird input is 'aa' (len 2): prefix_count[2] is 1, so assign S.\n\nFourth input is 'a' (len 1): prefix_count[1] is 1 → assign S.\n\nResult is 'PPSS' which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: third sample input is n=2, inputs are 'a' and 'c'.\n\nThe two strings are of length 1. So long_candidates are 'a' and 'c'. Check if long1[1] == long2[0]. But since length is 1, long1[1] is out of bounds. Wait, n=2, so the length of the long strings is n-1=1. So, the two strings are of length 1. So, for the code, when trying to check long1[1], which is index 1 of a string of length 1, which is invalid. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the case when n=2, the two long strings are of length 1. So, for the code step where we check long1[1] == long2[0], but long1 has length 1. So, long1[1] is out of range.\n\nAh, this is a problem. How to handle that?\n\nWait, in the case when n=2, the original string s has length 2. Its prefixes of length 1 is s[0], and the suffix of length 1 is s[1]. Therefore, the two strings of length 1 in the input are s[0] and s[1]. So, for the two long strings (of length 1), they are the prefix and suffix. Therefore, the code needs to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix. But how?\n\nIn this case, since the length is 1, the code's previous approach of checking long1[1] == long2[0] is invalid, since long1 has length 1. So, for n=2, the code must handle this case separately.\n\nWait, what is the code doing here? Let's think again.\n\nThe code was trying to check for the two long strings (of length n-1 = 1). For the code to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix, it checks if long1[1] == long2[0]. But when the length is 1, long1[1] is out of bounds. So, how to handle this?\n\nIn this case, for n=2, the original s has length 2. The prefix of length 1 is s[0], and the suffix of length 1 is s[1]. Therefore, the two input strings of length 1 are s[0] and s[1]. So, the original s is s[0] + s[1]. Therefore, the two input strings are s[0] and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest improper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) help determine the original string `s`. By checking the overlap between these two strings, we can construct the original string `s`.\n2. **Construct Original String**: Using the two longest improper prefixes and suffixes, we can determine the original string `s` by ensuring the correct overlap between the two strings.\n3. **Determine Prefix and Suffix Assignments**: Once we have the original string `s`, we check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`. For each length, ensure exactly one string is assigned as a prefix and the other as a suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ninputs = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Find the two strings of length n-1\nlong_candidates = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\nlong1, long2 = long_candidates[0], long_candidates[1]\n\n# Determine the correct s\ns_candidate = None\nif len(long1) == 1:\n    # n=2 case, the original s is long1 + long2 or long2 + long1\n    # since both are of length 1, and they are the prefix and suffix\n    # we can choose either, but need to check which one makes sense\n    # for example, the first is prefix, the second is suffix\n    s_candidate = long1 + long2\nelse:\n    if long1[1] == long2[0]:\n        s_candidate = long1 + long2[-1]\n    elif long2[1] == long1[0]:\n        s_candidate = long2 + long1[-1]\n    else:\n        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n        pass\n\n# Now process each input string to assign P or S\nprefix_count = {}\nresult = []\n\nfor string in inputs:\n    l = len(string)\n    if string == s_candidate[:l]:\n        if prefix_count.get(l, 0) == 0:\n            result.append('P')\n            prefix_count[l] = 1\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    else:\n        result.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list.\n2. **Identifying Longest Strings**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Constructing Original String**: By checking the overlap between these two strings, we determine the original string `s`. For `n=2`, the original string is simply the concatenation of the two strings of length 1.\n4. **Assigning Prefix and Suffix**: For each input string, we check if it matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`. If it does, we assign 'P' unless another string of the same length has already been assigned as a prefix. Otherwise, we assign 'S'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine the valid assignments for each input string, adhering to the constraints provided.",
