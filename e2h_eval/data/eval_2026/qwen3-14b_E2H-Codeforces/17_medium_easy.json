He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string.

It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The key here is that there might be multiple possible correct answers, but we just need to find any one that's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to figure out which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. Let's think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For instance, the longest prefix is s itself, but since the input doesn't include that (since it's only improper prefixes and suffixes), the longest possible strings in the input are of length n-1. Wait, the problem says that the input includes all improper prefixes and suffixes. So for a string of length n, there are n-1 prefixes (lengths 1 to n-1) and similarly n-1 suffixes. So total of 2n-2 strings.\n\nBut the problem is that we don't know which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. However, the original string s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nSo, the approach would be to find a possible s that is compatible with the given strings, then assign each input string as P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nWait, the original string s can be determined by considering that the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must overlap in some way. For example, if we have two strings of length n-1 in the input, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. But how do we know which is which?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct s can be determined by taking the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, suppose there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix (so the original string is that string plus one character). Similarly, the other must be the suffix. But how do these two relate?\n\nLet me think: the original string s has a prefix of length n-1, say p, and a suffix of length n-1, say s'. Then, the original string s is p + c, where c is the last character. Also, s' is the suffix of length n-1, so s' is the first n-1 characters of s, except the last character? No, wait: the suffix of length n-1 is the entire string except the first character. So, for example, if s is 'abcde', then the suffix of length 4 is 'bcde'.\n\nSo, for the original string s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have overlapping parts. Specifically, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 share n-2 characters. So, for example, if the prefix of length n-1 is 'abcd' and the suffix of length n-1 is 'bcde', then the original string is 'abcde'.\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1 in the input, one must be the prefix (call it P) and the other must be the suffix (call it S). Then, the original string s must be such that P is the first n-1 characters, and S is the last n-1 characters. Therefore, the original string s can be constructed by combining P and S. How?\n\nThe original string s must be P + (last character of S). Because P is of length n-1, and the suffix S is of length n-1. Let me see: the suffix S is s[1..n], so the original string s is s[0] + S. But also, the prefix P is s[0..n-2]. So the original string is P + s[n-1]. But the suffix S is s[1..n-1], so the first character of S is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1]. So, the original string is P concatenated with the last character of S. But also, the original string can be obtained by taking the first character of P, then the entire S. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIf the original string is s = P + c, where c is the last character. Then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = P[1..n-2] + c. Which is equal to S. So S must be equal to P[1..n-2] + c. But since S is of length n-1, and P is of length n-1, then P[1..n-2] is of length n-2, and adding c gives length n-1. Therefore, S is equal to P[1..n-2] + c. But the original string is P + c. So S is the original string's suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1] = (P[1..n-2] + c) = S. Therefore, the original string can be written as P + (last character of S). But also, the original string can be written as (first character of P) + S. Because the first character of P is the first character of the original string. Then, the original string is (first character of P) + S. But S is of length n-1. So the length is 1 + (n-1) = n, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, for the two strings of length n-1, one is a prefix (P) and the other is a suffix (S). Then, the original string s must be equal to P + (last character of S) and also equal to (first character of P) + S. Therefore, these two expressions must be equal. Therefore, P + last_char(S) must equal first_char(P) + S.\n\nSo, for example, if P is \"abab\" and S is \"baba\", then the original string would be \"abab\" + last_char(S) = \"abab\" + 'a' = \"ababa\". Also, first_char(P) is 'a', so the other expression is 'a' + \"baba\" = \"ababa\". So that works.\n\nSo, given that, the approach would be to take the two strings of length n-1 from the input, and check which pair (P, S) satisfies that P + last_char(S) equals first_char(P) + S. Once we find such a pair, then the original string is determined. Then, once we have the original string, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the two strings of length n-1 in the input. Let's call them candidates.\n\n2. For each possible pairing between them (i.e., one as prefix, the other as suffix), check if the original string can be formed. For example, for candidate1 as prefix (P) and candidate2 as suffix (S), check if P + last_char(S) == first_char(P) + S. If yes, then the original string is that.\n\nOnce we have the original string s, we can then process all the input strings and for each, check if it's a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where there are multiple possibilities for the original string? For example, in the third sample input, the input is for n=2, and the two strings are 'a' and 'c'. The original string can be 'ac' or 'ca'. So, in that case, depending on which is chosen as prefix and which as suffix, the original string varies. So the code needs to find any possible original string that is consistent with the input.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the original string s by checking the possible pairs of length n-1 strings, and once found, proceed to check all input strings against s.\n\nBut how to find the correct pair?\n\nLet me think: For each pair of strings of length n-1, say A and B, check if A is a prefix and B is a suffix. Then, the original string would be A + B[-1], which must be equal to B[0] + B (since the original string is first character of A (since A is the prefix of length n-1) followed by B (the suffix of length n-1). Wait, no. Wait, the original string is of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is A. So the original string is A concatenated with a single character. But the suffix of length n-1 is B. So the original string is B concatenated with a single character (the first character of the original string). Wait, no. Let me re-express this:\n\nOriginal string s is of length n.\n\nIf A is the prefix of length n-1, then s starts with A. So s = A + x, where x is a single character.\n\nAt the same time, B is the suffix of length n-1. So s ends with B. So s = y + B, where y is a single character (the first character of the original string).\n\nSo combining these two equations: A + x = y + B. Since the length of A is n-1, and B is n-1, then:\n\nA + x is length n, and y + B is also length n.\n\nTherefore, the first n-1 characters of A + x is A, and the last n-1 characters is x + ... ?\n\nWait, the suffix of length n-1 of s is the last n-1 characters. So for s = A + x (which is length n), the suffix of length n-1 is A[1:] + x. Because the suffix starts at index 1. For example, if s is 'abcd' (n=4), then the suffix of length 3 is 'bcd', which is A (prefix of length 3, 'abc') + x (d) → the suffix is 'bcd' = A[1:] + x.\n\nSo in this case, B must equal A[1:] + x. But since x is the last character of s, which is the same as the last character of B. Because B is the suffix of length n-1, which is A[1:] + x. So B's last character is x. Therefore, x is B[-1].\n\nThus, the original string is A + B[-1]. Also, the original string can be written as B[0] + B. Because B is the suffix of length n-1. So the original string is s = B[0] + B. Because the first character of s is B[0], then the rest is B. So the original string is B[0] + B. But also, it's A + B[-1]. Therefore, these two must be equal.\n\nSo the condition is that A + B[-1] == B[0] + B.\n\nSo for each pair of length n-1 strings A and B, check if this equality holds. If yes, then the original string is A + B[-1] (or B[0] + B, which should be the same).\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nThe input for n=5 includes two strings of length 4: 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nCheck if 'abab' (A) and 'baba' (B) satisfy A + B[-1] == B[0] + B?\n\nA + B[-1] is 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'.\n\nB[0] + B is 'b' + 'baba' → 'bbaba'? No. That's not equal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the original string is supposed to be A + B[-1], which is 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa' (length 5). And B[0] + B is 'b' + 'baba' → 'bbaba' (length 5). These are not equal. So that pair would not work. But according to the sample input, the correct original string is 'ababa'.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the pair reversed. Let me try B as the prefix and A as the suffix.\n\nSo B is the prefix (length 4) and A is the suffix (length 4). So the original string would be B + A[-1] = 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'.\n\nBut B[0] + B is 'b' + 'baba' → 'bbaba' which is not equal to 'babab'.\n\nHmm. That's not matching. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the pair wrong. Let's think again. For the sample input, the original string is 'ababa'.\n\nThe prefixes of length 4 are 'abab' (the first four letters), and the suffixes of length 4 are 'baba' (the last four letters). So in this case, the two length 4 strings are 'abab' (prefix) and 'baba' (suffix). So the original string is 'ababa'.\n\nNow, according to the condition, the original string should be A + B[-1], where A is the prefix (abab) and B is the suffix (baba). So A + B[-1] is abab + a → ababa. Which is correct. Also, B[0] + B is 'b' + 'baba' → 'bbaba' which is not equal to the original string. So why is the condition that A + B[-1] equals B[0] + B?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving that condition. Let me re-express.\n\nEarlier reasoning said that the original string can be written as A + x (where x is the last character), and also as y + B (where y is the first character of the original string). Therefore, A + x = y + B. But since the original string is A + x, then y is the first character of A. So substituting y with A[0], we get A + x = A[0] + B. But since x is the last character of B (because B is the suffix of length n-1, which is the last n-1 characters of the original string. So the original string is s = A + x, and B is the last n-1 characters of s, which is s[1..n]. So B = s[1..n] = (A[1..n-1]) + x. So B is A[1..n-1] + x. Therefore, x is B[-1].\n\nSo substituting into the equation A + x = A[0] + B, which becomes A + B[-1] = A[0] + B. So that's the condition.\n\nSo for the sample case, A is 'abab', B is 'baba'.\n\nA + B[-1] is 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nA[0] + B is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa'. Which matches. So the condition holds. So the original string is 'ababa'.\n\nAh, right! So earlier when I considered B as the prefix and A as the suffix, I was checking the wrong pair. So the correct pair is A (prefix) and B (suffix), where A is 'abab' and B is 'baba'. Then the condition holds.\n\nSo the algorithm is: for each pair of the two length n-1 strings, check if A + B[-1] equals A[0] + B. If yes, then the original string is A + B[-1], which is also A[0] + B.\n\nSo, in code, the first step is to find the two strings of length n-1. Then check all possible pairings (there are two possibilities: one as prefix and one as suffix, or vice versa). For each possible pairing, check if the condition holds. Once we find a valid pairing, we can construct the original string.\n\nOnce the original string is determined, then for each of the input strings, we check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple possibilities for the original string? Well, the problem says that Ivan will accept any answer that is consistent with at least one possible s. So as long as we find one possible s, then assign the labels accordingly.\n\nSo the plan for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\nLet's call them candidates = [s1, s2].\n\nThen, for each possible pairing between them (s1 as prefix and s2 as suffix, and vice versa), check if the condition holds. For example, for (A, B) = (s1, s2), check if A + B[-1] == A[0] + B. If so, then the original string is A + B[-1]. Then, proceed with that.\n\nOnce we have the original string s, then for each input string in the list, check if it is a prefix of s or a suffix. Then assign P or S.\n\nBut how to handle the case when there are multiple possible pairings? For example, if both pairings (s1 as prefix and s2 as suffix, and s2 as prefix and s1 as suffix) are valid. Then we can choose either. But in practice, perhaps only one of them is valid.\n\nOnce the original string is determined, the rest is straightforward.\n\nOnce the original string is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (s ends with that string). Then assign 'P' or 'S'.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input where the string is 'aaa', the input strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. The original string is 'aaa'. The prefixes are 'a', 'aa', and the suffixes are 'a', 'aa'. So for the input strings, each of the 'a's can be either P or S, and the same for the 'aa's. So the output can be any combination that has two P's and two S's. For example, PPSS, or PSPS, etc.\n\nBut in our code, for each input string, we need to assign it as P or S. But how to decide which one when there's ambiguity?\n\nThe problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable. So for each input string, if it is both a prefix and a suffix, we can choose to assign it as P or S. However, the code must assign exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. Wait, no: the total number of P's and S's must be equal. Because there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. So the output string must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Because for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, choosing to assign it as P or S affects the count.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So there exists at least one way to assign P and S such that all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of some s. Therefore, when we find s, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix (could be both). However, the code needs to assign exactly one of P or S for each input string, ensuring that the total number of P's is n-1 and S's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, the code can proceed as follows: once s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then assign 'P' (but need to make sure that the count is correct). However, if there are multiple possibilities, perhaps the code can greedily assign P first, then S, or vice versa. But this may not work because the counts must be exactly n-1.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be correct, and the code has found s, then for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. Therefore, the code can collect all the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix (and not a suffix) or vice versa. However, some may be both. For those, the code can choose to assign as P or S, but in such a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, since the code has already determined s, the code can generate a list of all the prefixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes or the suffixes. Then, assign P or S accordingly. However, since the input contains exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be in exactly one of the two sets (or both). But in reality, the input contains exactly the union of all prefixes and suffixes, and each string is present exactly twice (for each length). Wait, no. The problem says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. But for a given s, some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of s = 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. However, the input has two strings of length 1. So in that case, the input would have two 'a's. So when processing, each of those two 'a's can be assigned as either P or S, as long as the total counts are correct.\n\nSo, the approach for assigning P/S once s is determined:\n\nWe can create two sets: prefixes and suffixes. For each input string, check if it is in prefixes, and/or in suffixes.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes (with duplicates allowed for overlapping cases), each input string must be in at least one of the sets. However, for the code, the problem is to assign each input string as P or S, making sure that the total number of P's is n-1 and S's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each input string, if it's a prefix of s and not a suffix, assign it as P. If it's a suffix and not a prefix, assign as S. If it's both, then we can assign it as P or S, but need to manage the counts.\n\nBut how to track the counts? For example, in the case of the sample input where s is 'aaa', the input strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. The prefixes are 'a', 'aa', and the suffixes are 'a', 'aa'. So for each of the input strings, they are both a prefix and a suffix. So for each of the four input strings, they can be assigned as P or S. But the total number of P's must be 2 (n-1=3? Wait n is 3, so n-1 is 2. Oh, the sample input for n=3 is the second example. Let me check.\n\nIn the second example, input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe output is PPSS. So the original string is 'aaa', and the prefixes are 'a', 'aa'; the suffixes are 'a', 'aa'. The input has two 'a's and two 'aa's. The output has two P's and two S's. So for example, the first 'a' is a prefix, the second 'a' is a suffix, etc.\n\nSo in this case, the code needs to assign exactly two P's and two S's. But since all the input strings are both prefix and suffix, the code can choose any assignment as long as the counts are correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce s is determined, collect all the prefixes and suffixes. For each input string, check if it is a prefix. If it is, then we can assign it as P, unless we have already assigned all the required P's. But how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, since the code needs to assign exactly (n-1) P's and (n-1) S's, and each input string must be in at least one of the sets, perhaps the code can:\n\n- For each input string, check if it is a prefix. If it is, and we still need to assign more P's, assign it as P. Else, assign it as S.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think of an algorithm:\n\nInitialize count_p = 0, count_s = 0.\n\nFor each input string in order:\n\n   if the string is a prefix of s and count_p < (n-1):\n\n       assign 'P', increment count_p.\n\n   elif the string is a suffix of s and count_s < (n-1):\n\n       assign 'S', increment count_s.\n\n   else:\n\n       ??? But this can't happen since the input is valid.\n\nBut this approach may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the 'aaa' case, the first 'a' is processed. It is a prefix. Assign as P. count_p becomes 1. The next input string is 'aa' (a prefix). Assign as P, count_p becomes 2. Now, the next input string is 'aa' again. It is a prefix, but count_p is already 2 (max allowed). So the code would assign it as S. Then the next 'a' is a prefix, but count_p is already full. Assign as S. This gives P P S S, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the code processes the first 'a' as P, then the next 'a' as S, then the 'aa's as P and S. But how to decide which order?\n\nBut the code can process the input strings in any order, and for each, prefer P if possible, but this depends on the order. However, the problem allows any valid assignment.\n\nSo the code can proceed with this approach. For each input string, check if it is a prefix. If yes, and we still need to assign more P's, assign as P. Else, check if it is a suffix and assign as S. Since the input is valid, this will always work.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix or suffix of s?\n\nIn Python, for a string s, to check if a given string is a prefix, we can do: given_str == s[:len(given_str)].\n\nSimilarly for suffix: given_str == s[-len(given_str):].\n\nSo, for each input string, we can check these conditions.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two.\n\nCheck for the possible pairings of these two strings to find the original s.\n\nOnce s is determined, process all input strings to assign P/S.\n\nNow, the code must find the original s. How to do that?\n\nIn code:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThen, for each possible pair (A, B) where A and B are the two candidates:\n\n   check if A + B[-1] == A[0] + B. If yes, then s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n   also check if B + A[-1] == B[0] + A. If yes, then s_candidate = B + A[-1]\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, proceed with that.\n\nBut how to handle cases where both pairings are valid?\n\nFor example, if both pairings (A,B) and (B,A) are valid. But that would imply that the original string can be either A + B[-1] or B + A[-1]. However, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, there must be at least one possible s.\n\nOnce we find any valid s_candidate, proceed.\n\nBut how to find it?\n\nIn code:\n\nfor the two candidates, say s1 and s2:\n\n   check if s1 + s2[-1] == s1[0] + s2. If yes, then s_candidate is s1 + s2[-1]\n\n   else check if s2 + s1[-1] == s2[0] + s1. If yes, then s_candidate is s2 + s1[-1]\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nOnce s_candidate is found, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to do that?\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, for each input string in the original list, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possible s_candidate? For example, in the third sample input where n=2, the two candidates are 'a' and 'c'. Then, for pairing (a as prefix, c as suffix):\n\ns_candidate = a + c[-1] = a + 'c' → 'ac'.\n\nCheck if a[0] + c equals 'a' + 'c' → 'ac' which is correct.\n\nFor pairing (c as prefix, a as suffix):\n\ns_candidate is c + a[-1] = 'c' + 'a' → 'ca'. Check if c[0] + a is 'c' + 'a' → 'ca', which is correct. So both pairings are valid, leading to two possible s_candidate: 'ac' and 'ca'.\n\nIn this case, the code can choose either. Once chosen, the rest of the assignment is done based on that.\n\nBut how to choose between them? Well, the code can choose the first valid one it finds.\n\nSo in code, for the two candidates, check the first pairing (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix). If that works, use that s_candidate. Else, check the other way around.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef find_original_string(candidates, n):\n    s1, s2 = candidates\n    # try s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix\n    candidate_s = s1 + s2[-1]\n    if candidate_s == s1[0] + s2:\n        return candidate_s\n    # else try s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix\n    candidate_s = s2 + s1[-1]\n    if candidate_s == s2[0] + s1:\n        return candidate_s\n    # according to the problem statement, this should not happen\n    # but perhaps raise an error? Or handle somehow.\n    # but the problem says the input is valid, so this code will find one.\n\nOnce we have the original string, proceed.\n\nOnce the original string is known, process each of the input strings.\n\nNow, the code can proceed to generate the output string.\n\nNow, the code can collect all the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input, where the original string is 'aaa', each input string is both a prefix and suffix. So the code needs to assign P or S, but ensuring that the total number of P's and S's is n-1 each.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code can process the input strings in order, and for each, assign P if possible, else S.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nInitialize a list of 'P' and 'S' for the output.\n\ncount_p = 0\n\ncount_s = 0\n\nfor each string in the original input list:\n\n    is_prefix = (string == s[:len(string)])\n\n    is_suffix = (string == s[-len(string):])\n\n    if is_prefix and count_p < (n-1):\n\n        append 'P'\n\n        count_p += 1\n\n    elif is_suffix and count_s < (n-1):\n\n        append 'S'\n\n        count_s += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this should not happen as per the problem statement.\n\nBut why would this not happen? Because the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. However, in the case where a string is both, but the code has already filled up all P's, then it would have to be assigned as S.\n\nBut how to ensure that the counts are correct?\n\nLet me think: the input has exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. However, some strings may be both. So the total number of strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is n-1. Similarly for suffixes. So when processing the input, each string must be in the prefix set or the suffix set.\n\nBut the code's approach is to assign P first if possible, then S. Since the total number of P's needed is n-1, and the same for S's, this approach should work.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input, the original string could be 'ac' or 'ca'. Let's take 'ac' as the original string. The input strings are 'a' and 'c'.\n\nFor the first input string 'a', it is a prefix of 'ac' (yes). Assign P. count_p is 1. For the second input string 'c', it is a suffix of 'ac' (yes). Assign S. count_s is 1. So the output is 'PS'.\n\nAlternatively, if the code had chosen 'ca' as the original string, then the first input string 'a' is a suffix of 'ca' (no, the suffix of length 1 is 'a' (since 'ca' has length 2). So 'a' is a suffix. The input string 'c' is a prefix of 'ca'. So the code would assign 'S' for 'a' and 'P' for 'c', leading to 'SP'.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment, so both are acceptable.\n\nThus, the code's approach of preferring P when possible will work.\n\nNow, putting all this together in code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines, storing them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nCollect the two strings of length n-1.\n\nCheck for the original string as explained.\n\nOnce the original string is determined, process each of the input strings in order, checking if it is a prefix or suffix, and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to collect the two strings of length n-1?\n\nIn Python:\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nBut since the input has exactly two such strings, this list will have exactly two elements.\n\nNow, code for finding the original string.\n\nOnce that is done, process the rest.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut let's test with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe input strings are:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nn=5.\n\ncandidates are the strings of length 4: 'abab', 'baba'.\n\nCheck for s1 = 'abab', s2 = 'baba':\n\ns_candidate = s1 + s2[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'\n\nCheck if this equals s1[0] + s2 → 'a' + 'baba' → 'ababa' → yes. So original string is 'ababa'.\n\nNow, process each input string.\n\nFor each of the 8 input strings:\n\nCheck if it is a prefix or suffix of 'ababa'.\n\nLet's list all input strings:\n\n1. 'ba' → check if it is a prefix of 'ababa'? No. 'ababa' starts with 'a', so no. Check if it is a suffix? The suffix of length 2 is 'ba' (last two letters). Yes. So assign S.\n\n2. 'a' → prefix (yes). Assign P.\n\n3. 'abab' → length 4. 'ababa'[:4] is 'abab' → yes. Assign P.\n\n4. 'a' → prefix (yes). Assign P. But count_p is now 2 (after first two steps: 1 for 'a', 1 for 'abab'). Wait, initial count_p is 0, count_s is 0.\n\nProcessing the first input string 'ba' is a suffix. Assign S. count_s is 1.\n\nSecond input string 'a' is prefix. Assign P. count_p is 1.\n\nThird input string 'abab' is prefix. Assign P. count_p is 2.\n\nFourth input string 'a' is prefix. Assign P. count_p is 3 (n-1 is 4? Wait n is 5, n-1 is 4. So the total number of P's needed is 4. So count_p can go up to 4.\n\nWait, for n=5, the original string has 4 prefixes (lengths 1-4) and 4 suffixes. So the output must have 4 P's and 4 S's.\n\nSo for the first sample input, the output is SPPSPSPS.\n\nLet me see how the code would process each string.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach of assigning P first would generate the correct output.\n\nBut the code needs to process all input strings in the order they were given.\n\nBut the code's output depends on the order of processing.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid output.\n\nNow, the code for the first sample input:\n\nOriginal string is 'ababa'.\n\nInput strings in order:\n\n1. 'ba' → check if it",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the original string `s` from the given prefixes and suffixes and then classifying each input string accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the original string `s`.\n2. **Determine Original String**: Check both possible pairings of these candidates to see which pairing forms a valid original string `s`. This is done by verifying if combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate matches the combination of the first character of the prefix candidate with the suffix candidate.\n3. **Classify Strings**: Once the original string `s` is determined, classify each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`. Ensure that the total number of prefixes and suffixes are each exactly `n-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n    s1, s2 = candidates[0], candidates[1]\n    \n    # Try both possible pairings to find the original string\n    original = None\n    # Try s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix\n    candidate_s = s1 + s2[-1]\n    if candidate_s == s1[0] + s2:\n        original = candidate_s\n    else:\n        # Try s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix\n        candidate_s = s2 + s1[-1]\n        if candidate_s == s2[0] + s1:\n            original = candidate_s\n    \n    # Now, process each input string to determine P/S\n    result = []\n    count_p = 0\n    count_s = 0\n    for s in strings:\n        len_s = len(s)\n        is_prefix = (original[:len_s] == s)\n        is_suffix = (original[-len_s:] == s)\n        if is_prefix and count_p < (n-1):\n            result.append('P')\n            count_p += 1\n        elif is_suffix and count_s < (n-1):\n            result.append('S')\n            count_s += 1\n        else:\n            # This should not happen as per problem statement\n            pass\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the original string.\n3. **Finding Original String**: By checking both possible pairings of these candidates, we determine the original string `s` that satisfies the conditions of being formed by combining the prefix and suffix candidates.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: Each input string is checked against the original string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix. The classification ensures that the counts of 'P' and 'S' are each exactly `n-1`, maintaining the required balance.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the original string and classifies each input string, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
