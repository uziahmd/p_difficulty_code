There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model how the winner can accumulate as many games as possible under this constraint.\n\nLet me think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays against player 3, they have already played once (the first game), and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that works. For n=4, the answer is 2. Why? Because if you have two initial matches (like 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4), then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner plays two games. If you tried to have the winner play three games, that would require more players, but maybe it's not possible. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, the question is, given n, find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play. Let's think recursively. Let's say the winner plays k games. Then, each time they play a game, they must have a new opponent. But each of those opponents must have a number of games played that's within one of the winner's current count.\n\nWait, for the winner to play k games, they must have faced k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been in the tournament up to that point. But each of those opponents must have played a certain number of games before facing the winner. Let's think about the structure of the tournament.\n\nThe winner's path requires that each time they play a game, their opponent has either the same number of games played, or one less. Because the winner's previous games are increasing by one each time.\n\nLet me think of this as building a tree. For example, the maximum number of games is achieved when each time the winner plays, their opponent is someone who has played as many games as possible. So, for the first game, the winner plays someone who has 0 games (so the first game is 0 vs 0). Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. To maximize, perhaps the opponent has 1 game. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, the total number of players required is the sum of the previous numbers. Let me think: For example, to have a winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something? Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose f(k) is the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, they must have played k-1 games before, and then face an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nTo reach the k-th game, the winner must have played k-1 games. Then, their opponent in the k-th game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Because the difference can be at most one.\n\nBut for the opponent to have played k-1 games, that opponent must have had their own path of k-1 games. But that would require that the opponent's path is similar to the winner's. However, since the winner and the opponent are both in the tournament, perhaps the total number of players required is the sum of the players needed for the winner's path and the opponent's path.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model this as a Fibonacci-like recurrence. For example, to have a winner play k games, the minimal number of players required is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, in order for the winner to play their k-th game, they must have faced an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is zero) or k-2 games (difference is one). But if the opponent has played k-1 games, then that opponent must have had their own path of k-1 games. But that would require that the total players is f(k-1) + f(k-2) ?\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let me check with examples.\n\nFor example, when k=1, the minimal players is 2. Which is Fib(3)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by potential opponents.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. The idea is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, which corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This approach leverages the fact that each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games that differs by at most one from the winner's current count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    count = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        count += 1\n    return count - 1\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. This is because each game the winner plays requires a structure where the number of players needed grows in a Fibonacci-like manner.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 2) and iteratively generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers until we exceed `n`. The count of these iterations gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` (up to $10^{18}$) without excessive computation time.\n\nThis solution effectively leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the maximum number of games the winner can participate in under the given constraints.",
