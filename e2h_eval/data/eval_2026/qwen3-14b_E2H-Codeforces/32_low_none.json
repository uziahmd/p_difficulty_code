    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the new max and min, and then find the minimum instability. But if we do this naively, it would be O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, what's the original instability? It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nIf the element we remove is not the current max or min, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo the key here is that the optimal removal is either the max, the min, or maybe some other element if there are duplicates. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array has multiple elements with the same value as the current max or min. For example, if there are two max elements. Removing one of them would leave the other as the max, so the instability would be the same as before. So in this case, removing any of them doesn't help. But if there's only one max, then removing it would reduce the max to the next highest value.\n\nSo, the idea is: the minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by either:\n\n- Removing the current maximum, which would make the new max the second maximum. Then the instability is (second_max - min).\n- Removing the current minimum, which would make the new min the second min. Then the instability is (max - second_min).\n- Or, maybe there's a scenario where removing a different element (not the max or min) could help? Like, if there are multiple elements that are max or min. Wait, no. Because if you remove an element that's not the max or min, then the max and min stay the same. So the instability remains the same as original. So the only way to reduce instability is to remove either the max or the min, or maybe if there are duplicates in the max or min.\n\nWait, but suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If you remove 7, the instability becomes 3-1=2. If you remove 1, it becomes 7-3=4. So the best is to remove the max. But in this case, the original max is 7. So the approach would be to check what happens when you remove the max, and when you remove the min, and take the minimum between those two options.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple max elements? Like [7, 7, 3, 1]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove one of the 7s, the new instability is 7-1=6 (since there's still a 7). But if I remove the 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So in this case, the best is to remove the min. So the answer would be min( (original_max - second_min), (second_max - original_min) ) ?\n\nWait, but how do I find the second max and second min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\n- (max of array without the first element) - (min of array without the first element)\n- (max of array without the second element) - (min of array without the second element)\n- ... etc.\n\nBut again, computing this for each element is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nSo, the key insight is that the optimal removal is either the first occurrence of the max, the last occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, or the last occurrence of the min. Or perhaps, the minimal instability is achieved by removing the max or the min, but considering their counts.\n\nWait, but how can we find the minimal instability? Let's think again.\n\nThe original instability is max_a - min_a. If we remove an element that is not the max or the min, then the instability remains the same. Therefore, the only way to get a better instability is to remove either the max or the min. However, if there are multiple max or min elements, removing one of them may not change the overall max or min.\n\nFor example, if the array has multiple max elements. Let's say the array is [5, 5, 5, 5]. Then removing any element leaves",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of the array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Removing an element that is either the maximum or the minimum can potentially reduce this instability.\n2. **Key Insight**: If we remove an element that is not the current maximum or minimum, the instability remains unchanged. Therefore, the optimal approach involves considering the scenarios where we remove the maximum or the minimum value.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: To avoid recalculating the max and min for every possible removal, we can precompute the maximum and minimum values of the array. Then, we consider the cases where we remove the first occurrence of the maximum or the first occurrence of the minimum. This allows us to efficiently compute the resulting instability for these scenarios.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    min_val = min(a)\n    max_val = max(a)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of min and max\n    first_min_idx = a.index(min_val)\n    first_max_idx = a.index(max_val)\n    \n    # Case 1: remove the first min\n    new_max = max(a[:first_min_idx] + a[first_min_idx+1:])\n    new_min = min(a[:first_min_idx] + a[first_min_idx+1:])\n    instability1 = new_max - new_min\n    \n    # Case 2: remove the first max\n    new_max2 = max(a[:first_max_idx] + a[first_max_idx+1:])\n    new_min2 = min(a[:first_max_idx] + a[first_max_idx+1:])\n    instability2 = new_max2 - new_min2\n    \n    # Also consider if there are multiple min or max\n    # Check if there are more than one min or max\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n    \n    if count_min > 1:\n        # Removing a min (not the first one) would still leave another min\n        # So instability would be max_val - min_val (same as original)\n        # So we don't need to consider this case\n        pass\n    if count_max > 1:\n        # Similarly, removing a max (not the first one) leaves another max\n        pass\n    \n    # So the minimal instability is the min between instability1, instability2, and the original instability if we remove a non-extreme element\n    original_instability = max_val - min_val\n    \n    # But when removing a non-extreme element, the instability is same as original_instability\n    # So the minimal possible is the minimum between instability1, instability2, and original_instability\n    # However, if we have multiple min or max, then removing one of them might not change the instability\n    # So we need to check if there are multiple min or max\n    # For example, if count_min >= 2, then removing one min leaves another, so instability is max_val - min_val\n    # Similarly for max\n    # So the minimal instability could be min(original_instability, instability1, instability2)\n    \n    # But in the case when count_min >= 2, then instability1 is (max_val - min_val), since removing one min leaves another\n    # Similarly for count_max >= 2, instability2 is (max_val - min_val)\n    # So the minimal possible is the minimum between instability1, instability2, and original_instability (if it's better)\n    # However, original_instability is the same as when you remove a non-extreme element\n    \n    # Therefore, the answer is the minimum of instability1, instability2, and the original_instability if there are multiple min or max\n    # Wait, but original_instability is the same as the instability if we remove a non-extreme element.
