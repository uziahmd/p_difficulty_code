    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered in some way, maybe we can find a way to check that efficiently.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints on x, y, z. The problem says that x is between A and B, inclusive. Then y is between B and C, inclusive. And z is between C and D, inclusive. Also, the order is x ≤ y ≤ z? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So for example, if B is 2 and C is 3, then y can be 2 or 3. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle sides are such that x ≤ y ≤ z. Oh right! Because x is at most B, and y is at least B. So x ≤ y. And y is at most C, and z is at least C. So y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle has sides x ≤ y ≤ z. \n\nFor a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. Since x ≤ y ≤ z, the condition is x + y > z. Because z is the largest side. So the triangle inequality reduces to x + y > z. \n\nSo our problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z. \n\nBut how do we compute that efficiently? Because the ranges can be up to 5e5, so brute-force checking all possible triples would be O(B*C*D), which is way too slow. We need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. Let's break down the problem into parts. For each possible x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy the conditions. But since z must be ≥ C and ≥ y (since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, but wait y can be up to C. So z is ≥ C and ≥ y? Well, since y is ≤ C and z is ≥ C, then z ≥ C ≥ y. So z is always ≥ y. So for each x and y, z is in [C, D], and also z ≥ y. But since y ≤ C, z is already ≥ C ≥ y. So z can be from C to D. Wait, but y could be larger than C? No, because y is in [B, C]. So y can't be larger than C. Therefore, for each x and y, z is in [C, D], and since y ≤ C ≤ z, z is ≥ y. So the triple (x, y, z) satisfies x ≤ y ≤ z. \n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z. So for each x and y, we need to count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x + y. But since z must also be ≥ C. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. However, this interval must be non-empty. So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y -1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for all x and y?\n\nThe problem is that x ranges from A to B (so up to 5e5 elements), and y ranges from B to C (also up to 5e5 elements). So the total number of (x, y) pairs is O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which for worst case when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5, that would be O( (5e5)^2 ) = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the variables again. For each x and y, the value x + y must be greater than z. Since z is in [C, D], the minimal z is C. So for a given x and y, if x + y > D, then all z's in [C, D] are acceptable. If x + y <= C, then there are no valid z's. Otherwise, the valid z's are from C to (x + y - 1), but not exceeding D. So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) when x + y > C.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], compute how many z's are there in [C, D] such that z < x + y. Which is equivalent to:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nBut how to compute the sum over all x and y of this count_z?\n\nWe need to find for all x and y, the value of count_z, and sum them all.\n\nSo the key is to compute for each x and y, the value of x + y, and then compute how many z's are in [C, D] that are less than x + y.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the variables x and y. Let me denote S = x + y. Then, for each S, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) if S > C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo for each x and y, the contribution is the above value. So the total answer is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) where S = x + y and S > C.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for all possible S, the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to S, multiplied by the corresponding count_z for that S. Then sum over all S.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about possible ranges of S. Since x is between A and B, and y is between B and C. So the minimum S is A + B, and maximum is B + C. So S ranges from S_min = A + B to S_max = B + C.\n\nFor each possible S in this range, we need to calculate:\n\nnumber_of_pairs(S) * count_z(S)\n\nwhere count_z(S) is:\n\nif S > C: min(D, S - 1) - C + 1\n\nelse: 0\n\nBut wait, count_z(S) is for the z's. For example, if S is such that S -1 >= D, then count_z is D - C + 1. If S-1 is between C and D, then it's (S-1 - C + 1) = S - C. If S-1 < C, then zero.\n\nSo for each S, count_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, S - 1 - C + 1 + (C - C ? )) )\n\nWait, perhaps more clearly:\n\ncount_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1) \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nif S - 1 < C → 0\n\nelse:\n\nif S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C.\n\nSo for S such that S > C, count_z(S) is:\n\nif S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → S - C.\n\nBut S - 1 >= D is equivalent to S >= D + 1.\n\nSo for S >= D + 1 → count_z(S) = D - C + 1.\n\nFor C < S <= D → count_z(S) = S - C.\n\nFor S <= C → 0.\n\nSo, the count_z(S) is:\n\nif S > C:\n\n   if S > D → D - C + 1\n\n   else → S - C\n\nelse 0.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for all possible S in [S_min, S_max], the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to S, multiplied by the count_z(S) as above. Then sum all these products.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the range of S: S ranges from A + B to B + C.\n\n2. For each S in this range, compute how many (x, y) pairs exist where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y = S.\n\n3. For each such S, multiply that count by the count_z(S) as described, and sum all these.\n\nThe challenge is step 2: how to compute the number of pairs (x, y) for each S.\n\nSo how can we compute the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to S, where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C].\n\nLet me think of x and y as variables. For each possible x, y can be S - x. But y must be in [B, C], and x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo for a given S, the possible x values are those such that:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\n\nand y = S - x ∈ [B, C]\n\nWhich implies:\n\nB ≤ S - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\nS - C ≤ x ≤ S - B.\n\nAlso, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo combining these constraints:\n\nx must be in [max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)].\n\nBut wait, let's re-derive:\n\ny must be between B and C. So:\n\nB ≤ S - x ≤ C → subtract S from all parts:\n\n-B + S ≥ x ≥ S - C → no, let me do it correctly.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nB ≤ S - x ≤ C → \n\nFirst inequality: S - x ≥ B → x ≤ S - B.\n\nSecond inequality: S - x ≤ C → x ≥ S - C.\n\nSo x must be ≥ S - C and ≤ S - B.\n\nAdditionally, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [S - C, S - B].\n\nSo the lower bound for x is max(A, S - C).\n\nThe upper bound for x is min(B, S - B).\n\nIf the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, then there are no such x's, so the count is zero.\n\nOtherwise, the number of x's is upper - lower + 1.\n\nSo for each S, the number of pairs is max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1).\n\nThis seems manageable. So for each S, we can compute the count_pairs(S) as this value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through all possible S in [S_min, S_max], compute count_pairs(S) and count_z(S), multiply them, and add to the total.\n\nBut what is the range of S? S_min is A + B, S_max is B + C.\n\nThe problem is that S can be up to B + C, which for B and C up to 5e5, can be up to 1e6. So looping from S_min to S_max would take O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the total time complexity would be O(S_max - S_min + 1) = O( (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 ) = O(C - A + 1) = up to 5e5 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute total = 0\n\nfor S in S_min ... S_max:\n\n    compute count_pairs(S) as described.\n\n    compute count_z(S) as described.\n\n    total += count_pairs(S) * count_z(S)\n\nreturn total\n\nSo now, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut first, let's check for some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nS ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5.\n\nSo S can be 3,4,5.\n\nFor each S:\n\nCase S=3:\n\ncount_pairs(S) is the number of (x,y) pairs with x in [1,2], y in [2,3], x + y = 3.\n\nPossible x and y:\n\nx can be 1, then y = 2 (since 1+2=3). y is 2 which is in [2,3].\n\nx can be 2, then y = 1, which is not in [2,3]. So only one pair: (1,2).\n\nBut according to the formula:\n\nlower_x = max(A, S - C) = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(B, S - B) = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2,1) = 1.\n\nso count_pairs is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\ncount_z(S) is for S=3. Since S=3, which is equal to C=3. So S must be > C? No. Because the condition is S > C. So count_z(S) is zero. So this contributes 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nCase S=4:\n\ncount_pairs(S):\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nso count_pairs = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nPossible pairs: x=1, y=3 (sum 4); x=2, y=2 (sum 4).\n\ncount_z(S) is S=4 > C=3. Now, S=4. D=4. So S-1 = 3. So min(D, 3) is 3. So count_z is 3 - 3 + 1 = 1. So 1.\n\nSo contribution is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nCase S=5:\n\ncount_pairs(S):\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5 - 3) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 5 - 2) = min(2, 3) = 2.\n\nso count_pairs = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\nPossible pair: x=2, y=3 (sum 5).\n\ncount_z(S=5): since S=5 > C=3. Now, S-1 =4. D=4. So min(D, 4) is 4. So count_z is 4 - 3 +1 = 2. So 2.\n\nContribution is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nTotal so far is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the first sample output of 4. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: second input is 1 2 2 5. Output is 3.\n\nLet me check.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nS ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4.\n\nSo S can be 3 and 4.\n\nFor S=3:\n\ncount_pairs(S):\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1. So count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z(S=3): since S=3 equals C=2? No, C is 2. So S=3>2. So yes.\n\ncount_z(S=3) is min(5, 3-1) - 2 +1 = min(5, 2) - 2 +1 = 2 -2 +1 = 1. So contribution is 1*1=1.\n\nFor S=4:\n\ncount_pairs(S):\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-2)=2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2. So count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z(S=4) is min(5, 4-1) - 2 +1 = 3 -2 +1=2. So 1 * 2 = 2. Total is 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nAnother sample: third input is 500000 500000 500000 500000. So A=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nS ranges from 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6 to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So only S=1e6.\n\ncount_pairs(S) is:\n\nlower_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5.\n\nupper_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = min(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5. So count_pairs is 1.\n\ncount_z(S=1e6). C=5e5. S=1e6 > C. D=5e5. So S-1 = 999999. min(D, 999999) is 5e5. So count_z is 5e5 - 5e5 +1 = 1. So contribution is 1 * 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to loop through all possible S from S_min to S_max?\n\nBut what if S_min is larger than S_max? Well, since A ≤ B ≤ C, then S_min is A + B, and S_max is B + C. Since A ≤ B ≤ C, then A + B ≤ B + C. So S_min ≤ S_max. So no problem.\n\nNow, for each S in S_min to S_max:\n\nCompute:\n\nlower_x = max(A, S - C)\n\nupper_x = min(B, S - B)\n\nif lower_x > upper_x: count_pairs = 0\n\nelse: count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\nThen compute count_z:\n\nif S <= C: count_z = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    if S - 1 >= D:\n\n        count_z = D - C + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_z = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C\n\nSo, code-wise, for each S:\n\nif S <= C:\n\n    count_z = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    if S - 1 >= D:\n\n        count_z = D - C + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_z = S - C\n\nBut S - 1 >= D is equivalent to S >= D + 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\ncount_z = 0\n\nif S > C:\n\n    if S > D:\n\n        count_z = D - C + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        count_z = S - C\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is to loop through all S from S_min to S_max, compute count_pairs and count_z for each S, multiply and add to total.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of S_max? For B and C up to 5e5, S_max is up to 1e6. So looping from S_min to S_max is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, even 1e6 steps are manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, note that S ranges from A + B to B + C. So:\n\ns_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\nThen for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\nBut for large values of s_max (like 1e6), this is manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases. For example:\n\nCase where S is exactly C + 1. Then S - C is 1, so count_z is 1. Or when S is D + 1, then count_z is D - C + 1.\n\nAnother case: when D < C. But according to the input constraints, C ≤ D. So that's not possible. So C is <= D.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    # compute count_pairs\n\n    lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n        pairs = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n    # compute count_z\n\n    if s > C:\n\n        if s > D:\n\n            z_count = D - C + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            z_count = s - C\n\n    else:\n\n        z_count = 0\n\n    total += pairs * z_count\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the code above, when s is greater than C, but s - 1 is less than C? No. Because s > C implies that s - 1 >= C? No. For example, if s is C + 1, then s - 1 is C. Which is equal to C. So the code for count_z is:\n\nif s > C:\n\n   if s > D: ... else: z_count = s - C.\n\nBut for s > C, then s - C is >= 1 (since s is at least C + 1). So for example, when s = C + 1, then z_count is s - C = 1. Which is correct, because z can be from C to min(D, s-1) = C to C (since s-1 is C). So count is 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 1 2 3 4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3: lower_x = max(1, 3-3=0) → 1. upper_x = min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. pairs = 1. s=3 is not > C (C=3). So z_count is 0. contribution 0.\n\ns=4: lower_x = max(1, 4-3=1) → 1. upper_x = min(2, 4-2=2) → 2. pairs=2. s=4 > C=3. s=4 <= D=4. z_count = 4 - 3 = 1. contribution 2 * 1 = 2.\n\ns=5: lower_x = max(1, 5-3=2) → 2. upper_x = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. pairs=1. s=5 > C=3. s=5 > D=4. z_count is D - C +1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2. contribution 1 * 2 = 2. total is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 1 2 2 5.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 4.\n\ns=3: lower_x = max(1, 3-2=1) → 1. upper_x = min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. pairs=1. s=3>2. z_count is 3-2=1. contribution 1*1=1.\n\ns=4: lower_x = max(1, 4-2=2). upper_x = min(2, 4-2=2). pairs=1. s=4>2. s=4 <= D=5. z_count is 4-2=2. contribution 1*2=2. total 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: A=B=C=D=500000. s_min = 1e6, s_max = 1e6. So s=1e6.\n\nlower_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5. upper_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → 5e5. pairs=1. s=1e6 > C=5e5. s=1e6 > D=5e5. So z_count is D - C +1 = 5e5 - 5e5 +1 =1. total 1*1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when D is very large. For example, A=1, B=1, C=1, D=100. Then s ranges from 2 to 2. s=2.\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2 - 1 =1) → 1. upper_x = min(1, 2 -1=1) → 1. pairs=1. s=2>1. s=2 <= D=100. z_count = 2 -1=1. So total is 1. Which corresponds to (x=1, y=1, z can be from 1 to 100, but since z must be >= C=1. So z can be from 1 to 100. But the condition x + y > z. x + y = 2. So z < 2. So z can be 1. So count_z is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=5. So x can be 1-3, y is 3-3. So y is 3. So x can be 1, 2, 3. For each x, y=3. Then z can be 3-5. For each x, the sum x + y is x + 3. For x=1: sum is 4. So z must be <4. So z can be 3. So count_z is 1. For x=2: sum is 5. z must be <5 → z can be 3,4. count_z is 2. For x=3: sum is 6. z must be <6. So z can be 3,4,5. count_z is 3. So total is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nLet's see what the code does.\n\ns ranges from 1+3=4 to 3+3=6.\n\ns=4: lower_x = max(1, 4 - 3=1) → 1. upper_x = min(3, 4 -3=1) → 1. pairs=1. s=4>3. s=4 <= D=5. count_z=4-3=1. contribution 1*1=1.\n\ns=5: lower_x = max(1, 5-3=2). upper_x = min(3, 5-3=2). pairs=2-2+1=1. count_z: 5-3=2. contribution 1*2=2.\n\ns=6: lower_x = max(1, 6-3=3). upper_x = min(3, 6-3=3). pairs=1. count_z: s=6>3. s=6>5. So count_z is D - C +1 =5-3+1=3. contribution 1*3=3. total is 1+2+3=6. Correct.\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for very large values (up to 1e6), the loop is acceptable. Let's check the constraints.\n\nThe maximum possible s_max is B + C. Since B and C can be up to 5e5, s_max can be up to 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 times. For each iteration, simple calculations. So even in Python, this should be manageable within the time constraints.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input as four integers A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max inclusive:\n\ncompute lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\nupper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\nif lower_x > upper_x: pairs = 0 else pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\nthen compute count_z.\n\nAdd pairs * count_z to total.\n\nFinally, print total.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead input from stdin. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the sample input shows three lines, but the problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers... So the input is one line per test case. However, the sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. But looking at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'] — but that's probably the input for three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the input is one line. However, in the sample input, there are three lines. That's probably because the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is four integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the code should read one line of input. But the sample input shows three lines. But that's probably because the sample input is showing three different test cases, each with their own input line. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). \n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case. However, the problem statement says that the input is four integers. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers. But the sample input shows three lines, which may be three separate test cases. So perhaps the problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple lines, but the actual problem is for a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is one line, but the sample shows three lines. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut this is likely that the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. So this is a contradiction. But looking at the problem's note, it says that the first example's input is '1 2 3 4' and output is 4. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each on a separate line. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, it's clear that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which suggests that the code should process a single test case. But this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is shown as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code should read one line of input. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem may have one. However, the problem's note says that the first example's input is '1 2 3 4', which is one line. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut why does the sample input show three lines? Maybe the sample input is for three test cases, and the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which would imply that the code reads one line.\n\nThis is a critical point. How to proceed?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers. The sample input shows three lines. But the sample output shows three outputs. So perhaps the actual problem is that the code needs to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. For example, the code may be required to read T test cases, but the problem statement doesn't mention that. However, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nBut the problem's input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is just showing three different examples, but the actual code should process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input and output show that for three different inputs, the outputs are given. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which suggests that the code should read a single line of input. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is one line, and the output is one line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line represents a separate test case. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement, the user provided the sample input and output as lists. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nBut in the problem's original statement, the input is four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines, each with four integers, which implies that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must read multiple lines. For example, the first sample input line is '1 2 3 4' and the output is '4'. So the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut for the problem's original input, the code may be expected to read one line. However, given the sample input, it's safer to assume that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So the code should read one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. This is a contradiction. But perhaps the problem's sample input is formatted as a list of inputs, but in reality, the code should process one line.\n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is given as three lines, but the actual problem may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement does not mention that.\n\nThis is a problem. However, looking at the original problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, and the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ must satisfy $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. Given this, $x \\leq y \\leq z$ always holds true.\n2. **Triangle Inequality**: For a non-degenerate triangle with sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the critical condition is $x + y > z$.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible triples $(x, y, z)$, which would be computationally expensive, we use mathematical insights to reduce the complexity:\n   - For each possible sum $S = x + y$, determine the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy $z < S$.\n   - Calculate the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs for each $S$ and multiply by the count of valid $z$ values for that $S$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        total = 0\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            # Calculate number of (x, y) pairs for current s\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                pairs = 0\n            else:\n                pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            \n            # Calculate count_z for current s\n            if s > C:\n                if s > D:\n                    z_count = D - C + 1\n                else:\n                    z_count = s - C\n            else:\n                z_count = 0\n            \n            total += pairs * z_count\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each test case, calculate the minimum and maximum possible sums $S = x + y$, where $x$ ranges from $A$ to $B$ and $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$.\n3. **Valid Pairs Calculation**: For each possible sum $S$, determine the valid range of $x$ values that can form pairs $(x, y)$ such that their sum is $S$.\n4. **Valid $z$ Values Calculation**: For each valid sum $S$, determine how many values of $z$ (within the range $[C, D]$) satisfy $z < S$.\n5. **Total Count**: Multiply the count of valid $(x, y)$ pairs for each $S$ by the count of valid $z$ values and accumulate the total.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by focusing on the sum of $x$ and $y$ and leveraging mathematical properties to avoid brute-force iteration over all possible triples.",
