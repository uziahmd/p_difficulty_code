The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest subsegment in a sequence where changing at most one element can make it strictly increasing. Hmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that for problems involving finding the longest increasing subsegment, there's usually a dynamic programming approach. But here, we have the twist of allowing one change. So how do I incorporate that?\n\nLet me think. For each position, maybe I can track two things: the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at that position without any changes, and with one change. Or maybe something similar.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider for each index i, the maximum length of a subsegment ending at i where there are 0 or 1 changes allowed. Let's think of two arrays:\n\n- dp0[i]: the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with 0 changes (so the subsegment must be strictly increasing as is).\n- dp1[i]: the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with 1 change allowed.\n\nThen, for each i, how do we compute dp0[i] and dp1[i]?\n\nFor dp0[i], it's straightforward. If a[i] > a[i-1], then dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + 1. Otherwise, it's 1 (since the subsegment can only start at i).\n\nFor dp1[i], there are a few possibilities. Either:\n\n1. We use the previous dp1[i-1], and if a[i] > a[i-1], then we can extend it by 1. Because we already had one change before, and now the current element is okay.\n2. Or, we have a situation where the current element is not greater than the previous. Then, we can use the previous dp0[i-1] (which is the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i-1 without any changes) and add 1, because we can change a[i] to something bigger than a[i-1]. Or maybe we can change the previous element? Wait, no, because the change is allowed once. So if the current element is not greater than the previous, but we can change the current element to be larger than the previous. So in that case, the dp1[i] would be dp0[i-1] + 1. But wait, what if the previous dp0[i-1] is longer than the dp1[i-1]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence for dp1[i] is:\n\nIf a[i] > a[i-1], then dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1. But also, maybe there's another scenario where we have a change. Wait, perhaps the dp1[i] can be calculated as follows:\n\ndp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp0[i-1] + 1) if a[i] > a[i-1]? No, maybe not. Wait, let's think again.\n\nThe idea is that for dp1[i], we can have either:\n\n- The previous subsegment with one change, and the current element is larger than the previous. So we can extend it by 1.\n- Or, the previous subsegment was strictly increasing (no changes), and we can change the current element to be larger than the previous. So in this case, the length would be dp0[i-1] + 1.\n\nBut what if the current element is not larger than the previous? Then, we can consider changing the current element. So, for example, if a[i] <= a[i-1], then we can take the dp0[i-1] (the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i-1) and add 1, since we can change a[i] to something larger than a[i-1]. However, that would be allowed as one change. So in this case, dp1[i] would be dp0[i-1] + 1.\n\nBut also, maybe there's another possibility where we change the previous element. Wait, but that's not possible because the dp1[i-1] already accounts for one change. So when considering dp1[i], we can't make another change. So for the current element, the only way to have a change is to change the current element, or possibly the previous one. But how to model that?\n\nHmm. Let me think of the transitions.\n\nFor dp1[i], the maximum length of subsegment ending at i with at most one change.\n\nCase 1: The current element is part of a strictly increasing sequence. So if a[i] > a[i-1], then we can take the dp1[i-1] (which is the length with one change up to i-1) and add 1. Because we can extend it by 1, and no change is needed here.
