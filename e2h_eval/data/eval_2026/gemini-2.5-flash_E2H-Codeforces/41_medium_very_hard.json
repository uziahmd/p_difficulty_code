There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to maximize profit from building houses, given certain height restrictions.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I've got `n` spots, each with a maximum height of `h`. There are `m` restrictions, each stating that within a certain range of spots (`l_j` to `r_j`), the tallest house can't exceed a height of `x_j`. The profit for a house of height `a` is `a^2`. The constraints `n, h, m <= 50` are small, which hints at a polynomial-time solution.\n\nNow, let's analyze those restrictions. Each spot `i` has to obey two rules: its height is less than or equal to the global maximum `h`, AND less than or equal to `x_j` for every restriction that covers spot `i`. This means I need to find the *tightest* restriction for each spot.  I can pre-calculate the maximum allowed height, `max_allowed_height[i]`, for each spot `i`. It's initialized to `h`, and then I iterate through the restrictions. For each restriction, I update `max_allowed_height[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's height `x_j` within that range.  This gives me the *maximum* height I can build a house on spot `i`.\n\nThe key insight is that since the profit function `a^2` is increasing, I should always build the house to its maximum allowed height for each spot. So, for spot `i`, the optimal height is `max_allowed_height[i]`. The total profit is the sum of the squares of these optimal heights across all spots.\n\nI can easily trace this logic. I initialize an array for maximum allowed heights to `h`, go through the restriction, reduce the height where relevant.  I then just square each maximum allowed height.  A quick complexity check shows this is `O(m*n)`, which is fine given the small constraints.\n\nThe code is then quite straightforward. I use Python. I initialize `max_allowed_height`, process restrictions by taking the minimum, calculate the total profit and output. I handle 0-indexing correctly (using `l-1`, `r`). I even consider edge cases and constraints, such as `x_i=0`.  The solution seems robust. The given example matches my logic's output.  Even though the problem is labeled \"very hard\", this seems a standard greedy approach that works.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum profit achievable by building houses on `n` spots. Each house can have an integer height between `0` and `h`. A house of height `a` yields `a^2` dollars profit. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `k`.\n1.  **Global height limit:** The height of any house `height[k]` must be between `0` and `h` (inclusive). So, `height[k] <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions:** For every restriction `j` that covers spot `k` (i.e., `l_j <= k <= r_j`), the height of the house at spot `k` must be at most `x_j`. This is because if `height[k]` were greater than `x_j`, then `height[k]` would be the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` (or one of them), and it would violate the restriction `max(height[p] for p in [l_j, r_j]) <= x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `k`, its height `height[k]` must satisfy:\n`height[k] <= h`\n`height[k] <= x_j` for all restrictions `j` such that `l_j <= k <= r_j`.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `k`, the maximum allowed height, let's call it `max_allowed_height[k]`, is the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions covering spot `k`.\n`max_allowed_height[k] = min(h, min(x_j for all j such that l_j <= k <= r_j))`\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to maximize the profit from each individual house. Since the profit function `a^2` is strictly increasing for `a >= 0`, to maximize `height[k]^2`, we should choose the largest possible integer height for `height[k]`. This means `height[k]` should be set to `max_allowed_height[k]`.\n\nThe problem can be solved with the following greedy approach:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an array, say `max_allowed_height`, of size `n`. Initialize all elements to `h`. This represents the global maximum height limit for each spot before considering any specific restrictions.\n2.  **Process Restrictions:** Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions. For each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\n    For every spot `k` from `l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive), update `max_allowed_height[k] = min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)`. This ensures that each spot's maximum allowed height respects all applicable restrictions.\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit:** After processing all restrictions, iterate through the `max_allowed_height` array. For each spot `k`, its optimal height is `max_allowed_height[k]`. Add `(max_allowed_height[k])^2` to a running total profit.\n4.  **Output:** Print the total profit.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(l=1, r=1, x=1)`\n2. `(l=2, r=2, x=3)`\n3. `(l=3, r=3, x=2)`\n\n1.  **Initialization:** `max_allowed_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3)\n\n2.  **Process Restrictions:**\n    *   Restriction 1 `(1, 1, 1)`: Spot 1 is affected.\n        `max_allowed_height[0] = min(max_allowed_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `max_allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction 2 `(2, 2, 3)`: Spot 2 is affected.\n        `max_allowed_height[1] = min(max_allowed_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `max_allowed_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction 3 `(3, 3, 2)`: Spot 3 is affected.\n        `max_allowed_height[2] = min(max_allowed_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `max_allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit:**\n    *   Spot 1: `height = 1`, profit `1^2 = 1`.\n    *   Spot 2: `height = 3`, profit `3^2 = 9`.\n    *   Spot 3: `height = 2`, profit `2^2 = 4`.\n    Total profit = `1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Initialization: `O(n)`\n    *   Processing `m` restrictions: For each restriction, we iterate through a range of spots. In the worst case, a range can cover all `n` spots. So, `m` restrictions can take `O(m * n)` time.\n    *   Calculating total profit: `O(n)`\n    *   Total time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\n    Given `n, h, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` to store the `max_allowed_height` array. Given `n <= 50`, this is minimal.\n\nThis approach is correct because the decision for each spot's height is independent once its `max_allowed_height` is determined, and the `a^2` profit function encourages taking the maximum possible height.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line of input.\n    # n: number of spots\n    # h: maximum possible height for any house (global upper bound)\n    # m: number of zoning restrictions\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # The list is 0-indexed, so max_allowed_height[0] corresponds to spot 1,\n    # and max_allowed_height[n-1] corresponds to spot n.\n    # Initially, without any specific restrictions, any house can be built up to height 'h'.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the 'm' zoning restrictions.\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read the current restriction: l, r, x.\n        # l: left limit of the restriction (1-indexed)\n        # r: right limit of the restriction (1-indexed)\n        # x: maximum allowed height within the range [l, r]\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply this restriction to all spots within the range [l, r].\n        # In 0-indexed terms for Python lists, this range is from index l-1 to r-1.\n        # Python's range(start, end) iterates from 'start' up to 'end-1'.\n        # So, range(l-1, r) correctly covers indices l-1, l, ..., r-1.\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            # For each spot 'i' in the affected range, its maximum allowed height\n            # must be updated.
