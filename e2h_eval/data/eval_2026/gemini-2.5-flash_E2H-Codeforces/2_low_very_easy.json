Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Crafting the X-Pattern Checker**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to validate if a given character grid forms an \"X\" shape. The grid is `n x n`, and *n* is always odd. I've got this.\n\nMy first thought is to translate the problem description into concrete rules. The essence is: the diagonals are all the same letter, and every other cell is a *different* letter. That means diagonals (where `row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`) must have the same character, `diag_char`, and all other cells must be `other_char`.\n\nLet's represent the grid as a list of lists. I can initialize `diag_char` with `grid[0][0]` and `other_char` with `grid[0][1]`.  The script should handle reading the grid data, of course.\n\nThe core algorithm will involve a series of checks. First, `diag_char` and `other_char` *must* be different. If they are the same, it's an immediate \"NO.\" Then, I'll iterate through each cell. For each cell, I'll determine if it's on a diagonal using `r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`. If it *is* on a diagonal, I verify its character matches `diag_char`.  Otherwise, it must match `other_char`.  If any check fails, the script immediately prints \"NO\" and exits. If the entire grid is checked without issues, it prints \"YES.\"\n\nI've got a solid plan here. I'm going to quickly translate this logic into a Python script and test it thoroughly. I am pretty confident. It's a straightforward approach, and I can easily expand the tests to demonstrate edge cases or larger grid sizes.\n",
