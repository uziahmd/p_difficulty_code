There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Games in a Tennis Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem about a tennis tournament. The goal is to figure out the most games the winner can play given this weird rule: players can only compete if their game counts are within one of each other.  It’s a knockout tournament, so each game eliminates someone.\n\nI started by thinking about how to build this tournament to squeeze out as many games for the champion as possible.  I realized the winner, let's call them W, has to keep finding opponents. Let's say W has won *k* games. The rule means W's next opponent, O, has to have won either *k-1*, *k*, or *k+1* games. But if we are maximizing W's games, then O must have played either *k* or *k-1* games.\n\nI defined *f(k)* as the minimum number of players needed to get a winner who has played *k* games.  That seemed like a useful approach: trying to construct the tournament from the ground up to minimize the player pool needed, since we have a fixed total number of players (*n*). I tried to track how many players were at each \"level\" – how many had played the same number of games. I tried building up the tournament structure, thinking about the implications of the \"within one game\" rule, but that was getting really messy.\n\nThen I realized this is a binary tree structure.  Each internal node is a game, and the leaves are the original players.  The winner is the root. I started trying to find a pattern for how to play the optimal games. That's when it hit me: the tournament's structure kind of resembles the Fibonacci sequence!\n\nIf the winner has won *k* games, to add a *k+1* game, the winner can fight an opponent who won *k-1* or *k* games. If the goal is minimizing the required players, then playing a player who also won *k* games will be a waste of extra resources. This reduces to *k-1*.  My intuition and my calculations pointed to Fibonacci numbers, with a slight offset. If *F(k)* is the number of players needed for the winner to play *k* games, it turned out that *F(k) = Fib(k+2)* (shifted by two).\n\nNow the problem is straightforward. I need to find the largest *k* for which *Fib(k+2)* is less than or equal to *n*. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so I can use an iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers until one exceeds *n*. The answer is then *k*, as *k+2* exceeded *n*.\n\nI finally tested my logic with a few examples and implemented the algorithm. The tricky part was initially deriving the Fibonacci sequence relationship from the problem's rules.  That \"within one game\" restriction was the key!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue participating.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's establish the base cases for `F(k)`:\n- `F(0)`: A player has played 0 games. This requires 1 player (the player themselves). So, `F(0) = 1`.\n- `F(1)`: For a player (let's call them the \"winner\") to play 1 game, they must play against an opponent. Both players start with 0 games played. The winner (0 games) plays an opponent (0 games). The winner wins, having played 1 game. This requires 2 players in total. So, `F(1) = 2`.\n\nNow, let's derive a recurrence for `F(k)` for `k >= 2`.\nSuppose the winner has already played `k-1` games and won them all. To play their `k`-th game, they need an opponent. Let the winner be `P_W` (who has played `k-1` games) and the opponent be `P_O` (who has played `g_O` games).\nAccording to the rule, the absolute difference in games played must be no more than one: `abs((k-1) - g_O) <= 1`.\nThis means `g_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nHowever, `P_O` cannot have played `k` games and won, because `P_W` has only won `k-1` games so far. If `P_O` had `k` wins, `P_O` would be \"ahead\" of `P_W` in terms of games won, which is not how we construct the winner's path to maximize their games. So, `g_O` can only be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n\nWe have two options for `P_O`'s games played:\n\n1.  **`P_O` has played `k-1` games:**\n    `P_W` (k-1 games) plays `P_O` (k-1 games). Both players have won `k-1` games.\n    To produce `P_W` (k-1 games) requires `F(k-1)` initial players.\n    To produce `P_O` (k-1 games) requires another `F(k-1)` initial players.\n    The total initial players for this option would be `F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)`.\n\n2.  **`P_O` has played `k-2` games:**\n    `P_W` (k-1 games) plays `P_O` (k-2 games).\n    To produce `P_W` (k-1 games) requires `F(k-1)` initial players.\n    To produce `P_O` (k-2 games) requires `F(k-2)` initial players.\n    The total initial players for this option would be `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n\nTo find the *minimum* number of players `F(k)`, we choose the option that requires fewer initial players.\nLet's compare `2 * F(k-1)` and `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\nSince `F(j)` is always positive and strictly increasing for `j >= 1` (e.g., `F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3`), we know `F(k-2) < F(k-1)` for `k >= 2`.\nTherefore, `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` is always less than `2 * F(k-1)`.\nSo, the optimal strategy to minimize the number of initial players for a winner to play `k` games is to have the winner (who has played `k-1` games) play an opponent who has played `k-2` games.\n\nThis gives us the recurrence relation:\n`F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the first few values:\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence shifted. If `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, ...`, then `F(k) = Fib(k+2)`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\nGiven `n` up to `10^18`, we can iteratively calculate Fibonacci numbers until `F(k)` exceeds `n`. The largest `k` for which `F(k) <= n` will be our answer.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `f_prev = 1` (representing `F(0)`).\n2. Initialize `f_curr = 2` (representing `F(1)`).\n3. Initialize `games = 1` (representing the number of games played by the winner for `f_curr`).\n4. Loop while `f_curr <= n`:\n   a. Calculate `f_next = f_prev + f_curr`.\n   b. Update `f_prev = f_curr`.\n   c. Update `f_curr = f_next`.\n   d. Increment `games` by 1.\n5. When the loop terminates, `f_curr` is the first value in the sequence `F(k)` that is greater than `n`. The `games` variable will hold the index `k` for this `f_curr`. Therefore, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `games - 1`.\n\n**Example Trace (n=10):**\n- Initial: `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `games = 1`\n- Iteration 1: `f_curr (2) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `f_next = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  - `f_prev = 2`\n  - `f_curr = 3`\n  - `games = 2`\n- Iteration 2: `f_curr (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `f_next = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `f_prev = 3`\n  - `f_curr = 5`\n  - `games = 3`\n- Iteration 3: `f_curr (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `f_next = 3 + 5 = 8`\n  - `f_prev = 5`\n  - `f_curr = 8`\n  - `games = 4`\n- Iteration 4: `f_curr (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n  - `f_next = 5 + 8 = 13`\n  - `f_prev = 8`\n  - `f_curr = 13`\n  - `games = 5`\n- Iteration 5: `f_curr (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Result: `games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output for `n=10`. The approach is efficient as Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will not exceed approximately 90 for `n=10^18`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the large numbers without overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # F(k) represents the minimum number of players required for a winner to play k games.\n    # Base cases:\n    # F(0) = 1 (1 player, 0 games played)\n    # F(1) = 2 (2 players, winner plays 1 game.
