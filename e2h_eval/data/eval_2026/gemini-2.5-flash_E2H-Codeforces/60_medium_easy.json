Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Solving the Morse Code Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving Morse code sequences.  The goal is to count the distinct English letter sequences that can be formed as substrings of an evolving binary string `S`.  `S` grows character by character ('0' or '1'), and after each addition, we need to report the running count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic Morse code representation.  Each letter maps to a dot ('0') or dash ('1') sequence of length 1 to 4. There are some invalid codes to exclude. My task is to determine how many unique letter sequences can be constructed from the substrings of `S`. A sequence of letters is valid if the Morse codes of its constituent letters can be concatenated to create some substring within `S`.\n\nAt first glance, this screams dynamic programming. I thought about `dp[i]` representing the number of ways to parse a substring ending at index `i`. But, that only accounts for single substrings.  I need to consider *all* possible substrings.  The problem asks for *distinct* sequences, and that complicates things.\n\nIt quickly dawned on me that I need to efficiently identify *unique* sequences rather than just counting the number of ways to parse. Storing actual sequences would be too memory-intensive. I need a more numerical DP approach.\n\nI then thought about how the answer evolves with each new character appended.  I'm trying to figure out how many distinct sequences are newly created with each addition.  I know that at each step, a new substring is added. The idea is to keep track of the count for the entire string.\n\nThe real challenge is identifying what is a \"new sequence.\"  If a sequence is already formed by some prefix, we shouldn't recount it. The substrings will overlap. This is the crux of the problem: efficiently managing sequence uniqueness. I'm wondering if a `set` to store sequences is needed. Storing sequences directly could be unwieldy.\n\nI'm starting to think about breaking down each added character. My focus now is on what *new* sequences are created by a new character append. I should calculate the combinations for a new character based on the current string. For substrings ending in the character, I think a dynamic programming approach can solve the set of combinations of that sequence. I am starting to think that counting the ways to parse a single string into sequences might be a starting point and build the answer based on that. I want to build a table of combinations but avoid storing the combinations themselves.\n\nThis looks like a standard DP plus careful handling of \"uniqueness.\" The core is to efficiently track how the set of possible sequences grows with each append. It seems there is something that would work like this. The set will update each time a new character is added and all the substring combinations are computed. I think I have it. I need to test this hypothesis.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing *any* substring of a given string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending one character ('0' or '1') at a time, and we need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nLet's first understand the Morse code rules:\n*   '0' represents a dot, '1' represents a dash.\n*   Morse code representations of English letters have lengths from 1 to 4.\n*   There are 30 possible strings of length 1 to 4.\n*   26 of these correspond to distinct English letters.\n*   The 4 invalid strings are: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nThe core challenge is to count *distinct* sequences of letters. For example, if \"1\" maps to 'T', \"11\" maps to 'M', and \"111\" maps to 'O':\n*   Substring \"1\" can be parsed as 'T'. Sequence: (\"T\").\n*   Substring \"11\" can be parsed as 'M'. Sequence: (\"M\").\n*   Substring \"11\" can also be parsed as \"1\" + \"1\", which is 'T' + 'T'. Sequence: (\"T\", \"T\").\n*   Substring \"111\" can be parsed as 'O'. Sequence: (\"O\").\n*   Substring \"111\" can also be parsed as \"1\" + \"11\", which is 'T' + 'M'. Sequence: (\"T\", \"M\").\n*   Substring \"111\" can also be parsed as \"11\" + \"1\", which is 'M' + 'T'. Sequence: (\"M\", \"T\").\n*   Substring \"111\" can also be parsed as \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\", which is 'T' + 'T' + 'T'. Sequence: (\"T\", \"T\", \"T\").\n\nIf `S = \"111\"`, the set of distinct sequences is {(\"T\"), (\"M\"), (\"T\", \"T\"), (\"O\"), (\"T\", \"M\"), (\"M\", \"T\"), (\"T\", \"T\", \"T\")}. The count is 7.\n\nA naive approach of storing all sequences in a Python `set` would be too slow and memory-intensive, as sequences can be tuples of characters, and there could be many unique sequences. The maximum length of `S` is 3000.\n\nWe need a dynamic programming approach that counts the number of distinct sequences directly.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing any substring of `S` that *ends at index `i-1`*.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, increasing its length from `N-1` to `N`:\nThe new character is `S[N-1]`.\nWe need to find all distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[k:N]` for `0 <= k < N`.\nThese new sequences are formed by appending a Morse code character to an existing sequence.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing *any substring of `S` ending at index `i-1`*.\nThis is still problematic because `dp[i]` needs to store the actual sequences to ensure distinctness.\n\nA better approach is to use polynomial hashing for sequences.\nEach English letter can be assigned a unique small integer ID (e.g., 'A'=1, 'B'=2, ..., 'Z'=26).\nA sequence of letters `L_1, L_2, ..., L_k` can then be represented as a tuple of integers `(id(L_1), id(L_2), ..., id(L_k))`.\nTo hash this tuple, we can use a polynomial hash: `H = (id(L_1) * P^(k-1) + id(L_2) * P^(k-2) + ... + id(L_k) * P^0) mod M`.\nTo reduce collisions, we can use two different prime moduli `M1`, `M2` and two different bases `P1`, `P2`. A sequence is uniquely identified by the pair of hashes `(H1, H2)`.\n\nLet `S_current` be the string of length `N`.\nWe need to calculate `total_distinct_sequences` for `S_current`.\nThis `total_distinct_sequences` is the size of the union of all `f(substring)` for all substrings.\nThis is equivalent to `| union_{i=0 to N-1} (union_{j=0 to i} f(S_current[j:i+1])) |`.\nLet `current_total_sequences` be a `set` of `(hash1, hash2)` pairs representing all distinct sequences found so far.\n\nWhen `S_current` grows from length `N-1` to `N` by appending `char_N_minus_1`:\nWe need to consider all substrings ending at index `N-1`. These are `S_current[N-1:N]`, `S_current[N-2:N]`, `S_current[N-3:N]`, `S_current[N-4:N]`.\nFor each such substring `sub = S_current[j:N]`:\n  We need to find all sequences `seq` that `sub` can represent.\n  A sequence `seq = (L_1, ..., L_p)` is formed by `sub` if `sub` can be parsed as `M_1 ... M_p` where `M_x` is the Morse code for `L_x`.\n  This means `M_p` is `S_current[k:N]` for some `k`, and `(L_1, ..., L_{p-1})` is represented by `S_current[j:k]`.\n\nLet `dp_sub[p]` be a set of `(hash1, hash2)` pairs representing distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `sub[0...p-1]`.\n`dp_sub[0]` contains the hash of an empty sequence (e.g., `(0,0)`).\nFor `p` from 1 to `len(sub)`:\n  `dp_sub[p]` is initialized as an empty set.\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `p - L >= 0`:\n      `morse_code = sub[p-L : p]`\n      If `morse_code` is a valid Morse code for some letter `char_L` (with ID `id_L`):\n        For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp_sub[p-L]`:\n          Calculate new hashes: `new_h1 = (h1 * P1 + id_L) % M1`, `new_h2 = (h2 * P2 + id_L) % M2`.\n          Add `(new_h1, new_h2)` to `dp_sub[p]`.\nAfter computing `dp_sub[len(sub)]`, add all its elements to `current_total_sequences`.\nThe final answer for `S_current` is `len(current_total_sequences)`.\n\nThe maximum length of `sub` is 4. So `dp_sub` will have at most 5 states (`dp_sub[0]` to `dp_sub[4]`).\nThe number of sequences for a substring of length `k` is `P[k]`, where `P[k] = P[k-1] + P[k-2] + P[k-3] + P[k-4]` (if all codes are valid). `P[0]=1, P[1]=1, P[2]=2, P[3]=4, P[4]=8`.\nSo `dp_sub[p]` will contain at most 8 hash pairs.\nThis calculation for each `sub` is very fast.\n\nThe state `current_total_sequences` will store hashes of all distinct sequences found from *all* substrings up to the current `N`.\nThe total number of sequences can be large.\n`M = 3000`. At each step, we process up to 4 substrings. Each substring adds at most 8 sequences.\nSo, at each step, we add at most `4 * 8 = 32` new hash pairs to `current_total_sequences`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences could be `3000 * 32 = 96000`. A `set` of this size is manageable.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `current_total_sequences = set()`.\n2.  Initialize `S = \"\"`.\n3.  Precompute valid Morse codes and their corresponding letter IDs.\n    *   `morse_to_id`: a dictionary mapping valid Morse strings to integer IDs (1-26).\n    *   `INVALID_MORSE = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n4.  Choose two large prime moduli `M1 = 10^9 + 7`, `M2 = 10^9 + 9` (or any other large primes).\n5.  Choose two bases `P1 = 31`, `P2 = 37` (or any other primes larger than max letter ID).\n6.  For each of `m` input characters:\n    a.  Append the new character `c` to `S`. Let `N` be the new length of `S`.\n    b.  Iterate `j` from `max(0, N-4)` to `N-1`. This `j` is the starting index of a new substring ending at `N-1`.\n        i.  `sub = S[j:N]`.\n        ii. Initialize `dp_sub[0] = {(0, 0)}` (hash for empty sequence).\n        iii. For `p` from 1 to `len(sub)`:\n            *   `dp_sub[p] = set()`.\n            *   For `L` from 1 to 4:\n                *   If `p - L >= 0`:\n                    *   `morse_part = sub[p-L : p]`\n                    *   If `morse_part` is in `morse_to_id`:\n                        *   `id_L = morse_to_id[morse_part]`\n                        *   For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp_sub[p-L]`:\n                            *   `new_h1 = (h1 * P1 + id_L) % M1`\n                            *   `new_h2 = (h2 * P2 + id_L) % M2`\n                            *   Add `(new_h1, new_h2)` to `dp_sub[p]`.\n        iv. Add all `(h1, h2)` pairs from `dp_sub[len(sub)]` to `current_total_sequences`.\n    c.  Print `len(current_total_sequences)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. (Note: `len` returns an integer, which is implicitly modulo `10^9+7` if it's less than `10^9+7`.
