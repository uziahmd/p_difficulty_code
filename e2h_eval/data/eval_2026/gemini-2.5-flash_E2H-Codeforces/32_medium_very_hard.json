Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Competitive Programming Challenge: Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. The core idea is to find the smallest range (max - min) we can get in an array *after* chucking out exactly one element. To start, I'm thinking about the original array, call it 'a', and its sorted version, 'a_sorted'.  Instability here is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.\n\nThe sorted array gives me the easy access to the max and min, `s_n` and `s_1` respectively.  Now, the plan is to figure out which element to remove to minimize this instability. Intuitively, I need to either shrink the max or increase the min.\n\nIf I remove the smallest element, `s_1`, the new min becomes the next smallest number, `s_2`, and the max stays as `s_n`. The instability is `s_n - s_2`.  If I chuck out the largest element, `s_n`, the new max is `s_{n-1}`, and the min is still `s_1`. That gives me `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n\nWhat if I remove any other element?  Well, then, both the overall min and max of the array remain unchanged, so the instability will stay the same as in the original array (`s_n - s_1`). This means removing any element except the absolute max or min doesn't reduce the instability. So I only have to compare these two scenarios, removing either `s_1` or `s_n`.\n\nMy algorithm is basically this: Sort the array, then calculate the instability for the two cases (removing smallest or largest element), and pick the smaller of those two results.\n\nLet's test this with an example. Alright, with the array `[1, 3, 3, 7]`, removing `1` gives a range of `4`, and removing `7` gives a range of `2`. In this instance, removing `7` is best, and my algorithm gets that.\n\nIt seems to work! I'm confident that this approach will lead to the minimal instability and it looks to be an efficient `O(n log n)` solution due to the initial sort.  Okay, I think I've got this one figured out. Let's code it up!\n",
