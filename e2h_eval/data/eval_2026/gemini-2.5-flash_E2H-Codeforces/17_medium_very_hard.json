He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my thought process for a solution:**\n\nThe user wants me to tackle a tricky competitive programming puzzle. I need to figure out, for a given set of strings, whether each string is a prefix or a suffix of some unknown larger string. The trick is that I'm only given *improper* prefixes and suffixes, meaning they are shorter than the full string. I'm given all the prefixes and suffixes of length 1 up to *n-1*, but not the full string itself.\n\nMy first thought is that the lengths of the given strings are critical. I know that for each length *k* from 1 to *n-1*, I have exactly two strings in the input. One of these strings will be the prefix of length *k* from the original string *s*, and the other will be the suffix of length *k*. The puzzle is to determine which is which. The length of the original string *s* is unknown, but represented by *n*.\n\nI realized that the two strings of length *n-1* are the key. One is *s* without its last character (prefix), and the other is *s* without its first character (suffix).  I can uniquely reconstruct *s* if I know which is which by appending the last character of one to the other, making sure the common substring of length *n-2* (the middle of the original string) matches.\n\nIf I take the strings of length *n-1* and I can identify the prefix and suffix, I can use that to check if the rest of the given strings are prefixes and suffixes of the constructed string. If I check for consistency and find it is the valid string, I am confident I can correctly identify each input string as a prefix or suffix.\n\nI worked through two possibilities. The one with a correct common substring, if checked, means the reconstruction of the string, and identification of all other inputs as prefixes and suffixes.\n\nHere's my general approach:\n\n1.  Read in all the strings and keep track of their original order. Organize these by length to make checking easier.\n2.  Identify the two strings of length *n-1*. These are the candidates for the (n-1) length prefix and suffix.\n3.  Check both configurations (the prefix can be the first of these two, or the second, and then the suffix as the other string, in turn).\n4.  Reconstruct the full string from the prefix and suffix candidate strings, using the guaranteed condition that the common string matches.\n5.  Check if this constructed string *s* is valid: For all remaining input strings, determine if they are prefixes or suffixes of my constructed string. I keep track of which strings, by their original index, are identified as prefixes or suffixes.\n6.  If I can classify all the strings and find consistency, then I've got the answer.  If not, I try the other ordering of the two length-*n-1* strings.\n\nMy code will first focus on the edge case, if there is one. Since the original string has length *n* and the prefix and suffix of length n-1, there would be two strings of length 1, if n > 2. If it works, it prints the answer. I then run through the string length check and verification. If, during the process, I can no longer form a string, it returns `None`.\n\nI'm confident in this approach.  The guarantees in the problem description (there is exactly one answer) makes me think that, even if I have to try both length-*n-1* orderings, I'll arrive at the correct classification. The code seems efficient; it runs in at most *O(n^2)* time which is very fast for the problem constraints. I tested it against the provided examples, and it correctly output the desired results.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to reconstruct the classification of `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are given that there are exactly two strings for each length from `1` to `n-1`, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nThe core idea is to first determine the original string `s`. Once `s` is known, we can easily generate all its prefixes and suffixes and then match them against the input strings to produce the 'P'/'S' sequence.\n\nHow to determine `s`?\nThe key insight lies with the strings of length `n-1`. There are two such strings in the input. Let's call them `str_A` and `str_B`.\nOne of these must be the prefix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[0:n-1]`), and the other must be the suffix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[1:n]`).\n\nLet `P_{n-1}` denote `s[0:n-1]` and `S_{n-1}` denote `s[1:n]`.\nThe full string `s` can be reconstructed from `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` in two ways:\n1. `s = P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[n-2]` (where `S_{n-1}[n-2]` is the last character of `s`, which is also the last character of `S_{n-1}`).\n2. `s = P_{n-1}[0] + S_{n-1}` (where `P_{n-1}[0]` is the first character of `s`, which is also the first character of `P_{n-1}`).\nFor these to be consistent, the substring `s[1:n-1]` must be the same. This means `P_{n-1}[1:n-1]` must be equal to `S_{n-1}[0:n-2]`.\n\nThere are two possibilities for assigning `str_A` and `str_B` to `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\nAssume `P_{n-1} = str_A` and `S_{n-1} = str_B`.\nWe check if `str_A[1:n-1] == str_B[0:n-2]`.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string `s_cand_1 = str_A + str_B[n-2]`.\nThen, we proceed to verify if `s_cand_1` is consistent with *all* the given `2n-2` input strings.\n\n**Possibility 2:**\nAssume `P_{n-1} = str_B` and `S_{n-1} = str_A`.\nWe check if `str_B[1:n-1] == str_A[0:n-2]`.\nIf this condition holds, we can form a candidate string `s_cand_2 = str_B + str_A[n-2]`.\nThen, we proceed to verify if `s_cand_2` is consistent with *all* the given `2n-2` input strings.\n\nThe problem guarantees that a consistent answer exists, meaning at least one of these possibilities will lead to a valid `s`. We can try Possibility 1 first, and if it yields a valid solution, print it and exit. Otherwise, try Possibility 2.\n\n**Verification Process (`verify` function):**\nGiven a candidate string `s_cand` and the grouped input strings:\n1. Generate all true prefixes of `s_cand`: `P_k = s_cand[0:k]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n2. Generate all true suffixes of `s_cand`: `S_k = s_cand[n-k:n]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n3. Initialize an `ans_chars` list of size `2n-2` to store 'P' or 'S' for each original input string.\n4. For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n   a. Retrieve the two input strings of length `k` along with their original indices: `(str_k_1, idx_k_1)` and `(str_k_2, idx_k_2)`.\n   b. Compare these two input strings with `P_k` and `S_k` from `s_cand`:\n      i. If `str_k_1 == P_k` and `str_k_2 == S_k`: Assign `ans_chars[idx_k_1] = 'P'` and `ans_chars[idx_k_2] = 'S'`.\n      ii. Else if `str_k_1 == S_k` and `str_k_2 == P_k`: Assign `ans_chars[idx_k_1] = 'S'` and `ans_chars[idx_k_2] = 'P'`.\n      iii. Else (neither combination matches): `s_cand` is not a valid original string. Return `None`.\n5. If the loop completes successfully for all `k`, then `s_cand` is valid. Return `ans_chars`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the `2n-2` input strings. Store them in a list `all_input_strings` along with their original indices. Also, group them by length into a dictionary `strings_by_length = {length: [(string, index), ...], ...}`.\n3. Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from `strings_by_length[n-1]`. Let them be `(str_A, idx_A)` and `(str_B, idx_B)`.\n4. **Attempt Possibility 1:**\n   If `str_A[1:n-1] == str_B[0:n-2]` (handling `n=2` correctly where these slices are empty strings):\n     Construct `s_cand_1 = str_A + str_B[n-2]`.\n     Call `result = verify(s_cand_1, strings_by_length, n)`.\n     If `result` is not `None`, print `\"\".join(result)` and terminate.\n5. **Attempt Possibility 2:**\n   If `str_B[1:n-1] == str_A[0:n-2]`:\n     Construct `s_cand_2 = str_B + str_A[n-2]`.\n     Call `result = verify(s_cand_2, strings_by_length, n)`.\n     If `result` is not `None`, print `\"\".join(result)` and terminate.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Reading input and grouping strings: `O(N * L)` where `N = 2n-2` is the number of strings and `L = n-1` is max string length. So `O(n^2)`.\n- The `verify` function iterates `n-1` times. Inside the loop, string comparisons take `O(L)` time. So `O(n * L) = O(n^2)`.\n- The main logic calls `verify` at most twice.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n^2)`. Given `n <= 100`, this is `100^2 = 10000` operations, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Store strings grouped by length, preserving original index\n    # strings_by_length[length] = [(string, original_index), (string, original_index)]\n    strings_by_length = {length: [] for length in range(1, n)}\n\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s_i = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        strings_by_length[len(s_i)].append((s_i, i))\n\n    # Identify the two strings of length n-1\n    # These must be the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1\n    str_n_minus_1_a, idx_a = strings_by_length[n - 1][0]\n    str_n_minus_1_b, idx_b = strings_by_length[n - 1][1]\n\n    # Try two possibilities for the original string s\n    # Possibility 1: str_n_minus_1_a is P_{n-1} and str_n_minus_1_b is S_{n-1}\n    # s = P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[n-2]\n    # Condition for consistency: P_{n-1}[1:n-1] == S_{n-1}[0:n-2] (common substring s[1:n-1])\n    \n    # Check if the common part matches for Candidate 1\n    # For n=2, n-1=1, n-2=0.
