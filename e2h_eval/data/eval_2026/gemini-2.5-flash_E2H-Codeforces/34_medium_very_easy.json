And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my approach to solving it:**\n\nMy goal is to efficiently calculate the average sleep time across all possible \"weeks\" (consecutive `k` days) from a given sleep record of `n` days. The key is to avoid redundant calculations that would lead to a slow, `O(n*k)` solution.\n\nI know I can represent the sleep times as a list `a = [a1, a2, ..., an]`.  I need to find all possible `k`-day \"weeks\" and sum their sleep times. Then, I'll divide this total sum by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nThe initial approach seems straightforward: calculate the sum for each week and add them up. A naive approach of doing this `n-k+1` times, summing `k` elements at each iteration, would be `O(n*k)`. This would be too slow, especially if `k` is close to `n`.\n\nThen the brilliant idea hit me: **sliding window**. Instead of re-calculating the sum for each new window from scratch, I can reuse the previous sum and only update it with a single addition and subtraction. This reduces each calculation to `O(1)`.\n\nHere's how this sliding window works:\n1.  Calculate the initial sum for the first `k` days (`a1` to `ak`).\n2.  For each subsequent \"week,\" I subtract the first element of the previous week and add the next element (the one \"entering\" the current week). This updates the window sum in constant time.\n3.  I keep a running total of all window sums.\n4.  Finally, I divide by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to find the average.\n\nThe loop will run from `i = 1` to `n - k`. `i` will be used as the starting index of each subsequent week. Each subsequent window will be derived from the previous one, and the total sum will be incremented.\n\nI need to make sure the loop is correctly handling the array indices, and it's easy to make an off-by-one error. The initial window is `a[0:k]`. If I start from the `1st` element, the index has to shift. I need to remove `a[i-1]` and add `a[i+k-1]`. I'll run through a few examples to confirm the loop boundaries and index calculations are accurate.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   If `k = n`, there's only one \"week,\" which is the entire sleep record. This simplifies the problem significantly. I only need to sum the list and divide by one.\n*   If `k = 1`, each day is considered a \"week.\" So, I'm simply averaging all the sleep times. This also is straightforward.\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe constraints are reasonable: `1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and the sleep times are integers between 1 and 10^5.  I need to make sure my intermediate sums and the final average don't overflow. I can use the standard float division in Python for accuracy up to the required 6 decimal places. The sliding window approach has a time complexity of `O(n)`, which will be efficient enough for this `n` size. The space complexity is also `O(1)` as I only store a few variables, so it's efficient too.\n\nI'm confident in this sliding window strategy. Let me implement this in Python. I'll read in the input `n`, `k`, and the sleep times list `a`. Then, I'll initialize the `current_window_sum` with the sum of the first `k` elements. I'll use a `for` loop for sliding the window, updating the `current_window_sum` in each iteration, adding it to a `total_sum_of_all_weeks`, and finally calculating and printing the average with the required formatting. I will use `sys.stdin.readline` for faster I/O.\n",
