The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.

The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Understanding the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a tricky competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the probability of a \"valid\" radio tower setup, specifically the probability, modulo 998244353, that we can arrange the signal powers of the towers such that everyone gets coverage and no one gets overloaded.\n\nHere's the setup: we have towns numbered 0 to n+1 in a line. We build towers in towns 1 to n randomly with probability 1/2 each. Each tower has a power level between 1 and n. A tower's signal covers a range around it, and the power determines that range.\n\nThe rules: Town 0 and n+1 must *not* receive any signal. Every town from 1 to n *must* get a signal from *exactly* one tower. No signal overlap, but all towns 1 through n are covered.\n\nMy initial thoughts are focused on the conditions: The range of each tower must make sure that it does not cover 0 and n+1, which gives an upper bound on its power. Then, there's the critical \"exact coverage\" condition. It means the coverage intervals from all the towers form a partition of the towns 1 to n. The main challenge is to formulate this partition in terms of constraints.\n\nI need to find a suitable mathematical representation for these coverage intervals. My thought is that the towers must form a partitioning, with each town 1...n being covered by exactly one tower. I start by considering an interval for each tower i with power p_i, [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]. Also, the maximum power for any tower depends on its position to respect the condition on towns 0 and n+1.\n\nIf towers exist in positions s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, then the intervals must be non-overlapping and together they form the set 1...n. It is equivalent to a sequence of intervals [L_j, R_j] such that L_1=1, R_k=n, and R_j+1 = L_{j+1}. The tower position must be the center of its range. Hence, 2*s_j = L_j + L_{j+1}. I express the power for a given tower as p_{s_j} = (R_j - L_j + 1)/2. However, I need to make the parities compatible, so that all numbers are integers.\n\nI have a key insight: if we find the split points between the intervals that each tower covers, the towers and their powers are completely defined. I denote these split points by L_0, L_1, ..., L_{k+1} where L_0=0 and L_{k+1} = n+1. For each j, L_j and L_{j+1} have different parities. In addition, the parity of n and k need to match.\n\nThe core of the problem then becomes counting these valid sequences of L values. Since the power assigned for any tower uniquely determines its associated coverage, the problem reduces to the number of valid L_i sequences, then the towers built in those positions, and lastly multiply this probability for each choice for each town (1/2 if built, 1/2 if not). This is the key insight that lets me make progress. Now it is a sequence/partition counting problem.\n\nThe problem comes down to counting all sequences that have alternating parity and such that each town gets covered by exact coverage from one tower. This should translate into counting the number of valid sequences of L's. The probability for any given placement (and signal assignment) is the chance of having towers built in the correct locations (each 1/2). This will ultimately be the formula.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, after building radio towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ (each with probability $1/2$), we can assign signal powers $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to the built towers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a power $p_i$. A tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p_i$, i.e., $i-p_i+1 \\le c \\le i+p_i-1$.\n\n**Condition 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.**\n*   For town $0$: $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n*   For town $n+1$: $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nCombining these, for any tower at $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This also implies that the covered interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must be contained within $[1, n]$.\n\n**Condition 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower each.**\nThis means the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet the towns where towers are built be $s_1 < s_2 < \\dots < s_k$.\nLet $L_j = s_j - p_{s_j} + 1$ and $R_j = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1$ be the start and end points of the interval covered by tower $s_j$.\nFor a valid partition:\n*   $L_1 = 1$.\n*   $R_k = n$.\n*   For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $R_j + 1 = L_{j+1}$ (intervals are adjacent and non-overlapping).\n\nFrom $L_j = s_j - p_{s_j} + 1$ and $R_j = s_j + p_{s_j} - 1$, we can express $s_j$ and $p_{s_j}$ in terms of $L_j$ and $R_j$:\n$s_j = (L_j + R_j)/2$\n$p_{s_j} = (R_j - L_j + 1)/2$\n\nFor $s_j$ to be an integer, $L_j + R_j$ must be even, meaning $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$, this implies $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}-1$ must have the same parity, or $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\n\nLet's define $L_0=0$ and $L_{k+1}=n+1$. The set of towns $1, \\dots, n$ is covered by intervals $[L_j, L_{j+1}-1]$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nThe conditions become:\n1. We choose a sequence of split points $1 = L_1 < L_2 < \\dots < L_k < L_{k+1} = n+1$.\n2. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, the tower $s_j$ must be at $s_j = (L_j + L_{j+1}-1)/2$.\n3. For $s_j$ to be an integer, $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\n4. The set of towns $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ must be exactly the set of built towers. No other towers must be built, and all $s_j$ must be built.\n\nLet's check the parity condition.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), $L_2$ must be even.\nSince $L_2$ is even, $L_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $L_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$ (odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even).\nFinally, $L_{k+1}=n+1$ must have parity $(k+1) \\pmod 2$.\nThis implies $n+1 \\equiv k+1 \\pmod 2$, or $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe condition $p_{s_j} \\le \\min(s_j, n+1-s_j)$ is automatically satisfied by the choices of $L_j, L_{j+1}$ within the range $[1, n+1]$.\n$p_{s_j} \\le s_j \\iff (L_{j+1}-L_j)/2 \\le (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2 \\iff L_{j+1}-L_j \\le L_j+L_{j+1}-1 \\iff 1 \\le 2L_j$, which is true since $L_j \\ge 1$.\n$p_{s_j} \\le n+1-s_j \\iff (L_{j+1}-L_j)/2 \\le n+1 - (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2 \\iff L_{j+1}-L_j \\le 2n+2 - (L_j+L_{j+1}-1) \\iff 2L_{j+1} \\le 2n+3 \\iff L_{j+1} \\le n+3/2$, which is true since $L_{j+1} \\le n+1$.\n\nSo, a valid configuration exists if and only if there is a sequence $1=L_1 < L_2 < \\dots < L_k < L_{k+1}=n+1$ such that:\n1. $L_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k+1$.\n2. The towers built are exactly $S = \\{s_j = (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nAll other towns $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ must not have towers built.\n\nEach such sequence $(L_1, \\dots, L_k)$ uniquely determines the set of towers $S$. The total number of towns is $n$. The number of towers in $S$ is $k$.\nThe probability of this specific set of $k$ towers being built and $n-k$ towers not being built is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nSo we need to count the number of such valid sequences $(L_1, \\dots, L_k)$ over all possible $k$.\n\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of valid sequences $L_1, \\dots, L_j=i$ for some $j$.\n$L_1=1$. $dp[1]=1$.\nFor $i > 1$:\nIf $i$ is even, $L_j=i$ means $j$ must be even. The previous term $L_{j-1}$ must be an odd number $x < i$.\nIf $i$ is odd, $L_j=i$ means $j$ must be odd. The previous term $L_{j-1}$ must be an even number $x < i$.\nSo, $dp[i] = \\sum_{x<i, x \\text{ has opposite parity to } i} dp[x]$.\nThis is a path counting problem where we move from $x$ to $i$ if $x<i$ and $x,i$ have different parities.\nThe total number of such sequences is $dp[n+1]$.\nThe final term $L_{k+1}=n+1$ must have parity $(k+1) \\pmod 2$.\n$dp[n+1]$ counts sequences $L_1, \\dots, L_k, L_{k+1}=n+1$ where $L_{k+1}$ has parity $k+1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is exactly what we need.\n\nLet's compute $dp[i]$:\n$dp[1] = 1$ (sequence is just $L_1=1$).\n$dp[2]$: $L_1=1, L_2=2$. $1$ is odd, $2$ is even. Valid. $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$.\n$dp[3]$: $L_1=1, L_2=2, L_3=3$. $2$ is even, $3$ is odd. Valid. $dp[3] = dp[2] = 1$.\n$dp[4]$: $L_1=1, L_2=2, L_3=3, L_4=4$. $3$ is odd, $4$ is even. Valid. $dp[4] = dp[3] = 1$.\nIt seems $dp[i]=1$ for all $i$.\nThis is because for $L_j=i$, $L_{j-1}$ must be $i-1$ to satisfy $L_{j-1} < i$ and $L_{j-1}, i$ having different parities.\nNo, this is wrong. $L_j$ can be any $x < i$.\nExample: $n=5$. $L_{k+1}=6$. $L_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]$ (even): sum $dp[x]$ for odd $x<2$. $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[3]$ (odd): sum $dp[x]$ for even $x<3$. $dp[3]=dp[2]=1$.\n$dp[4]$ (even): sum $dp[x]$ for odd $x<4$. $dp[4]=dp[1]+dp[3]=1+1=2$. (Sequences: $1,2,3,4$ and $1,4$)\n$dp[5]$ (odd): sum $dp[x]$ for even $x<5$. $dp[5]=dp[2]+dp[4]=1+2=3$. (Sequences: $1,2,3,4,5$ and $1,4,5$ and $1,2,5$)\n$dp[6]$ (even): sum $dp[x]$ for odd $x<6$. $dp[6]=dp[1]+dp[3]+dp[5]=1+1+3=5$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[i]$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$. This looks like Fibonacci numbers.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nIt seems $dp[i] = F_{i-1}$ for $i \\ge 2$, and $dp[1]=F_1=1$.\nLet's check this hypothesis.\n$dp[i]$ for $i$ even: $dp[i] = \\sum_{x \\text{ odd}, x<i} dp[x]$.\n$dp[i]$ for $i$ odd: $dp[i] = \\sum_{x \\text{ even}, x<i} dp[x]$.\nLet $S_{odd}(m) = \\sum_{x \\text{ odd}, x \\le m} dp[x]$ and $S_{even}(m) = \\sum_{x \\text{ even}, x \\le m} dp[x]$.\nIf $i$ is even: $dp[i] = S_{odd}(i-1)$.\nIf $i$ is odd: $dp[i] = S_{even}(i-1)$.\n\nLet's test $dp[i]=F_{i-1}$ for $i \\ge 1$.\n$dp[1]=F_0=1$ (using $F_0=1$ or $F_1=1$ depending on indexing, let's use $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2 \\dots$ for $dp[i]=F_i$).\n$dp[1]=1$. $F_1=1$.\n$dp[2]=1$. $F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=1$. $F_3=2$. This doesn't match.\n\nMy $dp[i]$ values for $1 \\dots 6$: $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5$.\nThis is $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6$ if we define $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$ and then $dp[i] = F_{i}$ for $i \\ge 1$.\nLet's re-verify the Fibonacci sequence: $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nSo $dp[1]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_3=2$. My calculation for $dp[3]$ was $1$. This means my $dp[i]$ is not $F_i$.\n\nLet's re-calculate $dp[i]$ carefully.\n$dp[i]$: number of sequences $1=L_1 < L_2 < \\dots < L_j=i$ s.t. $L_x$ has parity $x \\pmod 2$.\n$dp[1]=1$ (sequence $L_1=1$).\nFor $i \\ge 2$:\nIf $i$ is even, $L_j=i$ means $j$ is even. $L_{j-1}$ must be odd.\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{x \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le x < i} dp[x]$.\nIf $i$ is odd, $L_j=i$ means $j$ is odd. $L_{j-1}$ must be even.\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{x \\text{ even}, 1 \\le x < i} dp[x]$.\n\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. (sum over odd $x < 2$, only $x=1$).\n$dp[3] = dp[2] = 1$. (sum over even $x < 3$, only $x=2$).\n$dp[4] = dp[1]+dp[3] = 1+1=2$. (sum over odd $x < 4$, $x=1,3$).\n$dp[5] = dp[2]+dp[4] = 1+2=3$. (sum over even $x < 5$, $x=2,4$).\n$dp[6] = dp[1]+dp[3]+dp[5] = 1+1+3=5$. (sum over odd $x < 6$, $x=1,3,5$).\n$dp[7] = dp[2]+dp[4]+dp[6] = 1+2+5=8$. (sum over even $x < 7$, $x=2,4,6$).\nThis sequence $dp[i]$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$.\nThis is $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nNo, this is $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots$ if we define $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nLet's use the standard $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[1]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_2=1$. This is the anomaly. $F_3=2$.\nFor $i \\ge 3$, $dp[i] = F_{i-1}$?\n$dp[3]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[4]=F_3=2$.\n$dp[5]=F_4=3$.\n$dp[6]=F_5=5$.\n$dp[7]=F_6=8$.\nYes, for $i \\ge 3$, $dp[i] = F_{i-1}$.\nAnd $dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1$.\nSo the number of valid sequences is $dp[n+1]$.\nIf $n+1=1$, $dp[1]=1$. (This means $n=0$, but $n \\ge 1$).\nIf $n+1=2$, $dp[2]=1$.\nIf $n+1 \\ge 3$, $dp[n+1] = F_n$.\n\nSo the total number of ways to pick the $L_j$ sequence is:\n*   If $n=1$: $dp[2]=1$.\n*   If $n \\ge 2$: $dp[n+1]=F_n$. (This is $F_n$ using $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$ or $F_{n}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$).\nLet's stick to $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[1]=1=F_1$.\n$dp[2]=1=F_2$.\n$dp[i]=F_{i-1}$ for $i \\ge 3$.\nSo $dp[n+1]$ is:\n*   If $n+1=1$: $F_1=1$. (Not possible as $n \\ge 1$).\n*   If $n+1=2$: $F_2=1$. (For $n=1$).\n*   If $n+1 \\ge 3$: $F_{(n+1)-1} = F_n$. (For $n \\ge 2$).\n\nSo the number of valid sequences is $F_{n}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_5=5$.\nThese match example outputs.\n\nThe total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ and $2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n**Fibonacci calculation:**\nWe can compute $F_n$ using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo $\\begin{pmatrix} F_n \\\\ F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nIf $n=1$, the matrix power is $0$. The result is $F_1=1$.\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$.\nThis method works for $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Modular inverse:**\n$2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$ can be computed as $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$ using Fermat's Little Theorem: $a^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nSo it's $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nOr $2^{MOD-1-n} \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThis can be computed using modular exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\n**Overall algorithm:**\n1. Define MOD = 998244353.\n2. Implement matrix multiplication modulo MOD.\n3. Implement matrix exponentiation modulo MOD.\n4. Calculate $F_n$ using matrix exponentiation. Handle $n=0, 1$ edge cases if needed (here $n \\ge 1$).\n   For $n=1$, $F_1=1$. For $n \\ge 2$, calculate $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$.

Output is $748683265$.\nThe next example input $n=3$. Output is $748683265$.\nThe next example input $n=5$. Output is $842268673$.\nThe problem note says: \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\". This is $n=2$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\nThis implies $748683265 \\equiv 1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$4 \\cdot 748683265 = 2994733060$.\n$2994733060 \\pmod{998244353} = 2994733060 - 3 \\cdot 998244353 = 2994733060 - 2994733059 = 1$.\nSo $748683265$ is indeed $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nMy calculation $F_2=1$ is correct.\nMy calculation of $2^{-n}$ is correct.\nThe logic seems sound.\n\nLet's check $n=3$:\n$F_3=2$. Probability is $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nThe output for $n=3$ is also $748683265$. This matches.\n\nLet's check $n=5$:\n$F_5=5$. Probability is $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\n$32^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$998244353 = 32 \\cdot 31195136 + 1$.\nSo $32^{-1} \\equiv 31195136 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$5 \\cdot 31195136 = 155975680$.\nThe example output for $n=5$ is $842268673$.\nMy calculation is $155975680$. The example output is different.\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nMy derivation for $dp[i]$ counts the number of valid sequences $L_j$ such that $L_j$ has the correct parity.\n$1=L_1 < L_2 < \\dots < L_k < L_{k+1}=n+1$.\nThe tower set is $S = \\{s_j = (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nThe probability for this specific set $S$ is $(1/2)^n$. This is correct.\nThe sum over all *distinct* valid $S$ sets.\nMy $dp[n+1]$ counts the number of valid sequences $L_1, \\dots, L_k, L_{k+1}=n+1$.\nEach such sequence defines a unique set $S$.\nThe $s_j$ are distinct because $L_j$ are strictly increasing.\n$s_j = (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2$. $s_{j+1} = (L_{j+1}+L_{j+2}-1)/2$.\nSince $L_j < L_{j+1} < L_{j+2}$, we have $L_j+L_{j+1}-1 < L_{j+1}+L_{j+2}-1$, so $s_j < s_{j+1}$.\nThus, each sequence $L_1, \\dots, L_k, L_{k+1}$ defines a unique set of tower locations $S$.\nSo the total count of such valid $S$ sets is indeed $dp[n+1]$.\n\nIs it possible that $F_n$ is not the correct formula?\nMy $dp[i]$ values are correct: $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$.\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=1$\n$dp[3]=1$\n$dp[4]=2$\n$dp[5]=3$\n$dp[6]=5$\n$dp[7]=8$\nThis sequence is $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nOr $F_1, F_2, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots$ if $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThe problem asks for $dp[n+1]$.\nFor $n=1$, $dp[2]=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $dp[3]=1$.\nFor $n=3$, $dp[4]=2$.\nFor $n=5$, $dp[6]=5$.\nThis sequence is $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nThis is $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, \\dots$.\nSo the number of ways is $F_n$. This is correct.\n\nLet's recheck the example outputs for $n=5$.\nMy calculation: $F_5 \\cdot 2^{-5} = 5 \\cdot 32^{-1} = 5 \\cdot 31195136 = 155975680$.\nExample output: $842268673$.\nThese are different.\nCould $F_n$ be referring to a different indexing of Fibonacci numbers?\nSome define $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$.\nIf $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8$.\nThen for $n=5$, $F_5=8$.\n$8 \\cdot 32^{-1} = 8 \\cdot 31195136 = 249561088$. Still not $842268673$.\n\nLet's check the example $n=5$ note:\n\"if $n = 5$ and you have built the towers in towns $2$, $4$ and $5$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $2$ to $2$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $4$ and $5$ to $1$.\"\nLet's verify this example. $n=5$. Towers at $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$s_1=2, s_2=4, s_3=5$. $k=3$.\n$p_2=2$: covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1, 3]$.\n$p_4=1$: covers $[4-1+1, 4+1-1] = [4, 4]$.\n$p_5=1$: covers $[5-1+1, 5+1-1] = [5, 5]$.\nThe intervals are $[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]$. They cover $[1,5]$ exactly.\nCheck conditions on $p_i$:\n$p_2=2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2) = \\min(2,4) = 2$. OK.\n$p_4=1 \\le \\min(4, 5+1-4) = \\min(4,2) = 2$. OK.\n$p_5=1 \\le \\min(5, 5+1-5) = \\min(5,1) = 1$. OK.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nWhat is the $L_j$ sequence for this?\n$L_1=1$. $R_1=3$. $s_1=(1+3)/2=2$. $p_1=(3-1+1)/2=1.5$ (No, $p_1=(R_1-L_1+1)/2 = (3-1+1)/2 = 1.5$. This is not possible).\nMy formula for $p_{s_j}$ was $(L_{j+1}-L_j)/2$. This is correct.\nThe interval covered by $s_j$ is $[L_j, L_{j+1}-1]$.\nSo for $s_1=2$, it covers $[1,3]$. So $L_1=1, L_2-1=3 \\implies L_2=4$.\nFor $s_2=4$, it covers $[4,4]$. So $L_2=4, L_3-1=4 \\implies L_3=5$.\nFor $s_3=5$, it covers $[5,5]$. So $L_3=5, L_4-1=5 \\implies L_4=6$.\nThe sequence of $L_j$ is $L_1=1, L_2=4, L_3=5, L_4=6$.\n$L_1=1$ (odd).\n$L_2=4$ (even). $L_1, L_2$ have different parities. OK.\n$L_3=5$ (odd). $L_2, L_3$ have different parities. OK.\n$L_4=6$ (even). $L_3, L_4$ have different parities. OK.\nThis is a valid $L_j$ sequence. $k=3$.\n$n=5$, $L_{k+1}=L_4=6$. $n+1=6$.\n$L_j$ parities: $1$ (odd), $4$ (even), $5$ (odd), $6$ (even).\n$j$ parities: $1$ (odd), $2$ (even), $3$ (odd), $4$ (even).\nThis matches $L_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$.\n$s_1 = (L_1+L_2-1)/2 = (1+4-1)/2 = 4/2 = 2$.\n$s_2 = (L_2+L_3-1)/2 = (4+5-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4$.\n$s_3 = (L_3+L_4-1)/2 = (5+6-1)/2 = 10/2 = 5$.\nThe set of towers is $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. This matches the example.\nThis sequence $1,4,5,6$ is counted by $dp[6]$.\n$dp[6]=5$.\nThis means there are 5 such sequences for $n=5$.\nThe probability is $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\nMy calculation is $155975680$.\nThe example output $842268673$.\nThis means $842268673 \\equiv 5/32 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nLet's check: $32 \\cdot 842268673 = 26952597536$.\n$26952597536 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$26952597536 = 27 \\cdot 998244353 + 5$.\nSo $842268673$ is indeed $5/32 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nMy calculations are correct and match the example values for $n=2,3,5$.\nThe formula is $F_n \\cdot 2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$, where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number with $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\n\nThe maximum $n$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. Matrix exponentiation is $O(\\log n)$.\n$2^{-n}$ is $O(\\log n)$. Total time complexity $O(\\log n)$.\nThis is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, n):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = mat_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # We want F_n.\n    # [F_{k+1}, F_k] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] * [F_k, F_{k-1}]\n    # [F_n, F_{n-1}] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]^(n-1) * [F_1, F_0]\n    # F_1 = 1, F_0 = 0\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    T_n_minus_1 = mat_pow(T, n - 1)\n    \n    # F_n is the top-left element of T_n_minus_1 * [1, 0]\n    # T_n_minus_1[0][0] * F_1 + T_n_minus_1[0][1] * F_0\n    # = T_n_minus_1[0][0] * 1 + T_n_minus_1[0][1] * 0\n    return T_n_minus_1[0][0]\n\ndef mod_inv(a):\n    return pow(a, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Though problem states 1 <= n <= 2e5\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_n\n    fn = fibonacci(n)\n\n    # Calculate (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    inv_2_pow_n = mod_inv(pow(2, n, MOD))\n\n    # Result is F_n * (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    ans = (fn * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\n# Call the solver function\nsolve()\n\n```",
