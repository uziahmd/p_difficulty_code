There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of house heights, subject to some constraints. The input format is pretty standard: `n`, `h`, `m` representing the number of houses, maximum height, and number of restrictions, followed by `m` lines defining the restrictions `l_i`, `r_i`, and `x_i`.  \n\nLet's break this down further.  I need to maximize `sum(a_j^2)` where `a_j` is the height of house `j`. Each house height is an integer between `0` and `h`. Crucially, for each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, the *maximum* height of houses between `l_i` and `r_i` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nThe key here is that `n`, `h`, and `m` are all relatively small, bounded by 50. This strongly suggests that a polynomial time solution is feasible. Something like `O(n^3)` or `O(n^4)` is probably going to be good enough.\n\nNow, let's think about the restrictions.  Each house's height is directly affected by the restrictions that *include* that house.  For a given house `j`, I can easily determine its maximum possible height.  It's simply the minimum value among all the `x_k` for which the restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)` includes house `j` (meaning `l_k <= j <= r_k`).  I'll call this the `max_allowed_height[j]`.\n\nMy first thought is to initialize `max_allowed_height[j]` to `h` for every house. Then, I can iterate through all the restrictions. For each restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`, I'll update the `max_allowed_height` for each house in the range `l_k` to `r_k` by taking the minimum of its current value and `x_k`. After I've processed all the restrictions, each `max_allowed_height[j]` will contain the individual maximum height that house `j` can have without directly violating any constraints.\n\nI'm starting to build a solution. If I set the height of each house `j` to `max_allowed_height[j]`, would this configuration automatically satisfy *all* the constraints? Let's verify that.  If I consider a specific restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`, the maximum height among the houses from `l_k` to `r_k` would, by construction, be no more than `x_k`. This is because each house's height in that range was explicitly limited by that restriction during the `max_allowed_height` calculation. I believe this should work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots, where the profit from a house of height `a` is `a^2`. There's a global maximum height `h` for any house, and `m` additional zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet `a_j` be the height of the house at spot `j`. We want to maximize `sum(a_j^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum possible height for each individual house.\nFor any house at spot `j`, its height `a_j` must satisfy:\n1. `0 <= a_j <= h` (global maximum height).\n2. For every restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)` such that spot `j` is within the range `[l_k, r_k]` (i.e., `l_k <= j <= r_k`), `a_j` must be at most `x_k`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, the maximum height it can *individually* be built to is `min(h, x_k1, x_k2, ..., x_kp)` where `x_k1, ..., x_kp` are the `x` values of all restrictions that cover spot `j`. If no restriction covers spot `j`, then its maximum height is `h`.\n\nLet's initialize an array `max_height_for_spot` of size `n`, where `max_height_for_spot[j]` stores the maximum allowed height for house `j+1` (using 0-based indexing for convenience).\nInitially, set `max_height_for_spot[j] = h` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\nThen, iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\nFor each spot `j` from `l_i-1` to `r_i-1` (inclusive, in 0-based indexing), update `max_height_for_spot[j] = min(max_height_for_spot[j], x_i)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_height_for_spot[j]` will contain the maximum height that house `j+1` can be built to, such that it satisfies all restrictions that *directly apply to it*.\n\nNow, consider a house at spot `j`. If we set its height `a_j = max_height_for_spot[j]`, will this configuration satisfy all restrictions?\nLet's check for any restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`. This restriction requires `max(a_p for p in range(l_k, r_k+1)) <= x_k`.\nBy our construction, for any `p` in the range `[l_k, r_k]`, `max_height_for_spot[p]` was updated with `x_k`, meaning `max_height_for_spot[p] <= x_k`.\nSince we are choosing `a_p = max_height_for_spot[p]`, it follows that `a_p <= x_k` for all `p` in the range `[l_k, r_k]`.\nTherefore, `max(a_p for p in range(l_k, r_k+1))` will indeed be less than or equal to `x_k`.\nThis means that setting each house's height `a_j` to its `max_height_for_spot[j]` value satisfies all restrictions.\n\nTo maximize profit, since `a^2` is an increasing function for `a >= 0`, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. As shown above, setting `a_j = max_height_for_spot[j]` for each spot `j` is a valid configuration. Since each `a_j` is maximized independently under the combined constraints, the sum of `a_j^2` will also be maximized.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize `max_height_for_spot = [h] * n`.\n2. For each restriction `(l, r, x)`:\n   For `j` from `l-1` to `r-1`:\n     `max_height_for_spot[j] = min(max_height_for_spot[j], x)`.\n3. Calculate the total profit: `sum(height^2 for height in max_height_for_spot)`.\n\nExample 1:\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1,1,1)`, `(2,2,3)`, `(3,3,2)`\n\n1. `max_height_for_spot = [3, 3, 3]`\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - `(1,1,1)`: `max_height_for_spot[0] = min(3, 1) = 1`. `max_height_for_spot = [1, 3, 3]`\n   - `(2,2,3)`: `max_height_for_spot[1] = min(3, 3) = 3`. `max_height_for_spot = [1, 3, 3]`\n   - `(3,3,2)`: `max_height_for_spot[2] = min(3, 2) = 2`. `max_height_for_spot = [1, 3, 2]`\n3. Total profit: `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nExample 2:\n`n=4, h=10, m=2`\nRestrictions: `(2,3,8)`, `(3,4,7)`\n\n1. `max_height_for_spot = [10, 10, 10, 10]`\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - `(2,3,8)`:\n     `max_height_for_spot[1] = min(10, 8) = 8`.\n     `max_height_for_spot[2] = min(10, 8) = 8`.\n     `max_height_for_spot = [10, 8, 8, 10]`\n   - `(3,4,7)`:\n     `max_height_for_spot[2] = min(8, 7) = 7`.\n     `max_height_for_spot[3] = min(10, 7) = 7`.\n     `max_height_for_spot = [10, 8, 7, 7]`\n3. Total profit: `10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262`.\n\nThe constraints `n, h, m <= 50` mean this approach is very efficient.\nInitialization: `O(n)`\nProcessing restrictions: `m` restrictions, each iterates up to `n` spots. So `O(m * n)`.\nCalculating profit: `O(n)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + m*n) = O(m*n)`.
