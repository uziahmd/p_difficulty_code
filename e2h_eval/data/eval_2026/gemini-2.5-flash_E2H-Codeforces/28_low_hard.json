String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Beautiful String Challenge**\n\nAlright, so the user wants me to tackle this competitive programming problem involving \"beautiful strings.\" Essentially, we're counting strings composed of '0's and '1's that have a specific number of each and can be reduced to a single character through a series of modifications. These modifications replace the last two characters based on a defined logic.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the modification operation. It's clearly a reduction process, shrinking the string length by one with each step. To get to the final single character, we'll need to perform `L-1` modifications. That final single character is the key to identifying the 'beautiful' strings.\n\nThe operation itself looks like it's based on some sort of binary arithmetic, but a straightforward mapping to 0 and 1 doesn't immediately reveal the pattern. Let's dig deeper. Considering the operation's behavior, I need to represent it mathematically. The results look like some combination of the input bits.\n\nAfter some analysis, I've realized it's a `NOR` (not OR) operation applied right-to-left. This means we're evaluating the expression from the end, reducing the string step-by-step. The final result depends on that cumulative application of the `NOR` operation across the string. The core of this problem becomes: determine a way to efficiently calculate this cumulative `NOR` reduction given a string. The conditions of the problem dictate we need exactly *n* zeros and *m* ones.\n\nEssentially, I need a combinatoric approach to determine how many of these strings will ultimately be reduced to the desired `g`. This will involve figuring out which combination of initial 0/1s leads to the given final character. The modular arithmetic aspect is a standard way of handling large outputs. I'll need to track the calculation and make sure to take the modulus every time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that, when reduced by a specific operation, result in a single character `g`. The reduction operation replaces the two last characters `c_1 c_2` with a new character: `1` if `c_1 = '0'` and `c_2 = '0'`, otherwise `0`. This process is repeated until a single character remains.\n\nLet's analyze the reduction operation:\n`op(0, 0) = 1`\n`op(0, 1) = 0`\n`op(1, 0) = 0`\n`op(1, 1) = 0`\n\nThis is equivalent to the logical NOR operation: `op(c1, c2) = NOT (c1 OR c2)`.\nThe reduction is right-associative. For a string `s_1 s_2 ... s_L`, the final character is `s_1` if `L=1`. If `L > 1`, it's `op(s_1, op(s_2, ..., op(s_{L-1}, s_L)...))`. This is not correct. The problem states \"replace two last characters\", so it's `op(s_{L-1}, s_L)`, then `op(s_{L-2}, result)`, and so on.\nThe final character for `s_1 s_2 ... s_L` is `f(s_1, s_2, ..., s_L)` where `f(x) = x` and `f(x_1, ..., x_k) = op(x_1, f(x_2, ..., x_k))` for `k > 1`.\nLet's denote the final character of a string `S` as `val(S)`.\n`val(c_1 c_2 ... c_L) = op(c_1, op(c_2, ..., op(c_{L-1}, c_L)...))`. This is a left-associative sequence of operations.\nLet's test this:\n`val(\"000\") = op(0, op(0,0)) = op(0,1) = 0`\n`val(\"001\") = op(0, op(0,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`\n`val(\"010\") = op(0, op(1,0)) = op(0,0) = 1`\n`val(\"011\") = op(0, op(1,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`\n`val(\"100\") = op(1, op(0,0)) = op(1,1) = 0`\n`val(\"101\") = op(1, op(0,1)) = op(1,0) = 0`\n`val(\"110\") = op(1, op(1,0)) = op(1,0) = 0`\n`val(\"111\") = op(1, op(1,1)) = op(1,0) = 0`\n\nNotice a pattern: If the string contains any '1's, the result `val(S)` is '0' unless all '1's are \"consumed\" by '0's in a specific way.\nMore formally, let's observe the effect of '1's.\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `op(s_i, X) = op(1, X) = 0` for any `X`.\nThis means that if there is a '1' at index `i`, then `val(s_i ... s_L)` will be `0`.\nThen `val(s_{i-1} s_i ... s_L) = op(s_{i-1}, val(s_i ... s_L)) = op(s_{i-1}, 0)`.\n- If `s_{i-1} = 0`, then `op(0, 0) = 1`.\n- If `s_{i-1} = 1`, then `op(1, 0) = 0`.\n\nThis implies that if there is a '1' anywhere in the string *except* possibly at the very first position `s_1`, the final result `val(S)` will be `0` if `s_1 = 1`, or `1` if `s_1 = 0`.\nLet's verify:\nIf `s_1 = 1`, then `val(S) = op(1, val(s_2 ... s_L)) = 0`. This is always true.\nSo, if `s_1 = 1`, the final character is `0`.\n\nIf `s_1 = 0`:\n`val(S) = op(0, val(s_2 ... s_L))`.\n- If `val(s_2 ... s_L) = 0`, then `val(S) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n- If `val(s_2 ... s_L) = 1`, then `val(S) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\n\nNow let's analyze `val(s_2 ... s_L)`.\nIf `s_2 = 1`, then `val(s_2 ... s_L) = 0` (from the rule that if `s_1=1`, result is 0).\nSo if `s_1 = 0` and `s_2 = 1`, then `val(S) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n\nWhat if `s_1 = 0` and `s_2 = 0`?\nThen `val(S) = op(0, val(0 s_3 ... s_L))`.\nIf `s_3 = 1`, then `val(0 s_3 ... s_L) = op(0, val(s_3 ... s_L)) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\nSo if `s_1 = 0, s_2 = 0, s_3 = 1`, then `val(S) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\n\nThis pattern is getting complex. Let's simplify.\nThe operation `op(x, y)` is `1` if `x=0, y=0`, else `0`.\nConsider the string `S = s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\nThe final character `g` is `1` if and only if `s_1=0` AND `val(s_2 ... s_L)=0`.\nThe final character `g` is `0` if `s_1=1` OR `(s_1=0` AND `val(s_2 ... s_L)=1)`.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying:\n`g = 1` if `s_1=0` AND (`s_2=0` AND `val(s_3 ... s_L)=0`).\n`g = 1` if `s_1=0`, `s_2=0`, ..., `s_k=0` AND `val(s_{k+1} ... s_L)=0` AND `k` is odd.\n`g = 1` if `s_1=0`, `s_2=0`, ..., `s_k=0` AND `val(s_{k+1} ... s_L)=1` AND `k` is even.\n\nThis is still not simple enough. Let's look at the example values again.\n`val(\"000\") = 0`\n`val(\"001\") = 1`\n`val(\"010\") = 1`\n`val(\"011\") = 1`\n`val(\"100\") = 0`\n`val(\"101\") = 0`\n`val(\"110\") = 0`\n`val(\"111\") = 0`\n\nNotice that `val(S) = 1` only if `S` contains at least one '1', and the first '0' appears before the first '1' (if any '1's exist).\nSpecifically, if `S` is `00...01...`, then `val(S)` can be `1`.\nIf `S` is `1...`, then `val(S)` is `0`.\nIf `S` is `00...0` (all zeros), then `val(S)` is `0` if `L` is odd, `1` if `L` is even.\nLet `z_0` be the number of leading zeros.\nIf `z_0` is odd, `val(S)` depends on `val(s_{z_0+1} ... s_L)`.\nIf `z_0` is even, `val(S)` depends on `val(s_{z_0+1} ... s_L)`.\n\nLet's define `f(S)` as the final character.\n`f(c) = c`.\n`f(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = op(c_1, f(c_2 ... c_k))`\nThis is `f(c_1, c_2, ..., c_k) = c_1 \\text{ NOR } (c_2 \\text{ NOR } (c_3 \\text{ NOR } ... (c_{k-1} \\text{ NOR } c_k)...))`.\nLet `A = (c_2 \\text{ NOR } (c_3 \\text{ NOR } ... (c_{k-1} \\text{ NOR } c_k)...))`.\nThen `f(c_1 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ NOR } A`.\n\nObserve that `X NOR Y = 1` iff `X=0` and `Y=0`. Otherwise `X NOR Y = 0`.\nSo `f(S) = 1` iff `c_1=0` AND `A=0`.\nAnd `A=0` iff `c_2=1` OR `(c_2=0` AND `B=1`) where `B = (c_3 \\text{ NOR } ... )`.\n\nThis is equivalent to the parity of the number of '1's, but with a twist.\nIf we consider the final character `g` as the result of a sequence of `L-1` operations.\nLet `g_k` be the result after `k` operations on the last `k+1` characters.\n`g_0 = s_L`\n`g_1 = op(s_{L-1}, s_L)`\n`g_2 = op(s_{L-2}, g_1)`\n...\n`g_{L-1} = op(s_1, g_{L-2})` which is the final character.\n\nThis means the final character is `s_1 NOR (s_2 NOR (s_3 NOR ... (s_{L-1} NOR s_L)...))`. This is indeed left-associative.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of this operation.\n`X NOR Y` is `1` iff `X=0` and `Y=0`.\nSo, `g=1` iff `s_1=0` AND `(s_2 NOR (s_3 NOR ...)) = 0`.\nAnd `(s_2 NOR (s_3 NOR ...)) = 0` iff `s_2=1` OR `(s_2=0` AND `(s_3 NOR ...) = 1)`.\n\nThis can be simplified:\nThe final character `g` is `1` if and only if the string is of the form `00...01` (an odd number of leading zeros, followed by a 1).\nNo, this is not quite right.\n`val(\"001\") = op(0, op(0,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`. Here `n=2, m=1`.\n`val(\"010\") = op(0, op(1,0)) = op(0,0) = 1`. Here `n=2, m=1`.\n`val(\"011\") = op(0, op(1,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`. Here `n=1, m=2`.\n`val(\"0000\") = op(0, op(0, op(0,0))) = op(0, op(0,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`. Here `n=4, m=0`.\n\nIt seems `g=1` if and only if the string has an even number of '0's followed by a '1' (or is `00...0` with even length).\nLet's consider the parity of the number of '0's.\nThe crucial observation is the effect of the first '1'.\nIf a string contains a '1', let `k` be the index of the first '1'.\n`S = s_1 s_2 ... s_{k-1} 1 s_{k+1} ... s_L`.\nAll `s_1, ..., s_{k-1}` are '0's.\nSo `S = 0^{k-1} 1 S'`.\nThe final character is `val(0^{k-1} 1 S')`.\n`val(1 S') = 0` (because `op(1, X) = 0`).\n`val(0 1 S') = op(0, val(1 S')) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n`val(00 1 S') = op(0, val(0 1 S')) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\n`val(000 1 S') = op(0, val(00 1 S')) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\nIn general, `val(0^j 1 S')` is `1` if `j` is odd, and `0` if `j` is even.\nHere `j` is the number of leading zeros before the first '1'. So `j = k-1`.\nTherefore, if the string contains at least one '1', `g=1` if and only if the number of leading zeros before the first '1' is odd.\n\nWhat if the string contains no '1's? Then `m=0`. The string is `00...0` (`n` zeros).\n`val(0) = 0`\n`val(00) = op(0,0) = 1`\n`val(000) = op(0, op(0,0)) = op(0,1) = 0`\n`val(0000) = op(0, op(0, op(0,0))) = op(0, op(0,1)) = op(0,0) = 1`\nSo for a string of `n` zeros, `g=1` if `n` is even, and `g=0` if `n` is odd.\n\nThis covers all cases:\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (string consists only of zeros)**\n- If `g = 0`: We need `n` to be odd. There is 1 such string (`0...0`).\n- If `g = 1`: We need `n` to be even. There is 1 such string (`0...0`).\n- If `n=0`, then `m` must be at least 1 (since `n+m >= 1`). So `m=0` implies `n >= 1`.\n  - Special case: `n=0, m=0` is not allowed.\n  - If `n=0`, `m=0`, then `L=0`, no string.\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (string contains at least one '1')**\nLet `k` be the number of leading zeros before the first '1'.\n`g=1` if `k` is odd.\n`g=0` if `k` is even.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem statement: \"character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character.\"\nThis means the operation is `s_1 s_2 ... s_{L-2} op(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\nThis is a right-associative reduction.\nLet `f(S)` be the final character.\n`f(c) = c`\n`f(c_1 c_2 ... c_L) = f(c_1 ... c_{L-2} op(c_{L-1}, c_L))`.\nLet's re-calculate `f(S)` for `L=3` and `L=4` using this.\n`f(\"000\") = f(\"0 op(0,0)\") = f(\"01\") = op(0,1) = 0`. This matches.\n`f(\"001\") = f(\"0 op(0,1)\") = f(\"00\") = op(0,0) = 1`. This matches.\n`f(\"010\") = f(\"0 op(1,0)\") = f(\"00\") = op(0,0) = 1`. This matches.\n`f(\"011\") = f(\"0 op(1,1)\") = f(\"00\") = op(0,0) = 1`. This matches.\n`f(\"100\") = f(\"1 op(0,0)\") = f(\"11\") = op(1,1) = 0`. This matches.\n`f(\"101\") = f(\"1 op(0,1)\") = f(\"10\") = op(1,0) = 0`. This matches.\n`f(\"110\") = f(\"1 op(1,0)\") = f(\"10\") = op(1,0) = 0`. This matches.\n`f(\"111\") = f(\"1 op(1,1)\") = f(\"10\") = op(1,0) = 0`. This matches.\n`f(\"0000\") = f(\"00 op(0,0)\") = f(\"001\") = f(\"0 op(0,1)\") = f(\"00\") = op(0,0) = 1`. This matches.\n\nSo my previous deduction of `g` values is correct, even though my initial interpretation of the operation order was left-associative while the problem implies right-associative. It turns out the final values are the same. This is a bit of a coincidence or a property of the NOR operation.\nLet's denote `op(c1, c2)` as `c1 ↓ c2`.\nLeft-associative: `((c1 ↓ c2) ↓ c3) ↓ c4`\nRight-associative: `c1 ↓ (c2 ↓ (c3 ↓ c4))`\nLet's check `0000`.\nLeft: `(((0↓0)↓0)↓0) = ((1↓0)↓0) = (0↓0) = 1`.\nRight: `0 ↓ (0 ↓ (0 ↓ 0)) = 0 ↓ (0 ↓ 1) = 0 ↓ 0 = 1`.\nThey are indeed the same for `0000`. Let's try `000`.\nLeft: `((0↓0)↓0) = (1↓0) = 0`.\nRight: `0 ↓ (0 ↓ 0) = 0 ↓ 1 = 0`.\nThey are the same. This property holds for NOR.\n`X ↓ (Y ↓ Z)` vs `(X ↓ Y) ↓ Z`.\n`X ↓ (Y ↓ Z) = 1` iff `X=0` and `(Y ↓ Z)=0`.\n`(Y ↓ Z)=0` iff `Y=1` or `Z=1`.\nSo `X ↓ (Y ↓ Z) = 1` iff `X=0` and (`Y=1` or `Z=1`).\n`(X ↓ Y) ↓ Z = 1` iff `(X ↓ Y)=0` and `Z=0`.\n`(X ↓ Y)=0` iff `X=1` or `Y=1`.\nSo `(X ↓ Y) ↓ Z = 1` iff (`X=1` or `Y=1`) and `Z=0`.\nThese are clearly not the same in general. For example, if `X=0, Y=1, Z=0`:\n`X ↓ (Y ↓ Z) = 0 ↓ (1 ↓ 0) = 0 ↓ 0 = 1`.\n`(X ↓ Y) ↓ Z = (0 ↓ 1) ↓ 0 = 0 ↓ 0 = 1`.\nThey are the same for this specific case.\n\nLet's re-examine `val(S) = 1` conditions based on my derived rules for the right-associative version:\n1. If `m=0` (string is `0...0` with `n` zeros): `g=1` iff `n` is even.\n2. If `m>0`: `g=1` iff the number of leading zeros before the first '1' is odd.\n\nLet's check this again with an example where `X ↓ (Y ↓ Z)` and `(X ↓ Y) ↓ Z` differ.\nThe property of `val(S)` I derived was:\nIf `S` contains at least one '1', `g=1` iff the number of leading zeros before the first '1' is odd.\nIf `S` consists only of '0's, `g=1` iff `n` is even.\n\nLet's test this with `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\nStrings are \"01\", \"10\".\nFor \"01\": `m=1 > 0`. Leading zeros before first '1' is 1 (odd). So `g=1`.\nFor \"10\": `m=1 > 0`. Leading zeros before first '1' is 0 (even). So `g=0`.\nSo for `n=1, m=1, g=0`, only \"10\" matches. Count = 1.\nExample output says 2. This means my rules are incorrect.\n\nThe example `1 1 0` output `2` (strings `01`, `10`).\n`f(\"01\") = op(0,1) = 0`.\n`f(\"10\") = op(1,0) = 0`.\nBoth strings result in `0`. My rules say:\nFor `01`: `m > 0`. Leading zeros before first '1' is 1 (odd). My rule says `g=1`. Actual `g=0`.\nFor `10`: `m > 0`. Leading zeros before first '1' is 0 (even). My rule says `g=0`. Actual `g=0`.\nMy rule for `m>0` is wrong.\n\nLet's analyze the `op(c1, c2)` as `c1 XOR c2 XOR (c1 AND c2) XOR 1`. No.\n`op(c1, c2) = 1 - (c1 OR c2)`. This is `NOT (c1 OR c2)`.\nLet's use `~ (c1 | c2)`.\nThe final character for `s_1 s_2 ... s_L` is `s_1 ~| (s_2 ~| (... ~| (s_{L-1} ~| s_L)...))`. This is right-associative.\n\nLet `res(S)` be the result of reducing string `S`.\n`res(c) = c`\n`res(c_1 ... c_L) = res(c_1 ... c_{L-2} (c_{L-1} ~| c_L))`\n\nLet's look at the example `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\nStrings: \"01\", \"10\".\n`res(\"01\") = 0 ~| 1 = 0`. Matches `g=0`.\n`res(\"10\") = 1 ~| 0 = 0`. Matches `g=0`.\nBoth are beautiful strings. Count = 2. This matches example.\n\nNow `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\nStrings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\". Total `C(4,2)=6` strings.\n`res(\"0011\") = res(\"0 (0~|1)\") = res(\"00\") = 0~|0 = 1`. (Does not match `g=0`)\n`res(\"0101\") = res(\"01 (0~|1)\") = res(\"010\") = res(\"0 (1~|0)\") = res(\"00\") = 0~|0 = 1`. (Does not match `g=0`)\n`res(\"0110\") = res(\"01 (1~|0)\") = res(\"010\") = res(\"0 (1~|0)\") = res(\"00\") = 0~|0 = 1`. (Does not match `g=0`)\n`res(\"1001\") = res(\"10 (0~|1)\") = res(\"100\") = res(\"1 (0~|0)\") = res(\"11\") = 1~|1 = 0`. (Matches `g=0`)\n`res(\"1010\") = res(\"10 (1~|0)\") = res(\"100\") = res(\"1 (0~|0)\") = res(\"11\") = 1~|1 = 0`. (Matches `g=0`)\n`res(\"1100\") = res(\"11 (0~|0)\") = res(\"111\") = res(\"1 (1~|1)\") = res(\"10\") = 1~|0 = 0`. (Matches `g=0`)\nOnly 3 strings match `g=0`. Example output says 4. My calculations are still off.\n\nWhat if the problem means the operation can be applied anywhere, not just the last two characters? \"replace two last characters\" seems unambiguous.\n\"For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\".\"\n`\"01010\"` -> `op(1,0)` on last two `010(1↓0)` -> `0100`. This is correct.\n`\"0100\"` -> `op(0,0)` on last two `01(0↓0)` -> `011`. This is correct.\nSo the interpretation of \"last two characters\" is definitely correct.\n\nLet's re-examine `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\nExample output: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\nMy calculation for \"0011\" was `res(\"0011\") = 1`. Example expects `0`.\nMy calculation for \"1001\" was `res(\"1001\") = 0`. Example expects `0`.\nMy calculation for \"1010\" was `res(\"1010\") = 0`. Example expects `0`.\nMy calculation for \"1100\" was `res(\"1100\") = 0`. Example expects `0`.\n\nThe problem is that my calculation for \"0011\" is `1`, but the example states it's `0`.\n`res(\"0011\")`:\n1. `00(1↓1)` -> `000`\n2. `0(0↓0)` -> `01`\n3. `0↓1` -> `0`.\nAha! My calculation was `res(\"0011\") = res(\"0 (0~|1)\") = res(\"00\") = 0~|0 = 1`.\nThe error was in `res(\"0 (0~|1)\")`. It should be `res(\"0 (op(0,1))\") = res(\"00\")`.\nThis is correct.\nThen `res(\"00\") = op(0,0) = 1`. This is correct.\nWhy does the example say \"0011\" leads to `g=0`?\n\nThis implies my `op` definition or the `res` function is wrong.\n`op(0,0) = 1`\n`op(0,1) = 0`\n`op(1,0) = 0`\n`op(1,1) = 0`\nThis is explicitly stated in the problem: \"This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\nThis definition is unambiguous.\n\nWhat if the problem means the *final* character `g` is the result of applying the operation `L-1` times, but the problem statement for `g` refers to the *parity* of some internal state? This is a common pattern in such problems.\nLet's see the parity.\n`0` maps to `0`, `1` maps to `1`.\n`00 -> 1`\n`01 -> 0`\n`10 -> 0`\n`11 -> 0`\nThis is `1` if `s1=0, s2=0` else `0`.\nThis is `(1-s1)(1-s2)` in arithmetic over integers.\nOr `(s1 XOR 1) AND (s2 XOR 1)` if we use boolean logic.\n\nLet's consider the result of the operation in terms of parity.\n`s_i` is the character.\n`s_i = 0` if `s_i` is even. `s_i = 1` if `s_i` is odd.\n`op(0,0) = 1` (even, even -> odd)\n`op(0,1) = 0` (even, odd -> even)\n`op(1,0) = 0` (odd, even -> even)\n`op(1,1) = 0` (odd, odd -> even)\n\nThis looks like addition modulo 2, but with a twist.\n`s_1 + s_2 + 1 (mod 2)`?\n`0+0+1 = 1 (mod 2)`\n`0+1+1 = 0 (mod 2)`\n`1+0+1 = 0 (mod 2)`\n`1+1+1 = 1 (mod 2)`\nNo, this doesn't match. `op(1,1)` should be `0`.\n\nWhat if the operation is `s_1 XOR s_2 XOR C` for some constant `C`?\n`0 XOR 0 XOR C = C`\n`0 XOR 1 XOR C = 1 XOR C`\n`1 XOR 0 XOR C = 1 XOR C`\n`1 XOR 1 XOR C = C`\nWe need `C=1` for `00`.\nThen `0 XOR 0 XOR 1 = 1`.\n`0 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 0`.\n`1 XOR 0 XOR 1 = 0`.\n`1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1`.\nThis still doesn't match `op(1,1)=0`.\n\nLet's consider the number of '1's.\nThe operation `op(c1, c2)` changes the number of '1's.\n- `00 -> 1`: `0` ones become `1` one.\n- `01 -> 0`: `1` one becomes `0` ones.\n- `10 -> 0`: `1` one becomes `0` ones.\n- `11 -> 0`: `2` ones become `0` ones.\n\nThis is very similar to a Nim game or a sum over GF(2).\nThe problem might be a known type of problem.\nLet `S = s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\nLet's try to find a property `P(S)` such that `P(op(c1,c2))` is related to `P(c1)` and `P(c2)`.\nConsider the sum of digits modulo 2. `sum(S) = (s_1 + ... + s_L) mod 2`.\n`sum(00) = 0`. `op(0,0)=1`. `sum(1)=1`. Parity changed.\n`sum(01) = 1`. `op(0,1)=0`. `sum(0)=0`. Parity changed.\n`sum(10) = 1`. `op(1,0)=0`. `sum(0)=0`. Parity changed.\n`sum(11) = 0`. `op(1,1)=0`. `sum(0)=0`. Parity is preserved.\n\nThis means that the parity of the number of '1's changes unless the two characters are `11`.\nThis is not simple.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the `g` value from the examples.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`: \"01\", \"10\". (Count 2)\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\". (Count 4)\n`n=1, m=1, g=1`: (Count 0)\n\nMy calculation for `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n`res(\"0011\") = 0` (Example says 0, my previous calculation said 1. Re-calc again for \"0011\")\n`0011`\n-> `00 (1↓1)` -> `000`\n-> `0 (0↓0)` -> `01`\n-> `0↓1` -> `0`.\nYes, \"0011\" leads to `0`. My previous calculation `res(\"00\") = op(0,0)=1` was correct, but the string was `000` not `00`.\nSo `res(\"0011\") = 0`. Matches example.\n\n`res(\"0101\")`:\n-> `01 (0↓1)` -> `010`\n-> `0 (1↓0)` -> `00`\n-> `0↓0` -> `1`. (Example expects `0`).\nThis is where my calculation differs from the example.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character.\"\nThis is unambiguous.\nWhat if `g` refers to something else? \"The character g equals either zero or one.\"\nIt sounds like `g` is the final character.\n\nCould it be that the problem implies that the string `s` *can* be reduced to `g`, not that it *always* reduces to `g`?\n\"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\nThis means there might be choices in the operations. But the operation is \"replace two last characters\". This is a deterministic process. There are no choices.\n\nThis is a very common type of problem where `g` is the final character.\nThe only way my calculation can differ from example is if my `op` definition is wrong, or my `res` function is wrong.\n`op(0,0)=1`, `op(X,Y)=0` otherwise. This is what I used.\n`res(S)`: `S_0 = S`. `S_{k+1} = S_k[0...L_k-3] + op(S_k[L_k-2], S_k[L_k-1])`. `res(S) = S_{L-1}[0]`.\nThis is what I used.\n\nLet's re-verify the example calculation for `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`L=4`.\n\"0011\" -> `00(1↓1)` -> `000` -> `0(0↓0)` -> `01` -> `0↓1` -> `0`. (Matches)\n\"0101\" -> `01(0↓1)` -> `010` -> `0(1↓0)` -> `00` -> `0↓0` -> `1`. (Does not match example `g=0`)\n\"0110\" -> `01(1↓0)` -> `010` -> `0(1↓0)` -> `00` -> `0↓0` -> `1`. (Does not match example `g=0`)\n\"1001\" -> `10(0↓1)` -> `100` -> `1(0↓0)` -> `11` -> `1↓1` -> `0`. (Matches)\n\"1010\" -> `10(1↓0)` -> `100` -> `1(0↓0)` -> `11` -> `1↓1` -> `0`. (Matches)\n\"1100\" -> `11(0↓0)` -> `111` -> `1(1↓1)` -> `10` -> `1↓0` -> `0`. (Matches)\nSo, based on my understanding, for `n=2, m=2, g=0`, there are 4 strings: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\nBut the example output says `4`. My list of strings that result in `0` is 4.\nThis means \"0101\" and \"0110\" must also result in `0`. But my calculation says `1`.\n\nWhat is wrong?\nCould it be that the problem uses a different meaning for \"0\" and \"1\"? For example, `0` is `true` and `1` is `false`.\nIf `0` is true, `1` is false:\n`op(true, true) = false`\n`op(true, false) = true`\n`op(false, true) = true`\n`op(false, false) = true`\nThis is not standard.\n\nLet's consider the problem statement again: \"This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\nThis means `op(0,0)=1` and `op(0,1)=0`, `op(1,0)=0`, `op(1,1)=0`.\nThis is precisely what I've been using.\n\nThis seems to be a common competitive programming problem, maybe there is a standard trick.\nWhat if `g` refers to the final character of the string *after* `n` zeros and `m` ones have been placed, but the length is `n+m`?\nThe problem is well-defined. I must be misinterpreting the example or making a calculation error.\n\nLet's re-calculate `res(\"0101\")` one more time very carefully.\nString: \"0101\"\nLength = 4.\nStep 1: Replace last two characters \"01\" with `op(0,1) = 0`. String becomes \"010\". Length = 3.\nStep 2: Replace last two characters \"10\" with `op(1,0) = 0`. String becomes \"00\". Length = 2.\nStep 3: Replace last two characters \"00\" with `op(0,0) = 1`. String becomes \"1\". Length = 1.\nFinal character is `1`.\n\nThis result `1` for \"0101\" is consistent with my previous calculation.\nThe example output for `n=2, m=2, g=0` is `4`. The strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\nMy results:\n\"0011\" -> `0` (Matches example)\n\"1001\" -> `0` (Matches example)\n\"1010\" -> `0` (Matches example)\n\"1100\" -> `0` (Matches example)\nThese four strings are exactly the ones from the example output.\nThis means my calculations for these four strings are correct.\nThe strings \"0101\" and \"0110\" are the other two strings with `n=2, m=2`.\nMy calculation for \"0101\" -> `1`.\nMy calculation for \"0110\" -> `1`.\nSo these two strings do NOT result in `g=0`. They result in `g=1`.\nThis means there are 4 strings for `g=0` and 2 strings for `g=1` when `n=2, m=2`.\nThe example output is correct with my calculations. I misread my own calculation results.\n\nOkay, so my `res(S)` function is correct.\nLet's summarize the conditions for `g`:\nLet `L = n+m`.\n`res(S) = 1` if `s_1 ... s_L` has an even number of '0's and an odd number of '1's.\nNo, this is not it.\nLet's look at the result `g` as a function of `s_1, ..., s_L`.\n`g(s_1, s_2, ..., s_L)`\n`g(s_1, s_2) = s_1 ~| s_2`\n`g(s_1, s_2, s_3) = s_1 ~| (s_2 ~| s_3)`\n`g(s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4) = s_1 ~| (s_2 ~| (s_3 ~| s_4))`\n\nLet `f(S)` be the character `g`.\n`f(c_1 ... c_L) = c_1 ~| f(c_2 ... c_L)` is incorrect.\nIt should be `f(c_1 ... c_L) = f(c_1 ... c_{L-2} (c_{L-1} ~| c_L))`.\nThis is `g(s_1, ..., s_L) = g(s_1, ..., s_{L-2}, s_{L-1} ~| s_L)`.\nLet `s'_k = s_k` for `k < L-1` and `s'_{L-1} = s_{L-1} ~| s_L`.\nThen `g(s_1, ..., s_L) = g(s'_1, ..., s'_{L-1})`.\n\nLet's define `val(S)` as the final character.\n`val(S) = 1` if `S` is of the form `0^k` where `k` is even and `k > 0`.\n`val(S) = 0` if `S` is of the form `0^k` where `k` is odd.\n`val(S) = 0` if `S` contains a `1` and `S` is of the form `1...`.\n`val(S) = 1` if `S` contains a `1` and `S` is of the form `01...`.\n`val(S) = 0` if `S` contains a `1` and `S` is of the form `001...`.\n`val(S) = 1` if `S` contains a `1` and `S` is of the form `0001...`.\n\nThis pattern seems to indicate that the final `g` depends on the parity of the number of zeros *before* the first '1', if a '1' exists.\nLet `S = 0^k 1 X` (where `X` is any string).\n`val(0^k 1 X)`:\n`val(1X) = val(1 (X_1 ~| ... ~| X_p))`. This is `1 ~| val(X)`. No, this is wrong.\n`val(1X) = val(1 (X_1 ~| ... ~| (X_{p-1} ~| X_p)...))`. This is `1 ~| val(X_1...X_p)`. No, this is wrong.\n\nLet's define `val_op(S)` using the problem's right-associative rule:\n`val_op(c) = c`\n`val_op(c_1 ... c_L) = val_op(c_1 ... c_{L-2} (c_{L-1} \\downarrow c_L))`\nwhere `c_{L-1} \\downarrow c_L` is `op(c_{L-1}, c_L)`.\n\nLet's test `val_op(S)` for `S` being `0^k 1 X`.\n`val_op(1X)`:\n`val_op(1)` is `1`.\n`val_op(10) = op(1,0) = 0`.\n`val_op(11) = op(1,1) = 0`.\n`val_op(100) = val_op(1 op(0,0)) = val_op(11) = op(1,1) = 0`.\n`val_op(101) = val_op(1 op(0,1)) = val_op(10) = op(1,0) = 0`.\n`val_op(110) = val_op(1 op(1,0)) = val_op(10) = op(1,0) = 0`.\n`val_op(111) = val_op(1 op(1,1)) = val_op(10) = op(1,0) = 0`.\nIt seems `val_op(1X) = 0` for any `X` (as long as `L >= 2`).\nThis is because `op(1, Y)` is always `0`. So `val_op(1Y) = op(1, val_op(Y))` if `Y` is a single character.\nIf `Y` is `y_1 y_2 ... y_k`, then `val_op(1 Y) = val_op(1 val_op(y_1 ... y_k))`.\nNo, this is not true. `val_op(1 Y) = val_op(1 y_1 ... y_{k-2} (y_{k-1} \\downarrow y_k))`.\nThe first character `s_1` is only involved in the last step of the reduction.\n`val_op(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = s_1 \\downarrow (s_2 \\downarrow (... \\downarrow s_L)...)` where `\\downarrow` is left-associative.\nThis is what I initially used and thought was `op(s_1, op(s_2, ...))`.\nBut the example calculations suggest that `val_op(s_1 ... s_L)` is `s_1 \\downarrow (s_2 \\downarrow (... \\downarrow s_L)...)` where `\\downarrow` is *right-associative*.\nLet `h(c_k, ..., c_L) = c_k \\downarrow (c_{k+1} \\downarrow (... \\downarrow c_L)...)`.\nThen `val_op(S) = h(s_1, ..., s_L)`.\nLet's re-calculate using this definition.\n`h(c) = c`.\n`h(c_1, c_2) = c_1 \\downarrow c_2`.\n`h(c_1, c_2, c_3) = c_1 \\downarrow (c_2 \\downarrow c_3)`.\n`h(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) = c_1 \\downarrow (c_2 \\downarrow (c_3 \\downarrow c_4))`.\n\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`: \"01\", \"10\"\n`h(\"01\") = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0`. (Matches)\n`h(\"10\") = 1 \\downarrow 0 = 0`. (Matches)\nCount = 2. Matches example.\n\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n\"0011\": `0 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 1)) = 0 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 0) = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0`. (Matches)\n\"0101\": `0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 1)) = 0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 0) = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`. (Doesn't match example `0`)\n\"0110\": `0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 0)) = 0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 0) = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`. (Doesn't match example `0`)\n\"1001\": `1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 1)) = 1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 0) = 1 \\downarrow 1 = 0`. (Matches)\n\"1010\": `1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 0)) = 1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 0) = 1 \\downarrow 1 = 0`. (Matches)\n\"1100\": `1 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 0)) = 1 \\downarrow (1 \\downarrow 1) = 1 \\downarrow 0 = 0`. (Matches)\nThis definition of `h` also gives 4 strings for `g=0`. It matches the strings in the example output.\nThe discrepancy is only for \"0101\" and \"0110\", which I calculate to be `1` but the example implies they should be `0`.\n\nThis is very confusing. There must be a standard interpretation of this type of operation that I'm missing.\nWhat if `g` is the parity of the number of '1's in the string? No, that's not it.\n\nWhat if the operation is `c_1 + c_2 + 1 \\pmod 2`?\n`0+0+1 = 1`\n`0+1+1 = 0`\n`1+0+1 = 0`\n`1+1+1 = 1`\nThis is `XOR` with `1` if both are `1`. No.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the example output for `n=2, m=2, g=0` is incomplete, or there's a subtle point.\nThe example output for `n=2, m=2, g=0` is `4`. My 4 strings match this.\nThe example output for `n=1, m=1, g=1` is `0`. My calculations: `01` -> `0`, `10` -> `0`. So for `g=1`, there are 0 strings. This also matches.\n\nSo it seems my interpretation of the operation and reduction is correct after all. The confusion was my misreading of my own calculations for `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\nMy calculations:\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\" (4 strings)\n`n=2, m=2, g=1`: \"0101\", \"0110\" (2 strings)\nTotal 6 strings, `C(4,2) = 6`. This is consistent.\n\nNow, let's derive the rules for `g` based on `h(s_1, ..., s_L) = s_1 \\downarrow (s_2 \\downarrow (... \\downarrow s_L)...)`.\nLet `A_k = s_k \\downarrow (s_{k+1} \\downarrow (... \\downarrow s_L)...)`.\n`A_L = s_L`.\n`A_k = s_k \\downarrow A_{k+1}`.\n`A_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND `A_{k+1}=0`.\n`A_k = 0` iff `s_k=1` OR `A_{k+1}=1`.\n\nWe want to find `A_1 = g`.\n`g = 1` iff `s_1=0` AND `A_2=0`.\n`g = 0` iff `s_1=1` OR `A_2=1`.\n\nLet's trace `A_k` from right to left.\n`A_L = s_L`.\n`A_{L-1} = s_{L-1} \\downarrow s_L`.\n`A_{L-2} = s_{L-2} \\downarrow (s_{L-1} \\downarrow s_L)`.\n...\n\nConsider the number of '1's.\nIf `m=0` (all zeros): String is `00...0` (`n` times).\n`A_L = 0`.\n`A_{L-1} = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`.\n`A_{L-2} = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0`.\n`A_{L-3} = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`.\nPattern for `A_k` for `0^N`: `A_k = 1` if `N-k` is even, `A_k = 0` if `N-k` is odd.\nWe want `A_1`. So `N-1`.\nIf `n` is the total number of zeros (`N`), then `g=A_1=1` if `n-1` is even (i.e., `n` is odd).\n`g=A_1=0` if `n-1` is odd (i.e., `n` is even).\nThis is the opposite of my previous finding for `m=0`.\nLet's check `000` (`n=3`). `n` is odd. My rule: `g=1`.\n`h(0,0,0) = 0 \\downarrow (0 \\downarrow 0) = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0`.\nSo if `m=0`, `g=1` if `n` is even, `g=0` if `n` is odd.\nThis is consistent with `A_1 = 1` if `n-1` is even `(n` is odd) for `A_k = 1` if `N-k` is even.\n`A_1` is `1` if `n-1` is even. `n-1` is even means `n` is odd. So `g=1` if `n` is odd.\nThis is `A_k = 0` if `N-k` is odd.\n`A_1 = 0` if `n-1` is odd. `n-1` is odd means `n` is even. So `g=0` if `n` is even.\nMy derivation is still flipped.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `A_k = s_k \\downarrow A_{k+1}`.\nIf all `s_i` are `0`:\n`A_n = 0`\n`A_{n-1} = 0 \\downarrow A_n = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`\n`A_{n-2} = 0 \\downarrow A_{n-1} = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0`\n`A_{n-3} = 0 \\downarrow A_{n-2} = 0 \\downarrow 0 = 1`\nSo `A_k = 1` if `n-k` is odd.\n`A_k = 0` if `n-k` is even.\nWe want `A_1`. So `n-1`.\n`g = A_1 = 1` if `n-1` is odd (i.e., `n` is even).\n`g = A_1 = 0` if `n-1` is even (i.e., `n` is odd).\nThis matches my first derived rule for `m=0`.\n- If `m=0` and `g=0`: `n` must be odd. Count 1.\n- If `m=0` and `g=1`: `n` must be even. Count 1.\n\nNow, if `m > 0`.\nLet `j` be the index of the last '1'. `s_j=1`.\n`A_j = s_j \\downarrow A_{j+1} = 1 \\downarrow A_{j+1} = 0`. (Because `1 \\downarrow X` is always `0`).\nSo `A_j = 0`.\nThen `A_{j-1} = s_{j-1} \\downarrow A_j = s_{j-1} \\downarrow 0`.\n`A_{j-1} = 1` if `s_{j-1}=0`.\n`A_{j-1} = 0` if `s_{j-1}=1`.\nThen `A_{j-2} = s_{j-2} \\downarrow A_{j-1}`.\nIf `A_{j-1}=1`, then `A_{j-2} = s_{j-2} \\downarrow 1 = 0`.\nIf `A_{j-1}=0`, then `A_{j-2} = s_{j-2} \\downarrow 0`.\nSo `A_{j-2} = 1` if `s_{j-2}=0` and `A_{j-1}=0`.\n`A_{j-2} = 0` if `s_{j-2}=1` or `A_{j-1}=1`.\n\nThis means that `A_k` for `k < j` depends on `s_k, s_{k+1}, ..., s_{j-1}` and `A_j=0`.\nSpecifically, `A_k = h(s_k, ..., s_{j-1}, 0)`.\nThis is exactly the same as `h(s_k, ..., s_{j-1}, 0)` where `0` effectively acts as `s_j`.\nSo the rightmost `1` (at index `j`) effectively makes `A_j=0`.\nThen the values of `A_k` for `k < j` depend on the sequence `s_k ... s_{j-1}` followed by this `0`.\nLet `Z = s_k ... s_{j-1}`. We are interested in `h(Z, 0)`.\n`h(Z, 0)` behaves like `h(Z_1, ..., Z_p, 0)`.\nThis is `h(Z_1, ..., Z_p) \\downarrow 0`.\n`X \\downarrow 0 = 1` if `X=0`.\n`X \\downarrow 0 = 0` if `X=1`.\nSo `h(Z,0) = 1` if `h(Z)=0`.\n`h(Z,0) = 0` if `h(Z)=1`.\nThis means `A_k = 1 - h(s_k ... s_{j-1})`.\n\nSo `g = A_1 = 1 - h(s_1 ... s_{j-1})`.\nThe string `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` contains only zeros (since `j` is the index of the last '1', so any '1's before `j` would have been `s_i` for `i < j`. This is not correct. `j` is the index of the last '1'. The characters `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` can be any mix of 0s and 1s).\n\nLet's re-examine `A_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND `A_{k+1}=0`.\n`A_j = 0`.\n`A_{j-1} = 1` iff `s_{j-1}=0` AND `A_j=0` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=0`).\n`A_{j-1} = 0` iff `s_{j-1}=1` OR `A_j=1` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=1`).\nSo `A_{j-1} = 1 - s_{j-1}`.\n`A_{j-2} = 1` iff `s_{j-2}=0` AND `A_{j-1}=0`.\n`A_{j-2} = 0` iff `s_{j-2}=1` OR `A_{j-1}=1`.\nSubstitute `A_{j-1}`:\n`A_{j-2} = 1` iff `s_{j-2}=0` AND `(1-s_{j-1})=0` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=1`).\n`A_{j-2} = 0` iff `s_{j-2}=1` OR `(1-s_{j-1})=1` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=0`).\nSo `A_{j-2} = (1-s_{j-2}) \\text{ AND } s_{j-1}`.\n\nThis looks like an alternating pattern.\n`A_j = 0`\n`A_{j-1} = 1 \\text{ if } s_{j-1}=0, \\text{ else } 0`.\n`A_{j-2} = 1 \\text{ if } s_{j-2}=0 \\text{ and } s_{j-1}=1, \\text{ else } 0`.\n`A_{j-3} = 1 \\text{ if } s_{j-3}=0 \\text{ and } (s_{j-2}=1 \\text{ or } s_{j-1}=0), \\text{ else } 0`.\nThis is becoming too complex.\n\nLet's find a simpler invariant or property.\nThe final character `g` depends on the parity of the number of '1's.\nIf `m` is odd, then `g=0`.\nIf `m` is even, then `g=1` if `n` is even, `g=0` if `n` is odd.\nLet's check this hypothesis.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`. `m` is odd. Hypothesis: `g=0`. Matches.\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`. `m` is even. Hypothesis: `g=1` if `n` is even. Here `n=2` (even). So `g=1`. Does not match example `g=0`.\n\nThe problem is hard. Let's look for known results for `X NOR Y` or similar operations.\nA string `S` ending in `0` can result in `1` if `S = S'00`.\nA string `S` ending in `1` can result in `0` if `S = S'01`.\n\nConsider the total number of '1's.\nIf `m=0`: `g=1` if `n` is even, `g=0` if `n` is odd.\nIf `m=1`: `g=0`.\nLet's test this for `n=1, m=1, g=0`. `m=1` is odd. `g=0`. Matches.\nIf `m=2`: `g=1` if `n` is even, `g=0` if `n` is odd.\nLet's test this for `n=2, m=2, g=0`. `m=2` is even, `n=2` is even. So `g=1`. Does not match.\n\nThe rule for `g` depends on `m` being `0` or `1` or `>1`.\nLet `L = n+m`.\nIf `m=0`: `g = (n%2 == 0)`. (1 if n even, 0 if n odd)\nIf `m=1`: `g = 0`. (This is because any string with one '1' must be `0...010...0`. If it's `...1`, then `s_L=1`. `A_L=1`. `A_{L-1}=s_{L-1} \\downarrow 1 = 0`. So `A_{L-1}=0`. Then `A_{L-2} = s_{L-2} \\downarrow 0`. This is `1-s_{L-2}`. So it alternates.\nIf `s_k = 1`, then `A_k = 0`. Then `A_{k-1} = 1-s_{k-1}`. `A_{k-2} = s_{k-2} \\downarrow (1-s_{k-1})`.\nThis is `1` if `s_{k-2}=0` and `1-s_{k-1}=0` (i.e. `s_{k-1}=1`).\nThis is `0` if `s_{k-2}=1` or `1-s_{k-1}=1` (i.e. `s_{k-1}=0`).\nSo `A_{k-2} = (1-s_{k-2}) \\text{ AND } s_{k-1}`.\n\nThis means `g=1` iff `s_1=0` and `s_2=1` and `s_3=0` and `s_4=1` and ...\nThis is `g=1` iff `s_i = (i%2)` for `i=1...k-1` and `s_k=1`.\nNo, this is wrong.\n\nLet's look at the problem as a state machine. The state is `current_value`. Start with `current_value = s_L`. Iterate `i` from `L-1` down to `1`. `current_value = op(s_i, current_value)`. The final `current_value` is `g`.\n`g = 1` if `s_i=0` and `current_value=0`.\n`g = 0` if `s_i=1` or `current_value=1`.\n\nConsider `g=1`. This implies `s_1=0` and `val(s_2...s_L)=0`.\n`val(s_2...s_L)=0` implies `s_2=1` or `val(s_3...s_L)=1`.\n`val(s_2...s_L)=0` implies `s_2=1` or (`s_3=0` and `val(s_4...s_L)=0`).\n\nThis is equivalent to: `g=1` iff the string is of the form `01` or `0001` or `000001` etc. (odd number of leading zeros, then `1`)\nOr `00` or `0000` etc. (even number of zeros, no `1`s).\n\nLet `S = s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\nLet `v_k` be the result of reducing `s_k ... s_L`.\n`v_L = s_L`.\n`v_k = op(s_k, v_{k+1})`.\nWe want `v_1`.\n`v_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND `v_{k+1}=0`.\n`v_k = 0` iff `s_k=1` OR `v_{k+1}=1`.\n\nLet's check the examples with this definition of `v_k`.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`. Strings: \"01\", \"10\".\n\"01\": `v_2=1`. `v_1 = op(0, v_2) = op(0,1) = 0`. Matches.\n\"10\": `v_2=0`. `v_1 = op(1, v_2) = op(1,0) = 0`. Matches.\nCount = 2. Matches example.\n\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n\"0011\": `v_4=1`. `v_3 = op(1,1) = 0`. `v_2 = op(0,0) = 1`. `v_1 = op(0,1) = 0`. Matches.\n\"0101\": `v_4=1`. `v_3 = op(0,1) = 0`. `v_2 = op(1,0) = 0`. `v_1 = op(0,0) = 1`. (Example wants `0`).\n\"0110\": `v_4=0`. `v_3 = op(1,0) = 0`. `v_2 = op(1,0) = 0`. `v_1 = op(0,0) = 1`. (Example wants `0`).\n\"1001\": `v_4=1`. `v_3 = op(0,1) = 0`. `v_2 = op(0,0) = 1`. `v_1 = op(1,1) = 0`. Matches.\n\"1010\": `v_4=0`. `v_3 = op(1,0) = 0`. `v_2 = op(0,0) = 1`. `v_1 = op(1,1) = 0`. Matches.\n\"1100\": `v_4=0`. `v_3 = op(0,0) = 1`. `v_2 = op(1,1) = 0`. `v_1 = op(1,0) = 0`. Matches.\nThis calculation method also gives `1` for \"0101\" and \"0110\".\nThis means the example output for `n=2, m=2, g=0` is `4` and my calculations give `4` for `g=0` (0011, 1001, 1010, 1100).\nThe specific strings \"0101\", \"0110\" result in `1`.\nSo the example output is correct. My previous confusion was due to misreading my own results.\n\nOkay, so the `v_k = op(s_k, v_{k+1})` definition is the correct one.\nNow, what are the properties of `v_1`?\n`v_1 = 1` iff `s_1=0` and `v_2=0`.\n`v_1 = 0` iff `s_1=1` or `v_2=1`.\n\nConsider the sequence `s_L, s_{L-1}, ..., s_1`.\n`v_L = s_L`.\n`v_{L-1} = op(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\n`v_{L-2} = op(s_{L-2}, op(s_{L-1}, s_L))`.\nThis is `v_k = s_k \\downarrow (s_{k+1} \\downarrow (... \\downarrow s_L)...)` where `\\downarrow` is right-associative.\nThis is the `h` function I used, and it matches the examples.\n\nSo the problem is to count strings `s` with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that `h(s_1, ..., s_{n+m}) = g`.\n\nLet `P_k` be `v_k = 0`. `Q_k` be `v_k = 1`.\n`Q_k` iff `s_k=0` AND `P_{k+1}`.\n`P_k` iff `s_k=1` OR `Q_{k+1}`.\n\n`P_L` iff `s_L=0`. `Q_L` iff `s_L=1`.\n`P_{L-1}` iff `s_{L-1}=1` OR `Q_L`.\n`P_{L-1}` iff `s_{L-1}=1` OR `s_L=1`.\n`Q_{L-1}` iff `s_{L-1}=0` AND `P_L`.\n`Q_{L-1}` iff `s_{L-1}=0` AND `s_L=0`.\n\nThis is `v_k = (1-s_k) \\cdot (1-v_{k+1})`. Where `1-x` is `NOT x`.\n`v_k = NOT(s_k OR v_{k+1})`.\nThe final value `g` is `v_1`.\n\nLet's look at the structure of `v_1`.\n`v_1 = 1` iff `s_1=0` AND `v_2=0`.\n`v_2=0` iff `s_2=1` OR `v_3=1`.\n`v_3=1` iff `s_3=0` AND `v_4=0`.\n`v_4=0` iff `s_4=1` OR `v_5=1`.\nAnd so on.\n\nThis creates a chain of dependencies.\n`g=1` if `s_1=0` AND (`s_2=1` OR (`s_3=0` AND (`s_4=1` OR (`s_5=0` AND ...))))`.\nThis is a nested expression.\n\nConsider the counts:\nIf `g=1`:\nStrings must be of the form `01...` or `0001...` or `000001...` etc.\nOr `00...0` (even length `n`).\n\nCase 1: `m=0` (string is `0...0` of length `n`).\n`v_n = 0`.\n`v_{n-1} = op(0,0) = 1`.\n`v_{n-2} = op(0,1) = 0`.\n`v_{n-3} = op(0,0) = 1`.\nSo `v_k = 1` if `n-k` is odd. `v_k = 0` if `n-k` is even.\nWe want `v_1`. So `n-1`.\n`g=1` if `n-1` is odd (i.e. `n` is even).\n`g=0` if `n-1` is even (i.e. `n` is odd).\nThis is consistent.\nIf `m=0`:\n- If `g=0`: `n` must be odd. Count 1.\n- If `g=1`: `n` must be even.

Then `v_k=0` if `k` is the last `1`.\nIf `k` is even: `s_k=1`. Then `v_k=1` if `k` is the last `1`.\n\nLet's consider the parity of the number of '1's.\nIf `m` is odd, `g=0`.\nIf `m` is even, `g=1` iff `n` is odd.\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`: `m=1` is odd.

So `g=1`. `dp[2][0][0]=0`.\n   Base case `n=2, m=0`: `v_2=0, v_1=op(0,0)=1`.\n   `dp[2][0][0] = 0`. `dp[2][0][1] = 1`.\n`dp[1][1][1] = 0` (calculated above).\nSo `dp[2][1][0] = 0 + 0 = 0`.\n\n`dp[1][2][1] = (2 > 0 ? 0 : 0) + (1 > 0 ? dp[0][2][0] : 0)`\n`= dp[0][2][0]`.\n`dp[0][2][0]`: string \"11\". `v_2=1, v_1=op(1,1)=0`. So `g=0`. `dp[0][2][0]=1`.\n   Base case `n=0, m=2`: `v_2=1, v_1=op(1,1)=0`.\n   `dp[0][2][0] = 1`. `dp[0][2][1] = 0`.\nSo `dp[1][2][1] = 1`.\n\nFinally: `dp[2][2][0] = dp[2][1][0] + dp[1][2][1] = 0 + 1 = 1`.\nExample output `4`. My DP is still wrong.\n\nThe issue is that `dp[n][m-1][0]` for `s_1=1` is correct. The result is always `0`.\nSo if `target_g=0`, we add `C(n+m-1, n)` for strings starting with `1`.\nIf `target_g=1`, we add `0` for strings starting with `1`.\n\nThis is not a DP over `n` and `m`. This is a combinatorial problem.\nThe recursive structure is:\n`count(n, m, g)`:\nIf `n+m=0`: return `0`.\nIf `n=0, m=0`: return `0`.\nIf `n=1, m=0`: return `1` if `g=0`, `0` if `g=1`. (String \"0\" -> 0)\nIf `n=0, m=1`: return `0` if `g=0`, `1` if `g=1`. (String \"1\" -> 1)\n\nFor `(n,m)`:\nIf `s_1=1`: `m_remaining = m-1`. `n_remaining = n`.\n   The final result `g'` is `0`.\n   If `g=0`: add `C(n+m-1, n)` to total.\n   If `g=1`: add `0`.\nIf `s_1=0`: `m_remaining = m`. `n_remaining = n-1`.\n   The final result `g'` is `1 - g_subproblem`.\n   If `g=0`: add `count(n-1, m, 1)` to total.\n   If `g=1`: add `count(n-1, m, 0)` to total.\n\nThis is a recursive definition.\nLet `F(n, m, g)` be the function.\n`F(n,m,0)`:\n  `res = 0`\n  If `m >= 1`: `res = (res + C(n+m-1, n)) % MOD` (strings starting with '1')\n  If `n >= 1`: `res = (res + F(n-1, m, 1)) % MOD` (strings starting with '0')\n  Return `res`.\n\n`F(n,m,1)`:\n  `res = 0`\n  If `m >= 1`: `res = (res + 0) % MOD` (strings starting with '1' always yield `0`)\n  If `n >= 1`: `res = (res + F(n-1, m, 0)) % MOD` (strings starting with '0')\n  Return `res`.\n\nBase cases:\n`F(1,0,0) = 1`. `F(1,0,1) = 0`.\n`F(0,1,0) = 0`. `F(0,1,1) = 1`.\n\nLet's trace `F(2,2,0)`:\n`F(2,2,0) = (m>=1 ? C(3,2) : 0) + (n>=1 ? F(1,2,1) : 0)`\n`= C(3,2) + F(1,2,1)`\n`= 3 + F(1,2,1)`\n\n`F(1,2,1) = (m>=1 ? 0 : 0) + (n>=1 ? F(0,2,0) : 0)`\n`= F(0,2,0)`\n\n`F(0,2,0) = (m>=1 ? C(1,0) : 0) + (n>=1 ? F(-1,2,1) : 0)`\n`= C(1,0) + 0` (since `n=0` so `n>=1` is false)\n`= 1`.\n\nSo `F(1,2,1) = 1`.\nThen `F(2,2,0) = 3 + 1 = 4`. This matches the example!\n\nThis recursive formula with combinations is the correct approach.\nThe maximum `n+m` is `2*10^5`. We need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials for combinations.\nThe recursion depth can be `n+m`.
