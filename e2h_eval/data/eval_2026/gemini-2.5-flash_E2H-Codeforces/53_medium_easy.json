    "thought": "**Solving the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to find the length of the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string. The string only contains lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 100 characters.\n\nMy approach is this: I'll iterate through possible substring lengths, starting from the longest possible length (`N-1`, where `N` is the string's length) and working my way down to 1. The key is to find the *largest* length for which a repeating substring exists. If I find a substring length that satisfies this condition, that's my answer, and I can stop there. If I go through all lengths and find nothing, the answer is 0.\n\nFor each potential length (`L`), I'll do this:\n\n1.  Generate all possible substrings of that length.\n2.  Count how many times each unique substring appears in the original string.\n3.  If any substring appears at least twice, I've found a valid length, and since I'm going in descending order, I know this is the longest such substring.\n\nTo check for repetitions efficiently, I'm thinking of comparing each substring against every other substring of the same length in the string. I could just brute-force this, meaning for a fixed `L`: I iterate the starting point of one substring (`i`) and then iterate starting points for the *second* occurrence of the same substring, `j`, where `j` will be strictly greater than `i`. This handles overlapping substrings correctly because the starting points of `j` are beyond `i`.\n\nI'm aware that a naive approach with nested loops could lead to O(N^4) complexity, where N is the length of the string. Given the input constraints (N <= 100), I'm hopeful that this might still be fast enough in Python, particularly given that Python has built-in optimizations for string operations, making constant factors smaller. Although, I wonder about hashing the substrings for faster lookups (O(N^2) instead of O(N^4)). I might have to revisit that.\n\nI've tested the logic with examples like \"abcd\" (answer: 0), \"ababa\" (answer: 3), and \"zzz\" (answer: 2) to ensure it handles different cases correctly. Based on my analysis and the problem constraints, this approach appears sound and reasonably efficient for the problem.\n",
