    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan for tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. It's all about finding a clever way to rearrange the given distinct numbers in an array so that no subset sums match up between the original and the rearranged version.**\n\nFirst, I realized that the simplest permutation, leaving the array unchanged, is a big no-no. It immediately fails the core requirement. A cyclic shift emerged as a potentially strong contender.\n\nI started digging into simpler cases. A cyclic shift seemed to work wonders with only two or three numbers, so I felt confident that it would continue to work for larger array sizes. This approach became the focus, and it appears to work in all scenarios.\n\nI then realized that I needed to prove this: Sorting the input array and applying a cyclic shift always yields a valid solution. I tried to demonstrate that any subset sum from the original (sorted array) must have a different sum compared to the corresponding subset of the cyclic-shifted array.\n\nThe crux of the proof is based on examining the differences between elements within the arrays. After sorting, the differences between neighboring elements are all negative (except for the last one, which is positive). This property effectively prevents any combination of sums from matching after the cyclic shift.\n\nThe initial proof started with the assumption that the sums were identical and broke this down into smaller subsets, focusing on the differences. Using this approach it becomes clear that it's impossible to generate an equivalent subset sum.\n\nI worked through special cases and examples to build my confidence in my approach. The cases such as n=1 were checked to ensure the condition, while the basic solution works for larger sizes.\n\nThe final strategy is: (1) read and handle the special cases where `n` equals 1, (2) sort the input array, and (3) apply the one-position cyclic shift to the sorted array. After verifying that these steps hold, I feel the solution is solid.\n\nThe time complexity is pretty good, O(N log N), which is fast enough for the given constraints (N <= 22). It's very fast.\n\nI'm confident this cyclic-shift solution, applied to a sorted array, is the best approach for this problem!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements at these indices in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these indices in `b`.\n\nLet's denote the given array as `a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`. We need to construct `b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]` such that `b` is a permutation of `a`, and for any `S` with `0 < |S| < n`, `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nIf `n = 1`, the condition `0 < |S| < n` becomes `0 < |S| < 1`, which means there are no such subsets `S`. Therefore, any permutation `b` works. The only permutation of `a = [a_0]` is `b = [a_0]` itself. So, we simply print `a_0`.\n\n**Case n >= 2:**\nConsider sorting the array `a` first. Let the sorted array be `a'_0 < a'_1 < ... < a'_{n-1}`. Since `a` contains distinct integers, all `a'_i` are strictly increasing.\nNow, let's construct `b` by cyclically shifting the sorted array `a'` by one position. That is, `b_i = a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\nFor example, if `a' = [x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}]`, then `b = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}, x_0]`.\nThis `b` is clearly a permutation of `a'` (and thus a permutation of the original `a`).\n\nWe need to prove that this construction satisfies the condition: `sum_{i in S} a'_i != sum_{i in S} b_i` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a'_i - b_i) != 0`.\nLet `d_i = a'_i - b_i = a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\nThe terms `d_i` are:\n* `d_0 = a'_0 - a'_1`\n* `d_1 = a'_1 - a'_2`\n* ...\n* `d_{n-2} = a'_{n-2} - a'_{n-1}`\n* `d_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0`\n\nSince `a'` is sorted and contains distinct elements:\n* `a'_i < a'_{i+1}` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`. Thus, `d_i < 0` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`.\n* `a'_{n-1} > a'_0` (because `n >= 2` and elements are distinct). Thus, `d_{n-1} > 0`.\n\nNow, consider `sum_{i in S} d_i`.\n1.  **If `n-1` is not in `S`**: All indices `i` in `S` are from `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`. For these indices, `d_i < 0`. Since `S` is non-empty, `sum_{i in S} d_i` will be a sum of negative numbers, which is strictly negative. Therefore, `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0`.\n\n2.  **If `n-1` is in `S`**: `d_{n-1}` is the only positive term. All other terms `d_i` for `i in S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}` are negative.\n    Let `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. `S'` is a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    The sum is `sum_{i in S} d_i = d_{n-1} + sum_{i in S'} d_i`.\n    Substituting the definitions of `d_i`:\n    `sum_{i in S} d_i = (a'_{n-1} - a'_0) + sum_{i in S'} (a'_i - a'_{i+1})`.\n    We want to show this sum is not zero.\n    This is equivalent to showing `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 != -sum_{i in S'} (a'_i - a'_{i+1})`.\n    Which simplifies to `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 != sum_{i in S'} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)`.\n\n    Let `P_j = a'_{j+1} - a'_j` for `j = 0, ..., n-2`. Since `a'` is sorted and distinct, all `P_j > 0`.\n    The sum `a'_{n-1} - a'_0` can be written as a telescoping sum:\n    `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 = (a'_1 - a'_0) + (a'_2 - a'_1) + ... + (a'_{n-1} - a'_{n-2}) = P_0 + P_1 + ... + P_{n-2}`.\n\n    So the condition becomes `P_0 + P_1 + ... + P_{n-2} != sum_{i in S'} P_i`.\n    `S'` is a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    Since `0 < |S| < n`, `S` cannot be the full set of indices `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.\n    If `S` were the full set, then `S'` would be `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    But since `S` is a proper subset (`|S| < n`), `S'` cannot be equal to `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`. This means `S'` must be a proper subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n    Since all `P_j > 0`, a sum over a proper subset of indices `sum_{i in S'} P_i` will be strictly less than the sum over all indices `P_0 + P_1 + ... + P_{n-2}`.\n    Therefore, `sum_{i in S'} P_i != P_0 + P_1 + ... + P_{n-2}`.\n    This implies `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0`.\n\nSince `sum_{i in S} d_i` is never zero for `0 < |S| < n`, this construction always works for `n >= 2`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. If `n == 1`, print `a[0]`.\n4. Otherwise (`n >= 2`):\n   a. Sort the array `a` in ascending order.\n   b. Create a new array `b` where `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n   c. Print the elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n2\n1 2\nSorted `a`: `[1, 2]`\n`b[0] = a[(0+1)%2] = a[1] = 2`\n`b[1] = a[(1+1)%2] = a[0] = 1`\nOutput: `2 1`\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n4\n1000 100 10 1\nSorted `a`: `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`\n`b[0] = a[1] = 10`\n`b[1] = a[2] = 100`\n`b[2] = a[3] = 1000`\n`b[3] = a[0] = 1`\nOutput: `10 100 1000 1` (This is a valid answer, even if it differs from the example's output, as multiple answers are allowed).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices (0 < k < 1 is impossible).\n        # So, any permutation works.
