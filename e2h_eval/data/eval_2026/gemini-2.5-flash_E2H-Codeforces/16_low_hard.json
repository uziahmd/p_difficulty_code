Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Crazy Town\" problem.  The goal is to figure out the fewest road crossings needed to get from home to the university.  I've broken it down step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n*   I've got the home coordinates `(x1, y1)`, university `(x2, y2)`, and a bunch of roads represented as linear equations: `ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0`.\n*   I can't just move directly, I can only traverse blocks created by these roads. Sharing a non-zero length border between blocks allows a move.\n*   I can't move if they are adjacent at an intersection but don't share a border, which essentially means no crossing.\n*   The math has to work to ensure no edge cases occur based on how the roads are defined.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\n\n*   The key is understanding that each road splits the plane into two regions.  I'm dealing with signs: `ai*x + bi*y + ci` will be either positive, negative, or zero for any point `(x, y)`.  Since the home and university are guaranteed not to be *on* any roads, I know I'm always working with positive or negative signs.\n*   If home and university are in the *same* block, it means all the signs are consistent for all roads: `sgn(ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci)` equals `sgn(ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci)` for every road `i`.  In this case, zero steps are required.\n*   If they're in *different* blocks, I need to cross roads. Crossing a road changes the sign of its corresponding expression; all other signs stay the same.\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\n\n*   For each road, I need to compare the sign of `ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` (home) and `ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci` (university).\n*   If the signs are different, I need to cross that road (increment the step count). If they are the same, no crossing is needed.\n*   So basically, I iterate through all the roads and count how many times the signs are different.  That count is the minimum number of steps.  Simple. I think I have a direct solution for this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block to a destination block. A \"step\" is defined as moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. This effectively means crossing a single road.\n\nEach road is defined by a linear equation `ax + by + c = 0`. This line divides the plane into two open half-planes: `ax + by + c > 0` and `ax + by + c < 0`. For any point `(x, y)` not on the line, the expression `ax + by + c` will have a specific sign (positive or negative).\n\nYour home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` are located in specific blocks. A block is a region defined by the intersection of half-planes. To determine which block a point `(x, y)` belongs to, we can evaluate `ax + by + c` for each road `(a, b, c)` and note the sign. The set of signs across all roads uniquely identifies the block (assuming the point is not on any road).\n\nIf your home and the university are in the same block, you need 0 steps. This would mean that for *every* road `i`, your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` lie on the same side of road `i`. That is, `(ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci)` and `(ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci)` have the same sign for all `i`.\n\nIf your home and the university are in different blocks, you need to cross roads. When you cross a road `k`, you move from a block where `ak*x + bk*y + ck` has one sign to a block where it has the opposite sign. For all other roads `j != k`, you remain on the same side of road `j`.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required to get from the home block to the university block is simply the count of roads `i` for which the home and university are on *opposite* sides. If they are on opposite sides of road `i`, you *must* cross road `i` at some point to reach the university block from the home block. If they are on the same side of road `i`, you do not need to cross road `i`.\n\nSo, for each road `i` with coefficients `(ai, bi, ci)`:\n1.  Calculate `val1 = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`.\n2.  Calculate `val2 = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n3.  If `val1` and `val2` have different signs, increment a counter. `val1` and `val2` will never be zero because the problem guarantees that home and university are not on any road.\n    We can check for different signs by checking if `val1 * val2 < 0`.\n\nThe final value of the counter will be the minimum number of steps.\n\nExample:\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (i.e., y=0)\nRoad 2: 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 (i.e., x=0)\n\nFor Road 1 (0, 1, 0):\n`val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n`val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n`val1 * val2 = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Different signs. Increment counter. Counter = 1.\n\nFor Road 2 (1, 0, 0):\n`val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n`val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n`val1 * val2 = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Different signs. Increment counter. Counter = 2.\n\nTotal steps = 2.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read road coefficients\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for home\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for university\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have different signs, it means home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this road.\n        # Since neither home nor university lie on any road, val1 and val2 will never be zero.\n        # We can check for different signs by checking if their product is negative.\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    # Print the minimum number of steps\n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
