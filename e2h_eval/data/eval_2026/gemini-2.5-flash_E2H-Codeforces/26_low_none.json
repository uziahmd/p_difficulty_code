    "thought": "**Analyzing Triangle Inequality Constraints for Integer Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of counting non-degenerate triangles with integer side lengths. The core is the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. I've got these ranges: `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`. The key insight here is to simplify things by recognizing what the constraints inherently imply.\n\nSince the side lengths are positive, and the ranges are defined with all values at least 1, the range constraints automatically establish that `x <= y <= z`. This critical understanding allows us to discard two of the triangle inequalities as redundant! We're left only needing to verify that `x + y > z`.\n\nThis drastically streamlines the problem. Now, the challenge is efficiently counting the valid triples `(x, y, z)` satisfying `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, `C <= z <= D`, and crucially, `x + y > z`. A naive triple nested loop would be computationally infeasible given the magnitude of `D`. I need to devise a more clever, likely iterative, approach to count these combinations. Perhaps using some kind of sliding window or prefix sum approach. I'll need to explore some more efficient algorithms to avoid that costly cubic time complexity.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given constraints on `x, y, z`:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n\nFrom these, it's clear that `x <= B <= y <= C <= z`. This implies `x <= y` and `y <= z`.\nTherefore, we always have `x <= y <= z`.\n\nFor a non-degenerate triangle with sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequalities must hold:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nSince we established `x <= y <= z`:\n- `x + z > y`: As `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: As `y >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`, `y + z >= x + 1 > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nSo, the only triangle inequality we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the number of integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet's iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` and then count valid `z` values.\nThe range for `x` is `[A, B]`.\nThe range for `y` is `[B, C]`.\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, the conditions for `z` are:\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z < x + y`\n\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z < x + y`.\nAlso, `z` must not exceed `D`. So, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of such `z` values for fixed `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive solution would be to iterate `x` from `A` to `B`, `y` from `B` to `C`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, calculate the count of `z`. This would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be up to `O((5*10^5)^2)`, too slow.\n\nWe need a faster way to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` over all valid `x, y`.\nLet `max_z = x + y - 1`. The number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, max_z) - C + 1)`.\nLet `k = x + y`. The condition is `z < k`. So `z` must be in `[C, min(D, k - 1)]`.\nThe sum is `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe maximum value for `x + y` is `B + C`. The minimum value is `A + B`.\nLet `S = x + y`. The range for `S` is `[A+B, B+C]`.\nFor a fixed sum `S`, the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = S` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C` is needed.\nThis is a common subproblem: count pairs `(x, y)` with `x+y=S` in given ranges.\n`x` ranges from `A` to `B`.\n`y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nSo `x` must be in `[A, B]`.\n`y = S - x`. So `B <= S - x <= C`.\nThis means `S - C <= x <= S - B`.\nCombining these, `x` must be in `[max(A, S-C), min(B, S-B)]`.\nThe number of such `x` values for a fixed `S` is `max(0, min(B, S-B) - max(A, S-C) + 1)`. Let's call this `count_xy(S)`.\n\nNow the total count of triangles is `sum_{S=A+B to B+C} count_xy(S) * max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThe range of `S` is up to `B+C`, which can be `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nThis sum still takes `O(B+C)` time, which is `O(10^6)`, feasible.\n\nLet's precompute `count_xy(S)` for all possible `S`.\nThe `count_xy(S)` function can be rewritten:\nLet `x_min = max(A, S-C)` and `x_max = min(B, S-B)`.\n`count_xy(S) = x_max - x_min + 1` if `x_max >= x_min`, else `0`.\n\nThe terms `max(A, S-C)` and `min(B, S-B)` are piecewise linear.\n`S-C` increases by 1 when `S` increases by 1.\n`S-B` increases by 1 when `S` increases by 1.\nThis suggests that `count_xy(S)` changes values in a structured way.\nWe can use a difference array or prefix sums approach.\n\nLet `f[k]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x+y=k`, `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\n`f[k] = min(B, k-B) - max(A, k-C) + 1` (if positive, else 0).\nThe range for `k` is `[A+B, B+C]`.\nLet `upper_x = min(B, k-B)`.\nLet `lower_x = max(A, k-C)`.\n`f[k] = upper_x - lower_x + 1` (if `upper_x >= lower_x`).\n\nWe can compute `f[k]` efficiently using a sweep-line or difference array approach.\nConsider `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nSo `x+y` ranges from `x+B` to `x+C`.\nFor a fixed `x`, we add 1 to `f[k]` for `k` in `[x+B, x+C]`.\nThis is a range update. A difference array can handle this.\nInitialize `diff` array of size `B+C+2` to zeros.\nFor `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `diff[x+B] += 1`\n  `diff[x+C+1] -= 1`\n\nAfter processing all `x` values:\n`f[k]` can be computed by taking prefix sums of `diff`.\n`f[k] = f[k-1] + diff[k]` for `k` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\n`f[A+B] = diff[A+B]`.\n\nThe maximum value `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nThe `diff` array needs to be of size `10^6 + 2`.\nThis precomputation takes `O(B-A+1)` for `diff` array updates and `O(B+C)` for prefix sums. Total `O(B+C)`.\n\nAfter computing all `f[k]` values:\nThe total count of triangles is `sum_{k=A+B to B+C} f[k] * max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `num_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis sum takes `O(B+C)` time.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(B+C)`.\nTotal space complexity: `O(B+C)` for `diff` and `f` arrays.\nGiven `D <= 5 * 10^5`, `B+C <= 10^6`. This is well within limits.\n\nLet's trace the logic with an example: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`.\n`x` in `[1, 2]`, `y` in `[2, 3]`, `z` in `[3, 4]`.\n`diff` array size up to `B+C+2 = 2+3+2 = 7`.\nInitialize `diff = [0]*7`.\n\nFor `x=1`:\n  `x+B = 1+2 = 3`. `x+C+1 = 1+3+1 = 5`.\n  `diff[3] += 1`\n  `diff[5] -= 1`\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\nFor `x=2`:\n  `x+B = 2+2 = 4`. `x+C+1 = 2+3+1 = 6`.\n  `diff[4] += 1`\n  `diff[6] -= 1`\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1]`\n\nCompute `f[k]` (number of `(x,y)` pairs summing to `k`):\n`f[k]` for `k` from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n`f[3] = diff[3] = 1`. (Pair: `x=1, y=2`)\n`f[4] = f[3] + diff[4] = 1 + 1 = 2`. (Pairs: `x=1, y=3`; `x=2, y=2`)\n`f[5] = f[4] + diff[5] = 2 + (-1) = 1`. (Pair: `x=2, y=3`)\n`f` array: `f[3]=1, f[4]=2, f[5]=1`. Other `f[k]=0`.\n\nNow calculate total triangles: `sum_{k=3 to 5} f[k] * num_z(k)`.\n`num_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k-1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(4, k-1) - 3 + 1)`.\n\n`k=3`: `f[3]=1`.\n  `num_z(3) = max(0, min(4, 3-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 2) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n  (This means for `x+y=3`, `z` must be `<3`. But `z>=C=3`, so no `z` is possible. Correct.)\n\n`k=4`: `f[4]=2`.\n  `num_z(4) = max(0, min(4, 4-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n  Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`.\n  (For `x+y=4`, `z` must be `<4`. So `z=3`. `z=3` is in `[3,4]`. Valid. Pairs `(1,3), (2,2)` with `z=3` give triangles `(1,3,3), (2,2,3)`.)\n\n`k=5`: `f[5]=1`.\n  `num_z(5) = max(0, min(4, 5-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 4) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2) = 2`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 2 = 2`.\n  (For `x+y=5`, `z` must be `<5`. So `z` can be `3` or `4`. Both `z=3, z=4` are in `[3,4]`. Valid. Pair `(2,3)` with `z=3` gives `(2,3,3)`. Pair `(2,3)` with `z=4` gives `(2,3,4)`.)\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.\nThis matches the first example output.\n\nThe maximum value for any side is `D`, which is `5 * 10^5`.\nThe maximum sum `k` is `B+C`, which is `2 * 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nSo, arrays of size `10^6 + 2` are needed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Max possible sum x+y is B+C.
