            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Card Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The core of it is Vanya and his cards. He's got a bunch of cards with given numbers, and he wants to end up with a total sum of zero. The tricky part is he can get new cards, but each new card's value is limited to a range from `-x` to `x`.  My task is to figure out the *minimum* number of new cards Vanya needs to reach that zero sum.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the situation. I calculate the current sum, let's call it `S`, of the cards he already has. That sum is the crucial starting point.\n\nIf `S` is already zero, great! No additional cards are needed. The answer's just 0, and I can move on.\n\nBut, and this is the likely scenario, `S` is not zero. Vanya needs to get that sum to zero, so he's got to add cards with a value that's equal and opposite to `S`. Let’s call the value of the new cards `v`. So: -x <= v <= x.\n\nThe key to the solution is *minimization*. I want the fewest number of new cards possible. So, each new card should contribute as much as possible towards getting that sum to zero.\n\nIf `S` is positive, Vanya needs to add negative numbers. To get the sum down as quickly as possible, he should add the most negative card possible, which is `-x`. I then figure out how many `-x` cards are needed to at least get the sum to be zero or less. I determine this by `ceil(S/x)`.\n\nIf `S` is negative, he needs to add positive numbers. To minimize the number of cards, Vanya should use the largest number possible, which is `x`. I figure out how many `x` cards are needed to get the sum to be zero or more. I determine this by `ceil(-S/x)`.\n\nI then realized that both cases converge to the same principle, `ceil(|S| / x)`. That's the solution. Calculate the absolute value of the sum, divide it by the maximum possible card value, and then round up. This gets me the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find. Boom. Done.\n",
