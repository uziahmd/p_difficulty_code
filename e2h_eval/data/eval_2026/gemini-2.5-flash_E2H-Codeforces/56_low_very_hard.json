Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Guard Duty Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and immediately, the small constraints jump out at me.  `R` and `B` being less than or equal to 10 means an exponential-time solution is likely feasible. That's good news; it simplifies things.\n\nFirst, I need to make a quick check: if the number of Rebel spaceships (`R`) doesn't equal the number of bases (`B`), I know right away the answer is \"No\".  We need a one-to-one perfect matching, so that's the first thing I'll check.\n\nThe meat of the problem is the geometric constraint:  \"any two paths...do not intersect.\"  That translates to line segments not crossing. I'll need a way to efficiently determine if any two segments representing the spaceship-base assignments intersect.\n\nThinking about it, I remember a robust way to check for segment intersection. Given two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4), they intersect if and only if two conditions are met:  p1 and p2 are on opposite sides of the line defined by (p3, p4), AND p3 and p4 are on opposite sides of the line defined by (p1, p2).\n\nHow do I determine \"opposite sides\"?  The cross product comes to mind.  Given points a, b, and c, `cross_product(a, b, c)` gives me the 'z' component of their 3D cross product, and that tells me which side of the line (a, b) point c lies on. A positive value means 'left', a negative value means 'right', and crucially, the problem states that no three points will be collinear. This means that I don't need to consider the case of 0 (which would be 'collinear'). The guarantee \"no three points are on the same line\" really simplifies this for me.\n\nSo, I'll iterate through all possible pairings (permutations) of spaceships to bases. For each pairing, I'll calculate the cross product for each pair of segments and verify the intersection rule. If any pair of segments intersect, that pairing is invalid. If, after checking all pairings, I find a non-intersecting configuration, I can output \"Yes\".  Otherwise, if I exhaust all permutations and nothing works, it's \"No\". The Python code should be relatively straightforward to implement, given the small input size.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a perfect matching between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two assigned paths (straight lines connecting a spaceship to its base) intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching is only possible if the number of spaceships `R` is equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, we can immediately say \"No\".\n\nGiven `R = B`, we need to find a permutation `P` of bases (indices `0` to `R-1`) such that if spaceship `i` is connected to base `P[i]`, no two segments `(spaceship_i, base_P[i])` and `(spaceship_j, base_P[j])` intersect for `i != j`.\n\nThe constraint `R, B <= 10` suggests that we can try all possible permutations of assignments. There are `R!` such permutations. For `R = 10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is feasible.\n\nFor each permutation:\n1.  Form the set of `R` segments: `(Rebel[i], Base[P[i]])` for `i` from `0` to `R-1`.\n2.  Check all pairs of these segments for intersection. If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n3.  If no pair intersects, then this permutation is a valid assignment, and we can output \"Yes\" and terminate.\n\nIf we iterate through all `R!` permutations and none of them are valid, then we output \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check:**\nTwo line segments `(p1, p2)` and `(p3, p4)` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p1` and `p2` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `(p3, p4)`.\n2.  `p3` and `p4` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `(p1, p2)`.\n\nWe can determine which side a point `c` lies with respect to a directed line `(a, b)` using the `z`-component of the cross product of vectors `(b - a)` and `(c - a)`. Let `A = (ax, ay)`, `B = (bx, by)`, `C = (cx, cy)`.\nThe cross product `cross_product(A, B, C) = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)`.\n*   If `cross_product(A, B, C) > 0`, `C` is to the \"left\" of `AB`.\n*   If `cross_product(A, B, C) < 0`, `C` is to the \"right\" of `AB`.\n*   If `cross_product(A, B, C) = 0`, `C` is collinear with `A` and `B`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", we don't need to worry about the `cross_product = 0` case for distinct points `A, B, C`. This simplifies the intersection check to:\n`segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4)` is true if:\n`(cross_product(p1, p2, p3) * cross_product(p1, p2, p4) < 0)` AND\n`(cross_product(p3, p4, p1) * cross_product(p3, p4, p2) < 0)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n3.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n4.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n5.  Define a helper function `cross_product(p1, p2, p3)` to calculate `(p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)`.\n6.  Define a helper function `segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2)` using the `cross_product` function.\n7.  Iterate through all permutations of `range(R)` (representing base indices) using `itertools.permutations`.\n8.  For each `permutation`:\n    a.  Assume the current permutation is valid (`is_valid_permutation = True`).\n    b.  Create a list of segments for this permutation: `segments = [(rebels[i], bases[permutation[i]]) for i in range(R)]`.\n    c.  Iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(seg1, seg2)` from `segments`.\n    d.  If `segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1])` is `True`:\n        i.  Set `is_valid_permutation = False`.\n        ii. Break from the inner loop (no need to check further pairs for this permutation).\n    e.  If `is_valid_permutation` is still `True` after checking all pairs:\n        i.  Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n9.  If the loop finishes without finding any valid permutation, print \"No\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function to calculate the z-component of the cross product of vectors (p2-p1) and (p3-p1)\n# This determines the orientation of p3 with respect to the directed line segment p1-p2.\n# > 0 means p3 is to the left, < 0 means p3 is to the right, = 0 means p3 is collinear.\ndef cross_product(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Helper function to check if two line segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) intersect.\n# Assumes no three points are collinear (guaranteed by problem statement).\ndef segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n    # Check if p1 and p2 are on opposite sides of the line (p3, p4)\n    o1 = cross_product(p3, p4, p1)\n    o2 = cross_product(p3, p4, p2)\n\n    # Check if p3 and p4 are on opposite sides of the line (p1, p2)\n    o3 = cross_product(p1, p2, p3)\n    o4 = cross_product(p1, p2, p4)\n\n    # If all four cross products are non-zero and signs are opposite for each pair,\n    # then the segments intersect strictly.\n    # The problem guarantees no three points are collinear, so o1,o2,o3,o4 will not be 0\n    # unless one of the points is an endpoint of the other segment, which is also\n    # implicitly handled by the strict inequality for non-collinear points.\n    return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of base assignments for rebels.\n    # A permutation 'p' means rebel[i] is assigned to bases[p[i]].\n    for p in permutations(range(R)):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            current_segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p[i]]))\n\n        is_valid_permutation = True\n        # Check all unique pairs of segments for intersection\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R): # j starts from i+1 to avoid checking same pair twice or segment with itself\n                seg1_p1, seg1_p2 = current_segments[i]\n                seg2_p1, seg2_p2 = current_segments[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(seg1_p1, seg1_p2, seg2_p1, seg2_p2):\n                    is_valid_permutation = False\n                    break # Found an intersection, this permutation is invalid\n            if not is_valid_permutation:\n                break # Break from outer loop if inner loop already found intersection\n\n        if is_valid_permutation:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    # If no valid permutation was found after checking all of them\n    print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
