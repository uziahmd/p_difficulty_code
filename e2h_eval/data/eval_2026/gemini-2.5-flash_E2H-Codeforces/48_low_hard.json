            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan for this base conversion script.**\n\nI'm starting with a problem that requires converting a number `c` from base `a` to base `b`. The really interesting part is that `b` can be either an integer or the Roman numeral representation 'R'.\n\nLet's break this down systematically. I'll need to:\n\n1.  **Get the Input:** Read in `a`, `b_str`, and `c_str`. It's straightforward: read the first line and split it, then read the second line.\n\n2.  **Convert to Decimal:** The core of the problem is converting `c_str`, which is in base `a`, into decimal. This means I'll need to parse `c_str` character by character. Digits 0-9 are easy. For digits beyond 9 (up to 24, since `a` goes up to 25), I can use A-O (or, using ASCII values is a clean and flexible approach). I'll write a helper function, `digit_to_int(char)`, to handle this mapping. I can iterate through the string and apply the standard base conversion formula: `decimal_value = decimal_value * a + digit_val`. This will be more efficient for large numbers.\n\n3.  **Convert to Base `b`:** This is where things get interesting.\n    *   **Integer `b`:** If `b_str` is an integer, I'll need to convert the decimal number to that base. This is also a standard process – repeated division and taking the remainders. I can store the remainders in a list and then reverse them to get the base `b` representation.\n    *   **Roman Numerals (`b_str` == 'R'):** If `b_str` is 'R', I'll need to convert the decimal number into Roman numerals. I'll need to look up the algorithm and structure the conversions according to the Roman numeral rules.\n\n4.  **Handle Leading Zeros:**  I need to be careful with any leading zeros in the input `c_str`. The output should omit them. I'll need to trim these off, but only after I have performed the base conversion.\n\nThis should be a relatively efficient solution. The calculations involved in base conversion can get large, so I need to make sure the data types can handle those large numbers.\n",
