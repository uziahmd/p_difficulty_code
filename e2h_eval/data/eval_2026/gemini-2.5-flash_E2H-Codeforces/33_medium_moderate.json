You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Refined Greedy Approach for \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's pretty straightforward: given a number (`a`) and some digits we can use (`s`), maximize the resulting number by replacing digits in `a` with those from `s`. The key is maximizing from the left – the most significant digits matter most.\n\nSo, the strategy that makes the most sense is a greedy one. We'll sort the digits in `s` in descending order. This way, we always pick the largest available digit from `s` when trying to improve `a`. We iterate through `a`, from left to right. For each digit in `a`, we look for a digit from `s` that's *strictly* greater. If we find one, we replace that digit in `a`, and we move on to the next digit. If there isn't a greater digit, we leave the current digit in `a` as it is.\n\nThe trick is how we manage `s`. Since the order matters, we need to sort it. And we have to keep track of what's been used. We use a pointer to iterate through `s`. If the current digit in `s` can replace the current digit in `a`, we make the swap *and* increment the pointer. If the digit in `s` is not greater than the digit in `a`, we don't increment the pointer. Crucially, the biggest insight I had was not to discard the current digit in `s` even if it couldn't be used immediately. It could come in handy later.\n\nThis approach is efficient, has a time complexity of O(n + m log m), where n is the length of a and m is the length of s, and should be correct. Edge cases are handled correctly too. So, all in all, I think this greedy algorithm nails it.\n",
