Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Mister B and the Angle Conundrum**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands: \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" The goal is to figure out the closest angle, formed by three vertices of a regular n-gon, to a given target angle 'a'. It's a classic geometry problem, but the constraint on 'n' (up to 10^5) tells me I can't brute-force it.\n\nI need a Python script to solve this efficiently. The core of this problem lies in understanding the geometry of regular polygons and how angles are formed. I recall some basic facts: the central angle subtended by each side is 360/n, and the interior angle is (n-2)*180/n. More importantly, the angle formed by three vertices is an inscribed angle, and that’s the key.\n\nLet's assume the vertices are numbered 1 to n. Without losing generality, I can fix one vertex, say vertex 1, as the vertex where the target angle is formed. Now I need to choose two other vertices, let's call them vertex (1+i) and (1+j). The problem is determining the angles I can get by varying i and j.\n\nThe angle formed at vertex 1 depends on how many sides separate (1+i) and (1+j) *not* passing through 1. I was initially thinking of the indices modulo n but that's not quite right. After careful review, if I consider (1+i) and (1+j) as vertices 'x' and 'y' such that 'i' sides go from '1' to 'x' and 'j' sides go from '1' to 'y', then the inscribed angle subtends an arc. That arc is (i+j) sides long. So the angle is just half of the central angle spanning (i+j) sides. That means the angle is (i+j) * (180/n).\n\nSo it boils down to finding the closest value of (i+j) * (180/n) to my target angle 'a'. I need to make sure 'i' and 'j' are distinct, between 1 and n-1, so 2 <= (i+j) <= n. This should give me the core logic for my Python solution: iterate through possible values of (i+j) within that range, calculate the corresponding angle, and track the minimum difference between the calculated angle and the target. Time to code it up!\n",
