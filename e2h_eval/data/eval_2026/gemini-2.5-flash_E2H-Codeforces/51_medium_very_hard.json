Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Pile of Letters Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem to solve.  The goal is to determine if a pile of letters can be formed by combining letters from two names.  Essentially, it's a character anagram check.\n\nMy approach is to use character counting. Here's my thought process:\n\n1.  **Input:**  I'll read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters as input strings.\n2.  **Combine the Names:** First, I'll combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3.  **Count Characters:**  Then, I'll count the frequency of each character in the combined names and the pile of letters.  My go-to here is Python's `collections.Counter` â€“ super convenient! Alternatively, I could use an array to store counts for each letter.\n4.  **Compare Frequencies:**  Finally, I'll compare the frequency maps. If they are identical, meaning each character has the same count, I can print \"YES\". Otherwise, I'll print \"NO.\"\n\nI've carefully considered the constraints, and this method should be efficient enough, given the maximum string lengths (around 100 characters).  It's O(n) in time complexity.  It's also pretty clean, I think, and easy to understand. Using `Counter` is the more readable version. I'm ready to write the code.\n",
