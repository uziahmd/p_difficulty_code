            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mahjong Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the fewest extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to form at least one \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) given three initial tiles.  These tiles are represented as number-suit pairs, which makes things easier to parse.\n\nMy initial thought is that we probably won't need to draw more than two tiles. With just the initial three, drawing two makes five, and with five tiles, we can almost certainly find a combination. The problem focuses on minimizing the *extra* tiles, so let's start with the easiest scenario.\n\n**Case 0: No Extra Tiles Needed**\n\nFirst, I need to check if the three tiles already form a mentsu.  This boils down to checking for koutsu (three identical tiles) or shuntsu (three consecutive tiles of the same suit).  The koutsu check is straightforward: all three tiles must be identical. The shuntsu check is slightly more complex, requiring me to verify that all the tiles share the same suit and that their numbers are sequential.\n\n**Case 1: One Extra Tile**\n\nIf the initial tiles don't form a mentsu, I have to consider drawing one extra tile. The logic here is: can I find *any* tile to draw that, combined with the initial three, creates a mentsu?  This essentially means checking if I can create a koutsu or shuntsu, when pairing one of the initial tiles with the extra one. In simpler words, I can check all possible cases where the drawn tile will form the required group with at least two other tiles, or one of the original tiles will group up with the two identical drawn tiles.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nI need to develop a systematic approach to check these cases. I'll need to define a function to determine if any group of tiles will form either a shuntsu or a koutsu. Let's start coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, which can be 0, 1, or 2. It's guaranteed that 2 draws are always sufficient (e.g., drawing two tiles identical to one of the existing tiles forms a koutsu).\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile is represented by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). We'll parse these into a more structured format, like `(number, suit)`.\n\nThe strategy is to check for 0 draws, then 1 draw, and if neither works, the answer is 2.\n\n**1. Check for 0 extra draws:**\nThis means the initial three tiles `t1, t2, t3` already form a mentsu.\n   *   **Koutsu:** Check if `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` are all identical.\n   *   **Shuntsu:** Check if `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` are all of the same suit, and their numbers are sequential (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`). To do this, sort the numbers and check if `num[0] + 1 == num[1]` and `num[1] + 1 == num[2]`.\n\nIf either condition is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Check for 1 extra draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not enough, we need to check if drawing one additional tile `t_draw` can form a mentsu with the existing `t1, t2, t3`. This means that among the four tiles `t1, t2, t3, t_draw`, there must be a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible tiles `t_draw` (9 numbers * 3 suits = 27 possibilities). For each `t_draw`, we form a hand of four tiles: `[t1, t2, t3, t_draw]`. Then we check if any three tiles from this hand form a mentsu.\nA more efficient approach is to consider how `t_draw` can complete a mentsu with `t1, t2, t3`:\n\n   *   **Complete a Koutsu:**\n      *   If `t1 == t2`, `t_draw` could be `t1` (or `t2`).\n      *   If `t1 == t3`, `t_draw` could be `t1` (or `t3`).\n      *   If `t2 == t3`, `t_draw` could be `t2` (or `t3`).\n      If any two initial tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile forms a koutsu.\n   *   **Complete a Shuntsu:**\n      *   If `t1` and `t2` are of the same suit:\n         *   If `num(t1) == num(t2) + 1` or `num(t2) == num(t1) + 1`, `t_draw` could be `num(t1) - 1` or `num(t1) + 2` (or similar for `t2`). For example, if we have `2m, 3m`, we can draw `1m` or `4m`.\n         *   If `num(t1) == num(t2) + 2` or `num(t2) == num(t1) + 2`, `t_draw` could be `num(t1) - 1` or `num(t1) + 1` (the middle tile). For example, if we have `2m, 4m`, we can draw `3m`.\n      *   Repeat this logic for pairs `(t1, t3)` and `(t2, t3)`.\n\nWe can collect all unique \"target\" tiles that would complete a koutsu or shuntsu with any pair of `t1, t2, t3`. If such a target tile exists, and it's a valid tile (number 1-9), then 1 draw is sufficient.\n\nA simpler way to check for 1 draw:\nIterate through all 27 possible tiles `t_draw`. Add `t_draw` to the initial hand. Now we have 4 tiles. Check all `C(4,3) = 4` combinations of 3 tiles from this hand. If any of these 3-tile combinations form a mentsu, then 1 draw is sufficient. If we find at least one `t_draw` that works, the answer is 1.\n\n**3. Check for 2 extra draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, the answer is 2. This is always possible. For example, pick `t1`. Draw two more tiles identical to `t1`. Now you have `t1, t1, t1` (a koutsu).\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nInput: `3p 9m 2p`\n\n1.  **Parse tiles:**\n    `t1 = (3, 'p')`\n    `t2 = (9, 'm')`\n    `t3 = (2, 'p')`\n\n2.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   **Koutsu:** Are `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')` identical? No.\n    *   **Shuntsu:**\n        *   Same suit: No, `m` and `p` suits are present.\n    So, 0 draws is not the answer.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    We need to find if there's a `t_draw` that can form a mentsu.\n    Let's consider pairs from `t1, t2, t3`:\n    *   **Pair `(t1, t3)` = `(3, 'p'), (2, 'p')`:**\n        *   Same suit ('p'). Numbers are 2, 3.\n        *   To form a shuntsu, we need `1p` (2-1=1) or `4p` (3+1=4).\n        *   If we draw `1p`, the hand becomes `[3p, 9m, 2p, 1p]`. This contains `[1p, 2p, 3p]`, which is a shuntsu.\n        *   If we draw `4p`, the hand becomes `[3p, 9m, 2p, 4p]`. This contains `[2p, 3p, 4p]`, which is a shuntsu.\n        Since we found a `t_draw` (`1p` or `4p`) that works, the answer is 1.\n\n    The minimum number of extra tiles needed is 1.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Represent tiles as `(int, str)` tuples.\n*   Sorting tiles helps for shuntsu checks.\n*   A helper function `check_mentsu(hand)` that takes a list of 3 tiles and returns `True` if they form a mentsu, `False` otherwise.\n*   A helper function `check_hand_for_mentsu(hand)` that takes a list of 4 tiles, iterates through all `C(4,3)` combinations, and uses `check_mentsu` on each.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    s = input().split()\n    tiles_str = s\n\n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a mentsu\n    def is_mentsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        # Koutsu check (three identical tiles)\n        if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n            return True\n\n        # Shuntsu check (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n        if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]: # Same suit\n            nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n            if nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Check for 0 extra draws\n    # The initial three tiles already form a mentsu\n    if is_mentsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 1 extra draw\n    # We need to find if there's any tile t_draw such that (tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2], t_draw) contains a mentsu\n    \n    # Generate all possible tiles (1m-9m, 1p-9p, 1s-9s)\n    all_possible_tiles = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            all_possible_tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    for t_draw in all_possible_tiles:\n        current_hand = tiles + [t_draw]\n        \n        # Check all combinations of 3 tiles from the 4-tile hand\n        found_mentsu_with_one_draw = False\n        for combo in itertools.combinations(current_hand, 3):\n            if is_mentsu(combo[0], combo[1], combo[2]):\n                found_mentsu_with_one_draw = True\n                break\n        \n        if found_mentsu_with_one_draw:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # If 0 or 1 extra draws didn't work, then 2 extra draws are always sufficient.\n    # For example, draw two tiles identical to tiles[0] to form a koutsu.\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
