And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the average sleep time over a certain period. The setup is straightforward enough: I'm given the total number of days, *n*, the length of a \"week\" which is *k*, and the sleep times recorded for each day. The goal is to compute the average sleep time across all possible *k*-day periods within the *n* days.\n\nI'm processing a pretty common type of problem here, but the efficiency is going to be key. I know there will be a lot of consecutive sums.\n\nFirst, I defined the \"problem\" by understanding the input constraints and what I need to produce as output. There will be `n - k + 1` possible weeks, and my final output is a single floating-point value.\n\nMy initial thought, the \"naive\" approach, involves iterating through all possible weeks and calculating the sum of sleep times for each one. This can be easily implemented with nested loops. However, the time complexity of this approach is `O((n - k + 1) * k)`, where the outer loop iterates over the possible start points of the weeks and the inner loop calculates the sum for each week. It's a clean solution, but quickly I realized that with `n` as large as `2 * 10^5`, this method could become inefficient, especially if *k* is relatively large. If *k* is in the order of *n* the naive approach is `O(n^2)` which is far too slow! I'm used to optimizing these types of solutions, so this becomes an issue.\n\nThe real key here is efficient sum calculation. So, how can I avoid repeatedly computing the same sums? That's when I recall the classic sliding window or prefix sum techniques.\n\nThe prefix sum approach seems ideal. I would create a prefix sum array `P`, where `P[i]` holds the sum of all sleep times from day 0 to day `i-1`. With this `P` array in place, computing the sum for any `k`-day week (say, from day `i` to `i + k - 1`) boils down to a simple subtraction: `P[i + k] - P[i]`. This significantly reduces the time complexity from `O(k)` (for repeated sum calculations) to `O(1)` per week. With the prefix sum array, I can now compute the sums in constant time.\n\nWith this knowledge, the rest is simple: I would precompute the prefix sums, iterate through all valid windows using the prefix sums, calculate the sum for each window, accumulate the total, and finally divide by the total number of weeks to find the average. The total time complexity should now be dominated by the prefix sum pre-computation, which is `O(n)`, and the window iteration `O(n)` making it an overall `O(n)` solution. This feels much better! This is how I'll write my script.\n",
