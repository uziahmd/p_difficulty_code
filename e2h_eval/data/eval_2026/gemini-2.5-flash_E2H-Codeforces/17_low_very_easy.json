He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Prefix/Suffix Puzzle**\n\nAlright, I'm facing a competitive programming challenge. I need to figure out how to identify which of `2n-2` strings are prefixes and suffixes of a secret string `s` of length `n`.  Each input string is a prefix or suffix, but they're all \"improper\" – no full string, just truncated bits.  For every length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, I'm guaranteed to have one prefix of length `k` and one suffix of length `k`.\n\nLet's break down the notation. If `s` is `s_1 s_2 ... s_n`, then prefixes are `p_k = s_1 ... s_k` and suffixes are `suf_k = s_{n-k+1} ... s_n`. My goal is to generate a string of 'P's and 'S's to identify each input string correctly.\n\nThe critical insight lies in the strings of length `n-1`. The prefix `p_{n-1}` is `s_1 s_2 ... s_{n-1}` and the suffix `suf_{n-1}` is `s_2 s_3 ... s_n`. Notice the overlap: `p_{n-1}` except for its last character, is the first part of `suf_{n-1}`.  Essentially, the tail of the prefix overlaps with the beginning of the suffix.  This gives me a way to reconstruct `s`.  If I knew `p_{n-1}` and `suf_{n-1}`, I could concatenate them and figure out which character is missing from the end of the prefix, and from the start of the suffix. So, the complete `s` can be formed as either `p_{n-1} + suf_{n-1}[-1]` or `p_{n-1}[0] + suf_{n-1}`.\n\nI have two strings of length `n-1`, let's call them `str1` and `str2`. One of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix, but I don't know which is which.  I can make an educated guess. I can assume that `str1` is the prefix of length `n-1` (`p_{n-1}`) and `str2` is the suffix of length `n-1` (`suf_{n-1}`) for now. I can concatenate them and test if they work. Crucially, the last `n-2` characters of the prefix must match the first `n-2` characters of the suffix. That's a good consistency check. I can create a candidate string using my assumed prefix and suffix: `s = str1 + str2[-1]`. Then I check if the candidate `s` is consistent with the rest of the given strings.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix of length `k` and the other is the suffix of length `k`.\n\nLet the unknown string be `s`.\nIts prefixes are `s[0]`, `s[0:2]`, ..., `s[0:n-1]`.\nIts suffixes are `s[n-1]`, `s[n-2:n]`, ..., `s[1:n]`.\n\nThe crucial observation is about the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these two strings be `L1` and `L2`.\nOne of them must be the prefix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[0:n-1]`), and the other must be the suffix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[1:n]`).\n\nThere are two possible assignments for `L1` and `L2`:\n\n**Case 1: `L1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L2` is `s[1:n]`**\nIf this is the case, the full string `s` can be reconstructed as `L1 + L2[-1]` (the last character of `L2`).\nAlternatively, `s` can be reconstructed as `L1[0] + L2`.\nFor `s` to be consistent, the part `s[1:n-1]` must be the same in both `L1` and `L2`. That is, `L1[1:]` must be equal to `L2[:-1]`.\nIf `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`, then we have a candidate string `s = L1[0] + L2` (or `L1 + L2[-1]`).\n\n**Case 2: `L2` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L1` is `s[1:n]`**\nSimilarly, if this is the case, the full string `s` would be `L2 + L1[-1]`.\nFor consistency, `L2[1:]` must be equal to `L1[:-1]`.\nIf `L2[1:] == L1[:-1]`, then we have a candidate string `s = L2[0] + L1`.\n\nWe can try both cases. Since the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these cases will lead to a valid `s`. If both lead to valid `s`, any one is fine.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store all `2n-2` input strings, along with their original indices, in a list of tuples `(string, original_index)`.\n3.  Separate the strings by length. Specifically, find the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n\n4.  **Attempt Case 1: Assume `str_A` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_B` is the suffix of length `n-1`.**\n    *   Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n    *   If they match, a candidate string `s_candidate = str_A[0] + str_B` is formed.\n    *   Verify this `s_candidate`:\n        *   Generate all its prefixes: `s_candidate[0:k]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n        *   Generate all its suffixes: `s_candidate[n-k:n]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n        *   Create a multiset (or frequency map) of these `2n-2` generated strings.\n        *   Create a multiset of the `2n-2` input strings.\n        *   If the two multisets are identical, then `s_candidate` is a valid string. We can use this assignment.\n\n5.  **If Case 1 leads to a valid `s_candidate`:**\n    *   Initialize an answer array `ans` of size `2n-2` with dummy values.\n    *   Iterate through the original input strings.\n    *   For each string `input_str` at `original_index`:\n        *   If `input_str` is one of the prefixes of `s_candidate` that hasn't been matched yet, assign `ans[original_index] = 'P'`. Mark this prefix as used.\n        *   Else (it must be a suffix), assign `ans[original_index] = 'S'`. Mark this suffix as used.\n    *   Print the `ans` array joined into a string.\n    *   Exit.\n\n6.  **If Case 1 did not lead to a valid `s_candidate` (or we want to try Case 2 anyway): Assume `str_B` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_A` is the suffix of length `n-1`.**\n    *   Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n    *   If they match, a candidate string `s_candidate = str_B[0] + str_A` is formed.\n    *   Verify this `s_candidate` using the multiset comparison as in step 4.\n    *   If this `s_candidate` is valid, proceed to construct the answer string `ans` as in step 5.\n    *   Print the `ans` array joined into a string.\n    *   Exit.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a solution exists, one of these two `s_candidate` strings will be valid.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example: n=5)**\nInput strings: `ba`, `a`, `abab`, `a`, `aba`, `baba`, `ab`, `aba`\n\n1.  `n = 5`.\n2.  Strings with original indices:\n    `[('ba', 0), ('a', 1), ('abab', 2), ('a', 3), ('aba', 4), ('baba', 5), ('ab', 6), ('aba', 7)]`\n3.

(Note: one 'a' was used as P, the other as S)\n    *   `('aba', 4)`: 'aba' is in `P_set`. `used_P['aba']` is 0. `ans[4] = 'P'`. `used_P['aba'] = 1`.\n    *   `('baba', 5)`: 'baba' is in `S_set`. `used_S['baba']` is 0. `ans[5] = 'S'`. `used_S['baba'] = 1`.\n    *   `('ab', 6)`: 'ab' is in `P_set`. `used_P['ab']` is 0. `ans[6] = 'P'`. `used_P['ab'] = 1`.\n    *   `('aba', 7)`: 'aba' is in `S_set`. `used_S['aba']` is 0. `ans[7] = 'S'`. `used_S['aba'] = 1`.\n\n    Final `ans`: `['S', 'P', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S']`.
