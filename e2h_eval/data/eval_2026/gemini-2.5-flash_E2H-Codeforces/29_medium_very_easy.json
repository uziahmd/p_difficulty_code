Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Plan to Tackle \"Substitutes in Number\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem involves substituting digits in a string based on a set of queries and calculating the final number, modulo a large prime. My first thought is that directly performing string replacements will be a nightmare, leading to exponentially growing strings and a likely TLE. We're dealing with a large modulo, which screams modular arithmetic and, crucially, the fact that the queries are applied sequentially. This means the replacements are *cumulative* – a replacement in a later query can affect digits introduced by previous replacements.\n\nInstead of tracking the actual string, the key is to track the *final value and length* each digit will ultimately become after all substitutions. Working backward from the last query seems like the best approach.  Let's maintain two arrays: `final_val[d]` and `final_len[d]`. `final_val[d]` holds the ultimate numerical value of digit `d` after all replacements, and `final_len[d]` is the effective length of the string `d` becomes, modulo `MOD - 1`. Initializing with `final_val[d] = d` and `final_len[d] = 1`, we process queries *in reverse*.\n\nFor a query `d -> t`, we update `final_val[d]` and `final_len[d]` based on the current values of `final_val` and `final_len` of the digits in `t`. We effectively \"pre-calculate\" what the final values will be. The length modulo `MOD - 1` is crucial for modular exponentiation.\n\nThe final string value can be calculated by iterating the original string and combining the values and lengths of the digits as in a modular multiplication, using a modified power function `pow(10, len, MOD)` where len is modulo `MOD - 1` to find the correct powers of 10 for each place value, modulo 1000000007. Handling empty strings by setting the value to 0 and the length to 0 correctly takes care of edge cases.\n\nThe time complexity is roughly O((sum of lengths of 't' in all queries + length of s) * log(1000000007)).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct string manipulation infeasible.\n\nWe need to find an approach that works with numerical values and lengths without explicitly constructing the final string. This is a classic problem that can be solved using modular arithmetic and processing queries in reverse.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWe need to calculate `Value(S) % MOD`. The value of a number represented by digits `c_k c_{k-1} ... c_1 c_0` is `c_k * 10^k + c_{k-1} * 10^{k-1} + ... + c_1 * 10^1 + c_0 * 10^0`.\nWhen we concatenate two numbers `A` and `B`, the value of `AB` is `Value(A) * 10^Length(B) + Value(B)`. All calculations must be done modulo `MOD`.\n\nThe length of the resulting string can be extremely large. When we calculate `10^Length(B) % MOD`, if `Length(B)` is very large, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. For a prime modulus `P`, `a^E % P = a^(E % (P-1)) % P` (if `a % P != 0`). Here, `a = 10`, `P = MOD`. So we need to keep track of lengths modulo `MOD - 1`. Let `MOD_MINUS_1 = MOD - 1`.\n\n**Strategy: Process Queries in Reverse**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** For each digit `j` from 0 to 9, we want to know what its final numerical value (`final_val[j]`) and final length (`final_len[j]`) will be after all replacements.\n    Initially, if no replacements happen, digit `j` remains `j`. So:\n    *   `final_val[j] = j`\n    *   `final_len[j] = 1` (length of a single digit string, modulo `MOD_MINUS_1`)\n\n2.  **Process Queries:** We iterate through the queries from the last one to the first one.\n    For each query `d -> t`:\n    This query tells us how the digit `d` would be transformed. Since we are processing in reverse, `final_val[d]` and `final_len[d]` should be updated based on the string `t` *using the current `final_val` and `final_len` values for the digits within `t`*. These current values already reflect the transformations from queries *after* the current one.\n\n    Let `new_val_d = 0` and `new_len_d = 0`.\n    *   If `t` is an empty string: `new_val_d = 0`, `new_len_d = 0`.\n    *   If `t` is not empty, iterate through its characters `c` from left to right:\n        *   Let `val_c = final_val[int(c)]` and `len_c = final_len[int(c)]`.\n        *   Update `new_val_d`: `new_val_d = (new_val_d * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD`.\n            This simulates concatenating the current `new_val_d` with the value `val_c`, where `val_c` effectively has `len_c` digits.\n        *   Update `new_len_d`: `new_len_d = (new_len_d + len_c) % MOD_MINUS_1`.\n            This accumulates the total length.\n\n    After processing all characters in `t`, update `final_val[d] = new_val_d` and `final_len[d] = new_len_d`.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:** After processing all queries in reverse, `final_val[j]` and `final_len[j]` will hold the ultimate value and length for each original digit `j`.\n    Now, iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n    Let `result_val = 0`.\n    For each character `c` in `s`:\n    *   Let `val_c = final_val[int(c)]` and `len_c = final_len[int(c)]`.\n    *   Update `result_val`: `result_val = (result_val * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD`.\n\n4.  **Output:** Print `result_val`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description): `s = \"222\", queries: \"2->0\", \"0->7\"`**\n\n*   `MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_MINUS_1 = 1000000006`.\n*   Initial `final_val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n*   Initial `final_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Queries (reversed order):**\n1.  **Query `0 -> 7`**: (`d=0`, `t=\"7\"`)\n    *   `new_val_d = 0`, `new_len_d = 0`.\n    *   For `c = '7'`: `val_c = final_val[7] = 7`, `len_c = final_len[7] = 1`.\n    *   `new_val_d = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`.\n    *   `new_len_d = (0 + 1) % MOD_MINUS_1 = 1`.\n    *   Update `final_val[0] = 7`, `final_len[0] = 1`.\n    *   `final_val` is now `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `final_len` is now `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  **Query `2 -> 0`**: (`d=2`, `t=\"0\"`)\n    *   `new_val_d = 0`, `new_len_d = 0`.\n    *   For `c = '0'`: `val_c = final_val[0] = 7` (using the updated value for '0'), `len_c = final_len[0] = 1`.\n    *   `new_val_d = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`.\n    *   `new_len_d = (0 + 1) % MOD_MINUS_1 = 1`.\n    *   Update `final_val[2] = 7`, `final_len[2] = 1`.\n    *   `final_val` is now `[7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `final_len` is now `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Final Calculation for initial `s = \"222\"`:**\n*   `result_val = 0`.\n*   For `c = '2'`: `val_c = final_val[2] = 7`, `len_c = final_len[2] = 1`.\n    `result_val = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`.\n*   For `c = '2'`: `val_c = final_val[2] = 7`, `len_c = final_len[2] = 1`.\n    `result_val = (7 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 77`.\n*   For `c = '2'`: `val_c = final_val[2] = 7`, `len_c = final_len[2] = 1`.\n    `result_val = (77 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 777`.\n\nFinal answer: `777`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the problem constraints and logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di_str, ti = line.split(\"->\")\n        queries.append((int(di_str), ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_MINUS_1 = MOD - 1 # For exponents in modular arithmetic (Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\n    # final_val[j] will store the numerical value that digit j ultimately becomes.\n    # final_len[j] will store the length (modulo MOD_MINUS_1) of the string that digit j ultimately becomes.\n    final_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    final_len = [1 for _ in range(10)] # Initial length for a single digit is 1\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d, t = queries[i]\n\n        current_val_t = 0\n        current_len_t = 0\n\n        if not t: # If t is an empty string, it becomes 0 value and 0 length\n            final_val[d] = 0\n            final_len[d] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        # Calculate the value and length of string t based on current final_val and final_len\n        # for its constituent digits.
