    "thought": "**Understanding Lexicographical Minimization with Restricted Swaps**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to rearrange a ternary string (containing '0', '1', and '2') to find the smallest string lexicographically. There are specific swap rules: I can swap '0' and '1', or '1' and '2', but not '0' and '2'. The challenge lies in how these restricted swaps impact the final arrangement.\n\nMy key insight is that the '0' and '2' characters act as \"barriers.\" A '0' cannot move past a '2', and vice versa. However, the character '1' is \"neutral.\" It can freely swap with both '0' and '2' and therefore can pass through any configuration of these, essentially jumping over these barriers. This creates two fixed components – the relative ordering of '0's and '2's, which cannot be altered, and the flexible positions of '1's.\n\nTo create the smallest string, I need to place the '0's at the beginning, followed by the '1's, and then the '2's. The '1's are \"grouped\" and are placed where they minimally disrupt the ordering of '0's and '2's. All '0's to the left of all '2's must stay where they are, and likewise for the '2's on the right of all '0's. I extract the '0's and '2's and maintain their relative order, forming a backbone string. Then, I count the '1's.\n\nThe ideal placement of the '1's is right before the first '2' within this backbone string. This placement ensures that all '0's possible are at the start, followed by all '1's, and then the '2's.\n\nSo, in summary, I'm constructing the final string in three steps:\n1. Extract and preserve the order of the '0's and '2's.\n2. Count the number of '1's.\n3. Place the '1's into the string right before the first '2' (or at the end if no '2's), achieving the smallest possible lexicographical arrangement.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string by performing specific adjacent swaps: '0' with '1', and '1' with '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This implies that their relative order is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in any string reachable by the allowed operations. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must maintain that relative order.\n\nConsider the role of '1's:\nSince a '1' can swap with both '0' and '2', a '1' can effectively \"pass through\" any sequence of '0's and '2's. For example, in \"012\", '1' can move left to \"102\" or right to \"021\". In both cases, the relative order of '0' and '2' is preserved. This means that all '1's can be collected together into a contiguous block, and this block can be placed anywhere in the string without changing the relative order of the '0's and '2's.\n\nTherefore, the strategy to obtain the lexicographically smallest string is as follows:\n1. **Separate '1's from '0's and '2's**: Iterate through the input string. Count all occurrences of '1'. Collect all '0's and '2's into a new sequence, preserving their original relative order. Let's call this sequence `S_02`.\n   Example: For \"100210\", `num_ones = 2`, and `S_02 = \"0020\"`.\n2. **Determine the placement of the '1's block**: We want the lexicographically smallest string. This means we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then '1's, then '2's.\n   Since the relative order of '0's and '2's in `S_02` is fixed, we cannot move a '0' past a '2' (or vice-versa) to get more '0's to the front.\n   However, the block of '1's can be inserted anywhere into `S_02`. To make the string lexicographically smallest, the '1's should come after all '0's that can possibly be at the beginning, and before all '2's that must follow them. This optimal position is immediately before the *first* '2' in the `S_02` sequence.\n   - All '0's that appear before the first '2' in `S_02` can be moved to the beginning of the string (before any '1's or '2's).\n   - All '2's (including the first '2') and any '0's that appear after the first '2' in `S_02` must follow.\n   So, the structure of the minimum string will be: `(prefix of S_02 before first '2') + (all '1's) + (suffix of S_02 starting from first '2')`.\n\nLet's apply this to the examples:\n\n**Example 1: `s = \"100210\"`**\n1. `num_ones = 2`. `S_02` (from '0's and '2's in order) = `\"0020\"`.\n2. The first '2' in `S_02` is at index 2.\n   - `S_02` prefix before first '2': `\"00\"`\n   - `S_02` suffix from first '2': `\"20\"`\n   Result: `\"00\"` + (`2 * '1'`) + `\"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\n**Example 2: `s = \"11222121\"`**\n1. `num_ones = 4`. `S_02` = `\"2222\"` (no '0's).\n2. The first '2' in `S_02` is at index 0.\n   - `S_02` prefix before first '2': `\"\"` (empty string)\n   - `S_02` suffix from first '2': `\"2222\"`\n   Result: `\"\"` + (`4 * '1'`) + `\"2222\"` = `\"11112222\"`.\n\n**Example 3: `s = \"20\"`**\n1. `num_ones = 0`. `S_02` = `\"20\"`.\n2. The first '2' in `S_02` is at index 0.\n   - `S_02` prefix before first '2': `\"\"`\n   - `S_02` suffix from first '2': `\"20\"`\n   Result: `\"\"` + (`0 * '1'`) + `\"20\"` = `\"20\"`.\n\n**Edge case: No '2's in the string (e.g., `s = \"10010\"`)**\n1. `num_ones = 2`. `S_02` = `\"000\"`.\n2. No '2's in `S_02`. In this case, the `first_two_idx` would effectively be the end of `S_02`.\n   - `S_02` prefix before first '2' (all of `S_02`): `\"000\"`\n   - `S_02` suffix from first '2' (empty string): `\"\"`\n   Result: `\"000\"` + (`2 * '1'`) + `\"\"` = `\"00011\"`. This is correct, as '0's and '1's can freely swap.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(N) because it involves a single pass through the string, joining characters, and finding an index, all of which are linear operations. The space complexity is O(N) for storing `S_02` and the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    other_chars_list = [] # Stores '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n\n    # First pass: count '1's and collect '0's and '2's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            other_chars_list.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the collected '0's and '2's into a string\n    s_other = \"\".join(other_chars_list)\n    \n    # Find the index of the first '2' in s_other\n    # If '2' is not found, s_other.find('2') returns -1\n    first_two_idx = s_other.find('2')\n            \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in the string.
