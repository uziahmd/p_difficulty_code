Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Flawed Flow\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and I need to whip up a Python script to solve it. Let's break this down. We're given an undirected graph with flow capacities, and the goal is to *direct* the edges such that the resulting graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and also satisfies a few flow constraints.  We're given the number of vertices *n* and edges *m*, and then the edge data itself: the two vertices connected by the edge, and the flow capacity.\n\nThe crucial constraints, aside from the obvious DAG requirement, are flow conservation at intermediate vertices and the fact that vertex 1 (the source) must have *no* incoming edges.  This source condition is huge; it basically screams, \"Direct everything outwards from the source!\"\n\nThe problem hints at a *maximum* flow problem, but we don't have to calculate the maximum flow itself. The cycle restriction, however, is a strong implication. It almost forces a specific structure, like a spanning tree with directed edges.\n\nMy intuition says a greedy approach might work. Start at vertex 1.  All edges incident to vertex 1 have to be directed outwards. Done.  Now, the game is to direct all other edges so that flow is conserved at all the other nodes and no cycles are created.\n\nThinking about it, the flow conservation at internal nodes means the *net* flow in or out must be zero, which is critical.  We could keep track of *in_flow* and *out_flow* for each vertex and try to balance them.\n\nThis does remind me of how we used to build a flow path; this almost feels like we're reconstructing it.  We know that no cycles should be formed, and the only \"source\" is node 1. I think I'll try to devise a strategy that keeps track of the in and out flows to see if that helps me build a DAG.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the direction of flow for each edge in an undirected graph, given the flow volume `ci` for each edge. The goal is to satisfy several conditions: flow conservation at intermediate vertices, no incoming edges to the source (vertex 1), and no cycles in the resulting directed graph. We are guaranteed that a solution always exists.\n\nThe crucial conditions are:\n1.  **Source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges:** This means any edge `(1, v)` must be directed `1 -> v`.\n2.  **No cycles:** This implies the graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n3.  **Flow conservation for 1 < v < n:** The sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow.\n\nLet's consider the total flow entering or leaving each vertex if all edges were directed away from the source.\nFor each vertex `v`, let `total_flow[v]` be the sum of `ci` for all edges incident to `v`.\nIn a valid flow network:\n*   For the source (vertex 1), `total_flow[1]` must be the total outgoing flow (the maximum flow value).\n*   For the sink (vertex `n`), `total_flow[n]` must be the total incoming flow (also the maximum flow value).\n*   For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow. This means that if we sum up all `ci` for edges `(u, v)` that are directed `u -> v`, and all `ci` for edges `(v, w)` that are directed `v -> w`, these sums must be equal.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition, combined with the source having no incoming edges, strongly suggests a topological ordering or a traversal method that naturally avoids cycles. A Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) from the source can be adapted.\n\nLet's think about the net flow for each vertex. If we consider an arbitrary direction for each edge, say `a_i -> b_i`, then `a_i` \"loses\" `c_i` flow and `b_i` \"gains\" `c_i` flow. For an intermediate vertex `v`, its net flow must be zero. For the source `1`, its net flow must be `-MaxFlow` (it only outputs flow). For the sink `n`, its net flow must be `+MaxFlow` (it only receives flow).\n\nWe can maintain a `balance` for each vertex. Initially, all `balance[v]` are 0.\nWhen we direct an edge `u -> v` with flow `c`:\n`balance[u] -= c`\n`balance[v] += c`\n\nFor intermediate vertices `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), we need `balance[v]` to be 0 at the end.\nFor source `1`, `balance[1]` will be negative.\nFor sink `n`, `balance[n]` will be positive.\n\nConsider a strategy where we process vertices based on their \"needs\".\nA common technique for this type of problem is to use a queue (like in BFS) to process vertices whose flow direction can be determined.\n\nLet's calculate the total flow `S` that *must* exit vertex 1 and *must* enter vertex `n`. This is the sum of `ci` for all edges connected to `n`. Why `n`? Because vertex `n` can only receive flow, and all its incident edges must be directed towards it. So, `S = sum(c_i for (u, n, c_i) in edges)`.\nLet's modify this. The problem states vertex 1 is the source and vertex `n` is the sink. All flow must originate from 1 and terminate at `n`.\nThe total flow value `F` is the sum of `ci` for all edges connected to vertex `n`. This is because all edges incident to `n` must be directed into `n` (otherwise, flow would leave the sink, which is not standard max-flow behavior, and also would make `n` not a sink). This is a strong assumption, but it's consistent with the \"no cycles\" and \"1 is source, n is sink\" conditions. If an edge `(u, n)` is directed `n -> u`, it implies `n` is providing flow, which contradicts it being a sink. So, all edges connected to `n` must be `u -> n`.\n\nLet's reconsider. The problem does *not* state that `n` has no outgoing edges. It only states that `1` has no incoming edges. However, if there are no cycles, and all flow starts at 1, then all flow must eventually reach `n`. This implies that `n` must be the \"final\" destination for all flow paths.\n\nLet's use a \"deficit\" approach. For each vertex `v`, we want its net flow to be 0 (if `v` is an intermediate node).\nInitialize `current_flow_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWe can use a queue to process vertices. A vertex `v` is ready to be processed if we know enough about its neighbors to decide the direction of its remaining undirected edges.\n\nA simpler approach:\nThe problem constraints (N, M up to 2e5) suggest something like a graph traversal (BFS/DFS).\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is key. If we start from vertex 1 and direct edges away from it, and continue this process, we are essentially building a directed graph that is a DAG.\n\nLet's define `current_balance[v]` as the sum of `ci` for edges already directed *into* `v` minus the sum of `ci` for edges already directed *out of* `v`.\nInitially, all `current_balance[v] = 0`.\nWe also need to keep track of the total flow that *must* pass through each vertex. For an intermediate vertex `v`, the sum of `ci` of all incident edges `(v, u)` must be equal to twice the total flow passing through `v` (once incoming, once outgoing).\nThis is not helpful directly.\n\nLet's try to determine the total flow `F` first. The total flow `F` is the sum of `ci` for all edges connected to `n`. Why? Because `n` is the sink. If the graph is a DAG and `1` is the source and `n` is the sink, all flow must eventually reach `n`. So, all edges `(u, n)` must be directed `u -> n`. If `n` were to send flow to `u` (`n -> u`), it would imply `n` is not solely a sink, or it would create a path that might lead back to `n` or other intermediate nodes, making `n` a source for some flow, which is not standard. Given that a solution *always exists*, this is a safe assumption.\nSo, `F = sum(c_i for (u, n, c_i) in edges)`.\nLet's verify this example:\n`3 3`\n`3 2 10`\n`1 2 10`\n`3 1 5`\nEdges connected to `n=3`: `(3, 2, 10)` and `(3, 1, 5)`.\nIf `n=3` is the sink, then `2 -> 3` and `1 -> 3`.\n`F = 10 + 5 = 15`.\n\nNow, for each vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), its net flow must be zero. For vertex `1`, its net flow must be `-F`. For vertex `n`, its net flow must be `+F`.\nWe can initialize `flow_deficit[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nFor vertex `1`, `flow_deficit[1] = -F`.\nFor vertex `n`, `flow_deficit[n] = F`.\n\nNow, we use a queue. Add all vertices `v` where `flow_deficit[v]` is non-zero (i.e., `1` and `n`) to the queue.\nThis is incorrect. We need to decide edge directions.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach:\nFor each vertex `v`, calculate `total_incident_flow[v] = sum(c_i for all edges (v, u) with flow c_i)`.\nWe need to determine the final `incoming_flow[v]` and `outgoing_flow[v]` such that:\n*   `incoming_flow[1] = 0`\n*   `outgoing_flow[1] = total_incident_flow[1]` (this is the total max flow)\n*   `incoming_flow[n] = total_incident_flow[n]` (this is the total max flow)\n*   `outgoing_flow[n] = 0`\n*   For `1 < v < n`: `incoming_flow[v] = outgoing_flow[v] = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`\n\nThis is the key insight! For an intermediate node `v`, the total flow passing *through* it is `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`. This means that half of its incident flow must be incoming, and half must be outgoing.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Store edges along with their original indices: `edges = [(a, b, c, original_idx), ...]`.\n2.  Create an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, original_idx)` for all neighbors `v` of `u`.\n3.  Initialize `current_flow_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n    This `current_flow_balance[v]` will track `(incoming_flow - outgoing_flow)` for vertex `v` from edges whose directions have already been decided.\n4.  Initialize `ans = [0] * m` to store the directions.\n5.  Initialize a queue `q`.\n6.  For each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`:\n    *   Calculate `total_incident_flow_sum = sum(c for neighbor, c, idx in adj[v])`.\n    *   If `v == 1`: The target `current_flow_balance[1]` should be `-total_incident_flow_sum`. This means all flow must leave `1`.\n    *   If `v == n`: The target `current_flow_balance[n]` should be `total_incident_flow_sum`. This means all flow must enter `n`.\n    *   If `1 < v < n`: The target `current_flow_balance[v]` should be `0`.\n    *   Initialize `current_flow_balance[v]` to `0`.\n    *   If `v == n`: Add `v` to the queue. (We start from the sink `n` and work backwards to ensure no cycles and correct flow for intermediate nodes).\n\nLet's refine the queue approach. We know the *final* net flow for each node:\n*   `net_flow[1] = - (sum of all c_i incident to 1)`\n*   `net_flow[n] = + (sum of all c_i incident to n)`\n*   `net_flow[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`\n\nWe can use a queue and process nodes that are \"ready\". A node is ready if we have determined the direction of all its incident edges *except one*, and we can use the net flow requirement to determine the direction of that last edge. This is a common strategy for problems involving degree constraints or flow conservation.\n\nLet `current_net_flow[v]` be the sum of `ci` for edges directed into `v` minus sum of `ci` for edges directed out of `v`, among edges whose directions are *already decided*.\nLet `degree[v]` be the number of undecided edges incident to `v`.\n\nInitialize `current_net_flow[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nInitialize `degree[v] = len(adj[v])` for all `v`.\nInitialize `ans = [0] * m`.\nCreate a queue `q`.\nFor `v` from 1 to `n`:\n    If `v == 1` or `v == n`:\n        Add `v` to `q`. (These are special nodes whose flow balance is fixed)\n    Else if `degree[v] == 1`:\n        Add `v` to `q`. (If an intermediate node has only one undecided edge, its direction can be determined by the `current_net_flow[v]` which must eventually become 0).\n\nThis approach seems more robust. Let's trace it.\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is automatically handled if we process nodes such that we don't create cycles. Starting from the sink `n` and determining directions, or from nodes with degree 1, often helps.\n\nLet's try the example:\n`3 3`\n`e0: 3 2 10`\n`e1: 1 2 10`\n`e2: 3 1 5`\n\n`adj`:\n`1: [(2, 10, e1), (3, 5, e2)]`\n`2: [(3, 10, e0), (1, 10, e1)]`\n`3: [(2, 10, e0), (1, 5, e2)]`\n\n`current_net_flow = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (index 0 unused)\n`degree = [0, 2, 2, 2]`\n`ans = [0, 0, 0]`\n`q = []`\n\nTarget `net_flow`:\n`total_incident_flow[1] = 10 + 5 = 15`. Target `net_flow[1] = -15`.\n`total_incident_flow[2] = 10 + 10 = 20`. Target `net_flow[2] = 0`.\n`total_incident_flow[3] = 10 + 5 = 15`. Target `net_flow[3] = 15`.\n\nInitial queue: Add `1` and `3`. (Nodes with fixed final net flow).\n`q = [1, 3]`\n\n**Pop 1 from q:**\n`v = 1`. Target `net_flow[1] = -15`. `current_net_flow[1] = 0`.\nWe need to make `current_net_flow[1]` become `-15`. This means `15` units of flow must leave `1`.\nIterate through edges incident to `1`:\n1.  `(2, 10, e1)`: `1` is `a_i` for this edge in `(1, 2)`. If `1 -> 2`, `ans[e1]=0`. `current_net_flow[1]` becomes `-10`. `current_net_flow[2]` becomes `+10`.\n    `degree[1]` decreases. `degree[2]` decreases.\n2.  `(3, 5, e2)`: `1` is `b_i` for this edge in `(3, 1)`. If `1 -> 3`, `ans[e2]=1`. `current_net_flow[1]` becomes `-10 - 5 = -15`. `current_net_flow[3]` becomes `+5`.\n    `degree[1]` decreases. `degree[3]` decreases.\n\nLet's be more precise. When processing a node `v`, we need to decide the direction of *one* of its incident undecided edges. We can't decide all of them at once without potentially creating a cycle or violating other nodes' balances.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is the most critical. This implies that we should process nodes in a topological order.\nSince vertex 1 has no incoming edges, it's a natural starting point for a topological sort. However, we don't know the full DAG structure yet.\n\nA standard approach for \"reconstructing\" a DAG from partial information (like flow conservation) is to use a queue of nodes that have \"unbalanced\" flow or whose remaining edges can be uniquely determined.\n\nLet's maintain `current_flow_balance[v]` which is `(total_incoming_flow_so_far - total_outgoing_flow_so_far)`.\nInitialize `current_flow_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nInitialize `ans = [0] * m`.\nInitialize `adj` list storing `(neighbor, flow, original_idx)`.\nInitialize `edge_processed[original_idx] = False`.\nQueue `q`.\n\nFor `v` from 1 to `n`:\n    If `v == n`:\n        `q.append(v)`\n\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n    `u = q.popleft()`\n\n    For each edge `(u, v, c, original_idx)` incident to `u`:\n        If `edge_processed[original_idx]` is True, continue.\n\n        // This is the tricky part: how to decide direction?\n        // We know that for `u=n`, all incident edges must be `v -> n`.\n        // For other nodes, we need to balance.\n        // We need to ensure that `current_flow_balance[u]` reaches its target.\n\n        If `u == n`:\n            // Edge is (u, v) or (v, u). We need v -> n.\n            If `edge_list[original_idx].a == v`: // original edge was (v, n)\n                `ans[original_idx] = 0` // v -> n\n                `current_flow_balance[v] -= c`\n                `current_flow_balance[u] += c`\n            Else: // original edge was (n, v)\n                `ans[original_idx] = 1` // v -> n\n                `current_flow_balance[v] -= c`\n                `current_flow_balance[u] += c`\n            `edge_processed[original_idx] = True`\n            // If `v` is now ready to be processed (e.g., its `current_flow_balance` can be determined)\n            // Or if `v` has only one remaining un-processed edge.\n            // This suggests a degree-based approach.\n\nLet's try the degree-based approach more systematically.\nFor each vertex `v`, we know its *final* `net_flow_target[v]`:\n*   `net_flow_target[1] = -

The \"no cycles\" condition is implicitly handled because we are essentially processing nodes in an order that respects flow dependencies. When we decide an edge direction, we satisfy the flow balance for one endpoint, and update the balance for the other. The process continues until all edges are directed. Since a solution is guaranteed to exist, this process will terminate and find one.\n\nLet's re-check the `F` calculation.\nExample 1:\n`3 3`\n`e0: 3 2 10`\n`e1: 1 2 10`\n`e2: 3 1 5`\n\nEdges incident to `n=3`: `(3, 2, 10)` and `(3, 1, 5)`.\n`F = 10 + 5 = 15`.

Don't add to `q`.\n\n**Iteration 3: `u = 2` (from q)**\n`undecided_edges_count[2] = 0`.

The logic seems to work.\n\nFinal checks for implementation details:\n*   `collections.deque` for queue.\n*   Adjacency list.\n*   `edge_list` to store original `(a,b,c)` for `ans` mapping.\n*   `ans` array initialized to `-1` to mark undecided.\n*   `undecided_edges_count` for each node.\n*   `current_net_flow` for each node.\n*   Careful with `a_orig`, `b_orig` when setting `ans[original_idx]`.\n\nThe condition for adding to queue: `If u == 1 or u == n:` OR `If 1 < u < n and undecided_edges_count[u] == 1:`.\nThis ensures that `u` has enough information to determine the direction of at least one edge.\nIf `u` is `1` or `n`, we can determine all its edges because its flow balance is fixed relative to the total flow `F`.\nIf `u` is an intermediate node and has `undecided_edges_count[u] == 1`, then the direction of that single remaining edge is uniquely determined by `u`'s `current_net_flow[u]` and `net_flow_target[u]` (which is 0 for intermediate nodes).\n\nThe `undecided_edge = None` check is important if a node is added to the queue, but its last edge is processed by its neighbor before `u` is popped.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\n# It's good practice to use fast I/O in competitive programming\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    edge_list = [] # Stores (a, b, c) for original edges\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, input().split())\n        edge_list.append((u, v, c))\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i))\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i))\n\n    ans = [-1] * m # To store the direction: 0 for a->b, 1 for b->a\n\n    current_net_flow = [0] * (n + 1) # Tracks (incoming_flow - outgoing_flow)\n    undecided_edges_count = [0] * (n + 1) # Number of incident edges whose direction is not yet decided\n\n    # Calculate initial undecided_edges_count\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        undecided_edges_count[u] = len(adj[u])\n\n    # Calculate total flow F (sum of flows incident to sink n)\n    F = 0\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = edge_list[i]\n        if u == n or v == n:\n            F += c\n    \n    # Define target net flow for each node\n    net_flow_target = [0] * (n + 1)\n    net_flow_target[1] = -F # Source needs to output F flow\n    net_flow_target[n] = F  # Sink needs to receive F flow\n\n    q = collections.deque()\n\n    # Initialize queue with nodes that can determine edge directions\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Source (1) and Sink (n) can always determine their edges\n        if u == 1 or u == n:\n            q.append(u)\n        # Intermediate nodes (1 < u < n) can determine their last undecided edge\n        elif undecided_edges_count[u] == 1:\n            q.append(u)\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n\n        # Find an undecided edge incident to u\n        undecided_edge_info = None\n        for v_neighbor, c_flow, original_idx in adj[u]:\n            if ans[original_idx] == -1: # If direction not set yet\n                undecided_edge_info = (v_neighbor, c_flow, original_idx)\n                break\n        \n        if undecided_edge_info is None:\n            # All edges for u are already processed (e.g., by its neighbors)\n            continue\n\n        v, c, original_idx = undecided_edge_info\n        a_orig, b_orig, _ = edge_list[original_idx]\n\n        # Determine direction based on u's current_net_flow vs net_flow_target\n        # If current_net_flow[u] < net_flow_target[u], u needs more incoming flow.
