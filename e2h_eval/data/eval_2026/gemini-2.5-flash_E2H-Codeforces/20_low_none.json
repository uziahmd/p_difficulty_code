    "thought": "**Breaking Down a Challenging Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's asking me to count the number of ways to assign integer values, $c_s$, to binary strings of varying lengths (1 to *n*). The twist is, the assignment has to ensure the *maximum* size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is precisely *f*.  The constraints, *n* up to 15, and *k, f* up to 200,000, don't seem outrageous, but this \"beautiful multiset\" concept needs to be demystified first.\n\nLet's unpack this. A \"beautiful multiset\" is basically a collection of binary strings, all of length *n*.  The key restriction is that for *every* possible shorter binary string *s* (of length 1 to *n*), the *count* of strings in the multiset that start with *s* can't exceed the corresponding $c_s$ value.\n\nI'm starting to visualize this. It's like building a binary tree of depth *n*. Each node is a binary string, and each leaf is a full-length string.  The $c_s$ values act like capacity limits on the number of leaves that can \"hang\" off a particular node (or its ancestral node). The total size of the multiset is the sum of the counts of all the full-length strings. This \"prefix\" property is critical; a string *s*'s prefix constraint affects all strings that start with *s*.\n\nMy initial thought is that this has a strong network flow or min-cut flavor to it, perhaps involving a min-cost max-flow approach. The $c_s$ constraints look like capacities. The way the count cascades down the tree feels like flow conservation. But I also suspect this could boil down to a maximum-weight independent set problem, given the constraints.\n\nI'm clearly overthinking this initially. If the length *L* of the string *s* is less than *n* length strings, $N(s)$ is the total count of the full strings of length *n* that has *s* as a prefix. For the case where the length *L* equals *n*, then $N(s)$ simply equals $x_s$.\n\nThe core challenge seems to be finding an efficient way to determine the maximum size of a beautiful multiset based on the given $c_s$ values and then counting how many different $c_s$ assignments lead to a max size of exactly *f*. I'll need to explore how to express the multiset's size mathematically in terms of the constraints, and find an efficient strategy for counting those assignments.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from 1 to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined given a set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset $M$ consists of binary strings of length exactly $n$. Let $x_S$ be the number of times string $S$ appears in $M$. The total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{S \\text{ len } n} x_S$.\nFor any binary string $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n]$, the condition is that the number of strings in $M$ having $s$ as a prefix must not exceed $c_s$. Let this count be $N(s)$.\nSo, $N(s) = \\sum_{S \\text{ len } n, s \\text{ is prefix of } S} x_S \\le c_s$.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as finding a maximum flow in a specially constructed graph, or more directly, using a minimum cut formulation. However, a simpler approach for finding the maximum multiset size is often seen in such problems.\nConsider a string $S$ of length $n$. If we include $x_S$ copies of $S$ in the multiset, this contributes $x_S$ to $N(s)$ for every prefix $s$ of $S$.\nThe total size of the multiset is $\\sum x_S$. We want to maximize this sum subject to $N(s) \\le c_s$.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is given by the following formula:\n$$ \\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} \\min(c_s, \\text{max_count_from_ancestors}(s)) $$\nwhere $\\text{max_count_from_ancestors}(s)$ is the minimum of $c_p$ for all prefixes $p$ of $s$ (including $s$ itself).\nThis formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum size of the multiset is:\n$$ \\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} x_s $$\nwhere $x_s$ are chosen such that $x_s \\ge 0$ and for any prefix $p$ of length $L < n$, $\\sum_{S \\text{ starting with } p} x_S \\le c_p$.\nThis is equivalent to finding $x_s$ for each string $s$ of length $n$ such that $0 \\le x_s \\le c_s$ and for any string $p$ of length $L < n$, $N(p) = N(p0) + N(p1)$, and $N(p) \\le c_p$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is given by:\n$$ \\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} \\min_{p \\text{ prefix of } s} c_p $$\nThis is a known result for this type of prefix constraint problem. For each full-length string $S$, the number of copies $x_S$ we can put is limited by $c_S$ itself, and also by $c_p$ for any prefix $p$ of $S$. If we put $x_S$ copies of $S$, this contributes $x_S$ to $N(p)$ for all prefixes $p$. To satisfy all constraints, $x_S$ must be at most $\\min_{p \\text{ prefix of } S} c_p$. To maximize the total sum, we choose $x_S = \\min_{p \\text{ prefix of } S} c_p$ for each $S$. This choice is consistent because the sum $\\sum_{S \\text{ starting with } p} x_S$ will be $\\sum_{S \\text{ starting with } p} \\min_{q \\text{ prefix of } S} c_q$. This sum is always $\\le c_p$. This is because each $\\min_{q \\text{ prefix of } S} c_q$ term includes $c_p$ in its minimum, so it's $\\le c_p$. And there are $2^{n-L}$ such strings $S$ starting with $p$. So the sum is $\\le 2^{n-L} \\cdot c_p$. This does not guarantee $\\le c_p$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The problem is equivalent to choosing an integer $x_s \\ge 0$ for each string $s$ of length $n$, such that for every string $p$ of length $1 \\le L \\le n$, the sum of $x_s$ for all $s$ of length $n$ that have $p$ as a prefix, is at most $c_p$. We want to maximize $\\sum x_s$.\nThis is a standard result in combinatorics/optimization: the maximum size of such a multiset is $\\min_{s \\text{ len } L < n} \\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-L} \\rfloor$. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe maximum number of strings of length $n$ that can have $s$ as a prefix is $c_s$. Let $N_L$ be the count of strings in the multiset that start with string $s$ of length $L$.\nThen $N_L(s) = N_{L+1}(s0) + N_{L+1}(s1)$.\nThe constraints are $N_L(s) \\le c_s$.\nWe want to maximize $N_n(\\epsilon)$ (where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string), which is the total count of strings in the multiset.\nThis is equivalent to a maximum flow problem. A source $S$, a sink $T$. Nodes for each string $s$. Edges $s \\to s0$ and $s \\to s1$ with infinite capacity. Edges $s \\to \\text{sink}$ with capacity $c_s$ for length $n$ strings. Edges $s \\to \\text{string } s \\text{ (parent)}$ with capacity $c_s$.\nThis structure is a tree. The maximum possible size of the multiset is $\\min_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} \\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\rfloor$.\nThis is a very common result. For each node $s$ in the binary tree representing prefixes, $c_s$ is the maximum number of leaves in its subtree we can \"take\". If we take $X$ leaves in the subtree of $s$, then we must have $X \\le c_s$. If we take $X_0$ leaves in the subtree of $s0$ and $X_1$ leaves in the subtree of $s1$, then $X_0+X_1$ leaves are taken in the subtree of $s$. So $X_0+X_1 \\le c_s$.\nThe maximum total number of leaves we can take is $X_{\\text{root}}$.\nThis value is $\\min_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} \\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\rfloor$.\nLet $v_s = \\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\rfloor$. The maximum size of the multiset is $\\min_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} v_s$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values such that $\\min_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} v_s = f$.\nLet $V = \\min_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} v_s$. We need $V=f$.\nThis means $v_s \\ge f$ for all $s$, and there exists at least one $s_0$ such that $v_{s_0} = f$.\nThe condition $v_s \\ge f$ is equivalent to $\\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\rfloor \\ge f$.\nThis implies $c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\ge f$, so $c_s \\ge f \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}$.\nAlso, $c_s \\le k$. So for each $s$, $c_s$ must be in the range $[f \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}, k]$.\nLet $L_s = f \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}$ and $R_s = k$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ such that $v_s \\ge f$ is $\\max(0, R_s - L_s + 1)$.\nLet $N_s = \\max(0, R_s - L_s + 1)$. This is the number of ways to pick $c_s$ such that $v_s \\ge f$.\nThe total number of ways to choose all $c_s$ such that $V \\ge f$ is $\\prod_{s \\text{ len } 1 \\dots n} N_s$.\nLet's call this product $P(f)$.\n\nNow, we need $V=f$. This can be computed using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, or more simply, by observing that $P(f)$ counts ways where $V \\ge f$.\nIf we want $V=f$, we can calculate $P(f) - P(f+1)$.\n$P(f+1)$ counts the number of ways where $V \\ge f+1$.\nSo $P(f) - P(f+1)$ gives the number of ways where $V=f$.\n\nLet's compute $P(val)$ for a given $val$.\nFor each string $s$, we need $c_s \\in [val \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}, k]$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ is $k - (val \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}) + 1$.\nThis must be non-negative. If $val \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} > k$, then there are 0 choices for $c_s$, so $P(val)=0$.\nLet $min\\_c_s = val \\cdot 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)}$. The number of choices for $c_s$ is $\\max(0, k - min\\_c_s + 1)$.\nThe total number of strings $s$ is $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2(2^n-1)$.\nFor $n=15$, this is $2(2^{15}-1) = 2(32767) = 65534$ strings.\nFor each string length $L \\in [1, n]$, there are $2^L$ strings.\nFor a fixed length $L$, $2^{n-L}$ is constant. So $min\\_c_s$ is the same for all $2^L$ strings of length $L$.\nLet $D_L = 2^{n-L}$.\nThe number of choices for $c_s$ for a string $s$ of length $L$ is $\\max(0, k - val \\cdot D_L + 1)$.\nLet $count_L(val) = \\max(0, k - val \\cdot D_L + 1)$.\nThen $P(val) = \\prod_{L=1}^{n} (count_L(val))^{2^L} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nThe maximum possible value for $f$ (and $val$) is $k$.\nThe maximum value for $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nWe need to compute $P(f)$ and $P(f+1)$.\n\nLet's check the constraints: $1 \\le n \\le 15$, $1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nModulo is $998244353$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Define a function `calculate_P(val)`:\n   - Initialize `res = 1`.\n   - Iterate `L` from 1 to `n`:\n     - Calculate `D_L = 2**(n-L)`.\n     - Calculate `min_c_s = val * D_L`.\n     - If `min_c_s > k`, then `count_L = 0`. In this case, `res` becomes 0, and we can immediately return 0.\n     - Otherwise, `count_L = (k - min_c_s + 1) % 998244353`.\n     - `res = (res * pow(count_L, 2**L, 998244353)) % 998244353`.\n   - Return `res`.\n\n2. Calculate `P_f = calculate_P(f)`.\n3. Calculate `P_f_plus_1 = calculate_P(f+1)`.\n4. The answer is `(P_f - P_f_plus_1 + 998244353) % 998244353`.\n\nExample 1: n=1, k=42, f=2\n`calculate_P(2)`:\nL=1: `D_1 = 2**(1-1) = 1`. `min_c_s = 2 * 1 = 2`. `count_1 = (42 - 2 + 1) = 41`.\n`P(2) = pow(41, 2**1, 998244353) = 41`.\n\n`calculate_P(3)`:\nL=1: `D_1 = 2**(1-1) = 1`. `min_c_s = 3 * 1 = 3`. `count_1 = (42 - 3 + 1) = 40`.\n`P(3) = pow(40, 2**1, 998244353) = 40`.\n\nAnswer: `(41 - 40 + 998244353) % 998244353 = 1`.\nWait, example output is 3. My formula is wrong.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully.\n\"A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $n$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $s$ with length from $1$ to $n$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $s$ is their prefix is not exceeding $c_s$.\"\n\"the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$.\"\n\nLet $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nFor $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ is the count of string $s$ itself.\nFor $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$.\nWe want to maximize $N(\\text{empty string})$.\nThe constraints are $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$.\nThis is a standard problem, often solved with dynamic programming on the tree.\nLet $dp[s]$ be the maximum number of full-length strings that can be chosen in the subtree rooted at $s$.\nFor a leaf $s$ (length $n$), $dp[s] = c_s$.\nFor an internal node $s$ (length $L < n$), $dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\nThe maximum size of the multiset is $dp[\\text{root}]$ (where root is the empty string).\n\nThis is different from the $\\min \\lfloor c_s / 2^{n-\\text{len}(s)} \\rfloor$ formula. That formula would apply if we were choosing $x_S$ for each $S$ of length $n$ and then checking constraints, but here $c_s$ is an upper bound on the *sum* of descendants, not just an individual leaf count.\n\nLet $f(s)$ be the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $n$, then $f(s) = c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $L < n$, then $f(s) = \\min(c_s, f(s0) + f(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of the multiset is $f(\\text{empty string})$.\nWe want $f(\\text{empty string}) = f$.\n\nThis recursive definition means that the value $f(s)$ depends on the $c_x$ values in the subtree rooted at $s$.\nThe empty string (root) has $f(\\text{empty string}) = \\min(c_{\\text{empty}}, f(0) + f(1))$. But the problem states $s$ has length from 1 to $n$. So $c_{\\text{empty}}$ is not given. This means $f(\\text{empty string}) = f(0) + f(1)$.\nSo the maximum size is $f(0) + f(1)$.\nAnd $f(0) = \\min(c_0, f(00) + f(01))$, $f(1) = \\min(c_1, f(10) + f(11))$, etc.\n\nLet $DP[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ such that for any string $s'$ of length $L$, $f(s')$ (the max count in its subtree) is equal to `val`.\nThis seems too complex because $f(s')$ for different $s'$ of the same length might be different.\n\nWhat if we fix $f(s)$ for all $s$ of length $L$?\nLet $N_L$ be the maximum count of strings in the multiset that start with *any* string of length $L$.\nThis is not how it works. Each string $s$ has its own $f(s)$.\n\nLet's try to calculate the maximum size for the first example: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\nStrings are $0, 1$.\n$f(0) = c_0$, $f(1) = c_1$.\nMaximum multiset size is $f(0)+f(1) = c_0+c_1$.\nWe need to choose $c_0, c_1 \\in [0, k]$ such that $c_0+c_1 = f$.\nFor $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\nWe need $c_0+c_1=2$.\nPossible pairs $(c_0, c_1)$ with $0 \\le c_i \\le 42$:\n$(0, 2)$\n$(1, 1)$\n$(2, 0)$\nThere are 3 ways. This matches the example output!\n\nSo the maximum size of the multiset is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } 1} f(s)$, where $f(s)$ is defined recursively.\n$f(s) = c_s$ for $len(s)=n$.\n$f(s) = \\min(c_s, f(s0) + f(s1))$ for $len(s) < n$.\nAnd the total is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } 1} f(s)$.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_sum}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ such that $\\sum_{s' \\text{ len } L} f(s')$ equals `current_sum`.\nThis is still problematic because $f(s')$ depends on $c_s'$ for $s'$ in its subtree, not just $c_s'$ for $s'$ of length $L$.\n\nLet's rethink the structure. The problem is a sum of $2^1$ independent subproblems for length 1 strings.\nThe total maximum size is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } 1} f(s)$.\nLet $g(s, \\text{val})$ be the number of ways to choose $c_x$ for all $x$ in the subtree of $s$ such that $f(s)=\\text{val}$.\nIf $len(s)=n$: $f(s)=c_s$. We need $c_s = \\text{val}$. There is 1 way if $0 \\le \\text{val} \\le k$, else 0 ways.\nIf $len(s)<n$: $f(s) = \\min(c_s, f(s0)+f(s1))$.\nWe need $f(s)=\\text{val}$.\nThis means $c_s \\ge \\text{val}$ and $f(s0)+f(s1) \\ge \\text{val}$ and ($c_s=\\text{val}$ or $f(s0)+f(s1)=\\text{val}$).\nLet $S_0 = f(s0)$ and $S_1 = f(s1)$.\nWe need $\\min(c_s, S_0+S_1) = \\text{val}$.\nThis can happen in two ways:\n1. $c_s = \\text{val}$ and $S_0+S_1 \\ge \\text{val}$.\n   Number of choices for $c_s$: 1 (it must be `val`). This is valid if $0 \\le \\text{val} \\le k$.\n   Number of choices for $S_0, S_1$: $\\sum_{S_0+S_1 \\ge \\text{val}} g(s0, S_0) \\cdot g(s1, S_1)$.\n2. $c_s > \\text{val}$ and $S_0+S_1 = \\text{val}$.\n   Number of choices for $c_s$: $k - \\text{val}$. This is valid if $0 \\le \\text{val} < k$.\n   Number of choices for $S_0, S_1$: $\\sum_{S_0+S_1 = \\text{val}} g(s0, S_0) \\cdot g(s1, S_1)$.\n\nLet $N_{L}[\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_x$ for strings $x$ of length $L+1, \\dots, n$ in the subtree of a node $s$ of length $L$, such that $f(s) = \\text{val}$.\nThis is a standard DP on trees, or rather, on tree levels.\nLet $dp[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_x$ for all $x$ in the subtree of *a* node of length $L$, such that $f(\\text{node})=\\text{val}$. Since the binary tree is symmetric, this value is the same for all nodes of length $L$.\nBase case: $L=n$.\n$dp[n][\\text{val}] = 1$ if $0 \\le \\text{val} \\le k$, else $0$.\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $dp[L][\\text{val}]$:\nWe need to sum over possible values for $S_0$ and $S_1$, where $S_0=f(s0)$ and $S_1=f(s1)$.\n$S_0$ can range from $0$ to $k$. $S_1$ can range from $0$ to $k$.\nThe maximum sum $S_0+S_1$ can be $2k$.\nThe maximum value for $f(s)$ is $k$.

This is a convolution.\nLet $P_{L+1}(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k dp[L+1][j] x^j$.\nThen $ways\\_sum$ is coefficients of $P_{L+1}(x)^2$. Maximum degree $2k$.\nLet $C_S = ways\\_sum[S]$.\n\nNow, for $dp[L][\\text{val}]$:\n$dp[L][\\text{val}] = 0$.\nCase 1: $c_s = \\text{val}$ and $S_0+S_1 \\ge \\text{val}$.\n   If $0 \\le \\text{val} \\le k$:\n     The number of ways for $S_0+S_1 \\ge \\text{val}$ is $\\sum_{S'=\\text{val}}^{2k} C_{S'}$. Let this be $SumC[\\text{val}]$.\n     $dp[L][\\text{val}] += SumC[\\text{val}]$.\nCase 2: $c_s > \\text{val}$ and $S_0+S_1 = \\text{val}$.\n   If $0 \\le \\text{val} < k$:\n     Number of choices for $c_s$ is $k - \\text{val}$.\n     Number of ways for $S_0+S_1=\\text{val}$ is $C_{\\text{val}}$.\n     $dp[L][\\text{val}] += (k - \\text{val}) \\cdot C_{\\text{val}}$.\n\nAll calculations must be modulo 998244353.\nThe maximum value for $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. $2k$ is $4 \\cdot 10^5$.\nConvolution takes $O(k \\log k)$ using FFT/NTT.\nWe do this $n$ times. Total time $O(n k \\log k)$.\n$n=15$, $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This should be feasible.\n\nLet's refine the DP state:\n`dp[val]` will store the number of ways to achieve `val` for $f(s)$ for a node $s$ at the current level.\n`dp_next[val]` will store the same for the next level (deeper).\n\nInitialize `dp` for $L=n$:\n`dp = [0] * (k + 1)`\nFor `val` from 0 to `k`: `dp[val] = 1`. (Other values are 0).\n\nLoop `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n  `current_dp = dp`\n  `dp_next = [0] * (k + 1)`\n\n  Calculate convolution:\n  `conv = [0] * (2*k + 1)`\n  For $j_0$ from $0$ to $k$:\n    If `current_dp[j_0] == 0`, continue.\n    For $j_1$ from $0$ to $k$:\n      If `current_dp[j_1] == 0`, continue.\n      `conv[j_0 + j_1] = (conv[j_0 + j_1] + current_dp[j_0] * current_dp[j_1]) % MOD`\n\n  Calculate suffix sums for `conv`:\n  `suffix_conv_sum = [0] * (2*k + 2)`\n  For $S$ from $2*k$ down to $0$:\n    `suffix_conv_sum[S] = (conv[S] + suffix_conv_sum[S+1]) % MOD`\n\n  Now compute `dp_next` for the current level `L`:\n  For `val` from 0 to `k`:\n    `ways = 0`\n    # Case 1: c_s = val and S_0+S_1 >= val\n    # Number of choices for c_s is 1.\n    # Number of ways for S_0+S_1 >= val is suffix_conv_sum[val].\n    `ways = (ways + suffix_conv_sum[val]) % MOD`\n\n    # Case 2: c_s > val and S_0+S_1 = val\n    # Number of choices for c_s is k - val.\n    # Number of ways for S_0+S_1 = val is conv[val].\n    If `val < k`:\n      `ways = (ways + (k - val) * conv[val]) % MOD`\n    \n    `dp_next[val] = ways`\n  \n  `dp = dp_next`\n\nAfter the loop, `dp` will contain the counts for nodes of length 1.\nThe total maximum size is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } 1} f(s)$.\nThere are $2^1=2$ nodes of length 1: $0$ and $1$.\nThe total sum is $f(0)+f(1)$.\nWe need $f(0)+f(1)=f$.\nSo we need to calculate $\\sum_{j_0=0}^f dp[j_0] \\cdot dp[f-j_0]$.\nThis is exactly `conv[f]` from the last iteration (when $L=1$).\nThis means we need to store the `conv` array from the last iteration (when we computed `dp` for $L=1$ from `dp` for $L=2$).\n\nLet's trace it again.\n`dp[val]` at level `L` represents $g(s, \\text{val})$ for a string $s$ of length $L$.\nStart with `dp` for $L=n$: `dp[val]=1` for $0 \\le val \\le k$, else $0$.\nIterate `L` from `n-1` down to $1$:\n  Calculate `conv` array using `dp` (from level $L+1$). `conv[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[j_0] \\cdot dp[j_1]`.\n  Calculate `suffix_conv_sum` using `conv`.\n  Calculate `next_dp` (for level $L$). `next_dp[val]` is computed using `conv`, `suffix_conv_sum`, and $k-\\text{val}$.\n  Update `dp = next_dp`.\nAfter the loop, `dp` contains $g(s, \\text{val})$ for a string $s$ of length 1.\nThe final answer is $\\sum_{j_0=0}^f dp[j_0] \\cdot dp[f-j_0]$. This is `conv[f]` if `conv` was computed using the final `dp` array.\nSo we need to compute `conv` one last time using the final `dp` (for $L=1$).\nThis `conv` will be for the sum of two $f(s)$ values, where $s$ is of length 1.\n\nThe values for `val` can go up to $k$.\nThe sum $j_0+j_1$ can go up to $2k$.\nThe `conv` array needs size $2k+1$.\n\nMaximum $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. Max $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe complexity of convolution using direct sum: $O(k^2)$.\n$N \\cdot K^2 = 15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10} = 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$. This is too slow.\nWe need NTT for convolution.\n\nNTT (Number Theoretic Transform) is a fast polynomial multiplication algorithm.\nThe modulo $998244353$ is a prime number and is suitable for NTT. It can be written as $119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$.\nThe maximum degree of polynomial is $2k$. So we need an NTT size of at least $2k+1$, which must be a power of 2.\nFor $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k+1 = 4 \\cdot 10^5 + 1$. The smallest power of 2 greater than this is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nNTT complexity is $O(S \\log S)$ where $S$ is the NTT size.\nTotal complexity: $O(n \\cdot S \\log S)$.\n$15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot \\log(524288) = 15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$.
