There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Problem: Maximizing House Profits with Zoning Restrictions**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring down a competitive programming problem where the goal is to squeeze the most profit out of building houses. We've got `n` spots, and each spot can hold a house of height up to `h`. The kicker? Profit is calculated as the square of the height, and we've got a bunch of zoning restrictions to deal with.  Each restriction essentially says, \"Hey, in this range of spots, the tallest house can't exceed this height.\"\n\nMy first thought? Let's break this down. For each spot, we need to pick a height. It has to be within the `0` to `h` range, of course. And it has to follow every single zoning restriction.  We're aiming to maximize the sum of the squared heights (that's the profit).\n\nThe small constraint values for `n`, `h`, and `m` (all less than or equal to 50) are screaming polynomial time. Might even be exponential, but with such small numbers, a brute-force approach wouldn't be completely out of the question. However, the restrictions give a clue.\n\nLet's dive into these restrictions.  If a restriction applies to a range, it means that *every* house within that range is capped by the given height. A little light bulb went off. For each spot, we can figure out its maximum allowable height by looking at all the restrictions that apply to it and picking the *smallest* allowed height. The most stringent rule is what matters. This means for each location, we can determine an independent upper bound for its height.\n\nSo here’s the key insight.  We can build an array, `max_allowed_height`, where each element, `max_allowed_height[i]`, represents the maximum possible height for house `i` considering all zoning rules. We start by assuming every house can be built to the maximum height `h`, then we iteratively apply restrictions.  For each restriction, we update the maximum allowed height of the affected houses with the lower restriction value. The crucial part here is that if a range has upper bound, and the largest house in this range has an upper bound, so can every house in the range, and it's upper bound is at most the upper bound of the largest house.\n\nNow, if we build each house to its `max_allowed_height`, will we satisfy all rules? Yes! We know that for any restriction, all heights within the range are less than or equal to the restriction's height.\n\nSince profit is `height^2`, and this function grows as height increases, we should make each house as tall as possible while staying legal, and this will be exactly `max_allowed_height[i]`. So, our strategy is to set each `a_i` (house height) to `max_allowed_height[i]`.  That's the core of the algorithm! It's a greedy approach and because of the structure of the restrictions, it yields the optimal answer.\n\nSo, let me go through it step-by-step:\n1.  Initialize an array `final_heights` where each element is `h`.\n2.  Iterate through all the restrictions.  For each restriction range, find `min(final_heights[i],restriction_value)` for each index in that range. This will make sure that the final height for any specific index is at most `x`.\n3.  Calculate the sum of squares of the values in the `final_heights` array.  This is the maximum profit.\n\nComplexity? It’s `O(m*n)`.  We go through each restriction and then update the heights of houses covered by that restriction.  The final profit computation is `O(n)`.  With `n, m <= 50`, this is super fast. This solution should work just fine, and I’ve checked with a few examples. I've also checked some basic edge cases where restrictions say a height has to be 0 for an index, or no restrictions exist to verify they all work correctly. It's time to code this up and get a high score.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, we can build a house of height `a_i`, where `0 <= a_i <= h`. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`. We are given `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` (inclusive) must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and the profit function:\n1.  **Constraints:** `n, h, m <= 50`. These are very small, suggesting that an `O(N*M)` or `O(N*M*H)` solution might pass.\n2.  **Profit Function:** We want to maximize `sum(a_i^2)`. Since `a_i` must be non-negative (heights are `0` or greater), `a_i^2` is an increasing function of `a_i`. This means to maximize the total profit, we should choose the largest possible height `a_i` for each house `i`.\n\nNow, let's understand the zoning restrictions. A restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that `max(a_k for k in [l_j, r_j]) <= x_j`. This condition implies that every house `k` within the range `[l_j, r_j]` must have a height `a_k` such that `a_k <= x_j`. If even one house in the range exceeded `x_j`, the maximum would be greater than `x_j`, violating the restriction.\n\nSo, for each spot `i`, its height `a_i` is subject to several upper bounds:\n*   The global maximum height `h`.\n*   For every restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` such that spot `i` is within the range `[l_j, r_j]` (i.e., `l_j <= i <= r_j`), `a_i` must be `a_i <= x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `i`, the maximum possible height `a_i` can be is the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions that cover spot `i`. Let's call this `max_allowed_height[i]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an array `final_heights` of size `n`. Initialize all elements `final_heights[k]` to `h`. This represents the initial maximum allowed height for each spot, before considering any specific zoning restrictions. (We'll use 0-indexed arrays for implementation, so spots are `0` to `n-1`).\n\n2.  **Process Restrictions:** For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\n    *   Iterate through all spots `k` from `l_j-1` to `r_j-1` (inclusive, to convert from 1-indexed to 0-indexed).\n    *   For each such spot `k`, update `final_heights[k] = min(final_heights[k], x_j)`. This ensures that spot `k`'s height respects the current restriction `x_j`, as well as any previously applied restrictions or the global `h`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit:** After processing all `m` restrictions, the `final_heights` array will contain the maximum possible height for each house that satisfies all global and local restrictions. Since we want to maximize `sum(a_i^2)` and `a_i^2` is maximized when `a_i` is maximized, we choose `a_i = final_heights[i]` for all `i`.\n    *   Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each `height` in `final_heights`.\n    *   Add `height * height` to `total_profit`.\n\n4.  **Output:** Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1.  **Initialize:** `final_heights = [3, 3, 3]`\n\n2.  **Process Restrictions:**\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`: For spot `0` (1-indexed spot `1`), `final_heights[0] = min(final_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `final_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`: For spot `1` (1-indexed spot `2`), `final_heights[1] = min(final_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `final_heights` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`: For spot `2` (1-indexed spot `3`), `final_heights[2] = min(final_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `final_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit:**\n    `total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n4.  **Output:** `14`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` for initialization. `m` restrictions, each potentially iterating `n` spots in the worst case (`l=1, r=n`). So, `O(m * n)` for processing restrictions. `O(n)` for summing profits. Total: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`. Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing `final_heights`. Given `n <= 50`, this is minimal.\n\nThis greedy approach works because each restriction imposes an independent upper bound on the heights within its range. Since we want to maximize `a_i^2`, we always choose the highest possible `a_i` that satisfies all applicable upper bounds.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line of input\n    # n: number of spots\n    # h: maximum possible height for any house (global limit)\n    # m: number of zoning restrictions\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, every spot can have a house up to height 'h' (the global maximum).\n    # We use 0-indexed array for convenience, so spots are from 0 to n-1.\n    final_heights = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the m zoning restrictions\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read the restriction parameters: l, r, x\n        # l: left limit of the restriction (1-indexed)\n        # r: right limit of the restriction (1-indexed)\n        # x: maximum allowed height within the range [l, r]\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots within the specified range [l, r].\n        # For each spot 'i' from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive, converting to 0-indexed):\n        # The house at spot 'i' must be at most 'x'.\n        # Therefore, we update its maximum allowed height to be the minimum of its current\n        # allowed height and 'x'.
