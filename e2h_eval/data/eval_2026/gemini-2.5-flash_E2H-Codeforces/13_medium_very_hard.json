For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, as a Python expert:**\n\nFirst, I need to take a set of three musical notes as input and classify it as \"major,\" \"minor,\" or \"strange.\" The notes are represented by letters, and I need to map them to numerical values (0-11) representing semitones. I'll use a dictionary for this mapping (C=0, C#=1, etc.). The challenge is that the order of the notes in the input doesn't matter; it's an unordered set, so I need to consider all possible arrangements. I know that a major triad can be formed by rearranging notes into intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (or 3,4 and 5) away from a base note. Similarly, a minor triad has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones from its base note. Any other combination is considered \"strange.\"\n\nMy approach is to read the notes, convert them to their numerical semitone values, and then sort them. I will then calculate the distance between each pair of sorted notes, considering the cyclic nature of the 12-tone scale (using the modulo operator to handle the cyclic wraps). This results in three intervals, which I will compare with the known interval patterns for major (4, 3, 5) and minor (3, 4, 5) triads.\n\nBecause I can rearrange the notes, I need to test all possible combinations to see if any match the major or minor pattern. It's important to remember that the order of these intervals matters; a major triad has a specific interval order, as does a minor triad. The problem guarantees that the result will be unambiguous: meaning, a triad won't be both major and minor. I'll implement a function to check for the proper cyclical matches. I can check if all the notes are the same, in that case the answer will be 'strange' immediately.\n\nMy Python code will read the input, map the notes to semitones, calculate the distances, then test all six permutations of the notes, arranging them and calculating intervals from them, to determine if the result is a major or minor triad (or strange if no match is found). I'll use `itertools.permutations` for the permutations. The input format will be a single line of three space-separated notes, and the output will be one of the three strings: \"major,\" \"minor,\" or \"strange.\" I'll also ensure my code handles the cyclic nature of the musical scale correctly, taking the smallest interval between the notes. Finally, the problem statement says that only one line of input will be given and it will contain exactly 3 notes, so I need to account for this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". The classification depends on the specific semitone distances between the notes when arranged in a particular order.\n\nThere are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. These notes form a cyclic scale, where each consecutive note is 1 semitone apart. We can map these notes to numerical values from 0 to 11 for easier calculation:\nC = 0, C# = 1, D = 2, D# = 3, E = 4, F = 5, F# = 6, G = 7, G# = 8, A = 9, B = 10, H = 11.\n\nThe distance between two notes `n_from` and `n_to` is calculated as `(n_to - n_from + 12) % 12`. This correctly handles the cyclic nature and ensures the distance is always positive and represents the shortest path upwards. For example, C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4` semitones. E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8` semitones.\n\nA triad consists of exactly three notes, say X, Y, and Z. The order of these notes matters for the definition of major and minor.\n\n*   **Major Triad:** If we can order the notes as X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 3 semitones.\n*   **Minor Triad:** If we can order the notes as X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nThe problem guarantees that a chord will be unambiguously major, minor, or strange (neither).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Semitones:** Create a dictionary to convert the string representation of notes (e.g., \"C\", \"C#\") into their corresponding integer semitone values (0-11).\n2.  **Read Input:** Read the three space-separated note strings from the input. Convert them to their numerical semitone values. Let these be `s1, s2, s3`.\n3.  **Check for Major Triad:**\n    *   Since the definition requires finding *an* ordering (X, Y, Z), we need to check all possible permutations of the three input notes. There are `3! = 6` permutations.\n    *   For each permutation `(x, y, z)`:\n        *   Calculate `dist_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12`.\n        *   Calculate `dist_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12`.\n        *   If `dist_xy == 4` and `dist_yz == 3`, then the chord is major. Set a flag `is_major = True` and stop checking.\n4.  **Check for Minor Triad (if not major):**\n    *   If `is_major` is still `False` after checking all permutations, then the chord is not major. Now, we check if it's minor.\n    *   Again, iterate through all 6 permutations `(x, y, z)` of the original three notes.\n    *   For each permutation:\n        *   Calculate `dist_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12`.\n        *   Calculate `dist_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12`.\n        *   If `dist_xy == 3` and `dist_yz == 4`, then the chord is minor. Set a flag `is_minor = True` and stop checking.\n5.  **Print Result:**\n    *   If `is_major` is `True`, print \"major\".\n    *   Else if `is_minor` is `True`, print \"minor\".\n    *   Else (if neither major nor minor), print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach directly implements the problem's definitions and handles all possible orderings of the notes, ensuring correctness for an \"unordered set\" of notes that needs to be ordered for classification. The number of permutations is very small (6), so this solution is highly efficient.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_semitone = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n\ndef get_distance(n_from, n_to):\n    return (n_to - n_from + 12) % 12\n\ndef solve():\n    notes_str = input().split()\n    semitones_val = [note_to_semitone[n] for n in notes_str]\n\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n\n    for p in itertools.permutations(semitones_val):\n        x, y, z = p\n        dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n        dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            is_major = True\n            break\n\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n        return\n\n    for p in itertools.permutations(semitones_val):\n        x, y, z = p\n        dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n        dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n            break\n\n    if is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
