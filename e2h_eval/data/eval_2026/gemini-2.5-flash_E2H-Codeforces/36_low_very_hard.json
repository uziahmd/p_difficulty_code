The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're looking at a competitive programming problem involving radio towers and signal coverage. The core question is about the probability of finding a valid power configuration, given random tower placements. Essentially, we're trying to figure out the chances of a \"success\" state in this probabilistic scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the mechanics. We have `n+2` towns, numbered `0` to `n+1`, and towers are placed in towns `1` through `n` with a 50/50 chance. A tower at location `i` with power `p` covers towns within the range `|c - i| < p`, or in simpler terms, `i - p < c < i + p`.\n\nNow, let's zero in on the constraints, because that's where the solution will hide. Constraint one is that towns `0` and `n+1` must remain signal-free. Thinking this through, for any tower at location `i`, its power `p` must not reach those towns. This means `i - p` must be greater than or equal to `0` and `i + p` must be less than or equal to `n+1`. Therefore, for a tower at `i`, its power must be between `1` and `min(i, n + 1 - i)`. This tells me the *maximum* possible power each tower can have, depending on its position.\n\nThe second constraint is key: each town from `1` to `n` must receive a signal from *exactly* one tower. This is where the partitioning concept comes in. The coverage ranges of the active towers must perfectly divide the towns `1` to `n`. It's a disjoint set problem – like having tiles that perfectly fit together with no gaps or overlaps.\n\nThis means if a tower at `i` has power `p`, it covers the range `[i-p+1, i+p-1]`. So, the challenge boils down to finding combinations where the ranges of the selected towers *cover* every town and *only* every town from 1 to `n`.  Each chosen power `p_i` has to satisfy `1 <= p_i <= min(i, n+1-i)`.\nThe core problem is about partitioning `{1, ..., n}` with the ranges `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]`.\nIn essence, the conditions for a valid solution are about the covered regions. We need `C_i \\subseteq \\{1, ..., n\\}` (coverage inside the bounds) for all towers `i` selected, and those covered regions need to partition the set. That should lead to the correct path!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towns for radio towers, we can assign signal powers such that:\n1. Towns `0` and `n+1` receive no signal.\n2. Towns `1, \\dots, n` each receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet `S` be the set of towns where towers are built. `S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}`. Each town `i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}` is chosen with probability `1/2`, independently.\nA tower at town `i` with signal power `p` covers towns `c` such that `i-p < c < i+p`. This means the interval `[i-p+1, i+p-1]`.\n\nCondition 1 implies that for any tower at `i` with power `p`:\n- `i-p+1 > 0 \\implies p \\le i`.\n- `i+p-1 < n+1 \\implies p \\le n+1-i`.\nSo, the maximum allowed power for a tower at `i` is `min(i, n+1-i)`.\nThe interval covered by a tower `i` with power `p` must be `[L, R]` where `1 \\le L \\le R \\le n`.\n\nCondition 2 implies that the intervals `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]` for `i \\in S` must form a partition of the set `{1, \\dots, n}`. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be `{1, \\dots, n}`.\n\nConsider a tower at `i` with power `p`. It covers `2p-1` towns centered at `i`.\nFor the intervals to partition `{1, \\dots, n}`, they must be of the form `[1, L_1], [L_1+1, L_2], \\dots, [L_{k-1}+1, n]`.\nThis structure implies that each tower must cover a symmetric interval around itself. Specifically, if a tower at `i` covers `[L, R]`, then `i = (L+R)/2` and `p = (R-L+2)/2`.\nFor `i` to be an integer, `L+R` must be even. For `p` to be an integer, `R-L` must be even. This means `L` and `R` must have the same parity.\n\nLet's look at the \"reach\" of a tower. A tower at `i` with power `p` covers `[i-p+1, i+p-1]`.\nThe maximum possible power for a tower at `i` is `min(i, n+1-i)`.\nIf `p = min(i, n+1-i)`, then the interval is `[i - min(i, n+1-i) + 1, i + min(i, n+1-i) - 1]`.\nNotice that `i - min(i, n+1-i) + 1` is either `1` (if `i` is small) or `2i - (n+1) + 1` (if `i` is large).\nSimilarly, `i + min(i, n+1-i) - 1` is either `2i-1` (if `i` is small) or `n` (if `i` is large).\n\nCrucially, if a town `j` is covered by a tower at `i` with power `p`, then `j \\in [i-p+1, i+p-1]`.\nIf `j` is covered by exactly one tower, then for any `j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}`, there is a unique `i \\in S` and a unique `p_i` such that `j \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]`.\nThis implies that for any `i \\in S`, the chosen power `p_i` must be `1`.\nWhy? Suppose a tower at `i` has power `p_i > 1`. It covers `[i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1]`.\nThis means `i-p_i+1` and `i+p_i-1` are covered.\nIf `p_i > 1`, then `i-p_i+1 < i` and `i+p_i-1 > i`.\nIf `i-p_i+1` is covered by tower `i`, it cannot be covered by any other tower.\nIf `i+p_i-1` is covered by tower `i`, it cannot be covered by any other tower.\nConsider the towns `1, \\dots, n`. Each must be covered exactly once.\nIf we have a tower at `i` with power `p_i`, it covers `2p_i-1` towns.\nThe towns `1, \\dots, n` must be partitioned into segments of length `2p_i-1`.\nThis means `n = \\sum_{i \\in S} (2p_i-1)`.\nSince `p_i \\ge 1`, `2p_i-1 \\ge 1`.\nIf `p_i = 1` for all `i \\in S`, then each tower `i` covers only town `i`.\nIn this case, for the towns `1, \\dots, n` to be covered exactly once, we must have towers in *all* towns `1, \\dots, n`. That is, `S = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}`.\nThe probability for this case is `(1/2)^n`.\n\nWhat if some `p_i > 1`?\nSuppose we have a tower at `i` with power `p_i`. It covers `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]`.\nThe towns `i-p_i+1` and `i+p_i-1` are covered.\nFor these towns to be covered exactly once, no other tower can cover them.\nThis means there cannot be a tower at `i-p_i+1` or `i+p_i-1`.\nMore generally, if a tower at `i` covers `[L, R]`, then there cannot be any other tower `j \\in S` such that `j \\in [L, R]`.\nThis implies that towers in `S` must be \"far apart\".\nSpecifically, if `i \\in S` covers `[L, R]`, then `S \\cap [L, R] = \\{i\\}`.\nAlso, the intervals must tile `[1, n]`.\nSuppose `n=5` and towers are at `2, 4, 5`.\nTower `2` has power `2`, covers `[1, 3]`.\nTower `4` has power `1`, covers `[4, 4]`.\nTower `5` has power `1`, covers `[5, 5]`.\nThis works! `S=\\{2,4,5\\}`. `p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1`.\nHere `p_2 = 2 > 1`. The condition `S \\cap [L, R] = \\{i\\}` holds: `S \\cap [1, 3] = \\{2\\}`.\nThe intervals `[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]` partition `[1,5]`.\nThe conditions `p_i \\le i` and `p_i \\le n+1-i` must hold.\nFor tower at `2` with `p_2=2`: `2 \\le 2` and `2 \\le 5+1-2=4`. Holds.\nFor tower at `4` with `p_4=1`: `1 \\le 4` and `1 \\le 5+1-4=2`. Holds.\nFor tower at `5` with `p_5=1`: `1 \\le 5` and `1 \\le 5+1-5=1`. Holds.\n\nThe critical observation is that each tower `i \\in S` must cover an interval `[L_i, R_i]` such that `i` is the center of this interval, i.e., `i = (L_i+R_i)/2`. This means `R_i - i = i - L_i`. Let this common distance be `d_i = p_i-1`. So `L_i = i-d_i` and `R_i = i+d_i`.\nThe intervals `[i-d_i, i+d_i]` for `i \\in S` must partition `{1, \\dots, n}`.\nThis means `i-d_i \\ge 1` and `i+d_i \\le n`.\nThis condition `p_i \\le i` and `p_i \\le n+1-i` is equivalent to `d_i \\le i-1` and `d_i \\le n-i`.\nSo, `d_i \\le \\min(i-1, n-i)`.\nThe set of towns `S` must be such that we can choose `d_i` for each `i \\in S` (where `0 \\le d_i \\le \\min(i-1, n-i)`) such that the intervals `[i-d_i, i+d_i]` partition `[1, n]`.\nThis implies that `S` must be a set of \"centers\" of disjoint intervals that tile `[1, n]`.\nIf `i \\in S`, then `i-d_i` and `i+d_i` are the boundaries of its covered segment.\nThe segment covered by `i` is `[i-d_i, i+d_i]`.\nThe next segment must start at `i+d_i+1`. Its center must be `j \\in S`.\nSo, `j-d_j = i+d_i+1`.\nThis structure implies that for any `i \\in S`, there cannot be another tower `j \\in S` in the interval `(i-d_i, i+d_i)`.\nThis means `S` must be a \"sparse\" set of towns.\n\nConsider the \"gaps\" between towers. If `i, j \\in S` are consecutive towers in `S` (i.e., `i < j` and no `k \\in S` with `i < k < j`), then the interval covered by `i` must end at `j-1`, and the interval covered by `j` must start at `i+1`.\nMore accurately, if `i \\in S` covers `[L_i, R_i]` and `j \\in S` covers `[L_j, R_j]`, and `R_i+1 = L_j`, then `R_i = i+d_i` and `L_j = j-d_j`.\nSo `i+d_i+1 = j-d_j`.\nThis means `j-i = d_i+d_j+1`.\nThe maximum `d_i` is `i-1` (covers `[1, 2i-1]`) or `n-i` (covers `[2i-n, n]`).\nSo `j-i \\le (i-1)+(j-1)+1 = i+j-1` (if `i` and `j` are small)\n`j-i \\le (n-i)+(n-j)+1 = 2n-i-j+1` (if `i` and `j` are large)\n\nThis problem is related to tiling a line segment with specific types of blocks.\nThe constraint `d_i \\le \\min(i-1, n-i)` means that a tower at `i` cannot cover beyond `1` or `n`.\nThe possible values for `d_i` are `0, 1, \\dots, \\min(i-1, n-i)`.\nIf `d_i = 0`, `p_i=1`, tower `i` covers only town `i`.\nIf `n` is odd, say `n=2k+1`, the center town is `k+1`. A tower at `k+1` can have `d_{k+1} = k`. It covers `[1, n]`.\nIf `n` is even, say `n=2k`, there is no single center town. Towers `k` and `k+1` can cover `[1, 2k-1]` and `[2, 2k]` respectively.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `n=5`.\n`S=\\{2,4,5\\}`. `p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1`.\n`d_2=1, d_4=0, d_5=0`.\nIntervals: `[2-1, 2+1]=[1,3]`, `[4-0, 4+0]=[4,4]`, `[5-0, 5+0]=[5,5]`.\nThese partition `[1,5]`.\nFor `d_2=1`: `1 \\le \\min(2-1, 5-2) = \\min(1,3) = 1`. Valid.\nFor `d_4=0`: `0 \\le \\min(4-1, 5-4) = \\min(3,1) = 1`. Valid.\nFor `d_5=0`: `0 \\le \\min(5-1, 5-5) = \\min(4,0) = 0`. Valid.\n\nThe problem effectively asks for the number of sequences `(t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k)` of distinct towns from `\\{1, \\dots, n\\}` such that there exist `d_1, \\dots, d_k` satisfying `0 \\le d_j \\le \\min(t_j-1, n-t_j)` and the intervals `[t_j-d_j, t_j+d_j]` partition `[1, n]`.\nEach such sequence corresponds to a valid configuration of towers. For each such configuration, the probability is `(1/2)^k`, where `k` is the number of towers.\nThe total probability is `sum_{valid configs C} (1/2)^{|C|}`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to partition the interval `[1, i]` using towers.\nTo compute `dp[i]`:\nWe can place a tower at `j` (`1 \\le j \\le i`) that covers `[L, i]`.\nThe previous segment must end at `L-1`.\nThe tower at `j` covers `[j-d_j, j+d_j]`. So `j+d_j = i`.\nThis means `d_j = i-j`.\nWe also need `d_j \\le \\min(j-1, n-j)`.\nSo `i-j \\le j-1 \\implies i+1 \\le 2j \\implies j \\ge (i+1)/2`.\nAnd `i-j \\le n-j \\implies i \\le n`. This is always true if we are computing `dp[i]` for `i \\le n`.\nSo, for a tower at `j` to cover `[L, i]` where `L=j-d_j=j-(i-j)=2j-i`, we need `j \\ge (i+1)/2`.\nThe number of ways to partition `[1, i]` is `sum_{j=(i+1)/2 to i} dp[2j-i-1]` (where `dp[0]=1`).\nThe base cases are `dp[0]=1`.\n`dp[1]`: `j \\ge (1+1)/2 = 1`. Only `j=1`. `d_1 = 1-1=0`. `dp[2*1-1-1] = dp[0]=1`. (Tower at 1, covers [1,1]).\n`dp[2]`: `j \\ge (2+1)/2 = 1.5`. So `j=2`. `d_2 = 2-2=0`. `dp[2*2-2-1] = dp[1]=1`. (Tower at 2, covers [2,2]. Preceded by partition of [1,1]).\n`dp[3]`: `j \\ge (3+1)/2 = 2`. So `j=2, 3`.\n  `j=2`: `d_2 = 3-2=1`. `dp[2*2-3-1] = dp[0]=1`. (Tower at 2, covers [1,3]).\n  `j=3`: `d_3 = 3-3=0`. `dp[2*3-3-1] = dp[2]=1`. (Tower at 3, covers [3,3]. Preceded by partition of [1,2]).\nSo `dp[3] = 1+1=2`.\n`dp[4]`: `j \\ge (4+1)/2 = 2.5`. So `j=3, 4`.\n  `j=3`: `d_3 = 4-3=1`. `dp[2*3-4-1] = dp[1]=1`. (Tower at 3, covers [2,4]. Preceded by partition of [1,1]).\n  `j=4`: `d_4 = 4-4=0`. `dp[2*4-4-1] = dp[3]=2`. (Tower at 4, covers [4,4]. Preceded by partition of [1,3]).\nSo `dp[4] = 1+2=3`.\n`dp[5]`: `j \\ge (5+1)/2 = 3`. So `j=3, 4, 5`.\n  `j=3`: `d_3 = 5-3=2`. `dp[2*3-5-1] = dp[0]=1`. (Tower at 3, covers [1,5]).\n  `j=4`: `d_4 = 5-4=1`. `dp[2*4-5-1] = dp[2]=1`. (Tower at 4, covers [3,5]. Preceded by partition of [1,2]).\n  `j=5`: `d_5 = 5-5=0`. `dp[2*5-5-1] = dp[4]=3`. (Tower at 5, covers [5,5]. Preceded by partition of [1,4]).\nSo `dp[5] = 1+1+3=5`.\n\nThe sequence `dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5, \\dots` looks like Fibonacci numbers.\nSpecifically, `dp[i] = F_{i}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots`.\nSo `dp[i] = F_{i+1}` using the definition `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\nLet's check the recurrence: `dp[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} dp[2j-i-1]`.\nThis is not `F_{i+1}`. For `F_{i+1}` we need `F_{i+1} = F_i + F_{i-1}`.\nLet's re-evaluate the sum.\nThe sum is over `j` from `\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil` to `i`.\nLet `k = 2j-i-1`.\nWhen `j = \\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil`:\n  If `i` is odd, `i=2m+1`, `j=(2m+2)/2=m+1`. `k = 2(m+1)-(2m+1)-1 = 2m+2-2m-1-1 = 0`.\n  If `i` is even, `i=2m`, `j=\\lceil(2m+1)/2\\rceil=m+1`. `k = 2(m+1)-2m-1 = 2m+2-2m-1 = 1`.\nWhen `j=i`: `k = 2i-i-1 = i-1`.\nSo the sum is `dp[0] + dp[1] + \\dots + dp[i-1]` (if `i` is odd, starting from `dp[0]`) or `dp[1] + \\dots + dp[i-1]` (if `i` is even, starting from `dp[1]`).\nThis sum is `dp[i] = \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} dp[k]` if `i` is odd and `dp[i] = \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} dp[k]` if `i` is even.\nLet `S_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{i} dp[k]`.\nIf `i` is odd: `dp[i] = S_{i-1}`.\nIf `i` is even: `dp[i] = S_{i-1} - dp[0] = S_{i-1} - 1`.\n`dp[0]=1`.\n`dp[1] = S_0 = dp[0] = 1`.\n`dp[2] = S_1 - 1 = (dp[0]+dp[1]) - 1 = (1+1)-1 = 1`.\n`dp[3] = S_2 = dp[0]+dp[1]+dp[2] = 1+1+1 = 3`.\n`dp[4] = S_3 - 1 = (dp[0]+dp[1]+dp[2]+dp[3]) - 1 = (1+1+1+3) - 1 = 5`.\n`dp[5] = S_4 = dp[0]+dp[1]+dp[2]+dp[3]+dp[4] = 1+1+1+3+5 = 11`.\nThis sequence is `1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, \\dots`. This is not Fibonacci.\nMy previous manual calculation for `dp[3]` and `dp[4]` was incorrect.\n`dp[3]=3` means:\n  `j=2, d_2=1`: tower at 2 covers `[1,3]`. Preceded by `dp[0]=1` way.\n  `j=3, d_3=0`: tower at 3 covers `[3,3]`. Preceded by `dp[2]=1` way.\nMy manual calculation `dp[3]=1+1=2` was wrong. It should be `dp[2]=1`.\nWait, the `dp[2j-i-1]` counts the ways to partition `[1, 2j-i-1]`.\nThe number of towers used in `[1, 2j-i-1]` is `k_1`. The current tower is `1`. So total `k_1+1`.\nThe problem asks for `sum_{valid configs C} (1/2)^{|C|}`.\nLet `f[i]` be this sum for partitioning `[1, i]`.\n`f[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} f[2j-i-1] \\cdot (1/2)`.\n`f[0] = 1` (empty partition, 0 towers, `(1/2)^0=1`).\n`f[1]`: `j=1`. `f[2*1-1-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[0] \\cdot (1/2) = 1/2`.\n`f[2]`: `j=2`. `f[2*2-2-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[1] \\cdot (1/2) = (1/2) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/4`.\n`f[3]`: `j=2,3`.\n  `j=2, d_2=1`: `f[2*2-3-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[0] \\cdot (1/2) = 1/2`. (Tower at 2 covering [1,3]).\n  `j=3, d_3=0`: `f[2*3-3-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[2] \\cdot (1/2) = (1/4) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/8`. (Tower at 3 covering [3,3], preceded by partition of [1,2]).\n`f[3] = 1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8`.\n`f[4]`: `j=3,4`.\n  `j=3, d_3=1`: `f[2*3-4-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[1] \\cdot (1/2) = (1/2) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/4`.\n  `j=4, d_4=0`: `f[2*4-4-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[3] \\cdot (1/2) = (5/8) \\cdot (1/2) = 5/16`.\n`f[4] = 1/4 + 5/16 = 4/16 + 5/16 = 9/16`.\n`f[5]`: `j=3,4,5`.\n  `j=3, d_3=2`: `f[2*3-5-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[0] \\cdot (1/2) = 1/2`.\n  `j=4, d_4=1`: `f[2*4-5-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[2] \\cdot (1/2) = (1/4) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/8`.\n  `j=5, d_5=0`: `f[2*5-5-1] \\cdot (1/2) = f[4] \\cdot (1/2) = (9/16) \\cdot (1/2) = 9/32`.\n`f[5] = 1/2 + 1/8 + 9/32 = 16/32 + 4/32 + 9/32 = 29/32`.\n\nThe example values are:\n`n=2`: `1/4`. My `f[2]=1/4`. Matches.\n`n=3`: `1/4`. My `f[3]=5/8`. Does not match.\n`n=5`: `5/32`. My `f[5]=29/32`. Does not match.\n\nWhat's wrong? The problem states `1 <= p <= min(i, n + 1 - i)`. My `d_i \\le \\min(i-1, n-i)` is `p_i-1 \\le \\min(i-1, n-i)`, which is `p_i \\le \\min(i, n-i+1)`. This part is correct.\n\nLet's re-read the conditions.\n\"towns 0 and n+1 don't get any signal\" -> `p_i \\le i` and `p_i \\le n+1-i`.\n\"towns 1, ..., n get signal from exactly one radio tower each\".\nThis implies that the chosen intervals `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]` must partition `[1, n]`.\nThis implies that `i` must be the center of its interval `[L_i, R_i]`.\nSo `L_i = i-p_i+1` and `R_i = i+p_i-1`.\nThe recurrence `f[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} f[2j-i-1] \\cdot (1/2)` assumes that the tower at `j` covers `[2j-i, i]`.\nThe town `2j-i` is `L_j`. This is `j-(i-j)`.\nSo `p_j-1 = i-j`. `p_j = i-j+1`.\nThe condition `p_j \\le j` means `i-j+1 \\le j \\implies i+1 \\le 2j \\implies j \\ge (i+1)/2`. This is correct.\nThe condition `p_j \\le n+1-j` means `i-j+1 \\le n+1-j \\implies i \\le n`. This is correct for `i \\le n`.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests that my interpretation of the recurrence or the problem might be missing something.\nThe example for `n=3` states `1/4`.\nPossible tower configurations for `n=3`:\n1. `S={1,2,3}`. `p_1=1,p_2=1,p_3=1`. Intervals `[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]`. Probability `(1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n2. `S={2}`. `p_2=2`. Interval `[1,3]`. Probability `(1/2)^1 = 1/2`.\n   Condition check for `p_2=2`: `p_2 \\le 2` (true), `p_2 \\le 3+1-2=2` (true). Valid.\nTotal probability `1/8 + 1/2 = 5/8`. This is `f[3]`.\nThe example output `1/4` for `n=3` suggests that only one of these is valid, or something else is counted.\nThe example note for `n=3`:\n\"with probability `1/8`, the towers are built in towns `1, 2, 3`, so we can set their signal powers to `1`\" (this is my case 1)\n\"with probability `1/8`, only one tower in town `2` is built, and we can set its signal power to `2`\" (this is my case 2, but probability is `1/2` not `1/8`).\nThis explanation is confusing. If towers are built in `1,2,3`, probability is `(1/2)^3=1/8`.\nIf only tower in `2` is built, probability is `(1/2)^1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/8`. This is `P(S=\\{2\\})`.\nSo the example output `1/4` for `n=3` is `1/8 + 1/8`. This suggests that the two configurations I found are the only ones, and they must be based on specific tower sets.\nMy `f[i]` calculates `sum_{S \\text{ is a valid set}} (1/2)^{|S|}`.\nFor `n=3`:\n`S={1,2,3}`: `p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1`. `|S|=3`. Contribution `(1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n`S={2}`: `p_2=2`. `|S|=1`. Contribution `(1/2)^1 = 1/2`.\nThe problem states \"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nThis means we sum up `P(S)` for all `S` for which a valid power assignment exists.\n`P(S) = (1/2)^{|S|} \\cdot (1/2)^{n-|S|} = (1/2)^n`.\nThis is a crucial insight! The probability of a specific set `S` of towers being built is `(1/2)^n`, not `(1/2)^{|S|}`.\nThe `(1/2)^{n-|S|}` comes from the towns where towers are *not* built.\n\nSo, let `N_k` be the number of valid configurations that use exactly `k` towers.\nThe total probability is `sum_{k=1}^n N_k \\cdot (1/2)^n`.\nThis means we need to count the number of valid sets `S`.\nLet `g[i]` be the number of ways to partition `[1, i]` using towers.\n`g[0] = 1`.\n`g[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} g[2j-i-1]`.\n`g[1]`: `j=1`. `g[0]=1`.\n`g[2]`: `j=2`. `g[1]=1`.\n`g[3]`: `j=2,3`. `g[0]+g[2] = 1+1 = 2`.\n`g[4]`: `j=3,4`. `g[1]+g[3] = 1+2 = 3`.\n`g[5]`: `j=3,4,5`. `g[0]+g[2]+g[4] = 1+1+3 = 5`.\nThis sequence `1,1,1,2,3,5,...` is `F_{i+1}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\nSo `g[i] = F_{i+1}`.\nThe number of ways to partition `[1,n]` is `g[n] = F_{n+1}`.\nEach such way corresponds to a specific set `S` of towers.\nFor example, for `n=3`, `g[3]=F_4=3`.\nThe 3 ways are:\n1. Tower at 2, `p_2=2`. Covers `[1,3]`. `S={2}`.\n2. Tower at 1, `p_1=1`. Covers `[1,1]`. Followed by tower at 2, `p_2=1`. Covers `[2,2]`. Followed by tower at 3, `p_3=1`. Covers `[3,3]`. `S={1,2,3}`.\n3. This is where my manual calculation was wrong.\n   For `g[3] = g[0] + g[2]`.\n   `g[0]` corresponds to `j=2, d_2=1`. Tower at 2 covers `[1,3]`. `S={2}`.\n   `g[2]` corresponds to `j=3, d_3=0`. Tower at 3 covers `[3,3]`. Preceded by partition of `[1,2]`.\n   The `g[2]` ways to partition `[1,2]` are:\n     a. Tower at 2, `p_2=1`. Covers `[2,2]`. Preceded by tower at 1, `p_1=1`. Covers `[1,1]`. `S'={1,2}`.\n     b. Tower at 1, `p_1=1`. Covers `[1,1]`. Preceded by tower at 2, `p_2=1`. Covers `[2,2]`. `S'={1,2}`.\n   This is still confusing. The `g[i]` counts the *number of ways to partition the interval*, not the number of tower sets.\n   Each `g[i]` represents a choice of `S` and powers `p_s`.\n   The actual problem asks for the number of *sets* `S` for which *there exists* a valid power assignment.\n   My `g[i]` counts how many pairs `(S, {p_s})` exist. If a set `S` can have multiple power assignments, it would be counted multiple times.\n   However, the condition that `i` is the center `(L_i+R_i)/2` and the segments partition `[1,n]` means that for a given `S`, the powers `p_s` are uniquely determined.\n   If `i \\in S` and it covers `[L, R]`, then `p_i = (R-L+2)/2`.\n   If `S` is given, and we want to partition `[1,n]`, we must define `p_i` for each `i \\in S`.\n   Let `i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k` be the towns in `S`.\n   The first tower `i_1` must cover `[1, R_1]`. So `p_{i_1} = (R_1-1+2)/2 = (R_1+1)/2`.\n   The second tower `i_2` must cover `[R_1+1, R_2]`. So `p_{i_2} = (R_2-(R_1+1)+2)/2 = (R_2-R_1+1)/2`.\n   And so on.\n   This means `i_j` must be `(L_j+R_j)/2`.\n   So `i_1 = (1+R_1)/2`, `i_2 = (R_1+1+R_2)/2`, etc.\n   This implies that for a given set `S`, there is at most one way to assign powers.\n   So `g[n] = F_{n+1}` is indeed the number of sets `S` for which a valid power assignment exists.\n\nSo the answer is `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\nLet's check `n=3`. `F_{3+1} = F_4 = 3`. Probability `3 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 3/8`.\nStill not `1/4`.\nThe problem note for `n=3` is `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`.\nThe first `1/8` is for `S={1,2,3}`. `F_4` counts this.\nThe second `1/8` is for `S={2}`. `F_4` counts this.\nWhat is the third configuration `F_4=3` counts?\n`g[3]=g[0]+g[2]`.\n`g[0]` corresponds to `j=2, d_2=1`. Tower at 2 covers `[1,3]`. Set `S={2}`.\n`g[2]` corresponds to `j=3, d_3=0`. Tower at 3 covers `[3,3]`. Preceded by partition of `[1,2]`.\nThe partition of `[1,2]` is `g[2]=1`. This is `j=2, d_2=0`. Tower at 2 covers `[2,2]`. Preceded by partition of `[1,1]`.\nThe partition of `[1,1]` is `g[1]=1`. This is `j=1, d_1=0`. Tower at 1 covers `[1,1]`. Preceded by partition of `[0,0]`.\nSo for `g[3]`:\n1. `S=\\{2\\}` (tower at 2 with `p_2=2` covers `[1,3]`).\n2. `S=\\{1,2,3\\}` (tower at 1 with `p_1=1` covers `[1,1]`, tower at 2 with `p_2=1` covers `[2,2]`, tower at 3 with `p_3=1` covers `[3,3]`).\nThese are the two cases I found. My `g[3]=2`.\nWhere did `F_4=3` come from?\n`F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\n`g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5`.\nThis sequence is `F_{i+1}`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}`.\nFor `n=3`, `g[3]=F_4=3`. This is what I got.\nThe two configurations I listed are `S={2}` and `S={1,2,3}`. These are 2 configurations.\nWhat is the third one? I must be missing something fundamental about the recurrence or the problem.\n\nLet's check the constraints on `j` again.\n`j` is the last tower in `S` that covers `i`. So `j \\in S`.\n`j+d_j = i`. `d_j = i-j`.\n`p_j = i-j+1`.\n`1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(j, n+1-j)`.\nSo `i-j+1 \\le j \\implies i+1 \\le 2j \\implies j \\ge (i+1)/2`.\nAnd `i-j+1 \\le n+1-j \\implies i \\le n`.\nThe calculation of `g[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} g[2j-i-1]` is correct.\nThe values `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5` are correct.\nThese are indeed `F_{i+1}`.\n\nSo for `n=3`, `g[3]=2`.\nThe two sets `S` are `{2}` and `{1,2,3}`.\nProbabilities for these sets are `(1/2)^3` each.\n`P(S=\\{2\\}) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n`P(S=\\{1,2,3\\}) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\nTotal probability `1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4`.\nThis matches the example output for `n=3`.\n\nFor `n=5`, `g[5]=5`.\nTotal probability `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`.\nThis matches the example output for `n=5`.\n\nIt seems my initial understanding of `P(S)` was wrong, and the Fibonacci sequence is correct.\nThe confusion with `n=3` example note: \"with probability `1/8`, only one tower in town `2` is built, and we can set its signal power to `2`.\"\nThis is `P(S=\\{2\\})`. It is `(1/2)^3` because `n=3`.\nThe probability of `S=\\{2\\}` being built *and nothing else* is `(1/2)^1 \\cdot (1/2)^{3-1} = (1/2)^3`.\nThis is consistent.\n\nSo the problem boils down to calculating `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots`.\nWe need to compute `F_{n+1}`. Since `n` can be up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`, we can use matrix exponentiation for `F_{n+1}`.\nThe matrix for Fibonacci numbers is `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n`[[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]^k`.\nWe need `F_{n+1}`, so we compute `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]^n`.\nThe top-left element will be `F_{n+1}`.\n\nWe also need `(1/2)^n = (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`MOD = 998244353`. This is a prime number.\nWe can compute `2^n \\pmod{MOD}` using modular exponentiation.\nThen compute its modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem: `a^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Define `MOD = 998244353`.\n2. Implement matrix multiplication `multiply(A, B)`.\n3. Implement matrix exponentiation `matrix_pow(A, p)`.\n4. Implement modular exponentiation `pow_mod(base, exp, mod)`.\n5. Compute `fib_n_plus_1 = matrix_pow([[1, 1], [1, 0]], n)[0][0]`.\n   (Base case: `n=1`, `F_2=1`. `matrix_pow([[1,1],[1,0]], 1)` is `[[1,1],[1,0]]`. `[0][0]` is `1`. Correct.)\n   (Base case: `n=0`, `F_1=1`. `matrix_pow([[1,1],[1,0]], 0)` is identity `[[1,0],[0,1]]`. `[0][0]` is `1`. Correct.)\n6. Compute `inv_2_pow_n = pow_mod(pow_mod(2, n, MOD), MOD-2, MOD)`.\n7. Result is `(fib_n_plus_1 * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD`.\n\nExample `n=2`:\n`F_{2+1} = F_3 = 2`.\n`inv_2_pow_2 = (2^2)^{-1} = 4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{998244353}`. `x = (998244353+1)/4 = 998244354/4 = 249561088.5`. Not an integer.\n`4^{-1} \\equiv 249561089 \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`2 \\cdot 249561089 = 499122178 \\pmod{998244353}`.\nOutput for `n=2` is `748683265`. This doesn't match `499122178`.\n\nWhat is `748683265`?\n`1/4 = 249561089`. Wait, `4^{-1}` is `249561089`.\n`2 \\cdot 249561089 = 499122178`.\nThe example output `748683265` is for `n=2`.\nThe real answer for `n=2` is `1/4`. My formula `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n` gives `F_3 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2 \\cdot 1/4 = 1/2`.\nThis is `499122178`.\n\nThis means my `g[n]` is wrong. Or the interpretation of `F_{n+1}` as `g[n]` is wrong.\nWhat is `g[n]`? It is the number of valid ways to partition `[1,n]`.\nFor `n=2`:\n1. `S={1,2}`. `p_1=1, p_2=1`. Intervals `[1,1], [2,2]`. Valid.\n2. `S={}`. No, this is not a partition of `[1,2]`.\nSo for `n=2`, there is only one valid set `S={1,2}`.\nThe probability for this set is `(1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\nMy `g[2]=F_3=2`. This means I'm counting two ways for `n=2`.\nWhat are they?\n`g[2] = sum_{j=\\lceil(2+1)/2\\rceil}^{2} g[2j-2-1] = g[2*2-2-1] = g[1]`.\n`g[1] = sum_{j=\\lceil(1+1)/2\\rceil}^{1} g[2j-1-1] = g[2*1-1-1] = g[0]`.\n`g[0]=1`. So `g[1]=1`, `g[2]=1`.\nSo `g[n]` is `1` for `n=0,1,2`.\n`g[3] = g[2] + g[0] = 1+1=2`.\n`g[4] = g[3] + g[1] = 2+1=3`.\n`g[5] = g[4] + g[2] + g[0] = 3+1+1=5`.\nThe sequence is `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5`.\nThis is indeed `F_{n+1}` starting with `F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...`.\nSo `g[n] = F_{n+1}`.\n\nFor `n=2`, `g[2]=F_3=2`.\nThe two ways are:\n1. `j=2, d_2=0`. Tower at 2 covers `[2,2]`. Preceded by partition of `[1,1]`. `g[1]=1` way for `[1,1]`. This is `S={1,2}`.\n2. What is the other way? My manual trace for `g[2]` says `g[1]`.\n   `g[2]`: `j=2` is the last tower covering `[L,2]`. `p_2=1`. Covers `[2,2]`. `L=2`.\n   The previous segment must cover `[1,1]`. This is `g[1]` ways.\n   `g[1]`: `j=1` is the last tower covering `[L,1]`. `p_1=1`. Covers `[1,1]`. `L=1`.\n   The previous segment must cover `[0,0]`. This is `g[0]` ways.\n   So `g[2]=1` corresponds to `S=\\{1,2\\}`.\n   `g[0]` is the empty set, `S=\\{\\}`.\n   So `g[2]` is indeed `1`.\n\nThe sequence is `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5`.\nThis is `F_{n+1}` *if* `F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5`.\nNo, this is `F_{n+1}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\nSo `g[0]=F_1`, `g[1]=F_2`, `g[2]=F_3`, `g[3]=F_4`, `g[4]=F_5`, `g[5]=F_6`.\nThis means `g[n] = F_{n+1}` is correct.\n\nLet's re-check `n=2` example. Output `748683265`.\nReal answer `1/4`.\n`1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089`.\nThe example output is `748683265`.\nThis is `3/4`.\nWhy `3/4` for `n=2`?\n`S={1,2}` (prob `1/4` for this specific S). `p_1=1, p_2=1`. Valid.\nWhat other `S` are valid?\nIf `S={1}`, `p_1=1`. Covers `[1,1]`. Town `2` is not covered. Invalid.\nIf `S={2}`, `p_2=1`. Covers `[2,2]`. Town `1` is not covered. Invalid.\nIf `S=\\{\\}`, no towns covered. Invalid.\nSo for `n=2`, only `S={1,2}` is valid. Probability `1/4`.\nThe example output `748683265` for `n=2` is `3/4`.\nThis means there are 3 valid sets `S` for `n=2`, each with probability `1/4`.\nThis contradicts my analysis.\n\nThe example note says for `n=2`: \"with probability `1/4`, the towers are built in both towns `1` and `2`, so we can set their signal powers to `1`.\"\nThis is `P(S=\\{1,2\\}) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`. This is the only case.\nSo the real answer for `n=2` is `1/4`.\nThe example output for `n=2` is `748683265`.\n`748683265 \\pmod{998244353}`. This value is `3 \\cdot (1/4) = 3/4`.\nThis implies that the provided example output `748683265` for `n=2` is incorrect, or my interpretation of the problem is still flawed.\nGiven that `n=3` and `n=5` match my formula `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n`, it's highly likely that my formula is correct and the `n=2` example output is simply wrong.\nLet's double-check `n=3`. `F_4 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 3 \\cdot 1/8 = 3/8`.\nExample output `748683265`.\n`3/8 \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 124780544.125`.\n`8^{-1} = 124780544`. (Since `8 \\cdot 124780544 = 998244352 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{MOD}`. So `8^{-1} = -124780544 \\equiv 998244353 - 124780544 = 873463809`).\n`3 \\cdot 873463809 = 2620391427 \\pmod{998244353} = 623902179`.\nThis is also not `748683265`.\n\nThe example output for `n=3` is `748683265`. This is `3/4`.\nThe example note for `n=3` says `1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4`. This is what I got with `g[3]=2` and `(1/2)^3`.\nSo `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4`.\nThis means `g[n]` is the count of valid sets `S`.\nSo for `n=3`, `g[3]=2`. The answer is `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 1/4`.\n`1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089`.\nThe example output for `n=3` is `748683265`. This is `3/4`.\nThis is very confusing. The example note for `n=3` says `1/4` but the output is `3/4`.\nThe example note for `n=2` says `1/4` but the output is `3/4`.\nThe example note for `n=5` says `5/32` and the output is `842268673`.\n`5/32 \\pmod{998244353}`.\n`32^{-1} = 31195136`.\n`5 \\cdot 31195136 = 155975680`.\nThe example output for `n=5` is `842268673`. This is not `155975680`.\n\nIt seems the example outputs are for a different problem or calculation.\nLet me re-read the problem statement very carefully.\n\"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nThis is `sum_{S \\text{ s.t. valid powers exist}} P(S)`.\n`P(S) = (1/2)^n` for any specific set `S`.\nSo the total probability is `(number of valid sets S) * (1/2)^n`.\nMy `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` (using `F_0=0, F_1=1`).\nSo `g[n]` is the number of valid `S` sets.\n`n=1`: `g[1]=F_2=1`. `S={1}`. `p_1=1`. Valid. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2`.\n`n=2`: `g[2]=F_3=2`. Wait, `g[2]=F_3=2` is wrong. `g[2]=1`.\n`g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5, \\dots`.\nThis sequence is `F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, \\dots`.\nSo `g[n] = F_{n+1}` is correct.\nFor `n=2`, `g[2]=F_3=2`.\nThe two ways are:\n1. `j=2, d_2=0`. Tower at 2 covers `[2,2]`. Preceded by partition of `[1,1]`. `g[1]=1` way.\n   This way for `[1,1]` is `j=1, d_1=0`. Tower at 1 covers `[1,1]`. Preceded by partition of `[0,0]`. `g[0]=1` way.\n   So this is `S={1,2}`.\n2. What is the other way for `n=2`? `g[2]=F_3=2`.\n   The recurrence `g[i] = sum_{j=\\lceil(i+1)/2\\rceil}^{i} g[2j-i-1]` is correct.\n   For `i=2`: `j` from `\\lceil(2+1)/2\\rceil = 2` to `2`. Only `j=2`.\n   `g[2] = g[2*2-2-1] = g[1]`.\n   So `g[2]` must be `g[1]`.\n   `g[1]`: `j` from `\\lceil(1+1)/2\\rceil = 1` to `1`. Only `j=1`.\n   `g[1] = g[2*1-1-1] = g[0]`.\n   Since `g[0]=1`, then `g[1]=1`, and `g[2]=1`.\n   So for `n=2`, `g[2]=1`. This means only one valid set `S={1,2}`. Probability `1/4`.\n   The example output for `n=2` is `748683265 \\equiv 3/4 \\pmod{998244353}`.\n   This is very strange. My `g[n]` values match `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1,2,3,4,5` as `1,1,1,2,3,5`.\n   This means `g[2]=1`.\n   So for `n=2`, the answer should be `1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\n   For `n=3`, `g[3]=2`. The answer should be `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4`.\n   For `n=5`, `g[5]=5`. The answer should be `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`.\n\nIt seems my computed values for `1/4`, `1/4`, `5/32` match the *notes* in the problem description, not the *outputs*.\n`n=2`: Note `1/4`, Output `748683265`.\n`n=3`: Note `1/4`, Output `748683265`.\n`n=5`: Note `5/32`, Output `842268673`.\n\nThis implies the example outputs are for `n=2` and `n=3` are `3/4`, and for `n=5` is something else.\nThis is a very confusing problem statement and examples.\nIf the notes are correct, then my `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n` calculation is correct.\nLet's calculate the values for `n=2,3,5` with `F_{n+1}`.\n`F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\n`n=1`: `F_2 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1 \\cdot 1/2 = 1/2`.\n`n=2`: `F_3 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2 \\cdot 1/4 = 1/2`.\n`n=3`: `F_4 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 3 \\cdot 1/8 = 3/8`.\n`n=5`: `F_6 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 8 \\cdot 1/32 = 1/4`.\n\nMy `g[n]` sequence `1,1,1,2,3,5` is `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1,2,3,4,5`.\nSo `g[2]=1`.\n`n=2`: `g[2] \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1 \\cdot 1/4 = 1/4`. (Matches note)\n`n=3`: `g[3] \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2 \\cdot 1/8 = 1/4`. (Matches note)\n`n=5`: `g[5] \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5 \\cdot 1/32 = 5/32`. (Matches note)\n\nSo my formula is `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n` using `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`...\nNo, it's `g[n]` (the count of valid sets for `[1,n]`) multiplied by `(1/2)^n`.\n`g[0]=1`\n`g[1]=1`\n`g[2]=1`\n`g[3]=2`\n`g[4]=3`\n`g[5]=5`\nThis sequence is `F_{n+1}` if we define `F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5`.\nNo, this is `F_{n+1}` if we define `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\n`F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1,2,...`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` using standard `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\n\nSo the answer is `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\nThis formula gives:\n`n=1`: `F_2 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1 \\cdot 1/2 = 1/2`.\n`n=2`: `F_3 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2 \\cdot 1/4 = 1/2`.\n`n=3`: `F_4 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 3 \\cdot 1/8 = 3/8`.\n`n=5`: `F_6 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 8 \\cdot 1/32 = 1/4`.\n\nThis is what I got after my first run through the `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n` formula.\nNow, let's compare these with the example notes again.\n`n=2`: Note `1/4`. My formula `1/2`. Mismatch.\n`n=3`: Note `1/4`. My formula `3/8`. Mismatch.\n`n=5`: Note `5/32`. My formula `1/4`. Mismatch.\n\nThis is extremely confusing. The notes and outputs are inconsistent, and my formula gives values that don't match either.\nLet's try to match the notes `1/4, 1/4, 5/32`.\n`n=2`: `1/4`. This means `g[2]=1`.\n`n=3`: `1/4`. This means `g[3]=2`.\n`n=5`: `5/32`. This means `g[5]=5`.\nThis sequence `1,2,5` for `n=2,3,5` is what `g[n]` *should* be.\nBut my `g[n]` sequence is `1,1,1,2,3,5`.\nSo `g[2]=1`, `g[3]=2`, `g[5]=5`. These match the `g[n]` values.\nMy `g[n]` calculation is correct based on the recurrence.\n`g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5`.\nThis means:\n`n=2`: `g[2]=1`. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4`. Matches note.\n`n=3`: `g[3]=2`. Prob `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4`. Matches note.\n`n=5`: `g[5]=5`. Prob `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`. Matches note.\n\nSo my formula is `g[n] \\cdot (1/2)^n` where `g[n]` is the sequence `1,1,1,2,3,5,...`.\nThis sequence is `F_{n+1}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` using standard Fibonacci indexing.\nSo the final formula is `F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\n\nThe example outputs are:\n`n=2`: `748683265`\n`n=3`: `748683265`\n`n=5`: `842268673`\n`n=200000`: `202370013`\n\nLet's check the values for `n=2,3,5` again.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\n`inv_2 = pow_mod(2, MOD-2, MOD) = 499122177`.\n`n=2`: `F_3 = 2`. `(1/2)^2 = inv_2^2 = 499122177^2 = 249122177000000000 \\pmod{MOD} = 249561089`.\nResult: `2 * 249561089 = 499122178`.\nThis is `1/2`. The note says `1/4`. My `g[2]` should be `1`.\nMy `g[n]` sequence `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5`.\nThis sequence is `F_{n+1}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}`.\n`g[2] = F_3 = 2`. This is incorrect. `g[2]` is `1`.\n`g[0]=1`.\n`g[1]=g[0]=1`.\n`g[2]=g[1]=1`.\n`g[3]=g[2]+g[0]=1+1=2`.\n`g[4]=g[3]+g[1]=2+1=3`.\n`g[5]=g[4]+g[2]=3+1=4`. (Wait, `g[5]` should be `g[4]+g[2]+g[0]` for `j=3,4,5`. `g[5] = g[2*3-5-1] + g[2*4-5-1] + g[2*5-5-1] = g[0] + g[2] + g[4] = 1+1+3=5`).\nSo the sequence `g[n]` is `1,1,1,2,3,5`.\nThis sequence is `F_{n+1}` if `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\n`F_1=1` (`g[0]`)\n`F_2=1` (`g[1]`)\n`F_3=2` (`g[2]`) - NO, `g[2]=1`. `F_3=2`.\nThis means `g[n]` is not `F_{n+1}`.\n\nThe sequence `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=1, g[3]=2, g[4]=3, g[5]=5` is `F_{n+1}` shifted.\n`g[0]=F_1`\n`g[1]=F_2`\n`g[2]=F_2` (not `F_3`)\n`g[3]=F_3` (not `F_4`)\n`g[4]=F_4` (not `F_5`)\n`g[5]=F_5` (not `F_6`)\n\nThis is `F_{n}` for `n \\ge 1` if `F_0=1, F_1=1`.\nOr `F_{n+1}` for `n \\ge 1` if `F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2`.\nLet's just compute the `g[n]` values directly using the recurrence.\n`g[0]=1`.\n`g[1]=g[0]=1`.\n`g[2]=g[1]=1`.\n`g[3]=g[0]+g[2]=1+1=2`.\n`g[4]=g[1]+g[3]=1+2=3`.\n`g[5]=g[0]+g[2]+g[4]=1+1+3=5`.\nThis sequence is `1,1,1,2,3,5,...`.\nThis is `F_k` for `k=1,2,3,4,5,6` if `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1` and `F_{n+2}` for `n \\ge 2`. No.\nThis is `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1` and `F_{n+1}` for `n \\ge 2` if `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` for `n \\ge 0` using `F_0=0, F_1=1`.\nThis is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\nSo the number of ways is `F_{n+1}`.\n`n=2`: `F_3 = 2`. My `g[2]=1`.\nThis is the source of the problem. My `g[n]` values are `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1` but `F_{n}` for `n \\ge 2`.\n`g[0]=1=F_1`\n`g[1]=1=F_2`\n`g[2]=1=F_2`\n`g[3]=2=F_3`\n`g[4]=3=F_4`\n`g[5]=5=F_5`\nSo `g[n]` is `F_n` for `n \\ge 2`. And `g[0]=F_1, g[1]=F_2`.\nThis means `g[n]` is `F_{n+1}` for `n=0,1` and `F_n` for `n \\ge 2`.\nThis is not a simple Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet's re-verify the example note for `n=2`: \"with probability `1/4`, the towers are built in both towns `1` and `2`, so we can set their signal powers to `1`.\"\nThis is `S={1,2}`. `p_1=1, p_2=1`. This is one valid configuration.\n`g[2]` represents the number of valid configuration for `n=2`.\nMy recurrence `g[2]=g[1]=1` implies only one configuration. This is `S={1,2}`.\nSo `g[2]=1` is correct.\nFor `n=3`: note says `1/4`. My `g[3]=2`. So `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 1/4`. Correct.\nFor `n=5`: note says `5/32`. My `g[5]=5`. So `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`. Correct.\n\nSo the values of `g[n]` are `1,1,1,2,3,5,...` for `n=0,1,2,3,4,5,...`.\nThis sequence is `F_{k}` where `k` starts from `1`.\n`g[0]=F_1=1`\n`g[1]=F_2=1`\n`g[2]=F_2=1`\n`g[3]=F_3=2`\n`g[4]=F_4=3`\n`g[5]=F_5=5`\nThis means `g[n]` is `F_{n}` for `n \\ge 2`, `g[1]=F_2`, `g[0]=F_1`.\nSo `g[n]` is `F_{\\max(1, n)}` for `n \\ge 0`.\nNo, `g[n]` is `F_{n}` for `n \\ge 2`, but `g[0]=1, g[1]=1`.\nThis is `F_n` for `n \\ge 2` and `F_1` for `n=0,1`.\nThis is `F_{\\max(1, n)}` for `n \\ge 0`.\nSo we need to compute `F_{\\max(1, n)}`.\nFor `n=0`, `F_1=1`.\nFor `n=1`, `F_1=1`.\nFor `n \\ge 2`, `F_n`.\nSo we need `F_n` for `n \\ge 1`.\nIf `n=0`, `F_1=1`.\nIf `n=1`, `F_1=1`.\nIf `n \\ge 2`, `F_n`.\nThis can be written as `F_{n_prime}` where `n_prime = max(1, n)`.\nLet's compute `F_{\\max(1,n)}` using matrix exponentiation.\n`n=1`: `max(1,1)=1`. `F_1=1`. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2`.\n`n=2`: `max(1,2)=2`. `F_2=1`. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4`. Matches note.\n`n=3`: `max(1,3)=3`. `F_3=2`. Prob `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 1/4`. Matches note.\n`n=5`: `max(1,5)=5`. `F_5=5`. Prob `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`. Matches note.\n\nThis looks like the correct interpretation.\nThe number of valid sets `S` is `F_{\\max(1, n)}`.\nFor `n=0`, `F_1=1`. But `n \\ge 1`.\nSo for `n=1`, we need `F_1`. For `n \\ge 2`, we need `F_n`.\nThis means we need `F_n` for `n \\ge 1`.\n`F_1=1`.\n`F_2=1`.\n`F_3=2`.\n`F_4=3`.\n`F_5=5`.\nSo the number of ways is `F_n`.\nIf `n=1`, `F_1=1`. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2`.\nIf `n=2`, `F_2=1`. Prob `1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\nIf `n=3`, `F_3=2`. Prob `2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 1/4`.\nIf `n=5`, `F_5=5`. Prob `5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32`.\n\nThis is the solution. Calculate `F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\nFor `n=1`, `F_1=1`. The matrix exponentiation `matrix_pow([[1,1],[1,0]], n-1)` for `n=1` gives `matrix_pow(M, 0)` which is `[[1,0],[0,1]]`. The `[0][1]` element is `0`.\nIf `n=1`, we need `F_1=1`.\nThe standard matrix exponentiation `M^k` gives `F_{k+1}` at `[0][0]` and `F_k` at `[0][1]`.\nSo for `F_n`, we need `M^{n-1}` and take `[0][0]` (which is `F_n`) or `[0][1]` (which is `F_{n-1}`).\nFor `n=1`, `M^0 = [[1,0],[0,1]]`. `[0][0]` is `1` (which is `F_1`). `[0][1]` is `0` (which is `F_0`).\nThis works for `n \\ge 1`.\nSo we need `matrix_pow([[1,1],[1,0]], n-1)[0][0]` for `n \\ge 1`.\nIf `n=1`, `n-1=0`. `matrix_pow(M, 0)` gives `[[1,0],[0,1]]`. `[0][0]` is `1`. This is `F_1`.\nSo this is good.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. `MOD = 998244353`.\n2. `matrix_pow(A, p)` for matrix exponentiation.\n3. `pow_mod(base, exp, mod)` for modular exponentiation.\n4.
