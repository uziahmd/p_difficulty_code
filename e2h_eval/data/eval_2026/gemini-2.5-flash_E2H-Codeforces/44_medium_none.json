He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Strategic Partitioning for Maximum Profit**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan: I need to tackle a competitive programming challenge. The objective is to figure out the best way to divide a set of problems across a set number of days to maximize the total profit. The input gives me the number of problems (n), the number of days (k), and the difficulty of each problem (a).  The goal is to calculate the highest possible profit and how many problems to do each day.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking of approaching it: I need to break down the total number of problems into k consecutive days of work, and figure out the best ways to get the maximum value in each group of problems.  The profit is tied to the hardest problem solved each day.  To get the most amount of money I'll need to make sure I am doing the best problems on each day.\n\nThe key insight is this: to get the most profit overall, I need to make each day's hardest problem as tough as possible. This means I want to include the biggest, most difficult numbers in the set to maximize that value. So, I will grab the highest 'k' problems, and then I'll make sure each one is in its own day and the biggest problem to make the most.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1.  I have an input problem and a list of numbers, I'll need to arrange them.\n2.  I will sort them descending so the biggest ones are first, I need the top 'k' of those to work with.\n3.  Then I will use these indices to partition the problems.\n4.  I will create a list of the largest numbers.  To make these the largest each day, I need to make segments that contain them.\n\nIf the best numbers are arranged into its own day I will have the maximum profit.  \n\nSo, I will generate the solution like this:\n1.  Calculate total profit: sum the k largest elements from the input array.\n2.  Take the first 'k' numbers in the ordered array.  \n3.  Sort the 'k' indices from the initial input, to create the correct split points.\n4.  Calculate the number of elements each day, as this is the output of the problem.\n\nLet's say the maximum profit is X.  I'll start at the beginning of the problem list and include problems until I have all k numbers, this will be day 1.\n\nI'll continue this pattern: start after day 1, and work until I have k segments or I reach the end of the problem set.\n\nThis will output the largest profit possible, and the breakdown of how many problems were done on each day.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on a particular day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits. We need to output the maximum total profit and the lengths of the `k` segments.\n\n**Understanding the Goal:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should intuitively try to make each daily maximum as large as possible. The largest possible values for these daily maximums are the `k` largest problem difficulties in the entire list `a`.\n\n**Proof of Maximum Profit:**\nLet the `k` largest problem difficulties in `a` be `M_1 \\ge M_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge M_k`. The sum `S = M_1 + M_2 + \\dots + M_k` is the maximum possible total profit.\nConsider any valid partition of `a` into `k` segments, say `P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_k`. Let `max(P_j)` be the maximum difficulty in segment `P_j`. The total profit for this partition is `sum(max(P_j))`. Each `max(P_j)` is an element from the original array `a`. Thus, `sum(max(P_j))` is a sum of `k` elements from `a`. This sum cannot exceed the sum of the `k` largest elements in `a`. Therefore, the maximum possible total profit is indeed `S`.\n\n**Constructing the Solution:**\nNow we need to find a way to partition the problems such that each of the `k` largest values `M_1, \\dots, M_k` becomes the maximum of one of the `k` daily segments.\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest values:**\n    First, we find the `k` largest problem difficulties from the input array `a`. It's helpful to store them along with their original indices. For example, we can create pairs `(a_i, i)` for all problems, sort them by difficulty in descending order, and pick the top `k` pairs. The sum of the difficulties in these `k` pairs will be our maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine segment boundaries:**\n    Let the original indices of these `k` chosen problems be `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k`. Sort these indices in ascending order. These `k` indices will serve as \"anchor points\" for our segments. Specifically, we can make `k-1` cuts to divide the `n` problems into `k` days. We'll use the first `k-1` sorted indices (`idx_1, \\dots, idx_{k-1}`) to define the end points of the first `k-1` days. The last day will then naturally cover all remaining problems up to `n-1`.\n\n    Let `cut_indices` be the sorted list of these `k` indices.\n    -   The first day will cover problems from index `0` up to `cut_indices[0]`.\n    -   The second day will cover problems from `cut_indices[0] + 1` up to `cut_indices[1]`.\n    -   ...\n    -   The `j`-th day (for `j < k`) will cover problems from `cut_indices[j-2] + 1` up to `cut_indices[j-1]`.\n    -   The `k`-th (last) day will cover problems from `cut_indices[k-2] + 1` up to `n-1`.\n\n    This strategy ensures that each of the chosen `k` largest problems (`a[cut_indices[0]], a[cut_indices[1]], \\dots, a[cut_indices[k-1]]`) falls into a distinct segment. Since these are the `k` largest values overall, and all other problems (those not among the `k` largest) have difficulties less than or equal to these `k` values, each `a[cut_indices[j]]` will indeed be the maximum difficulty within its assigned segment.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the list of difficulties `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)`: `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n4.  Sort `indexed_a` in descending order based on difficulty. If difficulties are equal, the relative order of indices doesn't matter for correctness, but a stable sort or secondary sort by index can be used for deterministic output.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted `indexed_a`. These are `top_k_problems`.\n6.  Calculate `max_profit = sum(problem[0] for problem in top_k_problems)`.\n7.  Extract the original indices of these `k` problems: `cut_indices = sorted([problem[1] for problem in top_k_problems])`.\n8.  Initialize an empty list `t_values` to store the number of problems per day.\n9.  Initialize `current_start_idx = 0`.\n10. Iterate `i` from `0` to `k-2` (for the first `k-1` days):\n    *   `end_idx = cut_indices[i]`.\n    *   The length of this day's segment is `end_idx - current_start_idx + 1`. Add this to `t_values`.\n    *   Update `current_start_idx = end_idx + 1` for the next day's segment.\n11. For the last day (the `k`-th day):\n    *   The length of this day's segment is `(n - 1) - current_start_idx + 1`. Add this to `t_values`.\n12. Print `max_profit`.\n13. Print the elements of `t_values` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Trace (`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`):**\n\n1.  `indexed_a = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.

Max is 5.)\n\n8.  **Loop `i = 1` (for second day):**\n    *   `end_idx = cut_indices[1] = 3`.\n    *   `length = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `t_values = [1, 3]`.\n    *   `current_start_idx = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   (Day 2 covers `a[1...3] = [4, 2, 6]`. Max is 6.)\n\n9.  **After loop (for third/last day):**\n    *   `length = (8 - 1) - 4 + 1 = 7 - 4 + 1 = 4`. `t_values = [1, 3, 4]`.\n    *   (Day 3 covers `a[4...7] = [5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max is 9.)\n\n10.
