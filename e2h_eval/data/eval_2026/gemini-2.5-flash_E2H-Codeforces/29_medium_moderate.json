Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Substitutes in Number Problem**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. We need a Python script to tackle this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem. The core is replacing digits in a string `s` based on queries, and then calculating the numerical value, modulo a large prime. The brute-force approach of direct string replacement is a no-go, as the string can balloon exponentially. We need to avoid that.\n\nMy initial thought is to keep track of what each digit *eventually* represents, both in terms of its numerical value and its length (how many digits it expands into). For each digit `d`, we'll store `val[d]` (its final numerical value) and `len[d]` (its final length), both modulo the given modulus, `M`.\n\nHere's the critical insight: the order of queries matters. If we process them in the given order, substitutions become complicated since an initial substitution influences later ones. We need to process the queries in *reverse* order. This ensures that the `val` and `len` values we use for a digit reflect its *final* representation after all subsequent substitutions.\n\nSo, the algorithm will:\n\n1.  Initialize `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1` for all digits.\n2.  Process queries in reverse, building the final representation for each digit. For each query `di -> ti`, we will calculate the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the *current* `val` and `len` values of the digits in `ti`. Length will be computed modulo `M-1`.\n3.  Once all queries are processed, go through the initial string `s`, look up the final `val` and `len` for each digit, and calculate the overall numerical value using modular exponentiation.\n\nThis should handle the problem efficiently, taking advantage of the constraints to avoid needing massive strings. The reverse processing is the clever part, ensuring accuracy. Let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length if we perform direct string manipulations, which is too slow and memory-intensive.\n\nInstead of manipulating the string `s` directly, we can track what each digit `0-9` *eventually* represents in terms of its numerical value and its length.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWhen calculating `10^L % MOD` for a potentially very large `L`, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem: `a^b % p = a^(b % (p-1)) % p` for prime `p`. So, we need to calculate `L % (MOD-1)`. Let `MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`.\n\nWe maintain two arrays (or dictionaries) for digits `0-9`:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value that digit `d` represents, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` represents, modulo `MOD_EXP`.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, each digit `d` represents itself and has a length of 1.\nSo, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries:**\nThe crucial observation is the order of queries. If a query `d1 -> t1` is followed by `d2 -> t2`, and `d2` appears in `t1`, then `d2` inside `t1` should also be affected by `d2 -> t2`. This implies that later queries affect earlier substitutions. To correctly account for this \"transitive\" substitution, we must process the queries in **reverse order**.\n\nFor each query `di -> ti`, processed from last to first:\nWe need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti`.\nLet `ti = c_k c_{k-1} ... c_0`. The numerical value of `ti` is `val[c_k] * 10^(L_k) + ... + val[c_1] * 10^(L_1) + val[c_0] * 10^0`, where `L_j` is the sum of lengths of digits `c_{j-1} ... c_0`. The total length of `ti` is `sum(length[c_j])`.\n\nTo calculate `current_val` and `current_len` for `ti`:\n*   Initialize `current_val = 0`\n*   Initialize `current_len = 0`\n*   Iterate through `ti` from right to left (character `c`):\n    *   Let `digit = int(c)`.\n    *   `current_val = (val[digit] * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD`\n    *   `current_len = (length[digit] + current_len) % MOD_EXP`\n*   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `val[int(di)] = current_val` and `length[int(di)] = current_len`.\n    *   If `ti` is an empty string, `current_val` and `current_len` remain `0`, which correctly represents replacing a digit with nothing.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` now hold the final effective value and length for each digit `d`.\nWe then calculate the final numerical value of the *original* string `s`:\n*   Initialize `final_ans = 0`\n*   Initialize `total_len = 0` (this accumulates the length of the expanded digits to the right of the current digit in `s`).\n*   Iterate through the initial string `s` from right to left (character `c`):\n    *   Let `digit = int(c)`.\n    *   `final_ans = (val[digit] * pow(10, total_len, MOD) + final_ans) % MOD`\n    *   `total_len = (length[digit] + total_len) % MOD_EXP`\n*   The `final_ans` is the result.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N + S_T)`, where `S_T` is the sum of lengths of all `ti` strings.\n    *   Processing `N` queries in reverse: For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. This takes `O(|ti| * log(MOD))` time due to `pow` function. Summing over all queries, this is `O(S_T * log(MOD))`.\n    *   Final calculation: Iterating through `s` of length `|s|`. This takes `O(|s| * log(MOD))` time.\n    *   Total: `O((|s| + S_T) * log(MOD))`. Given `|s|, S_T <= 10^5` and `log(MOD)` is small (approx 30), this is efficient enough (`~ 2 * 10^5 * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations).\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   `val` and `length` arrays: `O(1)` (10 elements).\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N + S_T)`.\n    *   Total: `O(N + S_T)`. Given `N, S_T <= 10^5`, this is `O(10^5)` space, which is fine.\n\nThis approach correctly handles empty `ti` strings, leading zeros, and the cumulative effect of substitutions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = 1000000006 # For exponent in pow(base, exp, mod), use exp % (mod-1)\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit (0-9)\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value that digit d represents\n    # length[d] stores the length of the string that digit d represents\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order to correctly handle transitive substitutions\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti_str = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n\n        # Calculate the new value and length for di based on ti_str\n        # Iterate through ti_str from right to left\n        for char_t in reversed(ti_str):\n            c = int(char_t)\n            # Add val[c] * 10^(current_len) to current_val\n            # current_len is the accumulated length of digits to the right within ti_str\n            current_val = (val[c] * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD\n            # Add length[c] to current_len\n            current_len = (length[c] + current_len) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        # Update val and length for the digit di\n        # If ti_str was empty, current_val and current_len will remain 0,\n        # correctly representing replacement with an empty string.\n        val[di] = current_val\n        length[di] = current_len\n\n    # Calculate the final numerical value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    total_len = 0 # Accumulated length of expanded digits processed so far (from right)\n\n    # Iterate through the initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        c = int(char_s)\n        # Add val[c] * 10^(total_len) to final_ans\n        # total_len represents the power of 10 for the current digit's value\n        final_ans = (val[c] * pow(10, total_len, MOD) + final_ans) % MOD\n        # Add length[c] to total_len for the next digit to the left\n        total_len = (length[c] + total_len) % MOD_EXP\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
