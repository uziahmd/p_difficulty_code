    "thought": "**Solving the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The core is finding the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, and the string contains only lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100.\n\nMy immediate thought is to break this down systematically. I'll need to iterate through all possible substring lengths, from 1 up to `n-1` (where `n` is the string's length).  If a substring of length `n` repeats, it's the entire string, but the problem specifies a non-empty string.\n\nFor each potential length, I'll need to generate all possible substrings. A length `L` string has `n - L + 1` substrings of that length. Then, for each substring, I'll count how many times it actually appears in the original string. I can track the maximum length of any substring that repeats at least twice.\n\nLet's assume the input string is `s` with length `n`.\n\nIf `n=1`, the answer is 0. If `n=2`, like \"aa\", the answer is 1. If `n=3`, like \"aba\", the answer is 1, and for \"aaa\" it's 2.\n\nNow, to refine the approach, it's often more efficient to iterate and find the first instance of a solution, rather than the last. But given that `n <= 100`, I can iterate from shorter to longer, tracking the `max_len`. This feels like the simplest strategy.\n\nI'll start by initializing `max_len` to 0.\n\nMy outer loop will iterate through `length` from 1 to `n-1`.\n\nMy inner loop will iterate `i` from 0 to `n - length`. `i` will be the starting position for my candidate substring.\n\nWithin the loops, I will get the substring, `sub = s[i : i + length]`\n\nNext is to check if `sub` appears at least twice.\nI can loop through the string to count the number of occurrences.\n    `count = 0`\n    Loop `j` from 0 to `n - length` (inclusive).\n      If `s[j : j + length] == sub`:\n        `count += 1`\n\n    If `count >= 2`:\n      `max_len = max(max_len, length)`\n\nThis feels correct, but I need to consider performance.  My outer loop runs in `O(n)` steps. The inner loop for creating substrings is also `O(n)`. The innermost loop for counting is another `O(n)`. String extraction, especially string slicing, is also considered `O(length)`. This gives me an `O(n * n * n * length)` or `O(n^4)` complexity. For `n = 100`, that means around 10^8 operations. It's not the most optimized solution, but it's acceptable for such a constraint.\n",
