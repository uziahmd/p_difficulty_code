Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Vanya and Lanterns Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem, and my immediate thought is \"Competitive programming, eh? Let's break this down systematically.\"  I need to find the smallest radius 'd' for the lanterns so the entire street, from 0 to 'l', is illuminated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have a street of length *l* with *n* lanterns at positions *a_i*. Each lantern lights a segment of length 2*d* centered on its position.\n\nThe crux of the problem is ensuring every point on the street is within *d* distance of at least one lantern.  I see that sorting the lantern positions is key for this. It will make dealing with the gaps between them much simpler. Let me assume the sorted positions are *a_0, a_1, ... a_{n-1}*.\n\nNow, the cases. At the beginning of the street (position 0), the lantern closest is *a_0*. To cover 0, the radius *d* must be at least *a_0*.  Similarly, at the end of the street (position *l*), the radius must be at least *l - a_{n-1}*.\n\nThe tricky part is the gaps between lanterns. If I have two lanterns, *a_i* and *a_{i+1}*, the combined coverage must include every point between them.  This means the distance between them, *a_{i+1} - a_i*, must be covered by *2d*, so *d* must be at least half this gap. I'll need to iterate through all adjacent lanterns and find the largest gap, which gives me *max_gap_d*.\n\nSo, the overall solution?  It's the maximum of those three values:  *a_0*, *l - a_{n-1}* and *max_gap_d*. That should give me the minimum radius *d* needed to light the entire street. I think I have a solid understanding now. Time to code it up!\n",
