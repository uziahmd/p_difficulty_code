String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling Vasily's Beautiful Strings: A Recursive Journey**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this interesting string problem. The core idea is that we have a string made up of zeros and ones, and this weird operation where you replace the last two characters with a single character based on their values. My goal? Figure out how many strings will end up as a specific target character after this reduction.\n\nMy first thought? This operation looks a lot like some kind of XOR or reduction. I start by meticulously examining the operation's behavior, especially the *number of ones* it creates. But I don't see an obvious pattern emerge. Okay, let's keep going.\n\nThen, I shifted my perspective, and I started thinking about right-to-left processing, sort of like a fold or reduce operation. It became clear the outcome is only changed by strings of two zeros: `00->1` - Any one changes the `0` to a `0`. This led me to view this as a right-associative reduction: `(x op y) op z` This gave a structure, and gave a direction!\n\nI define this operation, which I call `reduce`, and write it down.\n\nAfter this, I went down the path of what `reduce` can produce and observed its output in detail. The operation is simply: if the string has any `1`s at all, the result of the `reduce` is `0`, otherwise we apply the `reduce` to all zeros. So a string of all zeros is reduced to `1` if the length is even, and `0` if the length is odd. This is equivalent to `n+1 % 2`, where n is the number of zeros. I think this can provide a way forward!\n\nThis leads to the really crucial insight: The final result is dependent only on the *left side* of the string after removing the rightmost '1' and all trailing zeros. I can now form a recursive relationship here. I'll need to figure out the number of ways to form these left-hand strings, and the values to reduce with. This opens the door to using recursion and dynamic programming.\n\nMy mind is now focused on counting strings in terms of ones (m) and zeros (n), so I've reached the stage where it comes down to applying a recurrence relation with base cases. I know the result of `reduce` for strings of all zeros, so I can try to build from there. I think I'm on the right track!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings `s` that contain exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that a specific reduction process on `s` yields a final character `g`. The reduction process involves repeatedly replacing the last two characters `xy` with a new character `z` according to these rules:\n*   `00` -> `1`\n*   `01` -> `0`\n*   `10` -> `0`\n*   `11` -> `0`\n\nThis process continues until only one character remains. This is equivalent to a right-associative reduction: `f(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ op } (c_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } c_k)...)`, where `x op y` is the result of applying the rule to `xy`. The rules can be summarized as: `x op y = 1` if `x=0` and `y=0`, and `x op y = 0` otherwise.\n\nLet's analyze the `op` function:\n*   `0 op 0 = 1`\n*   `0 op 1 = 0`\n*   `1 op 0 = 0`\n*   `1 op 1 = 0`\n\nA key observation is that `1 op X` is always `0`, regardless of `X`.\n\nLet `R(s)` denote the final character obtained from string `s`.\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (The string consists only of zeros)**\nThe string is `s = \"0\" * n`.\n*   `R(\"0\") = 0` (for `n=1`)\n*   `R(\"00\") = 0 op 0 = 1` (for `n=2`)\n*   `R(\"000\") = 0 op (0 op 0) = 0 op 1 = 0` (for `n=3`)\n*   `R(\"0000\") = 0 op (0 op (0 op 0)) = 0 op (0 op 1) = 0 op 0 = 1` (for `n=4`)\nIt follows that `R(\"0\"*n) = 1` if `n` is even, and `R(\"0\"*n) = 0` if `n` is odd.\nSo, if `m=0`, there is 1 beautiful string if `g == (n % 2 == 0)`, and 0 otherwise.\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (The string contains at least one '1')**\nLet `s` be any string with `m > 0` ones. Let `c_i` be the rightmost '1' in `s`.\nWe can write `s = P + '1' + \"0\"*p`, where `P` is the prefix before the rightmost '1', and `p` is the number of trailing zeros after it. `P` has `m-1` ones and `n-p` zeros.\n`R(s) = R(P) \\text{ op } R('1' + \"0\"*p)`.\nLet's evaluate `R('1' + \"0\"*p)`:\n`R('1' + \"0\"*p) = 1 \\text{ op } R(\"0\"*p)`.\nSince `1 op X` is always `0`, `R('1' + \"0\"*p)` is always `0`.\n\nTherefore, `R(s) = R(P) \\text{ op } 0`.\n*   If `R(P) = 0`, then `R(s) = 0 op 0 = 1`.\n*   If `R(P) = 1`, then `R(s) = 1 op 0 = 0`.\nThis means `R(s) = 1 - R(P)`.\n\nThis recurrence is crucial: the final value `g` for a string with `m` ones is `1 - R(P)`, where `P` is a string with `m-1` ones and some number of zeros.\n\nLet's analyze the parity of `m`:\n*   If `m` is odd:\n    `R(s)` (with `m` ones) `= 1 - R(P_1)` (with `m-1` ones)\n    `= 1 - (1 - R(P_2))` (with `m-2` ones) `= R(P_2)`\n    ...\n    `= 1 - R(P_{m-1})` (with 1 one)\n    `= R(P_m)` (with 0 ones)\n    So, if `m` is odd, `R(s)` has the same value as `R(s_0)` where `s_0` is a string with `0` ones and `n'` zeros.\n    `R(s_0) = 1` if `n'` is even, `0` if `n'` is odd.\n    Thus, if `m` is odd, `R(s) = 1` if `n'` is even, `0` if `n'` is odd.\n    `n'` is the total number of zeros in the string `s` *minus* the sum of all `p_i` (number of zeros after each '1' in the reduction process).\n    Effectively, `n'` is the number of zeros in the string `s` that are *not* to the right of any '1'. This means `n'` is the number of zeros in the prefix before the first '1'.\n    Let `s = \"0\"^(n_L) + \"1\" + ...`. `n_L` is the number of leading zeros.\n    Then `R(s) = 1` if `n_L` is even, `0` if `n_L` is odd.\n    So, if `m` is odd, `R(s) = (n_L % 2 == 0)`.\n\n*   If `m` is even and `m > 0`:\n    `R(s)` (with `m` ones) `= 1 - R(P_1)` (with `m-1` ones)\n    `= 1 - (1 - R(P_2))` (with `m-2` ones) `= R(P_2)`\n    ...\n    `= 1 - R(P_m)` (with 0 ones)\n    So, if `m` is even, `R(s)` has the opposite value of `R(s_0)` where `s_0` is a string with `0` ones and `n'` zeros.\n    `R(s_0) = 1` if `n'` is even, `0` if `n'` is odd.\n    Thus, if `m` is even, `R(s) = 0` if `n'` is even, `1` if `n'` is odd.\n    `R(s) = (n_L % 2 != 0)`.\n\nCombining these:\n*   If `m` is odd: `R(s) = (n_L % 2 == 0)`. We want `R(s) = g`.\n    So we need `g == (n_L % 2 == 0)`. This means `n_L` must have the same parity as `g`.\n*   If `m` is even and `m > 0`: `R(s) = (n_L % 2 != 0)`. We want `R(s) = g`.\n    So we need `g == (n_L % 2 != 0)`. This means `n_L` must have the opposite parity of `g`.\n\nIn summary:\nThe final character `g` depends on the parity of `n_L` (number of leading zeros) and `m` (total number of ones).\n*   If `m` is odd: `g` must be `1` if `n_L` is even, `0` if `n_L` is odd. (`g == (n_L % 2 == 0)`)\n*   If `m` is even and `m > 0`: `g` must be `0` if `n_L` is even, `1` if `n_L` is odd. (`g == (n_L % 2 != 0)`)\n\nLet `k = n_L`. The number of leading zeros `k` can range from `0` to `n`.\nThe remaining `n-k` zeros and `m` ones can be arranged in `C( (n-k) + m - 1, m - 1 )` ways. (This is for the suffix starting from the first '1'). This is equivalent to choosing `m-1` positions for the remaining `1`s from `(n-k) + m - 1` available slots.\nThe total length of the string is `n+m`. The first `k` characters are `0`. The `k+1`-th character must be `1`. The remaining `(n+m) - (k+1)` characters consist of `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones.\nThe number of ways to arrange `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones is `C((n-k) + (m-1), m-1)`.\n\nSo, for `m > 0`:\nWe iterate `k` from `0` to `n`.\nFor each `k`, we check if `k` satisfies the parity condition for `g` and `m`.\nIf `m` is odd: `k % 2 == g`\nIf `m` is even: `k % 2 != g`\n\nIf the condition is met, we add `C(n-k + m-1, m-1)` to the total count.\nThe sum will be `sum_{k=0 to n, k \\text{ satisfies condition}} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `N_zeros = n-k` and `N_ones = m-1`. The term is `C(N_zeros + N_ones, N_ones)`.\nLet `S = n-k+m-1`. The term is `C(S, m-1)`.\nThe number of zeros `N_zeros` ranges from `0` to `n`.\nThe parity condition on `k` means `k` must be even or odd.\nIf `k` is even, `n-k` has the same parity as `n`.\nIf `k` is odd, `n-k` has the opposite parity as `n`.\n\nLet's rephrase the condition on `n_L = k`:\nIf `m` is odd: we need `k \\equiv g \\pmod 2`.\nIf `m` is even: we need `k \\not\\equiv g \\pmod 2`.\n\nLet `target_k_parity = g` if `m` is odd, `1-g` if `m` is even.\nWe need to sum `C(n-k+m-1, m-1)` for `k` from `0` to `n` such that `k % 2 == target_k_parity`.\n\nThis sum can be computed efficiently.\n`C(X, Y)` is the number of ways to choose `Y` items from `X`.\n`C(X, Y) = C(X, X-Y)`. Here `C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `N_prime = n + m - 1`. The terms are `C(N_prime - k, m-1)`.\nWe sum `C(N_prime - k, m-1)` for `k \\in [0, n]` with specific parity.\n\nThis is a known identity: `sum_{i=0 to X, i % 2 == P} C(A-i, B)`.\nThis is not a simple identity. Instead, we can use the identity `sum_{i=0 to K} C(R+i, i) = C(R+K+1, K)`.\nThis is `sum_{i=0 to K} C(R+i, R) = C(R+K+1, R+1)`.\nLet `j = n-k`. As `k` goes from `0` to `n`, `j` goes from `n` to `0`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{j=0 to n, (n-j) % 2 == target_k_parity} C(j+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `target_j_parity = (n - target_k_parity) % 2`.\nWe sum `C(j+m-1, m-1)` for `j \\in [0, n]` such that `j % 2 == target_j_parity`.\n\nThis is `sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv target\\_j\\_parity \\pmod 2} C(j+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `A = m-1`. We sum `C(j+A, A)` for `j \\in [0, n]` with specific parity.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv target\\_j\\_parity \\pmod 2} C(j+A, j)`.\nThis sum can be calculated using prefix sums of combinations, but that's `O(N)`.\nA more direct approach is `C(X, Y) = C(X-1, Y-1) + C(X-1, Y)`.\nWe need to sum `C(j+m-1, m-1)` for `j` with `j \\equiv target\\_j\\_parity \\pmod 2`.\nFor example, if `target_j_parity = 0`: `C(m-1, m-1) + C(m+1, m-1) + ...`\nIf `target_j_parity = 1`: `C(m, m-1) + C(m+2, m-1) + ...`\n\nThis summation can be simplified using `C(N, K) = C(N, N-K)`.\n`C(j+m-1, m-1) = C(j+m-1, j)`.\nThe sum is `sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv target\\_j\\_parity \\pmod 2} C(j+m-1, j)`.\n\nConsider the identity: `sum_{i=0 to K} C(N+i, i) = C(N+K+1, K)`.\nThis sums all terms. We need to sum alternating terms.\nThere's an identity: `sum_{k=0 to n} C(r+k, k) = C(r+n+1, n)`.\nAnd `sum_{k=0 to n, k \\text{ even}} C(r+k, k) = C(r+n, n) - C(r+n-1, n-1) + ...` no.\n`sum_{k=0 to n} (-1)^k C(r+k, k) = (-1)^n C(r+n-1, n)`.\n\nThe sum `sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv P \\pmod 2} C(j+m-1, m-1)`:\nThis is `C(m-1, m-1) + C(m, m-1) + C(m+1, m-1) + ... + C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\nThis is `sum_{i=m-1 to n+m-1, i \\equiv m-1+P \\pmod 2} C(i, m-1)`.\nThis is `sum_{i=m-1 to n+m-1, i \\equiv m-1+P \\pmod 2} C(i, i-(m-1))`.\nUsing `C(X, K) = C(X, X-K)`, we are summing `C(i, m-1)`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=K to N} C(i, K)` is `C(N+1, K+1)`. (Hockey-stick identity)\nWe need to sum only terms with specific parity.\n`S_0 = C(m-1, m-1) + C(m+1, m-1) + C(m+3, m-1) + ...`\n`S_1 = C(m, m-1) + C(m+2, m-1) + C(m+4, m-1) + ...`\nThe sum `S_0 + S_1 = C(n+m, m)`.\nThe difference `S_0 - S_1` is also known.\n`sum_{k=0 to N} (-1)^k C(M, k)` for fixed `M` is not helpful.\n`sum_{k=0 to N} (-1)^k C(R+k, K)` for fixed `R, K`.\n\nThis is a standard result for sums of combinations with alternating parity.\n`sum_{k=0 to n} C(R+k, K)` where `k` has specific parity.\nIt can be shown that `sum_{k=0 to n, k \\text{ even}} C(R+k, K) = C(R+n, K+1) - C(R-1, K+1)` (if `n` is even)\nand `sum_{k=0 to n, k \\text{ odd}} C(R+k, K) = C(R+n, K+1) - C(R, K+1)` (if `n` is odd).\nThis is not quite right because the `R` changes.\nLet's use the fact that `C(N, K)` is the coefficient of `x^K` in `(1+x)^N`.\nThe sum `sum_{j=0 to n} C(j+m-1, m-1)` is the sum of coefficients of `x^{m-1}` in `(1+x)^{m-1}, (1+x)^m, ..., (1+x)^{n+m-1}`.\n\nThis problem is simpler. The sum `sum_{k=0 to n, k \\text{ has desired parity}} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`\nLet `j = n-k`. Then `k=n-j`.\n`k \\equiv target\\_k\\_parity \\pmod 2 \\implies n-j \\equiv target\\_k\\_parity \\pmod 2 \\implies j \\equiv n - target\\_k\\_parity \\pmod 2`.\nLet `P = (n - target\\_k\\_parity) % 2`.\nWe need to sum `C(j+m-1, m-1)` for `j \\in [0, n]` such that `j \\equiv P \\pmod 2`.\nThe terms are `C(m-1, m-1), C(m, m-1), ..., C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\nThis is a sum of `C(X, K)` where `K` is fixed (`m-1`) and `X` varies.\nThe sum `sum_{i=K to N} C(i, K) = C(N+1, K+1)`. This is the hockey-stick identity.\nSo `sum_{j=0 to n} C(j+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m, m)`.\n\nThe desired sum is `S = sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv P \\pmod 2} C(j+m-1, m-1)`.\nThe total sum `S_T = sum_{j=0 to n} C(j+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m, m)`.\nWe need to find `S`.\nIf `m=1`, `C(j+0, 0) = C(j,0) = 1`.\nThe sum is `sum_{j=0 to n, j \\equiv P \\pmod 2} 1`.\nThis is `ceil((n+1)/2)` if `P=0` and `floor((n+1)/2)` if `P=1`, or vice versa depending on `n`.\nMore precisely, `(n+1 - P)/2` if `n \\ge P`, and `(n+1)/2` for `P=0`.\nThe number of terms `j \\in [0, n]` with `j \\equiv P \\pmod 2` is `(n - P)/2 + 1` if `n \\ge P` and `n \\equiv P \\pmod 2`.\nOr `(n - (P+1))/2 + 1` if `n \\ge P+1` and `n \\equiv P+1 \\pmod 2`.\nThis is `(n+1+P)/2` if `n+1` has same parity as `P`.\nThis is `(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd.\nCount of numbers `j` in `[0,n]` with `j%2 == P`: `floor((n-P)/2) + 1`.\nThis is `(n+1)//2` if `P=0` and `(n+1+1)//2 -1` if `P=1`\nNumber of even numbers: `n//2 + 1`. Number of odd numbers: `(n+1)//2`.\nSo for `m=1`, the answer is `n//2+1` if `P=0`, and `(n+1)//2` if `P=1`.\n\nLet's check `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`m=1` is odd. `target_k_parity = g = 0`.\n`P = (n - target_k_parity) % 2 = (1 - 0) % 2 = 1`.\nWe sum `C(j+0, 0)` for `j \\in [0,1]` with `j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2`.\nOnly `j=1` satisfies. `C(1,0)=1`. Answer is 1.\nExample output is 2. My logic is wrong for `m=1`.\n\nWhat strings are there for `n=1, m=1`? \"01\", \"10\".\n`R(\"01\") = 0 op 1 = 0`.\n`R(\"10\") = 1 op 0 = 0`.\nBoth reduce to `0`. So for `g=0`, answer is 2. For `g=1`, answer is 0.\nMy logic gives 1 for `g=0`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `R(s) = 1 - R(P)`.\n`R(s) = R(P) \\text{ op } 0`.\n`P` has `m-1` ones and `n-p` zeros.\nThe number of zeros in `P` depends on `p`.\nThis is where the problem is. `R(P)` is not a single value.\n\nLet's return to the initial definition: `R(s) = c_1 \\text{ op } (c_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } c_k)...)`.\n`x op y = (x==0 and y==0)`.\nLet `s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k`.\n`R(s) = 1` if and only if `c_1=0` AND `R(c_2 ... c_k)=0`.\n`R(s) = 0` otherwise.\n\nThis is a recursive definition.\n`R(s) = (c_1 == 0 \\text{ and } R(c_2...c_k) == 0)`.\nLet `f(s)` be the value.\n`f(s)` is `0` if `s` contains a `1` at the very first position (`c_1=1`).\n`f(s)` is `0` if `f(c_2...c_k)` is `1`.\n`f(s)` is `1` if `c_1=0` and `f(c_2...c_k)=0`.\n\nLet's analyze the value of `R(s)` based on the *number of ones* (`m`).\nIf `m=0`: `s = \"0\"*n`.\n`R(\"0\") = 0`.\n`R(\"00\") = (0==0 \\text{ and } R(\"0\")==0) = (true \\text{ and } true) = 1`.\n`R(\"000\") = (0==0 \\text{ and } R(\"00\")==0) = (true \\text{ and } false) = 0`.\n`R(\"0000\") = (0==0 \\text{ and } R(\"000\")==0) = (true \\text{ and } true) = 1`.\nSo `R(\"0\"*n) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd. This is `(n % 2 == 0)`.\n\nIf `m > 0`:\nLet `c_i` be the *first* `1` in `s`. So `s = \"0\"^(i-1) + \"1\" + s'`.\n`R(s) = (c_1 == 0 \\text{ and } R(c_2...c_k) == 0)`.\nIf `c_1 = 1`: `R(s) = 0`.\nIf `c_1 = 0`: `R(s) = R(\"0\"^(i-2) + \"1\" + s') \\text{ and } R(s) = 1` if `R(\"0\"^(i-1) + \"1\" + s') = 0`.\nThis is exactly the same structure as before, just from left to right.\n\nLet `N_0(s)` be the number of leading zeros in `s`.\nIf `N_0(s) = 0`, then `c_1 = 1`. So `R(s) = 0`.\nIf `N_0(s) = k > 0`, then `s = \"0\"*k + s_suffix`.\n`R(s) = (0==0 \\text{ and } R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix) == 0)`.\nThis means `R(s) = 1` if `R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix) = 0`.\nAnd `R(s) = 0` if `R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix) = 1`.\nSo `R(s) = 1 - R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix)`.\nIf `k` is the number of leading zeros:\n`R(s) = R(\"0\"*k + s_suffix)`.\n`R(\"0\"*k + s_suffix) = 1 - R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix)`\n`= 1 - (1 - R(\"0\"*(k-2) + s_suffix))`\n`= R(\"0\"*(k-2) + s_suffix)`\nThis pattern continues.\nIf `k` is even, `R(s) = R(s_suffix)`.\nIf `k` is odd, `R(s) = 1 - R(s_suffix)`.\n\nNow, `s_suffix` is `1` followed by the rest of the string.\nThe first character of `s_suffix` is `1`.\nSo `R(s_suffix) = 0` (because `c_1` of `s_suffix` is `1`).\n\nTherefore:\n*   If `k` (number of leading zeros) is even: `R(s) = R(s_suffix) = 0`.\n*   If `k` (number of leading zeros) is odd: `R(s) = 1 - R(s_suffix) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n\nThis means `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`. (If `m>0`).\n\nLet's recheck this simpler rule:\nFor `n=1, m=1, g=0`:\nStrings: \"01\", \"10\".\nFor \"01\": `k=1` (one leading zero). `k` is odd. `R(\"01\") = (1%2 != 0) = 1`.\nFor \"10\": `k=0` (zero leading zeros). `k` is even. `R(\"10\") = (0%2 != 0) = 0`.\nSo \"01\" gives `1`, \"10\" gives `0`.\nIf `g=0`, only \"10\" is beautiful. Count is 1. Still not 2.\n\nThe example output 2 for `1 1 0` means both \"01\" and \"10\" result in `0`.\nMy `R(s)` definition is `c_1 op (c_2 op ...)` which is right-associative.\nThe example trace: \"01010\" -> \"0100\" -> \"011\" -> \"00\" -> \"1\".\nMy `R(\"01010\") = 0 op (1 op (0 op (1 op 0))) = 0 op (1 op (0 op 0)) = 0 op (1 op 1) = 0 op 0 = 1`. Matches.\n\nThe example trace for `1 1 0`:\n\"01\": `0 op 1 = 0`. OK.\n\"10\": `1 op 0 = 0`. OK.\nBoth give 0. So answer 2.\n\nMy `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)` is wrong.\nWhat is `R(\"01\")`? `k=1`. `R(\"01\") = 0 op R(\"1\") = 0 op 1 = 0`.\nWhat is `R(\"10\")`? `k=0`. `R(\"10\") = 1 op R(\"0\") = 1 op 0 = 0`.\nThis matches the example!\n\nSo the rule is:\nIf `m=0`: `R(\"0\"*n) = (n % 2 == 0)`.\nIf `m > 0`:\n  Let `k` be the number of leading zeros. `s = \"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest`.\n  `R(s) = R(\"0\"*k) \\text{ op } R(\"1\" + s_rest)`.\n  `R(\"1\" + s_rest) = 1 \\text{ op } R(s_rest) = 0`.\n  So `R(s) = R(\"0\"*k) \\text{ op } 0`.\n  If `R(\"0\"*k) = 0` (i.e. `k` is odd), `R(s) = 0 op 0 = 1`.\n  If `R(\"0\"*k) = 1` (i.e. `k` is even), `R(s) = 1 op 0 = 0`.\n  So for `m > 0`, `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`. (This is if `k` is odd, result is 1. If `k` is even, result is 0).\n\nLet's re-verify this rule.\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`m > 0`. `g=0`. We need `k % 2 != 0` to be `0`. So `k` must be even.\nStrings: \"01\", \"10\".\n\"01\": `k=1`. `k` is odd. `R(\"01\") = 1`. (My rule says 1, example says 0)\n\"10\": `k=0`. `k` is even. `R(\"10\") = 0`. (My rule says 0, example says 0)\nMy rule `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)` is still wrong for `m>0`.\n\nThe problem is that `R(\"0\"*k) \\text{ op } R(\"1\" + s_rest)` is not how the reduction works.\nIt is `R(c_1 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ op } R(c_2 ... c_k)`.\nThis means `R(\"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest) = \"0\" \\text{ op } R(\"0\"*(k-1) + \"1\" + s_rest)`.\nThis is what I used to derive `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`.\nIt seems my derivation `R(s) = 1 - R(\"0\"*(k-1) + s_suffix)` is correct.\nAnd `R(s_suffix) = 0` is correct.\nSo `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)` is correct.\nBut the example `R(\"01\")=0` contradicts `k=1` (odd) should give `1`.\nThis means my interpretation of `R(s_suffix)=0` might be wrong.\n`s_suffix` starts with `1`. `R(1 + s_rest) = 1 op R(s_rest)`. This is indeed `0`.\n\nWhat is going on? The problem statement says:\n`one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\"`.\nThis means `10` -> `0`.\n`two modifications transform it to \"011\"`.\nThis means `0100` -> `011` (`00` -> `1`).\nThis is *not* `c_1 op (c_2 op (...))`. This is `... op (c_{k-1} op c_k)`.\nIt's left-associative or a stack.\n`s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k`.\n`s_1 = c_1 c_2 ... (c_{k-2} \\text{ op } (c_{k-1} \\text{ op } c_k))`.\nNo, it's `s_1 = c_1 ... c_{k-2} (c_{k-1} \\text{ op } c_k)`.\nThis is `reduce(c_1 ... c_k) = reduce(c_1 ... c_{k-2} (c_{k-1} \\text{ op } c_k))`.\nThis is a standard fold/reduce from right to left, `val = c_1`. Then `val = val op c_2`. No.\n\nThe operation is: `replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character`.\nThis means `s = prefix + c_{k-1} c_k`. New string is `prefix + (c_{k-1} \\text{ op } c_k)`.\nThis is exactly `R(s) = c_1 \\text{ op } (c_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } c_k)...)`.\nThe example trace confirms this.\n\nLet's re-verify `R(\"01\")` and `R(\"10\")` manually.\n`s = \"01\"`. `k=2`.\n1. `01` -> `0` (`0 op 1 = 0`). Final char is `0`.\n`s = \"10\"`. `k=2`.\n1. `10` -> `0` (`1 op 0 = 0`). Final char is `0`.\nBoth `01` and `10` yield `0`. This matches the example.\n\nMy derivation `R(\"01\") = 1` was wrong.\n`R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)` was wrong.\n\nLet's re-derive `R(s)` based on `k` leading zeros.\n`s = \"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest`.\n`R(\"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest) = R(\"0\"*k) \\text{ op } R(\"1\" + s_rest)` is wrong.\nThe rule is `R(s) = c_1 \\text{ op } R(c_2 ... c_k)`.\n`R(\"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest)`\nIf `k=0`: `s = \"1\" + s_rest`. `R(s) = 1 \\text{ op } R(s_rest) = 0`.\nIf `k=1`: `s = \"01\" + s_rest`. `R(s) = 0 \\text{ op } R(\"1\" + s_rest)`.\nSince `R(\"1\" + s_rest) = 0`, we have `R(s) = 0 op 0 = 1`.\nIf `k=2`: `s = \"001\" + s_rest`. `R(s) = 0 op R(\"01\" + s_rest)`.\nSince `R(\"01\" + s_rest) = 1` (from `k=1` case), we have `R(s) = 0 op 1 = 0`.\nIf `k=3`: `s = \"0001\" + s_rest`. `R(s) = 0 op R(\"001\" + s_rest)`.\nSince `R(\"001\" + s_rest) = 0` (from `k=2` case), we have `R(s) = 0 op 0 = 1`.\n\nThe pattern for `m > 0`:\nIf `k` is the number of leading zeros:\n*   `k=0`: `R(s)=0`.\n*   `k=1`: `R(s)=1`.\n*   `k=2`: `R(s)=0`.\n*   `k=3`: `R(s)=1`.\nThis means `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`.\nThis rule seems to be consistent. Let's trace `n=1, m=1, g=0` using this rule.\n\"01\": `k=1` (odd). Rule says `R(\"01\") = 1`. Example says `0`.\n\"10\": `k=0` (even). Rule says `R(\"10\") = 0`. Example says `0`.\nThe rule `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)` is correct for \"10\", but incorrect for \"01\".\nThe only way this could happen is if `s_rest` is empty for \"01\", but not for \"10\".\n`s = \"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest`.\nFor \"01\", `k=1`, `s_rest` is empty. `R(\"1\"+s_rest)` becomes `R(\"1\") = 1`.\nSo `R(\"01\") = 0 op R(\"1\") = 0 op 1 = 0`. This matches the example!\n\nFor \"10\", `k=0`, `s_rest` is \"0\". `R(\"1\"+s_rest)` becomes `R(\"10\") = 1 op R(\"0\") = 1 op 0 = 0`. This matches the example!\n\nSo the general rule for `m > 0` is:\n`R(s) = 0` if `k=0` (starts with '1').\n`R(s) = 0 op R(\"0\"*(k-1) + \"1\" + s_rest)` if `k>0`.\nThis implies `R(s) = 1` if `R(\"0\"*(k-1) + \"1\" + s_rest) = 0`.\nAnd `R(s) = 0` if `R(\"0\"*(k-1) + \"1\" + s_rest) = 1`.\nSo `R(s) = 1 - R(\"0\"*(k-1) + \"1\" + s_rest)` for `k > 0`.\n\nLet `val(k)` be the result of `R(s)` where `s` has `k` leading zeros.\n`val(0) = 0`.

This is the rule I derived earlier and thought was wrong.\nIt seems it *is* the rule. Why did the example `n=1, m=1, g=0` give 2?\n\"01\": `k=1` (odd). `R(\"01\") = 1`.\n\"10\": `k=0` (even). `R(\"10\") = 0`.\nIf `g=0`, only \"10\" is beautiful. Count is 1. Example says 2.\n\nThis means my base case `R(\"1\" + s_rest) = 0` might be wrong.\n`R(\"1\" + s_rest) = 1 \\text{ op } R(s_rest)`. This is `0` *unless* `s_rest` is empty.\nIf `s_rest` is empty, then `R(\"1\") = 1`.\nThis is the key!\n\nLet `k` be number of leading zeros. `s = \"0\"*k + \"1\" + s_rest`.\nIf `s_rest` is empty (`m=1` and `n=k`): `s = \"0\"*k + \"1\"`.\n`R(\"0\"*k + \"1\")`:\n`k=0`: `s = \"1\"`. `R(\"1\") = 1`.\n`k=1`: `s = \"01\"`. `R(\"01\") = 0 op R(\"1\") = 0 op 1 = 0`.\n`k=2`: `s = \"001\"`. `R(\"001\") = 0 op R(\"01\") = 0 op 0 = 1`.\n`k=3`: `s = \"0001\"`. `R(\"0001\") = 0 op R(\"001\") = 0 op 1 = 0`.\nSo for `s = \"0\"*k + \"1\"` (i.e., `m=1`, `n=k`): `R(s) = (k % 2 == 0)`.\n\nIf `s_rest` is NOT empty (`m > 1` or `m=1` and `n > k`):\nThen `s_rest` starts with either `0` or `1`. It's not a single character.\nSo `R(\"1\" + s_rest) = 1 \\text{ op } R(s_rest) = 0`. (Because `s_rest` is not empty, `R(s_rest)` is either `0` or `1`).\nThis means the `val(k)` sequence `0, 1, 0, 1, ...` applies.\nSo for `m > 1` OR (`m=1` AND `n > k`): `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`.\n\nLet's combine everything:\n\n**Final Logic:**\n1.  **`m = 0` (string is \"0\"*n)**:\n    `R(s) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n    Count is 1 if `g == (n % 2 == 0)`, else 0.\n\n2.  **`m = 1` (string is \"0\"*k + \"1\" + \"0\"*(n-k))**:\n    *   If `n-k > 0` (i.e. `s_rest` is \"0\"*(n-k) and is not empty):\n        `s = \"0\"*k + \"1\" + \"0\"*(n-k)`.\n        `R(\"1\" + \"0\"*(n-k)) = 1 \\text{ op } R(\"0\"*(n-k)) = 1 \\text{ op } ((n-k)%2 == 0)`.\n        If `(n-k)%2 == 0`, it's `1 op 1 = 0`.\n        If `(n-k)%2 != 0`, it's `1 op 0 = 0`.\n        So `R(\"1\" + \"0\"*(n-k))` is always `0` if `n-k > 0`.\n        Then `R(s) = (k % 2 != 0)`. (This is the `val(k)` sequence `0,1,0,1...` starting `val(0)=0`).\n        We need `g == (k % 2 != 0)`.\n    *   If `n-k = 0` (i.e. `s = \"0\"*n + \"1\"`):\n        `R(s) = (n % 2 == 0)`.

This matches example `1 1 0 -> 2`.\n\nLet's check `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`m > 1`. `g=0`. We need `g == (k % 2 != 0)`, which means `0 == (k % 2 != 0)`, so `k` must be even.\n`k \\in [0, n] = [0, 2]`. So `k` can be `0` or `2`.\nFor `k=0`: Add `C(n-k+m-1, m-1) = C(2-0+2-1, 2-1) = C(3, 1) = 3`.\nFor `k=2`: Add `C(n-k+m-1, m-1) = C(2-2+2-1, 2-1) = C(1, 1) = 1`.\nTotal count is `3+1 = 4`.
