Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Array Stabilization\" challenge.  It's about minimizing the \"instability\" of an array, which is simply the difference between its maximum and minimum values. The twist is that we have to *remove exactly one element* from the array to achieve this minimization.\n\nThe constraints are pretty straightforward: the array size `n` can be up to 10^5, and each element `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.  I need to handle these efficiently.\n\n**Decomposing the Problem**\n\nThe key insight, as with many of these problems, is to think about how removing an element impacts the minimum and maximum values.  If I remove an element in the \"middle\" (not the min or max), the instability doesn't necessarily change - it depends on the array's spread.  To minimize the instability, I should logically try to either *increase the minimum* or *decrease the maximum*.\n\nLet's imagine the sorted array `a_sorted`. Let's say it's  `[s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]`.  I know `s_1` is the original minimum and `s_n` is the original maximum.  If I remove an element that is *not* `s_1` or `s_n`, the range stays at the same original spread.\n\nIf I remove `s_1` (the smallest element), then the new minimum becomes `s_2`, and the maximum is still `s_n`.\n\nIf I remove `s_n` (the largest element), then the new maximum becomes `s_{n-1}`, and the minimum is still `s_1`.\n\nSo the possible minimum instabilities that I need to look at are:\n1. `s_n - s_2` (remove `s_1`)\n2. `s_{n-1} - s_1` (remove `s_n`)\n\nEssentially, I need to compute the instability for those two cases and return the *minimum* of those instabilities.  Sorting will be important, but this approach should give me the optimal solution quickly.\n",
