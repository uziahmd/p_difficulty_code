Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Elaboration: Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my approach to solve the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem.  First things first, I needed a Python script for it.\n\n**Problem Interpretation & Input:**\nThe problem is fairly straightforward, but understanding the crucial points is essential. We have a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns at positions `a_i`. Each lantern has a \"lighting radius\" `d` which is the same for all lanterns and lights points within distance `d` from its position. Our goal is to determine the *minimum* `d` required so the entire street [0, `l`] is illuminated.\n\nWe're given the input as `n`, `l`, and the positions of the lanterns: `a_1`, `a_2`, ... , `a_n`. The output will be this calculated `d` value, which should be a floating-point number with high precision to meet the problem's criteria. The given constraints specify the ranges for `n`, `l`, and the lantern positions `a_i`.\n\n**Core Idea and Initial Steps:**\nThe solution revolves around sorting the lantern positions first. That makes the whole analysis of the coverage much easier. The sorted lantern positions are denoted as  `a_0`, `a_1`, ... , `a_{n-1}`.\n\n**Analysis of Gaps:**\nThe key is to consider the street in segments.  There are a few key areas where we need to ensure the lights overlap:\n\n1.  **Beginning of the Street:** The first segment is [0, `a_0`]. To cover this area, the lantern at `a_0` must light up to point 0. This means `d` must be at least `a_0`.\n2.  **End of the Street:**  The segment is [`a_{n-1}`, `l`]. To light up to point `l`, the lantern at `a_{n-1}` needs to cover it, which means `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n3.  **Between Lanterns:**  Finally, the segments between adjacent lanterns, from `a_i` to `a_{i+1}`, have to be lit. To achieve this, the radius of lantern `a_i` and the radius of lantern `a_{i+1}` should overlap. This overlap means `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.  Simplifying it, `d` must be greater or equal to `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. The largest value of `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` among adjacent lantern pairs will determine the `d` value.\n\n**Combining the Requirements and Edge Cases:**\nThe overall `d` has to be large enough to satisfy *all* of these conditions: cover the beginning of the street, cover the end of the street, and bridge the gaps between lanterns. Thus, we have to find the maximum among three values to determine the `d`. It will be the maximum of `a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` for all pairs of adjacent lanterns.\n\nConsider the edge cases like a single lantern or lanterns at either extreme of the street. If `n = 1`, it works as expected. If the first lantern is placed at position `0`, it's radius should be atleast equal to the position of the last lantern. If the last lantern is placed at the end of the street, the result is equal to the radius of the lantern. This logic takes care of all those edge cases.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Implementation:**\nThe plan is to read input, sort the lantern positions, and then compute the required `d`. The main steps are:\n\n1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read the array `a` with lantern positions.\n3.  Sort the array `a`.\n4.  Initialize a variable `max_d` to `0.0`.\n5.  Set `max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  Set `max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n7.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `n - 2`, calculating `max_d = max(max_d, float((a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0))`.\n8.  Finally, print `max_d` formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\nThis algorithm works efficiently in O(N log",
