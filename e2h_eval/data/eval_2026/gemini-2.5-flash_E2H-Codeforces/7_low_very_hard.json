The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition: Rudolf and Snowflakes (Hard)**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of this \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (Hard)\" problem.  My initial thought is to devise a Python script to tackle this. Let's start by dissecting the snowflake structure.\n\nI see that we're essentially building a tree.  It starts with a single center vertex.  Then, we attach `k` new vertices to it, where `k` must be greater than 1.  This is our first layer. Each of these new vertices is only connected to the center.  Now, the subsequent layers are the key here. We repeat the process of connecting each of the \"leaf\" vertices from the previous layer to `k` more new vertices.  This process is repeated `d` times, where `d` is at least 1.\n\nThe important realization is that the total number of vertices, `n`, can be expressed as a geometric series: `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`. We can simplify this to `n = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nThe constraints are pretty clear: `k` must be greater than 1, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n` cannot exceed 10^18. So, the core of the problem is: given an `n`, can we find integer values for `k` and `d` that satisfy this equation and the constraints?\n\nNow that I have a solid grasp on the mathematical formulation, it is time to work on the Python code that will efficiently search for a solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake. A snowflake is defined by two parameters: `k` (the branching factor, `k > 1`) and `d` (the number of layers after the initial center and first `k` branches, `d >= 1`). The total number of vertices `n` in such a snowflake is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`\n\nThis sum can be written as `n = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nWe are given `n` (up to `10^18`) and need to find if there exist integers `k > 1` and `d >= 1` satisfying this equation.\n\nLet's analyze the equation `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`.\n\n**Case 1: Small `d` values**\n\n*   **`d = 1`**: `n = 1 + k`.\n    If `n > 2`, then `k = n - 1`. Since `n > 2`, `k > 1` is satisfied.\n    So, any `n > 2` can be formed with `d=1` and `k=n-1`.\n    However, the problem statement says \"This step should be done at least once.\" This refers to the step \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to `k` more new vertices.\"\n    If `d=1`, the structure is: center -> `k` vertices -> `k*k` vertices.\n    Total vertices `1 + k + k^2`.\n    The sum `1 + k + ... + k^d` implies `d` is the highest power of `k`.\n    The initial vertex is connected to `k` new vertices. Let's call this layer 0.\n    Then, each of these `k` vertices (layer 0) connects to `k` new vertices. This is the first \"step\" mentioned in the rule. These form layer 1.\n    If this step is done `d` times, the layers are 0, 1, ..., `d-1`. The total sum would be `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`.\n    The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\". This means `d` must be at least 2 in the sum `1 + k + ... + k^d`.\n    Let's re-read carefully: \"Initially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to `k` new vertices (`k > 1`).\" (This gives `1+k` vertices). \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to `k` more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n    If this step is done once: the `k` vertices (which are connected to only one other vertex, the center) each get `k` new children. Total vertices: `1 + k + k*k`. Here `d=2` in the series `1 + k + ... + k^d`.\n    If this step is done `m` times, the total vertices are `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m+1)`. So we need `m >= 1`, which means `d` in the sum `1 + k + ... + k^d` must be at least `2`.\n\n    So, we need `d >= 2`.\n\n*   **`d = 2`**: `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\n    This is a quadratic equation `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\n    The discriminant is `D = 1^2 - 4 * 1 * (1 - n) = 1 - 4 + 4n = 4n - 3`.\n    For `k` to be an integer, `4n - 3` must be a perfect square, say `s^2`.\n    `k = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\n    We need `k > 1`.\n    `(-1 + s) / 2 > 1` implies `-1 + s > 2` implies `s > 3`.\n    Also, `s` must be odd for `(-1 + s)` to be even.\n    So, for `d=2`, we check if `4n-3` is a perfect square `s^2` where `s` is an odd integer greater than 3.\n\n**Case 2: Larger `d` values (d >= 3)**\n\nFor `d >= 3`, we have `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`.\nSince `k >= 2`, we know:\n`k^d < n`\n`k^d + k^(d-1) + ... + k + 1 = n`\n`k^d < n < k^d + k^(d-1) + ... + k^d = k^d * d` (This upper bound is loose, `n < k^d * (1 + 1/k + 1/k^2 + ...) = k^d * (k/(k-1))` for `k >= 2`, so `n < 2 * k^d`)\n\nFrom `k^d < n`, we have `k < n^(1/d)`.\nFrom `n = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`, we have `n(k-1) = k^(d+1) - 1`.\n`nk - n = k^(d+1) - 1`.\n`k^(d+1) - nk + n - 1 = 0`.\n\nFor a fixed `d`, we can try to find `k`.\nSince `k >= 2`, `k^(d+1)` grows very fast.\n`n = 1 + k + ... + k^d`.\nSmallest `k` is 2. So `n >= 1 + 2 + ... + 2^d = 2^(d+1) - 1`.\nThis implies `2^(d+1) - 1 <= n`, so `2^(d+1) <= n+1`.\n`d+1 <= log2(n+1)`.\nSince `n <= 10^18`, `log2(10^18 + 1)` is approximately `log2(10^18) = 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.32 = 59.79`.\nSo `d+1` can be at most around 60. This means `d` can be at most around 59.\nThis is a small range for `d`. We can iterate `d` from `3` up to `59`.\n\nFor each `d` in this range:\nWe need to find an integer `k >= 2` such that `1 + k + ... + k^d = n`.\nLet `f(k) = 1 + k + ... + k^d`. This function is strictly increasing for `k >= 2`.\nWe can use binary search to find `k`.\nThe range for `k` is `[2, n^(1/d) + 2]` (a slightly generous upper bound).\nA tighter upper bound for `k`: `k^d < n`, so `k < n^(1/d)`.\nThe maximum value for `k` when `d=3` is `(10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`.\nThe maximum value for `k` when `d=59` is `(10^18)^(1/59)` which is close to `2`.\nSo `k` is in the range `[2, 10^6]`.\n\nBinary search for `k`:\nFor a fixed `d`:\n  `low = 2`, `high = 10^6 + 7` (a bit more than `n^(1/3)` to be safe).\n  While `low <= high`:\n    `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n    Calculate `S = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^d`.\n    Be careful with overflow: `mid^d` can exceed `10^18` if `mid` is large and `d` is small.\n    When calculating `S`, if `current_term = mid^i` exceeds `n`, then `S` will definitely exceed `n`.\n    We can compute `S` iteratively: `S = 1`, `power_of_k = 1`.\n    For `i` from `1` to `d`:\n      `power_of_k *= mid`\n      If `power_of_k` overflows or `S + power_of_k` overflows `n`, then `S` is too large.\n      `S += power_of_k`\n    \n    If `S == n`, we found a solution. Return \"YES\".\n    If `S < n`, `mid` is too small, `low = mid + 1`.\n    If `S > n`, `mid` is too large, `high = mid - 1`.\n\nIf the loop finishes without finding `k`, then no solution for this `d`.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n\n1.

So `k = (-1 + 7) // 2 = 3`. `k=3 > 1`. YES. (1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13)\n*   `n = 1`: No. (`k > 1`, `d >= 2` implies `n >= 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7`)\n*   `n = 3`: No. (`n >= 7`)\n*   `n = 6`: No. (`n >= 7`)\n*   `n = 15`:\n    *   `d=2`: `4*15 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57`. Not a perfect square.\n    *   `d=3`: `low=2, high=int(15**(1/3))+2 = 2+2=4`.\n        *   `mid = (2+4)//2 = 3`. `1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40`. `40 > 15`. `high = 2`.\n        *   `mid = (2+2)//2 = 2`. `1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`. `15 == 15`. YES.\n*   `n = 10^18`:\n    *   `d=2`: `4*10^18 - 3`. `s = int((4*10^18 - 3)**0.5) = int(2*10^9 - epsilon)`. `s*s` will be `(2*10^9 - 1)^2` or `(2*10^9)^2`. `(2*10^9)^2 = 4*10^18`. So `s` would be `2*10^9`. `s` is even. Not a solution for `d=2`.\n    *   `d=3` to `59`: Test `k`. `10^18` is `1000000000000000000`.\n        For `d=59`, `k=2`: `2^60 - 1`. `2^10 = 1024 ~ 10^3`. `2^60 = (2^10)^6 ~ (10^3)^6 = 10^18`.\n        More precisely, `2^60 - 1 = 1152921504606846975`. This is `n` for `k=2, d=59`.\n        So, if `n = 1152921504606846975`, it would be YES.\n        For `n = 10^18`, it seems no solution.\n\nThe check for `power_of_k * mid` overflow: `power_of_k > n // mid` is correct. If `mid` is 0, this would cause a ZeroDivisionError, but `mid` is always `>= 2`.\nThe check for `current_sum + power_of_k` overflow: `current_sum > n - power_of_k` is correct.\n\nThe maximum value for `d` is `log2(10^18 + 1) - 1` approx `58.79`.
