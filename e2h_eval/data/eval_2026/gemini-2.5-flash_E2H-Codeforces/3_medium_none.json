Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Solving \"Vanya and Lanterns\"**\n\nAlright, I'm facing the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. It's about lighting up a street segment from 0 to 'l' with 'n' lanterns, each with a radius 'd'. My goal is to find the *minimum* 'd' that ensures the entire street is lit. Here's how I'm approaching this:\n\nFirst, understanding the setup is key. I have a street length 'l' and lantern positions 'a_i'. Each lantern at 'a_i' lights the interval [a_i - d, a_i + d].  I need to calculate the minimum 'd' necessary.\n\nTo make things easier, I'll start by sorting the lantern positions. Sorting is essential because the order drastically influences which areas of the street are uncovered. After sorting, say 'a_1 <= a_2 <=...<= a_n', it becomes easier to look for the \"critical gaps\".\n\nMy plan involves identifying three potentially problematic areas:\n\n1.  **The Start and End of the Street:**  If the first lantern isn't at 0, or the last lantern isn't at 'l', I'll have a gap at the start or end that 'd' has to cover.  'd' must be large enough to reach 0 from the start lantern position, and also from the last lantern position to 'l'.\n2.  **Gaps between Lanterns:** I'll focus on the space between each pair of adjacent lanterns (post-sorting). To light up the entire street, I need to cover any gap between them. For the middle portion between two consecutive lantern positions, 'd' has to be at least half the distance between those two lanterns (i.e., (a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub>)/2).\n3.  **Find the Maximum Radius:** By considering each of these scenarios, the minimum value for 'd' is determined by the largest value needed amongst the initial segment, final segment and the middle segments.\n\nIn more detailed steps, I'll:\n\n1.  Read the input: 'n', 'l', and the array of lantern positions, 'a_i'.\n2.  Sort the 'a' array (lantern positions)\n3.  Calculate 'max\\_d' to be 0.0. I'll store the final answer here.\n4.  Check if the radius of the first lantern is sufficient to cover the start of the street.\n5.  Check if the radius of the last lantern is sufficient to cover the end.\n6.  Iterate through the array and find the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns, considering that the radius of the lantern has to extend a value such that the middle point between them is covered.\n7.  Finally, return the maximum 'd' amongst all the segments.\n\nI will use Python to implement this because it's concise.  I'll use `float()` for divisions to maintain required precision and format the output to the specified number of decimal places.  I'm confident I can make the optimal computation by applying these steps!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` required for `n` lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`. The street spans from coordinate 0 to `l`. Each lantern is located at a specific point `a_i` and lights all points within distance `d` from it, meaning it covers the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo find the minimum `d`, we need to consider all parts of the street that might be unlit and determine the `d` required to cover them. The critical unlit sections can be categorized into three types:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The segment `[0, a[0]]` (where `a[0]` is the position of the first lantern after sorting) must be covered. Specifically, the point 0 must be lit. The first lantern `a[0]` is responsible for covering the start of the street. The distance from `a[0]` to 0 is `a[0]`. Thus, `d` must be at least `a[0]`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street:** The segment `[a[n-1], l]` (where `a[n-1]` is the position of the last lantern after sorting) must be covered. Specifically, the point `l` must be lit. The last lantern `a[n-1]` is responsible for covering the end of the street. The distance from `a[n-1]` to `l` is `l - a[n-1]`. Thus, `d` must be at least `l - a[n-1]`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` (after sorting), the segment `[a[i], a[i+1]]` must be fully lit. The point that is furthest from both `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` within this segment is their midpoint, `(a[i] + a[i+1]) / 2`. To cover this midpoint, each lantern must extend its light radius at least `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`. This is the minimum `d` required to bridge the gap between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`. We need to find the maximum such value among all adjacent pairs.\n\nThe minimum light radius `d` that lights the entire street `[0, l]` will be the maximum of the `d` values required for these three types of critical sections.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions into a list `a`.\n3.  Sort the list `a` in ascending order. This simplifies identifying the first/last lanterns and calculating gaps between adjacent ones.\n4.  Initialize a variable `max_d` to `0.0`. This variable will store the maximum required radius found so far.\n5.  **Calculate `d` for the street start:** Update `max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  **Calculate `d` for the street end:** Update `max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n7.  **Calculate `d` for gaps between lanterns:** Iterate through the sorted lantern positions from `i = 0` to `n-2`. For each pair `(a[i], a[i+1])`, calculate the required radius `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0`. Update `max_d = max(max_d, (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0)`.\n8.  Print `max_d` formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach covers all possible scenarios, including cases with a single lantern or lanterns at the street's exact ends. The time complexity will be dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`, and the space complexity is `O(N)` for storing lantern positions. Given `N <= 1000`, this is highly efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and l from the first line\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the lantern positions from the second line\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily find the first/last and calculate gaps\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Initialize max_d to 0.0.
