His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how to find Vasya's best and worst ranks in this Olympiad, as I see it:**\n\nThe heart of the problem is figuring out how to pair the scores from the two rounds. We know Vasya has at least *x* points, but that doesn't immediately tell us his rank.  The key is to understand that the jury can arbitrarily assign ranks in case of ties.\n\n**Best Rank:**\n\nTo get the best rank, I need to make sure Vasya gets the highest possible score. This is where I start thinking about the guaranteed condition: there's at least one pair of scores that adds up to at least *x*.  I can maximize Vasya's score by giving him the highest possible total score from the available combinations, even if that means others could potentially tie with this total. Sorting helps here: `a_n + b_n` is *always* the largest possible sum, so I'm trying to make that at least `x`. In order for Vasya to get rank 1, I just need `a_n + b_n` to be `>= x`. If it is, and then the strategy to minimize the scores of everyone else by assigning scores by `a_i + b_i`, Vasya *must* be rank 1. If Vasya has `a_n + b_n`, everyone else can have a smaller sum, guaranteed. Since the jury is allowed to break ties, Vasya will be placed in the highest position among the tie. Thus, the best rank will be `1`.\n\n**Worst Rank:**\n\nThe worst rank is more tricky. I'm trying to minimize Vasya's score, but that score must still be at least *x*. Then, I want to arrange the remaining scores to maximize the number of people who have scores *greater than or equal* to Vasya's score. This means making sure as many people as possible score better. I've been thinking about this in terms of maximizing the total count of people who score better than, or at least equal to, Vasya. I want a `S_V` that is at least `x`, and that gives me the highest count of people who also have scores `>=S_V`. To find this minimum, I can find the sum `S`, such that the number of `a_i + b_j >= S` is minimized. I'm imagining a situation where I deliberately pair scores to make as many other people as possible score close to or better than Vasya. This is similar to a maximum bipartite matching problem, but I need a computationally efficient approach, especially with the large input size. I've realized that the two pointer greedy approach is correct, to minimize the number of people with `a_i + b_j >= S_V`. I'm starting to think a binary search on possible ranks, or scores, might be helpful in finding Vasya's worst possible rank.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, Vasya's minimum total score `x`, and two lists of `n` scores for the first and second tours (`a` and `b`). We don't know which `a_i` corresponds to which `b_j`. The ranking is based on the sum of points, with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\nLet's sort both lists `a` and `b` in ascending order. Let them be `a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n` and `b_1 \\le b_2 \\le \\dots \\le b_n`.\n\n### Best Possible Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best rank, Vasya wants to maximize their score and minimize the scores of all other participants.\nThe problem guarantees that \"Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 \\le i, j \\le n) such, that `a_i + b_j \\ge x`.\"\nThe maximum possible score any participant can achieve is `a_n + b_n` (by pairing the highest score from tour 1 with the highest score from tour 2). This score `a_n + b_n` is guaranteed to be at least `x` because it's the maximum possible sum, and at least one pair `a_i + b_j` satisfies the `x` condition.\n\nSo, Vasya can be assigned the scores `a_n` and `b_n`, resulting in a total score of `S_V = a_n + b_n`. This score is `\\ge x`.\nFor the remaining `n-1` participants, we need to pair the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` (`a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}`) with the remaining `n-1` scores from `b` (`b_1, \\dots, b_{n-1}`). To minimize their scores, we should pair `a_i` with `b_i` for `i=1, \\dots, n-1`. The scores for these participants would be `a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}`.\nSince `a_n \\ge a_i` and `b_n \\ge b_i` for all `i < n`, it follows that `a_n + b_n \\ge a_i + b_i`.\nTherefore, Vasya's score `S_V` will be greater than or equal to all other participants' scores.\nWith the jury's discretion for ties, Vasya can be placed first among participants with the highest score.\nThus, Vasya's best possible rank is **1**.\n\n### Worst Possible Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the worst rank, Vasya wants to minimize their score (while still being `\\ge x`) and maximize the scores of other participants. Vasya's rank is `1 + (\\text{number of people with score } > S_V) + (\\text{number of people with score } = S_V \\text{ placed before Vasya by jury})`. To maximize this rank, we count all people with score `\\ge S_V`.\n\nLet's define a function `count_ge(S_target)` which returns the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who can achieve a total score of at least `S_target`.\nThis can be found using a greedy approach:\n1. Sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n2. Initialize `count = 0`.\n3. Use two pointers: `ptr_a = 0` (for `a` starting from the smallest) and `ptr_b = n-1` (for `b` starting from the largest).\n4. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] \\ge S_target`:\n     This pair `(a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b])` can form a sum `\\ge S_target`. We use them, increment `count`, `ptr_a++`, `ptr_b--`.\n   Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S_target`):\n     `a[ptr_a]` is too small to make `S_target` even with the largest available `b[ptr_b]`. To maximize the count of pairs that *do* meet the target, we must discard `a[ptr_a]` (pair it with some `b` that won't meet the target anyway), and try a larger `a`. So, `ptr_a++`.\n5. Return `count`.\n\nThe function `count_ge(S_target)` is monotonically non-increasing with `S_target`.\nWe want to find Vasya's score `S_V` such that `S_V \\ge x` and `count_ge(S_V)` is maximized.\nSince `count_ge` is non-increasing, to maximize `count_ge(S_V)`, we should pick the smallest possible `S_V` that Vasya could achieve, such that `S_V \\ge x`.\nThe smallest score Vasya can achieve is `x`. If Vasya gets exactly `x` points, then the number of people with score `\\ge x` is `count_ge(x)`. This `count_ge(x)` represents the maximum number of people who can score at least `x`.\nIf Vasya is one of these `count_ge(x)` people, and all of them score `\\ge x`, then Vasya's rank would be `count_ge(x)` (assuming the jury places Vasya last among ties).\n\nThis logic is sound:\n1. Vasya must score at least `x`.\n2. To maximize Vasya's rank (make it worst), we want as many people as possible to score `\\ge` Vasya's score.\n3. The smallest score Vasya can possibly have is `x`. If Vasya scores `x`, then all other participants who score `\\ge x` will be ranked better or equal.\n4. The maximum number of people who can score `\\ge x` is given by `count_ge(x)`.\n5. If Vasya scores `x`, and `k = count_ge(x)` people (including Vasya) score `\\ge x`, then Vasya's worst rank is `k`.\n\nTherefore, the worst possible rank for Vasya is `count_ge(x)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nSorted `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n**Best Rank:**\nAs derived, best rank is 1.\n\n**Worst Rank:**\nWe need `count_ge(x)` where `x=7`.\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n`ptr_a = 0` (`a[0]=3`), `ptr_b = 5` (`b[5]=8`), `count = 0`\n\n1. `a[0] + b[5] = 3 + 8 = 11 \\ge 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n2. `a[1] + b[4] = 4 + 6 = 10 \\ge 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n3. `a[2] + b[3] = 4 + 4 = 8 \\ge 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n4. `a[3] + b[2] = 4 + 4 = 8 \\ge 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n5. `a[4] + b[1] = 5 + 3 = 8 \\ge 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n6. `a[5] + b[0] = 6 + 0 = 6 < 7`. `ptr_a = 6`.\nLoop terminates because `ptr_a = 6` (which is `n`).\n\nSo, `count_ge(7) = 5`.\nThe worst rank is 5.\n\nOutput: `1 5`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can take the highest score from tour A (max(a)) and highest from tour B (max(b)).\n    # The problem guarantees that at least one pair (a_i, b_j) sums to >= x.\n    # The pair (max(a), max(b)) will always sum to >= x.\n    # If Vasya gets max(a) + max(b) points, and other participants are paired to minimize their scores\n    # (e.g., sort remaining a's and b's and pair a_k with b_k),\n    # Vasya's score will be greater than or equal to everyone else's.\n    # With the jury's discretion for ties, Vasya can be ranked 1st.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst possible rank for Vasya.\n    # To maximize Vasya's rank (make it worst), we want to maximize the number of people\n    # who score greater than or equal to Vasya's score.\n    # Vasya's score must be at least x.\n    # To maximize the count of people with score >= S_V, we should choose the smallest possible S_V >= x.\n    # This means Vasya scores exactly x points.\n    # Then we find the maximum number of participants who can score >= x.\n    # This count will be Vasya's worst rank (assuming the jury places Vasya last among ties).\n\n    # Sort both arrays for the greedy approach.\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n\n    count_ge_x = 0\n    ptr_a = 0\n    ptr_b = n - 1\n\n    while ptr_a < n and ptr_b >= 0:\n        if a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x:\n            # This pair (a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b]) can achieve a score >= x.\n            # We use these scores for one participant.\n            count_ge_x += 1\n            ptr_a += 1\n            ptr_b -= 1\n        else:\n            # a[ptr_a] is too small to achieve x even with the largest available b[ptr_b].\n            # This a[ptr_a] cannot be part of a pair summing to >= x.\n            # We move to the next largest a[ptr_a] to try and form a pair >= x.\n            ptr_a += 1\n            # Note: b[ptr_b] remains, as it might form a pair >= x with a larger a.\n\n    worst_rank = count_ge_x\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
