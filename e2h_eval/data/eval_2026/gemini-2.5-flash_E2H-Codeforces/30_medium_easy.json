Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My current thought process for solving the TV Game problem is as follows:**\n\nI need to create a Python script that solves a competitive programming problem. In this problem, two players, Homer and Marge, are given a number with an even number of digits. They take turns extracting the leftmost digit and appending it to their own numbers. The goal is to maximize the sum of their resulting numbers. The output should be a string of 'H' and 'M' characters representing the sequence of moves.\n\nI've begun by understanding the problem: each player makes half the total number of moves, and all digits are used once. The order of digit selection is crucial because it influences the value of the final sum. The first examples help confirm that the output format should just be the move sequence.\n\nI considered a few example scenarios with a small number of digits. Analyzing these helps to see the possible outcomes and start formulating a strategy. I realized that brute-forcing all possible move sequences is impractical, especially for larger inputs. The value of placing a digit at the leftmost position is much higher than the value when placed at the rightmost, so an optimal greedy solution to pick the largest available digit at each step won't work.\n\nThen I focused on the idea that the problem could be solved by dynamic programming. I had to discard some earlier approaches due to their large space and computational complexity. The actual numbers being constructed are too big, so it's best to look at the *contribution* of each digit.\n\nI defined a suitable state space for a dynamic programming solution. This involves tracking how many digits each player has taken. The core idea is to compute the maximum total sum recursively, considering the current digit and choosing which player should take it. I realized I needed a recursive DP function with memoization. The state will be (`h_taken`, `m_taken`), representing the number of digits Homer and Marge have taken so far, and the recursive value would be the *maximum contribution* from the remaining digits in A. The contribution of each digit will be determined by its original value and the player's taking turn.\n\nTo reconstruct the optimal move sequence (the path), I'll need to store the decision ('H' or 'M') made at each DP state.  This should allow me to trace back the choices made to generate the optimal sequence.\n\nThe solution now seems clear: a DP function with memoization and path reconstruction. The time complexity is expected to be `O(n^2)`, which is efficient enough for this problem. The code will involve two nested loops representing each player's moves, a recursive function to compute the maximum value for each state, and memoization.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and the sum of the numbers they form (`S1` for Homer, `S2` for Marge) is maximized. The number `A` consists of `2n` digits. In each turn, a player takes the leftmost digit of `A` and appends it to their number.\n\nLet's analyze how the value of `S1 + S2` is formed. Each player takes `n` digits. If Homer takes digits `d_1, d_2, ..., d_n` in that order, his number `S1` will have the value `d_1 * 10^(n-1) + d_2 * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_n * 10^0`. Similarly for Marge's number `S2`.\n\nThe key insight is to consider the contribution of each digit from the original number `A`. Suppose `A[i]` is the `i`-th digit (0-indexed) of `A`. When `A[i]` is taken by a player, say Homer, and it is his `k`-th digit (0-indexed, meaning `k` digits have been taken by Homer before `A[i]`), then `A[i]` contributes `A[i] * 10^(n-1-k)` to Homer's score `S1`. The same logic applies if Marge takes `A[i]`.\n\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach. We need to decide for each digit `A[idx]` whether Homer or Marge takes it. The decision depends on how many digits each player has already taken.\n\nLet `dp(h_taken, m_taken)` be the maximum possible sum of contributions from the remaining digits (`A[h_taken + m_taken:]`), given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits.\n\nThe state transitions are as follows:\n`idx = h_taken + m_taken` (current digit being considered is `A[idx]`)\n`current_digit_value = int(A[idx])`\n\n1.  **Homer takes `A[idx]`**:\n    This is possible only if `h_taken < n`.\n    The power of 10 for `A[idx]` will be `n - 1 - h_taken`.\n    Contribution: `current_digit_value * (10 ** (n - 1 - h_taken))`\n    Recursive call: `dp(h_taken + 1, m_taken)`\n    Total value if Homer takes: `current_digit_value * (10 ** (n - 1 - h_taken)) + dp(h_taken + 1, m_taken)`\n\n2.  **Marge takes `A[idx]`**:\n    This is possible only if `m_taken < n`.\n    The power of 10 for `A[idx]` will be `n - 1 - m_taken`.\n    Contribution: `current_digit_value * (10 ** (n - 1 - m_taken))`\n    Recursive call: `dp(h_taken, m_taken + 1)`\n    Total value if Marge takes: `current_digit_value * (10 ** (n - 1 - m_taken)) + dp(h_taken, m_taken + 1)`\n\nWe choose the option that yields the maximum total value. The base case is when `idx == 2n`, meaning all digits have been processed, so `dp(n, n)` returns 0.\n\nTo reconstruct the path (the sequence of 'H' and 'M' moves), we store the choice ('H' or 'M') made at each state `(h_taken, m_taken)` that leads to the maximum value.\n\n**State Space and Complexity:**\n*   `h_taken` ranges from 0 to `n`.\n*   `m_taken` ranges from 0 to `n`.\n*   The total number of states is `(n+1) * (n+1)`.\n*   For `n=18`, this is `19 * 19 = 361` states, which is very small.\n*   Each state computation involves at most two recursive calls and constant arithmetic operations.\n*   The overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.\n*   The space complexity for memoization is also `O(n^2)`.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for `n <= 18`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n# Read A as a string\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Memoization table for DP results: stores (h_taken, m_taken) -> max_value\nmemo = {}\n# Memoization table for path reconstruction: stores (h_taken, m_taken) -> 'H' or 'M'\npath_memo = {}\n\ndef solve(h_taken, m_taken):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible sum of contributions from the remaining digits,\n    given the number of digits Homer and Marge have taken.\n    \n    Args:\n        h_taken (int): Number of digits Homer has already taken.\n        m_taken (int): Number of digits Marge has already taken.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum total contribution from the remaining digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # If this state has already been computed, return the memoized value\n    if (h_taken, m_taken) in memo:\n        return memo[(h_taken, m_taken)]\n\n    # Calculate the current index in the original string A\n    idx = h_taken + m_taken\n\n    # Base case: All 2n digits have been processed\n    if idx == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n\n    # Get the current digit's integer value\n    current_digit_value = int(A[idx])\n\n    max_val = -1  # Initialize with a value lower than any possible sum\n    choice = ''    # Stores the best move ('H' or 'M') for this state\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n    if h_taken < n:\n        # Calculate the power of 10 for this digit in Homer's number\n        # If it's Homer's k-th digit (0-indexed), its position is n-1-k\n        homer_power = n - 1 - h_taken\n        val_if_homer_takes = current_digit_value * (10 ** homer_power)\n        \n        # Recursively find the max value for the rest of the game\n        res_homer = solve(h_taken + 1, m_taken)\n        total_homer_sum = val_if_homer_takes + res_homer\n        \n        # If Homer's choice yields a better sum, update max_val and choice\n        if total_homer_sum > max_val:\n            max_val = total_homer_sum\n            choice = 'H'\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n    if m_taken < n:\n        # Calculate the power of 10 for this digit in Marge's number\n        # If it's Marge's k-th digit (0-indexed), its position is n-1-k\n        marge_power = n - 1 - m_taken\n        val_if_marge_takes = current_digit_value * (10 ** marge_power)\n        \n        # Recursively find the max value for the rest of the game\n        res_marge = solve(h_taken, m_taken + 1)\n        total_marge_sum = val_if_marge_takes + res_marge\n        \n        # If Marge's choice yields a better sum, update max_val and choice\n        # Using '>' prioritizes Homer if sums are equal, which is fine per problem statement.\n        # If only Marge can move (e.g., Homer already took n digits), 'choice' might be empty.\n        # We need to handle that case explicitly to ensure Marge's move is chosen.\n        if total_marge_sum > max_val:\n            max_val = total_marge_sum\n            choice = 'M'\n        elif choice == '' and m_taken < n: # This condition ensures Marge is chosen if she's the only option\n            max_val = total_marge_sum\n            choice = 'M'\n\n    # Store the result and the best choice in memoization tables\n    memo[(h_taken, m_taken)] = max_val\n    path_memo[(h_taken, m_taken)] = choice\n    \n    return max_val\n\n# Start the DP from the initial state (0 digits taken by Homer, 0 by Marge)\nsolve(0, 0)\n\n# Reconstruct the path using path_memo\nresult_path = []\ncurrent_h = 0\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nfor _ in range(2 * n):\n    # Get the best move for the current state\n    move = path_memo[(current_h, current_m)]\n    result_path.append(move)\n    \n    # Update the counts based on the chosen move\n    if move == 'H':\n        current_h += 1\n    else: # move == 'M'\n        current_m += 1\n\n# Print the final sequence of moves\nsys.stdout.write(''.join(result_path) + '\\n')\n\n```",
