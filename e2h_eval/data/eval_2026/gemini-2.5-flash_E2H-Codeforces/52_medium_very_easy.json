Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break it down. We've got Vasily with an initial number of candles, `a`. Each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. The clever bit is that `b` burnt-out candles can be used to make one new candle. The goal is to maximize the total time the room is lit.\n\nMy immediate thought is that since each candle burns for just an hour, the optimal strategy is to use *every* candle we can get our hands on. It's a greedy approach: burn, collect, craft, repeat. I should track the total hours the room is lit and the number of burnt-out candles.\n\nSo, here's how I think it'll work, step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Burn Phase:** Light all the available candles (initially, the `a` candles). Add the number of lit candles to our `total_hours`.\n2.  **Collection Phase:** Collect all the burnt-out candles.\n3.  **Crafting Phase:**  Check how many new candles we can create from the burnt-out candles. We divide the number of burnt-out candles by `b`.\n4.  **Iteration:** Go back to the burn phase with the newly crafted candles.  Keep repeating this process until we can't craft any more new candles.\n\nTo make sure this works, let's try an example. If `a = 4` and `b = 2`:\n\n*   **Iteration 1:** We burn 4 candles, so `total_hours = 4`. We have 4 burnt-out candles. We can craft `4 // 2 = 2` new candles.\n*   **Iteration 2:** We burn 2 new candles, increasing `total_hours` to 6. Now we have 2 burnt-out candles, which is enough to craft `2 // 2 = 1` more candle.\n*   **Iteration 3:** We burn 1 candle, making `total_hours = 7`. Now we have 1 burnt out candle and we can't make anymore so we are done.\n\nI think that example solidifies the pattern, and I'm confident in the logic.\n\nNow for the algorithm, I'll initialize `total_hours` to zero and the current number of new candles to the initial `a` value. I'll also initialize a `burned_out_candles_stash` to track burnt-out candles. I'll use a `while` loop that runs as long as there are new candles. Inside the loop, I'll add the new candles to the total hours and the `burned_out_candles_stash`. Then calculate the number of candles that can be crafted from our stash and update the `burned_out_candles_stash` and the `current_new_candles`.\n\nThe constraints are `1 <= a <= 1000` and `2 <= b <= 1000`, so the number of iterations should be pretty small. Even if `a` is 1000 and `b` is 2, it quickly converges. I'm not worried about integer overflow; the total hours should stay within reasonable bounds.\n\nThe input format is one line with two integers: `a` and `b`, separated by a space. I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for input (that's a competitive programming trick to make input faster) and `print()` for output.\n\nI'm feeling good about this. Let's write the code! I'll read the line, split it, convert to integers, and then implement the algorithm. Then test it with the example. And test a few edge cases!\n",
