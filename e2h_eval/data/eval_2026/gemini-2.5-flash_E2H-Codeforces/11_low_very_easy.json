A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got the \"Soft Drinking\" problem in front of me.  Essentially, the goal is to figure out the maximum number of toasts that *each* friend can make, ensuring everyone gets the same amount.  That's key.  Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to clearly define the resources and the constraints.  We've got the number of friends (`n`), the drink bottles (`k`), the drink volume per bottle (`l`), the limes (`c`), lime slices per lime (`d`), the salt (`p`), the drink needed *per toast per friend* (`nl`), and the salt needed *per toast per friend* (`np`). Got it.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to calculate the total available resources: total drink in milliliters is `k * l`, total lime slices are `c * d`, and the total salt is just `p`. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to translate these resources into possible toasts. Here's where it needs extra thought:  the problem is about toasts *per person*.  If we're making *X* toasts total, each friend needs *X* times the per-toast requirements for each resource.  So for *T* toasts, that's  `T * n * nl` milliliters of drink, `T * n` slices, and `T * n * np` grams of salt.  However, this also means we can find the maximum *individual* toast count by dividing the total resources by the *per-person* requirements. \n\nLet me re-formulate the logic. The key is to calculate the maximum number of *individual* toasts based on each resource, then figure out the limiting factor.\n\nFor drink, the total milliliters is `k * l`. Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. So, the total number of individual toasts is `(k * l) // nl`. For limes, the total slices is `c * d`, and each friend needs one slice, thus total is `(c * d) // 1`.  Salt is similar: `p // np`.\n\nFinally, the limiting factor. The maximum *individual* toast count for all friends is the *minimum* of these three values: `min((k * l) // nl, (c * d) // 1, p // np)`. We have to make sure each friend can make the same number. Therefore, this represents the total individual toasts possible, which is the same for each person.  The solution is then simply this value.\n",
