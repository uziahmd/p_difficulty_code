He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Profit Maximization Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. I need to maximize profit over *k* days, given *n* problems with varying difficulties. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The overall goal is to maximize the sum of these daily maximums.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the contribution of each problem to the profit. The crucial element seems to be the *maximum* difficulty within each day's sequence.  Essentially, I'm trying to strategically choose these maximums across the *k* days to get the biggest possible total profit.\n\nThe core idea is to identify the *k* largest values in the input array. If I can ensure that each of these *k* largest values becomes the maximum difficulty for one of the *k* days, then I've maximized the total profit.\n\nLet's break it down further. I need to ensure that the *k* largest values, let's call them `M_1 >= M_2 >= ... >= M_k`, are indeed the daily maximums.  If this is achievable, the total profit would be the sum of these *k* values. But is this always possible?\n\nI think so. I can think about it this way: pick the *k* largest values from the array, potentially including duplicates. For the segment where one of those largest values lives, I have a maximum value. If the *i*-th largest value is the maximum of the *i*-th segment, I'm set. If not, then I can always find another segment where a value larger than or equal to that *i*-th value is present, and shift the segment boundaries.\n\nBased on this, it seems my strategy is to select the *k* largest difficulty values, determine a partitioning of the array so that each of the selected values is the maximum of a segment.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on one day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits. We need to output the maximum total profit and the number of problems solved each day.\n\nLet's analyze the profit. To maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should try to make these maximums as large as possible. The most intuitive approach is to pick the `k` largest problem difficulties from the entire list `a` and ensure that each of these `k` difficulties becomes the maximum for one of the `k` days.\n\nSuppose the `k` largest difficulties in the array `a` are `M_1 \\ge M_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge M_k`. If we can partition the problems such that `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k` are the maximums for each of the `k` days, then the total profit will be `M_1 + M_2 + \\dots + M_k`. This is the maximum possible sum because any other set of `k` daily maximums would be a subset of problems from `a`, and their sum cannot exceed the sum of the `k` largest problems from `a`.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Identify the `k` largest difficulties in the input array `a`. Let's store these values and their original indices.\n2. The maximum total profit will be the sum of these `k` largest difficulties.\n3. To determine the daily problem counts (`t_j`), we need to define the `k` segments such that each of these `k` largest difficulties is the maximum in one segment. A simple way to achieve this is to make each of these `k` largest difficulties the *last* problem in its respective day's segment (except for the very last one, which could be anywhere in the last segment). More precisely, we can use the original indices of these `k` largest difficulties as split points.\n\nLet's outline the steps for implementation:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, index)` for each problem in `a`.\n4. Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty. If difficulties are equal, the order doesn't matter for finding the largest values, but sorting by index ascending for ties can help in getting a canonical set of indices for splits.\n5. Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These are the `k` largest difficulties. Sum their difficulties to get the maximum total profit.\n6. Extract the original indices of these `k` largest difficulties. Store them in a list, say `split_indices`.\n7. Sort `split_indices` in ascending order. These indices represent the positions where we will make cuts to define the `k` segments.\n8. The first day's problems will go from index `0` up to `split_indices[0]`. So, the number of problems is `split_indices[0] + 1`.\n9. For subsequent days (from day `j=1` to `k-2`), the problems will go from `split_indices[j-1] + 1` up to `split_indices[j]`. The number of problems for day `j+1` is `split_indices[j] - split_indices[j-1]`.\n10. The last day's problems (day `k`) will go from `split_indices[k-2] + 1` up to `n-1`. The number of problems for day `k` is `n - (split_indices[k-2] + 1)`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1. `a` with indices: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2. Sort by difficulty (descending): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3. Take top `k=3` elements: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n4. Max total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n5. Extract indices: `[6, 3, 0]`.\n6. Sort indices: `split_indices = [0, 3, 6]`. These are the *0-based indices* of the problems that are chosen to be the maximums for their respective days.\n7. Calculate `t_j` values (number of problems per day):\n   - Day 1: Problems from index `0` up to `split_indices[0] = 0`. This is `a[0]`. Number of problems: `split_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n   - Wait, this isn't quite right. The example output is `3 2 3`. My current logic would give `1` for the first day. The `split_indices` should mark the *end* of a day's problems. If `split_indices = [0, 3, 6]`, this means problem at index 0 is the max of day 1, problem at index 3 is max of day 2, problem at index 6 is max of day 3.\n   \nLet's adjust the `t_j` calculation. The `k` selected indices `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k` (sorted) define the points *after which* a day ends.\nThe first day ends at `idx_1`. It includes problems `a_0, \\dots, a_{idx_1}`. Number of problems: `idx_1 + 1`.\nThe second day ends at `idx_2`. It includes problems `a_{idx_1+1}, \\dots, a_{idx_2}`. Number of problems: `idx_2 - idx_1`.\n...\nThe `j`-th day ends at `idx_j`. It includes problems `a_{idx_{j-1}+1}, \\dots, a_{idx_j}`. Number of problems: `idx_j - idx_{j-1}`.\nThe `k`-th day ends at `idx_k`. It includes problems `a_{idx_{k-1}+1}, \\dots, a_{n-1}`. Number of problems: `n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)`.\n\nLet's re-apply with `split_indices = [0, 3, 6]`:\n- `t_1`: `split_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n- `t_2`: `split_indices[1] - split_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n- `t_3`: `n - (split_indices[1] + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4`.\nThis gives `[1, 3, 4]`, which sums to 8. The profit is still 20, but the `t_j` values don't match the example `[3, 2, 3]`.\n\nThe problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\" So `[1, 3, 4]` is a valid answer for the example.\nDay 1: `[5]` (max 5)\nDay 2: `[4, 2, 6]` (max 6)\nDay 3: `[5, 1, 9, 2]` (max 9)\nTotal profit: `5 + 6 + 9 = 20`. This is correct.\n\nThe example output `[3, 2, 3]` corresponds to `split_indices = [2, 4, 7]`.\nLet's check `a[2]=2, a[4]=5, a[7]=2`. Are these the `k` largest? No.\nThe example output `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]` has daily maximums `5, 6, 9`.\nThe indices of these maximums in the original array `a`:\n- `5` is at index `0`.\n- `6` is at index `3`.\n- `9` is at index `6`.\nThe chosen split points (end indices of segments) are `2, 4, 7`.\nSegment 1: `a[0 \\dots 2] = [5, 4, 2]`. Max is `5` (at index 0).\nSegment 2: `a[3 \\dots 4] = [6, 5]`. Max is `6` (at index 3).\nSegment 3: `a[5 \\dots 7] = [1, 9, 2]`. Max is `9` (at index 6).\nThe key insight is that the *indices of the `k` largest elements* are used to define the segments, but they don't necessarily have to be the *last* element of a segment. They just need to be *within* a segment and be its maximum.\nMy current logic is to make them the last element of a segment. This is a valid way to ensure they are the maximum.\n\nLet `k_largest_indices` be the sorted list of indices of the `k` largest problems.\n`k_largest_indices = [0, 3, 6]` for the example.\nThe daily counts `t_j` can be constructed as follows:\n`t_1 = k_largest_indices[0] + 1`\n`t_2 = k_largest_indices[1] - k_largest_indices[0]`\n...\n`t_{k-1} = k_largest_indices[k-2] - k_largest_indices[k-3]` (for `k > 2`)\n`t_k = n - k_largest_indices[k-1]` (Mistake here, this should be `n - (k_largest_indices[k-2] + 1)` which is `n - k_largest_indices[k-1]` if `k_largest_indices[k-1]` is the last index).\n\nLet's refine the `t_j` calculation.\nThe `k` largest elements are `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`. Their indices are `0, 3, 6`.\nSort these indices: `sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]`.\nThese `k` indices must be part of `k` distinct days.\nThe first day must end at or after `sorted_indices[0]`.\nThe second day must end at or after `sorted_indices[1]`.\n...\nThe `k`-th day must end at or after `sorted_indices[k-1]`.\nAnd all problems must be covered.\n\nA simple construction for `t_j` values:\n`t_j` is the number of problems in day `j`.\nThe first `k-1` days will each contain exactly one of the `k` largest problems, and they will be the last problem of their respective day.\nThe last day will contain all remaining problems, including the `k`-th largest problem.\n\nLet `sorted_indices` be the sorted list of the original 0-based indices of the `k` largest problem difficulties.\n`sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]` for `k=3`.\n\n`t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1` (problems from index 0 to `sorted_indices[0]`)\n`t_2 = sorted_indices[1] - sorted_indices[0]` (problems from index `sorted_indices[0]+1` to `sorted_indices[1]`)\n...\n`t_{k-1} = sorted_indices[k-2] - sorted_indices[k-3]` (problems from index `sorted_indices[k-3]+1` to `sorted_indices[k-2]`)\n`t_k = n - (sorted_indices[k-2] + 1)` (problems from index `sorted_indices[k-2]+1` to `n-1`)\n\nThis is for `k > 1`.\nFor `k=1`, `t_1 = n`.\n\nLet's re-apply with `sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]` (`k=3`):\n`t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n`t_2 = sorted_indices[1] - sorted_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`\n`t_3 = n - (sorted_indices[1] + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`\nResult: `[1, 3, 4]`. This is a valid answer.\n\nLet's test with another example: `n=4, k=2, a=[1, 2000, 2000, 2]`\n1. `a` with indices: `[(1,0), (2000,1), (2000,2), (2,3)]`\n2. Sort by difficulty (desc): `[(2000,1), (2000,2), (2,3), (1,0)]`\n3. Take top `k=2` elements: `[(2000,1), (2000,2)]`\n4. Max total profit: `2000 + 2000 = 4000`.\n5. Extract indices: `[1, 2]`.\n6. Sort indices: `sorted_indices = [1, 2]`.\n7. Calculate `t_j` values (`k=2`):\n   `t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n   `t_2 = n - (sorted_indices[0] + 1) = 4 - (1 + 1) = 4 - 2 = 2`\nResult: `[2, 2]`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems robust and correct.\nThe time complexity will be dominated by sorting the difficulties. If we store `(difficulty, index)` pairs and sort them, it's `O(N log N)`. Extracting `k` elements and their indices, then sorting indices, takes `O(k log k)`. Summing and calculating `t_j` values takes `O(k)`. Since `k \\le N`, the overall complexity is `O(N log N)`.\nGiven `N \\le 2000`, `N log N` is well within typical time limits (`2000 * log2(2000) approx 2000 * 11 = 22000` operations, which is very fast).\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n- `k=1`: `sorted_indices` will have one element, say `idx_0`.\n  `t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1 = idx_0 + 1`. This is wrong. For `k=1`, there's only one day, so all `n` problems are solved on that day. `t_1` must be `n`.\n  My formula: `t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1`. `t_k = n - (sorted_indices[k-2] + 1)`. If `k=1`, `k-2 = -1`, which is out of bounds.\n  So, special handling for `k=1`: `t_1 = n`.\n  For `k > 1`:\n    `t_1 = sorted_indices[0] + 1`\n    `t_j = sorted_indices[j-1] - sorted_indices[j-2]` for `j` from `2` to `k-1`.\n    `t_k = n - (sorted_indices[k-2] + 1)`\n\nRevised `t_j` calculation for `k > 1`:\n`t_values = []`\n`current_idx = 0`\nFor `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n  `end_idx_for_this_day = sorted_indices[i]`\n  `problems_on_this_day = end_idx_for_this_day - current_idx + 1`\n  `t_values.append(problems_on_this_day)`\n  `current_idx = end_idx_for_this_day + 1`\nThe last day:\n`problems_on_last_day = n - current_idx`\n`t_values.append(problems_on_last_day)`\n\nLet's re-test with `sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]` (`k=3`):\n`t_values = []`\n`current_idx = 0`\n`i = 0` (`k-2 = 1`, loop for `i=0, 1`):\n  `end_idx_for_this_day = sorted_indices[0] = 0`\n  `problems_on_this_day = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`\n  `t_values = [1]`\n  `current_idx = 0 + 1 = 1`\n`i = 1`:\n  `end_idx_for_this_day = sorted_indices[1] = 3`\n  `problems_on_this_day = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`\n  `t_values = [1, 3]`\n  `current_idx = 3 + 1 = 4`\nLast day:\n`problems_on_last_day = n - current_idx = 8 - 4 = 4`\n`t_values = [1, 3, 4]`. This is consistent.\n\nThis refined logic is correct for `k > 1`.\nFor `k=1`, simply print `n`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Pair difficulties with their original indices\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the original index doesn't matter for finding max profit\n    # but sorting by index ascending can provide a consistent tie-breaking for problem splits.\n    indexed_a.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the k largest difficulties and sum them for max profit\n    max_profit = 0\n    selected_indices = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        max_profit += indexed_a[i][0]\n        selected_indices.append(indexed_a[i][1]) # Store original index\n\n    # Step 4: Sort the selected indices in ascending order\n    # These indices will define the split points for days\n    selected_indices.sort()\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the number of problems for each day (t_j)\n    t_values = []\n    if k == 1:\n        t_values.append(n)\n    else:\n        current_problem_idx = 0\n        for i in range(k - 1):\n            # The (i+1)-th day ends at selected_indices[i]\n            # Problems covered are from current_problem_idx to selected_indices[i]\n            problems_on_this_day = selected_indices[i] - current_problem_idx + 1\n            t_values.append(problems_on_this_day)\n            current_problem_idx = selected_indices[i] + 1\n        \n        # The last day covers remaining problems\n        problems_on_last_day = n - current_problem_idx\n        t_values.append(problems_on_last_day)\n\n    # Output the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_profit) + '\\n')\n    sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, t_values)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
