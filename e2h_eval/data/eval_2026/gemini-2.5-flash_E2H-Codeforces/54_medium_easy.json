Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Optimal Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to find three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. My thought process starts with understanding the geometry: angles in a regular n-gon are inscribed angles on a circumcircle, related to the intercepted arc's measure.\n\nFixing one vertex (let's say vertex 1), I realize that the key is the number of edges on the arc between the other two vertices, excluding vertex 1. This number directly determines the inscribed angle. I'm exploring different ways to represent this relationship. Initially, I thought about using indices and calculating distances between vertices, but I realized that the \"wraparound\" nature of the polygon requires more careful consideration.\n\nI'm focused on expressing the angle in terms of 'k', which represents the number of edges on the arc not including vertex 1. The angle is simply  `k * (180/n)`. My goal is to find the 'k' that minimizes the absolute difference between this calculated angle and the target angle 'a'.\n\nTo optimize the search, I consider that the optimal 'k' should be close to `(a * n) / 180`. I generate two candidate 'k' values – the floor and ceiling of this target value – and make sure they are within the acceptable range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nFinally, after finding the optimal 'k', I choose my vertices. I fix vertex 2 as 1. Then `v1 = 2` and `v3 = 2 + best_k`. I am confident that this is a valid choice of vertices. The result of the code is the vertices that give me the closest approximation to the target angle 'a'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon:**\n1.  All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` of the polygon, where `v2` is the vertex of the angle, is an inscribed angle in the circumcircle.\n3.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n4.  In a regular `n`-gon, the arc between any two adjacent vertices subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\n5.  If an arc consists of `k` edges of the polygon, it subtends a central angle of `k * (360/n)` degrees.\n6.  Therefore, an inscribed angle that intercepts an arc of `k` edges will have a measure of `(k * (360/n)) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Angle Values:**\nFor `v1, v2, v3` to be distinct vertices, `v1` and `v3` must not be `v2`. Also, `v1` must not be `v3`.\nThe arc `v1-v3` (the one not containing `v2`) must consist of at least 1 edge and at most `n-2` edges.\n*   Minimum `k=1`: This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to each other, and `v2` is any other vertex. For example, if `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=3`. The arc `2-3` has 1 edge.\n*   Maximum `k=n-2`: This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the two vertices farthest from `v2` without passing through `v2`. For example, if `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=n`. The arc `2-n` (not containing 1) consists of vertices `2, 3, ..., n`, which is `n-1` vertices and thus `n-2` edges.\nSo, the number of edges `k` on the intercepted arc can be any integer from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles are `k * (180/n)` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal Angle:**\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`. The possible angles are `k * base_angle`.\nWe are looking for `k` such that `k * base_angle` is closest to `a`.\nThis means `k` should be close to `a / base_angle`. Let `k_target = a / base_angle`.\nSince `k` must be an integer, the optimal `k` will likely be `floor(k_target)` or `ceil(k_target)`.\n\nWe can check these two candidate `k` values (after ensuring they are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`) and determine which one yields the minimum difference.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `k_target = a / base_angle`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = infinity` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  Identify candidate `k` values:\n    *   `k_cand1 = floor(k_target)`\n    *   `k_cand2 = ceil(k_target)`\n6.  Create a list `possible_k_values`.\n    *   If `1 <= k_cand1 <= n-2`, add `int(k_cand1)` to `possible_k_values`.\n    *   If `1 <= k_cand2 <= n-2` and `k_cand2 != k_cand1`, add `int(k_cand2)` to `possible_k_values`.\n    (Note: Since `n >= 3`, `n-2 >= 1`. The range `[1, n-2]` always contains at least `k=1`. Thus, `possible_k_values` will never be empty.)\n7.  Iterate through `k` in `possible_k_values`:\n    *   Calculate `current_angle = k * base_angle`.\n    *   Calculate `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `current_diff < min_diff`:\n        *   Update `min_diff = current_diff`.\n        *   Update `best_k = k`.\n8.  **Outputting Vertices:**\n    To form an angle of `best_k * (180/n)` degrees, we need to choose `v1, v2, v3` such that the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) has `best_k` edges.\n    A simple choice is:\n    *   Let `v2 = 2`.\n    *   Let `v1 = 1`. (This is the vertex immediately counter-clockwise to `v2`).\n    *   Let `v3 = 2 + best_k`. (This is `best_k` steps clockwise from `v2`).\n    The arc `1-(2+best_k)` that does not contain `2` has `best_k` edges.\n    For example, if `v2=2`, `v1=1`, `v3=3`. Arc `1-3` (not containing 2) is just `1 -> n -> ... -> 3`. This is not `best_k` edges.\n\n    A simpler and correct choice for vertices `v1, v2, v3` is:\n    *   Fix `v2 = 2`.\n    *   Fix `v1 = 1`.\n    *   Then `v3` must be `(2 + best_k)`. This `v3` is `best_k` steps away from `v2` *in the direction opposite to `v1`*.\n    The vertices are `1, 2, ..., n`.\n    If `v2=2`, `v1=1`, then `v3` must be `2 + best_k`.\n    The arc intercepted by angle `1-2-(2+best_k)` is the arc from `1` to `(2+best_k)` that does *not* contain `2`.\n    This arc is `1 -> n -> (n-1) -> ... -> (2+best_k)`.\n    No, this is wrong. The arc is `(2+best_k) -> (2+best_k-1) -> ... -> 1`.\n    The number of edges on the arc `P_i P_j` (not containing `P_k`) is `|i-j|` if `P_k` is outside the segment `P_i P_j`.\n    Let's pick `v2 = 1`.\n    Let `v1 = 2`.\n    Then `v3` should be `2 + best_k`.\n    The angle `2-1-(2+best_k)` intercepts the arc from `2` to `(2+best_k)` that does not contain `1`.\n    The vertices on this arc are `2, 3, ..., (2+best_k)`.\n    The number of edges is `(2+best_k) - 2 = best_k`.\n    This choice is valid: `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=(2+best_k)`.\n    All three vertices are distinct: `1`, `2` (since `n >= 3`), and `2+best_k` (since `best_k >= 1`, `2+best_k >= 3`, so it's distinct from 1 and 2).\n    And `2+best_k <= 2 + (n-2) = n`, so `v3` is a valid vertex index.\n    The output format is `v1 v2 v3`. So we print `2 1 (2+best_k)`.\n\n**Example:** `n=4, a=68`\n1.  `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n2.  `k_target = 68 / 45.0 = 1.511...`\n3.  `k_cand1 = floor(1.511...) = 1`\n4.  `k_cand2 = ceil(1.511...) = 2`\n5.  Valid range for `k` is `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`. Both `1` and `2` are valid.\n    `possible_k_values = [1, 2]`\n6.  Check `k=1`:\n    `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`\n    `current_diff = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`\n    `min_diff = 23.0`, `best_k = 1`\n7.  Check `k=2`:\n    `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`\n    `current_diff = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`\n    Since `22.0 < 23.0`:\n    `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 2`\n8.  Final `best_k = 2`.\n9.  Output vertices: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(2+2)=4`. Print `2 1 4`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    base_angle_per_edge = 180.0 / n\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # Calculate target k value\n    # k * (180/n) should be close to 'a'\n    # k should be close to a / (180/n) = (a * n) / 180\n    k_target = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n    # Consider integer k values around k_target\n    # k must be in the range [1, n-2]\n    \n    possible_k_values = []\n\n    # Check k_floor\n    k_floor = math.floor(k_target)\n    if 1 <= k_floor <= n - 2:\n        possible_k_values.append(int(k_floor))\n\n    # Check k_ceil (only if different from k_floor to avoid redundant calculation)\n    k_ceil = math.ceil(k_target)\n    if 1 <= k_ceil <= n - 2 and k_ceil != k_floor:\n        possible_k_values.append(int(k_ceil))\n\n    # Iterate through the selected candidate k values to find the best one\n    for k in possible_k_values:\n        current_angle = k * base_angle_per_edge\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        \n        # If current_diff is strictly smaller, update best_k.\n        # If current_diff is equal, the problem allows any optimal solution,\n        # so we keep the first one found (which implicitly prefers the k that was processed first).\n        if current_diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Construct the vertices for the output.\n    # We choose v2 = 1 (any vertex can be the angle's vertex).\n    # We choose v1 = 2 (the vertex immediately clockwise to v2).\n    # We choose v3 = 2 + best_k.\n    # This forms an angle 2-1-(2+best_k).\n    # The intercepted arc (2 to 2+best_k, not containing 1) has exactly 'best_k' edges.\n    # This choice ensures v1, v2, v3 are distinct and within bounds:\n    # v2=1. v1=2 (since n>=3, 1!=2).\n    # v3=2+best_k.
