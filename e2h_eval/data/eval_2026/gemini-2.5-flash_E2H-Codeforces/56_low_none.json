Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem, and it's a classic matching problem with a geometric twist.  My initial thought is to break down the key parts.  First, the input: we've got Rebel spaceships (`R`) and bases (`B`) with 2D coordinates. The core requirement is a one-to-one assignment of ships to bases *without* any intersecting connecting lines.  The problem states \"perfect matching\", so `R` must equal `B` for a solution to even be possible. If they're not equal, it's an immediate \"No\". This is a really important early check.\n\nThe non-intersection constraint is where the geometric part comes in. We need a way to efficiently determine if two line segments intersect. This screams \"orientation test\" to me. I recall from computational geometry that segments `AB` and `CD` intersect if and only if: `A` and `B` are on opposite sides of the line `CD`, *and* `C` and `D` are on opposite sides of `AB`.  This can be elegantly checked using cross products (or the equivalent `orientation` function). The formula `orientation(A, B, C) * orientation(A, B, D) < 0` AND `orientation(C, D, A) * orientation(C, D, B) < 0` should do the trick, given that no three points are collinear. This simplifies our calculations.\n\nNow, the crucial detail is the small constraint on `R` and `B`: they are at most 10.  That's a massive hint! With `N = 10`, `N!` permutations is definitely manageable. It means I can probably brute-force this.\n\nMy plan is clear:\n\n1.  Check if `R == B`. If not, \"No\".\n2.  Generate all permutations of assigning Rebel ships to bases. With `N = 10`, `10!` is within feasible limits.\n3.  For each permutation:\n    *   Form the segments based on the current assignment.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of segments and use the orientation test to check for any intersections. If any two intersect, reject this permutation.\n    *   If no intersections are found, we've got a valid assignment! Output \"Yes\".\n\nThis brute-force approach seems totally reasonable given the problem constraints. I should be able to write a pretty straightforward Python script to execute this strategy.\n",
