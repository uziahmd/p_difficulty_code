            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Card Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. Vanya has a bunch of cards with numbers on them, and he wants to end up with a total sum of zero. The catch? He can find new cards, but each new card's value has to be within a certain range, from -x to x.  My goal is to figure out the minimum number of new cards Vanya needs.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the current situation. I'll sum up all the numbers on the cards Vanya already has. Let's call this sum 'S'. The target sum is zero, so the \"difference\" I need to cover is 0 - S, or simply -S.  That's the sum I'm trying to achieve with new cards.\n\nNow, to minimize the number of new cards, I need to maximize the *contribution* of each new card.  Each card value can range from -x to x. If the difference is zero (S is already zero), then I don't need any cards. Done.\n\nIf -S isn't zero, it gets interesting. If -S is positive, I want to add *positive* values, and the *biggest* positive value I can add is 'x'. If -S is negative, I want to add *negative* values, and the *smallest* negative value I can add is '-x'. In either case, I'm trying to add cards with absolute value 'x'. Let's call the target sum needed 'T'.  If T is positive, I use x. If T is negative, I use -x.\n\nTo get the *minimum* number of cards, I need to figure out how many cards with value 'x' (or '-x') are required to reach the absolute value of the target difference.  It seems the calculation is `ceil(abs(T) / x)`.  I'll need to round up to ensure I reach or surpass the required sum. A quick check confirms this is indeed the case. So, that `ceil(abs(-S) / x)` is the solution!\n",
    "response": "The goal is to make the sum of all cards equal to zero.\nFirst, calculate the sum of the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\nVanya needs to find additional cards such that their sum, when added to `S`, results in 0. This means the sum of the additional cards must be `-S`.\n\nLet `target_sum_needed = -S`.\n\nTo minimize the number of additional cards, Vanya should choose cards that contribute the maximum possible absolute value towards `target_sum_needed`. The maximum absolute value a card can have is `x`.\n\nIf `target_sum_needed` is positive, Vanya should choose cards with value `x`.\nIf `target_sum_needed` is negative, Vanya should choose cards with value `-x`.\nIf `target_sum_needed` is zero, Vanya doesn't need any more cards.\n\nIn general, each additional card can contribute at most `x` to the absolute value of the sum.\nSo, we need to find how many times `x` fits into `abs(target_sum_needed)`.\n\nLet `abs_target_sum_needed = abs(target_sum_needed)`.\nThe minimum number of cards required is `ceil(abs_target_sum_needed / x)`.\nThis can be calculated using integer division as `(abs_target_sum_needed + x - 1) // x` for positive `abs_target_sum_needed`, or simply `abs_target_sum_needed // x` if `abs_target_sum_needed` is a multiple of `x`, and `abs_target_sum_needed // x + 1` otherwise. A more concise way for positive integers is `(abs_target_sum_needed + x - 1) // x`.\n\nIf `abs_target_sum_needed` is 0, the result is 0 cards. The formula `(0 + x - 1) // x` would give `(x-1)//x`, which is 0 for `x >= 1`. So this formula works for 0 as well.\n\n**Example 1:**\nn = 3, x = 2\nCards: -1, 1, 2\nCurrent sum `S = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n`target_sum_needed = -S = -2`.\n`abs_target_sum_needed = abs(-2) = 2`.\nMinimum cards = `(2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`.\nVanya needs 1 card with value -2. This is valid since `abs(-2) <= x` (i.e., `2 <= 2`).\n\n**Example 2:**\nn = 2, x = 3\nCards: -2, -2\nCurrent sum `S = -2 + (-2) = -4`.\n`target_sum_needed = -S = 4`.\n`abs_target_sum_needed = abs(4) = 4`.\nMinimum cards = `(4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2`.\nVanya needs 2 cards. He can use two cards with value 2 (since `abs(2) <= x`, i.e., `2 <= 3`). `2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    cards = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # The sum of additional cards needed is -current_sum\n    target_sum_needed = -current_sum\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, no cards are needed\n    if target_sum_needed == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the absolute value of the sum needed\n    abs_target_sum_needed = abs(target_sum_needed)\n\n    # Each additional card can contribute at most 'x' to the absolute sum.\n    # To find the minimum number of cards, we divide the absolute sum needed\n    # by 'x' and take the ceiling.\n    # Using integer division, ceil(a/b) can be calculated as (a + b - 1) // b\n    # for positive integers a and b.\n    \n    min_cards = (abs_target_sum_needed + x - 1) // x\n    \n    print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
