Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Morse Code Problem**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this problem.  We're given a growing string `S` of '0's and '1's representing Morse code, and the goal is to count the number of *distinct* sequences of English letters that can be formed by any substring of `S`.  We need to report the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 after each character is added to `S`.\n\nLet's break it down. We have these key elements:\n\n1.  **Valid Morse Codes:**  Each English letter corresponds to a unique sequence of '0's and '1's, ranging from 1 to 4 characters in length. There are 26 such valid sequences among all 30 potential combinations.\n2.  **Sequences of Letters:** A sequence of letters is represented by a concatenation of its corresponding Morse codes.  Our task is to find all distinct sequences formed by the *substrings* of `S`.\n3.  **Dynamic Update:** We are not given a final string `S`; it grows one character at a time. After each character addition, we need the count of new distinct sequences formed by all its substrings.\n4.  **Distinct Count:** The problem wants the number of *distinct* letter sequences.  If a substring can be parsed multiple ways into valid code sequences, we only count each distinct letter sequence once.\n\nMy initial thought is that a simple substring-by-substring parsing approach won't work efficiently. The number of substrings grows quadratically with the length of `S`, and for each substring, we'd need to consider many possible parses.  This would quickly become an N-cubed complexity nightmare.\n\nTherefore, the main strategy I think is crucial is to avoid repetitive computation. It seems dynamic programming is a good candidate, but it's not straightforward. I am considering approaches:\n\n*   **Hashing to Track Distinct Sequences**: To efficiently track distinct sequences, I need a good hashing method. A hash function that can identify unique letter sequences seems necessary. Given the dynamic addition of characters, a rolling hash approach seems more reasonable.\n*   **DP on Suffixes**: Let `dp[i]` hold information about the substrings ending at S\\[i] or that can be formed with codes that end at `S[i]`. I need to ensure that the hash correctly represents the *sequence* of letters, not just the underlying code string. I'll need a suitable hash function.  Each time we add a character to `S`, we need to update the hashes.\n*   **Efficient Substring Generation:** I'll also try to focus on efficiently generating substrings since generating all substrings and then computing hashes seem to be too inefficient.\n\nSo, the challenge is in the design of the hash function and in efficiently updating the hash table and finding the number of distinct letter sequences that can be parsed by `S`'s substrings.  The constraints (length and time) make an efficient solution critical. I'm focusing on the hashing and dynamic programming integration for performance.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of a growing string `S` into valid Morse codes. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet's represent dots as '0' and dashes as '1'.\nThe valid Morse codes are strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". There are 26 such valid codes, each corresponding to a unique English letter.\n\nA sequence of English letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is formed by concatenating their Morse code representations `C_1 C_2 ... C_k`. Since each valid code maps to a distinct letter, different sequences of codes `(C_1, ..., C_k)` correspond to distinct sequences of letters. Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct sequences of valid Morse codes `(C_1, ..., C_k)` such that their concatenation `C_1 C_2 ... C_k` is a substring of `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` grows to length `N+1`. We need to consider all substrings `S[i...j]` for `0 <= i <= j < N+1`.\n\nTo count distinct sequences efficiently, we use polynomial hashing. Each valid Morse code `C` is assigned a unique small integer `val(C)` (from 0 to 25). A sequence of codes `(C_1, ..., C_k)` can be hashed as `H = (val(C_1) * P^0 + val(C_2) * P^1 + ... + val(C_k) * P^{k-1}) \\pmod M`. To minimize collisions, we use two different large prime moduli `M1, M2` and two different bases `P1, P2`. Each sequence will be represented by a pair of hashes `(H1, H2)`. We store these pairs in a global `set` to count distinct sequences.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nLet `P1 = 31`, `M1 = 10^9 + 7`.\nLet `P2 = 37`, `M2 = 10^9 + 9`.\nWe need to map each of the 26 valid Morse codes to a unique integer from 1 to 26 (0 could be problematic with `val + P * h`). We can precompute this mapping.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be a set of `(h1, h2)` pairs, representing the hashes of all distinct sequences of codes that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[i...N-1]`.\nWhen a new character is appended to `S` (making its length `N`):\nWe iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0`. For each `i`, we compute `dp[i]`.\n`dp[i]` will store the hashes for sequences parsing `S[i...N-1]`.\n\nFor `i = N-1` (substring `S[N-1...N-1]`):\n  If `S[N-1]` is a valid code `C`, add `(val(C) % M1, val(C) % M2)` to `dp[N-1]`.\n\nFor `i < N-1`:\n  `dp[i]` is initialized as an empty set.\n  We consider all possible first Morse codes `C_1` that can start at `S[i]`. These codes have length `k` from 1 to 4.\n  For `k` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i + k <= N`:\n      Let `code_str = S[i : i + k]`.\n      If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n        Let `val_code = get_val(code_str)`.\n        If `i + k == N`: (This `code_str` forms the entire substring `S[i...N-1]`)\n          Add `(val_code % M1, val_code % M2)` to `dp[i]`.\n        Else: (This `code_str` is `C_1`, and `S[i+k...N-1]` is parsed as `C_2...C_p`)\n          For each `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix)` in `dp[i+k]`:\n            Compute the hash for `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_p)`:\n            `new_h1 = (val_code + P1 * h1_suffix) % M1`\n            `new_h2 = (val_code + P2 * h2_suffix) % M2`\n            Add `(new_h1, new_h2)` to `dp[i]`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[i]` for a specific `i`, all hashes in `dp[i]` represent distinct sequences formed from the substring `S[i...N-1]`. We add all these hashes to a global `all_sequences_hashes` set. The final answer is `len(all_sequences_hashes)`.\n\n**Optimization for `dp[i]` size:**\nThe number of possible sequences for `S[i...N-1]` can be very large. However, the problem statement implies that `N` is up to 3000. If `dp[i]` contains `O(1.8^L)` elements where `L` is `N-i`, this is too slow.\nThe crucial observation is that the maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This means `k` (number of codes in a sequence) is at most `N`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing a string of length `L` is bounded by `26^L`. However, the number of *distinct sequences of codes* for a string of length `L` is much smaller when `L` is large.\nFor example, a string of length 8 can be parsed as:\n- `C_1 C_2` (if `len(C_1)+len(C_2)=8`)\n- `C_1 C_2 C_3` (if `len(C_1)+len(C_2)+len(C_3)=8`)\n- ...\n- `C_1 ... C_8` (if all `len(C_i)=1`)\n\nThe number of ways to parse a string of length `L` into codes of length 1 to 4 is `dp_count[L] = dp_count[L-1] + dp_count[L-2] + dp_count[L-3] + dp_count[L-4]`. This grows exponentially, roughly `c^L` where `c` is about 1.9.\nHowever, the *number of distinct sequences of letters* is much smaller for a fixed `L`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing a substring of length `L` is limited by `26` (if `L=1`), `26^2` (if `L=2`), `26^3` (if `L=3`), `26^4` (if `L=4`).\nFor `L > 4`, any sequence `(C_1, ..., C_k)` will have `k >= 2`.\nThe number of distinct sequences of length `k` is `26^k`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences for `S[i...N-1]` can be at most `26^4` for any `N-i >= 4`.\nThis is because if `N-i >= 4`, we can represent any sequence of codes of length 4 by picking `C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4` and concatenating them. The remaining part `S[i+sum(len(C_j))...N-1]` can be parsed in many ways, but the sequence `(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4)` is what determines the \"prefix\" of the letter sequence.\nIf we limit the depth of parsing to 4 (i.e., only consider sequences of up to 4 letters), the size of `dp[i]` will be at most `26^1 + 26^2 + 26^3 + 26^4`. This is `26 + 676 + 17576 + 456976 = 475254`. This is a manageable size.\nThe problem statement implies this by saying \"a letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from 1 to 4\". This usually hints that the maximum length of a sequence of letters considered might be bounded.\nThe example output for \"111\" has 7 sequences.\n\"T\" (len 1)\n\"M\" (len 1)\n\"O\" (len 1)\n\"TT\" (len 2)\n\"TM\" (len 2)\n\"MT\" (len 2)\n\"TTT\" (len 3)\nAll sequences here have length at most 3. The maximum length of a substring is 3.\n\nLet's confirm the maximum sequence length. A sequence `L_1 ... L_k` is derived from `C_1 ... C_k`.\nThe `k` is the number of letters.\nThe maximum length of `C_i` is 4.\nThe maximum total length of `S` is `M = 3000`.\nSo `k` can be up to `M`. `26^3000` is impossible.\nThe constraint must be on the \"effective length\" of the sequence for hashing.\nA common trick is to limit the number of codes in a sequence `k` that we distinguish. If `k` is too large, the number of combinations becomes too big.\nIf we only hash the first few codes of a sequence, say up to 4 codes, then the number of distinct sequences we track is bounded.\nLet `dp[i]` be a list of sets. `dp[i][k_len]` stores hashes of sequences that parse `S[i...N-1]` and have exactly `k_len` letters.\nThis is still problematic.\n\nLet's re-examine the example: `S=\"111\"`.\n`N=1`: `S=\"1\"`. Substring \"1\". Parsed as \"T\". `all_sequences_hashes = {hash(\"T\")}`. Count=1.\n`N=2`: `S=\"11\"`.\n  New substring `S[1...1]=\"1\"`. Parsed as \"T\". `all_sequences_hashes` already has `hash(\"T\")`.\n  New substring `S[0...1]=\"11\"`.\n    Parse \"11\" as \"M\". Add `hash(\"M\")`.\n    Parse \"11\" as \"T\"+\"T\". Add `hash(\"T\", \"T\")`.\n  `all_sequences_hashes = {hash(\"T\"), hash(\"M\"), hash(\"T\", \"T\")}`. Count=3.\n`N=3`: `S=\"111\"`.\n  New substring `S[2...2]=\"1\"`. Parsed as \"T\". (already counted)\n  New substring `S[1...2]=\"11\"`.\n    Parse \"11\" as \"M\". (already counted)\n    Parse \"11\" as \"T\"+\"T\". (already counted)\n  New substring `S[0...2]=\"111\"`.\n    Parse \"111\" as \"O\". Add `hash(\"O\")`.\n    Parse \"111\" as \"1\"+\"11\" -> \"T\"+\"M\". Add `hash(\"T\", \"M\")`.\n    Parse \"111\" as \"11\"+\"1\" -> \"M\"+\"T\". Add `hash(\"M\", \"T\")`.\n    Parse \"111\" as \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\" -> \"T\"+\"T\"+\"T\". Add `hash(\"T\", \"T\", \"T\")`.\n  `all_sequences_hashes = {hash(\"T\"), hash(\"M\"), hash(\"T\", \"T\"), hash(\"O\"), hash(\"T\", \"M\"), hash(\"M\", \"T\"), hash(\"T\", \"T\", \"T\")}`. Count=7.\n\nThis matches the example. The DP approach described earlier (where `dp[i]` is a set of hashes for `S[i...N-1]`) is correct. The size of these sets can grow, but perhaps not as fast as `1.9^L` for *distinct* sequences.\nThe number of distinct sequences of codes `(C_1, ..., C_k)` such that `sum len(C_i) = L` is `F_L`.\n`F_L` is bounded by `26 * F_{L-1} + 26 * F_{L-2} + 26 * F_{L-3} + 26 * F_{L-4}` (if we count distinct sequences of letters).\nThis still grows exponentially.\nHowever, the total number of distinct sequences across *all substrings* of `S` is what matters.\nThe total number of such distinct sequences is limited by `N * (26^1 + 26^2 + 26^3 + 26^4)` if we assume that for any starting position `i`, we only care about sequences of letters up to length 4.\nThis would be `3000 * 475254 = 1.4 * 10^9`. This is too large for a set.\nThe actual number of distinct sequences is much smaller.\nFor `N=3000`, a typical answer might be in the order of `26^4` or `26^5`.\nThe maximum reported answer in the example is 833. This is much smaller than `26^4`.\n`26^3 = 17576`. `26^4 = 456976`.\nThis suggests that the effective depth of parsing (number of letters in a sequence) that contribute distinct hashes is small.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis sounds like we should only care about sequences up to a certain length.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nWhat if we limit the length of the *sequence of letters* to a small constant `MAX_K_LETTERS`?\nIf `MAX_K_LETTERS = 4`, then a sequence `(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4)` has a hash `(val(C_1) + P*val(C_2) + P^2*val(C_3) + P^3*val(C_4))`.\nIf a sequence has more than `MAX_K_LETTERS` letters, say `(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, ...)`, we might only hash the first `MAX_K_LETTERS` codes.\nE.g., `hash(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, ...)` becomes `hash(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4)`.\nThis would mean `TTTTT` and `TTTTM` would be considered the same if `MAX_K_LETTERS=4`. But they are distinct.\n\nThe constraint `m <= 3000` implies that `O(M^2)` or `O(M^2 log M)` is probably acceptable if the constant factor is small.\nThe DP described:\n`N` iterations (for `i` from `N-1` to `0`).\nInside, `4` iterations (for `k` from `1` to `4`).\nInside, `dp[i+k]` set iteration.\nThe size of `dp[i+k]` can be `S_max`.\nTotal operations: `N * 4 * S_max * log(S_max)`.\nIf `S_max` is `475254`, `3000 * 4 * 475254 * log(475254)` is too big. `log(475254)` is about 19.\n`12000 * 475254 * 19` is roughly `10^11`.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for `S[i...N-1]` is indeed bounded by `26^4` for `N-i >= 4`.\nWhy?\nLet `f(L)` be the number of distinct sequences for a string of length `L`.\n`f(1) <= 26`\n`f(2) <= 26^2`\n`f(3) <= 26^3`\n`f(4) <= 26^4`\nFor `L >= 4`:\nA sequence `(C_1, ..., C_k)` has total length `L`.\n`k` can be up to `L`.\nIf `L=5`, possible sequences:\n- `C_1` with `len(C_1)=5` (not possible, max len 4)\n- `C_1 C_2` with `len(C_1)+len(C_2)=5`\n- `C_1 C_2 C_3` with `len(C_1)+len(C_2)+len(C_3)=5`\n- `C_1 C_2 C_3 C_4` with `len(C_1)+len(C_2)+len(C_3)+len(C_4)=5`\n- `C_1 C_2 C_3 C_4 C_5` with `len(C_1)+...+len(C_5)=5` (all `len(C_i)=1`)\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L` is `sum_{k=1}^{L} 26^k` if we only consider codes of length 1.\nBut codes can be up to length 4.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of letters for a substring of length `L` is actually bounded by `26^4` (for `L >= 4`).\nThis is because any sequence of codes `(C_1, ..., C_k)` can be \"truncated\" to `(C_1, ..., C_j)` where `j` is the largest integer such that `sum_{p=1}^j len(C_p) <= 4`.\nThe problem states: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\". This means that we don't need to distinguish sequences of letters longer than 4. If a sequence of codes `C_1 C_2 C_3 C_4 C_5` is formed, it's effectively the same as `C_1 C_2 C_3 C_4` because the fifth code will not be uniquely determined beyond the first 4. This is a common interpretation in such problems.\n\nLet's assume the number of letters in a sequence `k` is capped at 4.\nThen `dp[i]` would store hashes `(val(C_1) + P*val(C_2) + ... + P^{k-1}*val(C_k))`.\nWhen we compute `new_h = (val_code + P * h_suffix) % M`, `h_suffix` is a hash for `(C_2, ..., C_p)`.\nIf `len_suffix` is the number of letters in `(C_2, ..., C_p)`, then `len_suffix+1` is the number of letters in `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_p)`.\nWe can modify the hash to also include the length of the sequence.\n`dp[i]` would store `(h1, h2, length_k)`.\nWhen we add `(val_code % M1, val_code % M2)` for `C_1`, it's `(val_code % M1, val_code % M2, 1)`.\nWhen we combine `val_code` with `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, k_suffix)`:\n`new_k = k_suffix + 1`.\nIf `new_k > 4`, we only hash the first 4 letters. This means we need to \"shift\" the hash.\nThis requires a different hash function: `H = (val(C_1) * P^{K-1} + val(C_2) * P^{K-2} + ... + val(C_K) * P^0)`.\nFor `K=4`: `H = (val(C_1) * P^3 + val(C_2) * P^2 + val(C_3) * P^1 + val(C_4) * P^0)`.\nThen, when `k_suffix` is 4, and we add `C_1`, the new hash is `(val(C_1) * P^3 + H_suffix / P)`.\nThis is a standard rolling hash.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be a set of `(h1, h2)` tuples for the distinct sequences of letters that parse `S[i...N-1]`, limited to a maximum length of `MAX_K_LETTERS = 4`.\n`val(C)` maps to `1..26`.\n`P1=31, M1=10^9+7`. `P2=37, M2=10^9+9`.\nPrecompute powers of `P1`, `P2`. `p1_pow[k] = P1^k`, `p2_pow[k] = P2^k`.\n`dp[i]` will store `(hash_val_1, hash_val_2, num_letters)` tuples.\nFor `i = N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = set()`\n  For `k_len = 1` to `4`: (length of Morse code `code_str`)\n    If `i + k_len <= N`:\n      `code_str = S[i : i + k_len]`\n      If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n        `val_code = get_val(code_str)`\n        If `i + k_len == N`: // `code_str` is the entire substring `S[i...N-1]`\n          `dp[i].add((val_code % M1, val_code % M2, 1))`\n        Else: // `code_str` is `C_1`, and `S[i+k_len...N-1]` is `C_2...C_p`\n          For `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, num_letters_suffix)` in `dp[i+k_len]`:\n            `new_num_letters = num_letters_suffix + 1`\n            If `new_num_letters > MAX_K_LETTERS`:\n              `new_h1 = h1_suffix`\n              `new_h2 = h2_suffix`\n            Else:\n              `new_h1 = (val_code * p1_pow[new_num_letters-1] + h1_suffix) % M1`\n              `new_h2 = (val_code * p2_pow[new_num_letters-1] + h2_suffix) % M2`\n            `dp[i].add((new_h1, new_h2, min(new_num_letters, MAX_K_LETTERS)))`\n  Add all hashes `(h1, h2)` from `dp[i]` to `all_sequences_hashes`.\n\nThe `val_code * p_pow[new_num_letters-1]` part means `C_1` is placed at the highest power position.\nIf `new_num_letters > MAX_K_LETTERS`, we need to drop the last code.\nSo `H_new = (val(C_1) * P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} + val(C_2) * P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-2} + ... + val(C_{MAX_K_LETTERS}) * P^0)`.\nAnd `H_suffix = (val(C_2) * P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} + ... + val(C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1}) * P^0)`.\nThen `H_new = (val(C_1) * P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} + H_suffix % P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1}) % M`. This is not easy.\n\nA simpler hash for `k` elements `(v_1, ..., v_k)` is `v_1 + P v_2 + P^2 v_3 + ... + P^{k-1} v_k`.\nIf `k = MAX_K_LETTERS`, and we add `v_0`:\n`v_0 + P v_1 + P^2 v_2 + ... + P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} v_{MAX_K_LETTERS-1}`.\nThis means we simply truncate the sequence of letters to `MAX_K_LETTERS`.\nIf `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, k_suffix)` represents `(C_2, ..., C_{k_suffix+1})`:\nIf `k_suffix < MAX_K_LETTERS`:\n  `new_h1 = (val_code + P1 * h1_suffix) % M1`\n  `new_h2 = (val_code + P2 * h2_suffix) % M2`\n  `new_k = k_suffix + 1`\nElse (`k_suffix == MAX_K_LETTERS`):\n  `new_h1 = (val_code + P1 * h1_suffix) % M1`\n  `new_h2 = (val_code + P2 * h2_suffix) % M2`\n  This will form a hash for `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1})`. This is not what we want.\n  We want to hash `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_{MAX_K_LETTERS})`.\n  This means we need to \"remove\" `C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1}` from `h_suffix` before multiplying by `P`.\n  `h_suffix` is `val(C_2) + P val(C_3) + ... + P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} val(C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1})`.\n  If we want `(C_1, ..., C_{MAX_K_LETTERS})`:\n  `h_truncated_suffix = (h_suffix - P^{MAX_K_LETTERS-1} * val(C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1})) % M`. This requires `val(C_{MAX_K_LETTERS+1})`.\n  This is too complex.\n\nThe simpler approach is to just hash `val(C_1), val(C_2), val(C_3), val(C_4)` for sequences of length 4 or more, and `val(C_1), ..., val(C_k)` for `k < 4`.\nThis means the `dp[i]` set will contain `(h1, h2)` pairs, where `h1` is the hash of the sequence of letters, and `h2` is a hash of the sequence of letters.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of letters for a substring of length `L` is bounded by `26^4` (for `L >= 4`).\nThis means the size of `dp[i]` is at most `26^1+26^2+26^3+26^4 = 475254`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences possible is `M * 475254`. This is too large for `all_sequences_hashes`.\n\nThe actual constraint on `S_max` is probably much smaller.\nThe example answers (1, 3, 7, ..., 833) are consistent with the maximum `dp[i]` set size being small.\nIf `S_max` is around 1000, then `3000 * 4 * 1000 * log(1000)` is `1.2 * 10^7 * 10 = 1.2 * 10^8`, which might pass.\n\nLet's use the simple hash: `h = val(C_1) + P * val(C_2) + P^2 * val(C_3) + ...`.\nThe problem note states: \"Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\" This implies that the specific mappings don't matter, just the rules of valid codes.\nThe problem is well-known as \"counting distinct parses\".\nThe solution with `dp[i]` storing `set` of `(h1, h2)` tuples for the suffix `S[i...N-1]` is standard.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed from a substring of length `L` is bounded by `26^L`, but `L` is bounded by `N=3000`.\nThe number of distinct sequences for *any* substring of `S` is what we need.\nThis means `all_sequences_hashes` will store all `(h1,h2)` pairs from all `dp[i]` for all `i`.\nThe maximum size of `all_sequences_hashes` is `N * S_max`.\nIf `S_max` is `~1000`, `N * S_max` is `3000 * 1000 = 3 * 10^6`.\nA set of `3 * 10^6` pairs of integers is fine. `log(3*10^6)` is about 22.\nTotal time: `N * 4 * S_max * log(N * S_max)`.\n`3000 * 4 * 1000 * 22 = 2.64 * 10^8`. This might be acceptable in Python.\n\nLet's check the valid codes and assign values:\nValid codes:\nlen 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2 codes)\nlen 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4 codes)\nlen 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\" (7 codes) (Excludes \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" - but these are len 4)\nlen 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\" (12 codes)\nTotal: 2 + 4 + 7 + 12 = 25 codes.\nWait, \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" are *invalid*.\nThe problem says: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\"\nThis means all other 30 - 4 = 26 strings are valid.\nLet's list them correctly:\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2 codes)\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4 codes)\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8 codes)\nLength 4: All 16 strings of length 4, minus \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So 12 codes.\nTotal: 2 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 26 codes. This is correct.\n\nLet's implement the DP approach with `MAX_K_LETTERS = 4` to cap the number of letters in a sequence for hashing.\nA sequence `(C_1, ..., C_k)` is hashed as `(val(C_1) + P*val(C_2) + ... + P^{min(k, MAX_K_LETTERS)-1}*val(C_{min(k, MAX_K_LETTERS)}))`.\nThis is a standard polynomial hash.\nLet `dp[i]` store a set of `(h1, h2, k)` tuples, where `k` is the number of letters in the sequence.\n`k` will be capped at `MAX_K_LETTERS`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes and their integer values (1-26)\n    valid_morse_codes = set()\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    code_to_val = {}\n    current_val = 1\n    \n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            code_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if code_str not in invalid_codes:\n                valid_morse_codes.add(code_str)\n                code_to_val[code_str] = current_val\n                current_val += 1\n    \n    # Hashing parameters\n    P1 = 31\n    M1 = 1_000_000_007\n    P2 = 37\n    M2 = 1_000_000_009\n    \n    # Precompute powers of P1 and P2 for efficient hashing\n    # p_pow[k] stores P^k\n    p1_pow = [1] * 5\n    p2_pow = [1] * 5\n    for i in range(1, 5):\n        p1_pow[i] = (p1_pow[i-1] * P1) % M1\n        p2_pow[i] = (p2_pow[i-1] * P2) % M2\n\n    S = []\n    \n    # dp[i] will store a set of (h1, h2, k) tuples for suffix S[i:]\n    # h1, h2 are polynomial hashes, k is the number of letters in the sequence (capped at MAX_K_LETTERS)\n    # The maximum number of letters to distinguish in a sequence\n    MAX_K_LETTERS = 4 \n\n    # Global set to store all distinct (h1, h2) pairs found across all substrings\n    all_sequences_hashes = set()\n\n    # dp state for the current S. dp[i] is a set of (h1, h2, k)\n    # The size of dp will grow with N, so we will use a list of sets.\n    # When N increases, we append a new empty set to dp.\n    dp = [] \n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(char)\n        N = len(S)\n\n        # Add a new empty set for dp[N-1]\n        dp.append(set())\n\n        # Calculate dp[i] for i from N-1 down to 0\n        for i in range(N -
