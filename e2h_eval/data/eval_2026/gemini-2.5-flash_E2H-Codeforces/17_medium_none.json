He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My current train of thought is focused on solving the \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" programming problem in Python.** I start by meticulously breaking down the problem's requirements: input (n, 2n-2 strings), output (a string of 'P's and 'S's), and the problem's core constraint that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of a single unknown string, *s*.\n\nThe key realization is that we can reconstruct *s* from its longest prefix (length n-1) and longest suffix (length n-1).  I deduce that among the given strings, there will be exactly two strings of length n-1.  One must be a prefix, and the other a suffix.  My brain works through the logic of two potential scenarios: where the first of these long strings is the prefix, or where it's the suffix, and then I work out the implications of each assignment. Crucially, I notice that the problem's guarantee ensures at least one scenario will work.\n\nThe critical insight is the need for consistency: the longest prefix (minus its first character) must overlap and exactly match the longest suffix (minus its last character).  This leads to the crucial comparison: `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]` or `L2[1:] == L1[:-1]`. If this test passes, I have my candidate string, which I carefully derive by concatenating the first character of the prefix string, then the suffix string. If I can validate a string, I do that.\n\nMy next task is to manage duplicates of substrings. To handle multiple, identical prefixes or suffixes (like in the case of \"aaa\"), I have determined that I can store the original indices of the strings. Then I can use a Counter to track my prefixes and suffixes as I build my result string of 'P's and 'S's.\n\nNext, I worked through the logic needed to build a working function. With a working function, I will be able to test my code thoroughly. I then consider the code's implementation: reading input, storing strings, finding the longest strings, testing for overlap and consistency, constructing `s` by matching all the given string. The final step is to translate my thought process into code. I'm focusing on efficiency as well, given the problem's constraints. I feel confident that this approach will be both correct and efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of the given `2n-2` strings, whether it is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are given that these `2n-2` strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths `1` to `n-1`), and that for each length `L` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one prefix and one suffix. We are guaranteed that a consistent string `s` exists.\n\nThe core idea to solve this problem is to reconstruct the original string `s`. The longest improper prefix has length `n-1`, and is `s[0...n-2]`. The longest improper suffix also has length `n-1`, and is `s[1...n-1]`. Among the `2n-2` input strings, there will be exactly two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call them `str_A` and `str_B`.\n\nThere are two possibilities for how `str_A` and `str_B` relate to `s`:\n1.  `str_A` is `s[0...n-2]` (the prefix of length `n-1`), and `str_B` is `s[1...n-1]` (the suffix of length `n-1`).\n2.  `str_B` is `s[0...n-2]`, and `str_A` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's consider Case 1. If `str_A` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str_B` is `s[1...n-1]`:\n*   The full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str_A[0] + str_B`. (The first character of `str_A` followed by `str_B`).\n*   For this to be a valid reconstruction, the substring `str_A[1...n-2]` (which is `s[1...n-2]`) must be identical to `str_B[0...n-3]` (which is also `s[1...n-2]`). In Python slicing, this means `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n*   If this condition holds, we have found a candidate for `s`.\n\nIf Case 1 does not yield a valid `s` (i.e., the consistency check `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]` fails), we try Case 2.\n*   If `str_B` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str_A` is `s[1...n-1]`:\n*   The full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str_B[0] + str_A`.\n*   The consistency check is `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n*   Since the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these two cases must yield a valid `s`. We can pick the first one that works.\n\nOnce we have identified the correct string `s_final`, we need to determine for each of the original `2n-2` input strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix.\n1.  Generate all `n-1` prefixes of `s_final`: `s_final[0...L-1]` for `L=1` to `n-1`.\n2.  Generate all `n-1` suffixes of `s_final`: `s_final[n-L...n-1]` for `L=1` to `n-1`.\n3.  To handle duplicate strings (e.g., if `s=\"aaa\"`, `P_1=\"a\"` and `S_1=\"a\"`), we use `collections.Counter` to store the expected counts of each prefix and suffix.\n4.  Iterate through the *original* input strings in their given order. For each string:\n    *   If it matches an expected prefix and its count is greater than zero, assign 'P' and decrement its count in `expected_P_counts`.\n    *   Otherwise (it must match an expected suffix), assign 'S' and decrement its count in `expected_S_counts`.\n5.  Store these 'P'/'S' assignments in a list, maintaining their original input order.\n6.  Finally, join the characters in the list and print the resulting string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=5, s=\"ababa\")**:\nInput strings: `ba`, `a`, `abab`, `a`, `aba`, `baba`, `ab`, `aba`. (Original indices 0-7)\n\n1.  Identify strings of length `n-1 = 4`: `abab` and `baba`.\n    Let `str_A = \"abab\"` and `str_B = \"baba\"`.\n\n2.  **Try Case 1**: Assume `str_A` is `P_4`, `str_B` is `S_4`.\n    *   Consistency check: `str_A[1:]` (`\"bab\"`) == `str_B[:-1]` (`\"bab\"`). This is true.\n    *   Reconstruct `s_final`: `str_A[0] + str_B` = `\"a\" + \"baba\"` = `\"ababa\"`.\n\n3.  Generate expected prefixes and suffixes for `s_final = \"ababa\"`:\n    *   Prefixes: `P_1=\"a\"`, `P_2=\"ab\"`, `P_3=\"aba\"`, `P_4=\"abab\"`.\n    *   Suffixes: `S_1=\"a\"`, `S_2=\"ba\"`, `S_3=\"aba\"`, `S_4=\"baba\"`.\n    *   `expected_P_counts = {'a': 1, 'ab': 1, 'aba': 1, 'abab': 1}`\n    *   `expected_S_counts = {'a': 1, 'ba': 1, 'aba': 1, 'baba': 1}`\n\n4.  Assign 'P' or 'S' to original input strings:\n    *   `('ba', 0)`: `expected_P_counts['ba']` is 0. `expected_S_counts['ba']` is 1. Assign 'S'. `expected_S_counts['ba']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('a', 1)`: `expected_P_counts['a']` is 1. Assign 'P'. `expected_P_counts['a']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('abab', 2)`: `expected_P_counts['abab']` is 1. Assign 'P'. `expected_P_counts['abab']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('a', 3)`: `expected_P_counts['a']` is 0. `expected_S_counts['a']` is 1. Assign 'S'. `expected_S_counts['a']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('aba', 4)`: `expected_P_counts['aba']` is 1. Assign 'P'. `expected_P_counts['aba']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('baba', 5)`: `expected_P_counts['baba']` is 0. `expected_S_counts['baba']` is 1. Assign 'S'. `expected_S_counts['baba']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('ab', 6)`: `expected_P_counts['ab']` is 1. Assign 'P'. `expected_P_counts['ab']` becomes 0.\n    *   `('aba', 7)`: `expected_P_counts['aba']` is 0. `expected_S_counts['aba']` is 1. Assign 'S'. `expected_S_counts['aba']` becomes 0.\n\n5.  The resulting character list is `['S', 'P', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S']`.\n    Joined, this gives `SPPSPSPS`, which matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store all input strings along with their original indices\n    all_input_strings_with_indices = []\n    # Store strings of length n-1 to identify the longest prefix/suffix candidates\n    strings_of_len_n_minus_1 = []\n\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        all_input_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            strings_of_len_n_minus_1.append(s)\n    \n    # According to the problem statement, there are exactly two strings of length n-1.\n    long_str1 = strings_of_len_n_minus_1[0]\n    long_str2 = strings_of_len_n_minus_1[1]\n\n    s_final = None\n\n    # Attempt 1: Assume long_str1 is the prefix of length n-1 and long_str2 is the suffix of length n-1.\n    # The full string s would be long_str1[0] + long_str2.\n    # For this to be consistent, the middle part must match: long_str1[1:] == long_str2[:-1].\n    if long_str1[1:] == long_str2[:-1]:\n        s_final = long_str1[0] + long_str2\n    \n    # If the first attempt didn't yield a valid string, try the second possibility.\n    # Attempt 2: Assume long_str2 is the prefix of length n-1 and long_str1 is the suffix of length n-1.\n    # The full string s would be long_str2[0] + long_str1.\n    # For this to be consistent, the middle part must match: long_str2[1:] == long_str1[:-1].\n    if s_final is None:\n        if long_str2[1:] == long_str1[:-1]:\n            s_final = long_str2[0] + long_str1\n        \n    # At this point, s_final must have been determined due to the problem guarantee.\n\n    # Generate all expected prefixes and suffixes of s_final and store their counts.\n    # Using Counter helps manage duplicates (e.g., if 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix).\n    expected_P_counts = Counter()\n    expected_S_counts = Counter()\n\n    for length in range(1, n): # Lengths from 1 to n-1\n        prefix = s_final[:length]\n        suffix = s_final[n-length:]\n        expected_P_counts[prefix] += 1\n        expected_S_counts[suffix] += 1\n    \n    # Prepare the result string characters, initialized with empty strings\n    result_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n\n    # Iterate through the original input strings to assign 'P' or 'S'\n    for s_val, original_idx in all_input_strings_with_indices:\n        # If the string can be a prefix and we still expect one, assign 'P'\n        if expected_P_counts[s_val] > 0:\n            result_chars[original_idx] = 'P'\n            expected_P_counts[s_val] -= 1\n        # Otherwise, it must be a suffix (and we still expect one), assign 'S'\n        elif expected_S_counts[s_val] > 0:\n            result_chars[original_idx] = 'S'\n            expected_S_counts[s_val] -= 1\n        # The 'else' case should theoretically not be reached if the problem guarantees hold,\n        # as every input string must be either an expected prefix or an expected suffix.\n\n    # Join the characters to form the final output string and print it\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
