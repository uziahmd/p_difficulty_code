He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. First, I need to figure out how to count those zeroes.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by how many times 10 appears as a factor. And since 10 = 2 * 5, I need to count pairs of 2 and 5. The number of 2s will always be greater than or equal to the number of 5s in the prime factorization of `n!`, so I just need to count the factors of 5.\n\nLegendre's formula is perfect for this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` This keeps going as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's analyze `Z(n)`. It's a non-decreasing function; it either stays the same or goes up. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. For the small values of `n`, it's zero until `n` equals 5. Then it increments. I see the jumps are not always of size 1. For example, from 24 to 25, the number of zeroes jumps from 4 to 6. This is because we add an additional factor of 5 and 25 at the same time. The contribution comes from floor(25/5) and floor(25/25).\nOkay, so it increases by `k` when `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`. Got it!\n\nThe problem asks for all `n` where `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, if I find one `n_0` where `Z(n_0) = m`, all values of `n` that work should form a contiguous range. I can use binary search or a similar technique to find the bounds. I need to write this up into Python.\n",
