Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Minimum Steps Between Blocks**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this problem: find the shortest path, in terms of blocks crossed, to get from my starting point (home) to my destination (university) on a plane divided by `n` lines.  Each block is a region, formed by the intersection of half-planes defined by these lines. A \"step\" means moving from one block to an adjacent one, sharing a common border.  Neither home nor university lies on any of the lines, which simplifies things.\n\nHere's my approach: Each line, say `ax + by + c = 0`, splits the plane in two. A point (x,y) inside any block will satisfy the half-plane inequality for each line, either `ax + by + c > 0` or `ax + by + c < 0`.\n\nLet's call the value of the expression `ax + by + c` at a point `P` as `val(P)`. If I have my home point `P1` and the university `P2`, and look at a specific line, I can evaluate `val(P1)` and `val(P2)`.\n\nIf both `val(P1)` and `val(P2)` are the same sign, they're on the same side of that line. If their signs differ, they're on opposite sides. That's crucial.\n\nIf the number of steps is zero, it means I'm already in the same block. This happens when *all* lines have the same sign for `P1` and `P2`. In other words, `val_i(P1) * val_i(P2) > 0` for all lines i.\n\nIf the points *are* separated by blocks, then I need to cross some lines to get there. The minimum number of steps is equivalent to the number of lines that I *must* cross. A step happens when I cross exactly one line. Thus, the minimum number of steps corresponds to the number of lines such that the `val_i(P1)` and `val_i(P2)` have opposite signs (where points are on the opposite side of each line).\n\nThe core of it is this: Any path from `P1` to `P2` must cross a line `L_k` if `P1` and `P2` are on opposite sides of `L_k`. So if I count how many lines separate the two points (have opposite signs), that's the minimum number of steps.  If two points are on the opposite sides of k lines, I need at least k steps.\n",
