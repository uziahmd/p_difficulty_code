For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script to classify a three-note chord as major, minor, or \"strange\". The input will be three note names, like \"C E G\".  There are 12 notes (C to H, including sharps). The core concept is calculating the distance (in semitones) between notes, remembering that the scale is cyclic (after H comes C again). The key is the modulo 12 arithmetic: the distance from note A to note B is `(B - A + 12) % 12`.\n\nA triad has exactly three notes, and the *order* matters for classifying major or minor.  A major triad has a specific interval pattern:  4 semitones between the first and second notes, and then 3 between the second and third (like C-E-G). A minor triad reverses that: 3 semitones then 4 (like C-D#-G).  I have to check *all* the possible orderings of the input notes to see if *any* of them fit either the major or minor pattern. There are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\nFirst, I'll create a mapping from note names to integers (0-11). Then, read the input and convert the note names to their integer equivalents. For each permutation of those integers, I'll calculate the two distances and check if they match either the major (4, 3) or minor (3, 4) interval pattern. If I find a match, I'll output the corresponding label (\"major\" or \"minor\") and stop searching because the problem says there's no ambiguity (it can't be both). If no permutation matches, it's \"strange.\"\n\nThe modular arithmetic and permutations are the critical parts. I'll use `itertools.permutations` for the permutations. The problem's \"unambiguous\" statement simplifies the logic. No need to get into harmonic complexities - if any ordering matches major or minor, that is the answer.\n\nI've carefully considered the examples to make sure the code covers all possible cases and that the cyclic nature of the musical scale is properly handled. I am confident this approach covers all the requirements and constraints given.\n",
