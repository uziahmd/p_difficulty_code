Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number.

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Approach for Maximizing Chest Openings**\n\nAlright, I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands: Neko needs to open as many chests as possible, given a set of chests with numbers, a set of keys with numbers, and the condition that a key can open a chest if their sum is odd.  My initial reaction is to break this down.\n\nFirst, the key observation here is that the actual *values* of the numbers on the chests and keys don't matter, only their parity - whether they're even or odd. This is a massive simplification, because `a_i + b_j` is odd *if and only if* one of `a_i` or `b_j` is even, and the other is odd.  No need to worry about the specific numbers, just their remainders when divided by two.\n\nMy strategy becomes clear:\n\n1.  **Count the Parity:** I need to count how many odd and even chests there are, and similarly, how many odd and even keys I have. Let's call them `chests_odd`, `chests_even`, `keys_odd`, and `keys_even`.\n\n2.  **Matching:** This clearly boils down to a matching problem. An odd chest *must* be opened with an even key, and an even chest *must* be opened with an odd key.  I want to maximize the total number of pairings.\n\n3.  **Independent Matches:**  Here's where it gets interesting.  The odd chest/even key matches are *completely* independent from the even chest/odd key matches. I can't mix and match.\n\n4.  **Maximize Each Match:** The maximum number of matches between odd chests and even keys is simply the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. Likewise, the maximum for even chests and odd keys is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\n5.  **Total:** Since the pairings are independent, the overall maximum number of opened chests is just the sum of these two maxima: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.  That's my solution.\n\nI should verify this with an example to make sure I'm thinking clearly. Let's try the provided example; I'll quickly count the odds and evens, apply the formula, and then I'm confident that's the approach I should take. This should be an easy and efficient solution that I can quickly code up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests and `m` keys. Each chest `i` has a number `a_i` and each key `j` has a number `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe core condition is `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}`, which means the sum `a_i + b_j` must be odd. Let's analyze the parity of the numbers:\n*   An odd number plus an odd number equals an even number. (`odd + odd = even`)\n*   An even number plus an even number equals an even number. (`even + even = even`)\n*   An odd number plus an even number equals an odd number. (`odd + even = odd`)\n*   An even number plus an odd number equals an odd number. (`even + odd = odd`)\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that for `a_i + b_j` to be odd, one of `a_i` and `b_j` must be odd, and the other must be even. They must have different parities.\n\nThis means:\n1.  An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n2.  An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n\nThis observation simplifies the problem significantly. We don't need to consider the actual values `a_i` and `b_j`, only their parity.\n\nLet's count the number of odd and even chests, and odd and even keys:\n*   `chests_odd`: The count of chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n*   `chests_even`: The count of chests with an even number `a_i`.\n*   `keys_odd`: The count of keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n*   `keys_even`: The count of keys with an even number `b_j`.\n\nTo maximize the number of opened chests, we should make as many valid pairings as possible.\n*   For odd chests, we need even keys. The maximum number of odd chests we can open is limited by the number of odd chests available and the number of even keys available. So, we can open `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` odd chests.\n*   For even chests, we need odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of even chests we can open is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSince these two types of pairings (odd chest with even key, and even chest with odd key) use completely disjoint sets of chests (odd vs. even) and keys (even vs. odd), they are independent. We can simply sum the maximums from both scenarios.\n\nThe maximum total number of chests Neko can open is:\n`min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_odd = 0`, `chests_even = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n    *   If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_odd = 0`, `keys_even = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n    *   If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n*   **Chests:**\n    *   `9` (odd), `14` (even), `6` (even), `2` (even), `11` (odd)\n    *   `chests_odd = 2`\n    *   `chests_even = 3`\n*   **Keys:**\n    *   `8` (even), `4` (even), `7` (odd), `20` (even)\n    *   `keys_odd = 1`\n    *   `keys_even = 3`\n\n*   Matches:\n    *   Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n    *   Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n\n*   Total opened chests: `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient as it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then performing a few constant-time operations. The time complexity will be O(N + M).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count odd and even chests\n    chests_odd = 0\n    chests_even = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Count odd and even keys\n    keys_odd = 0\n    keys_even = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate maximum matches\n    # Odd chests can be opened by even keys\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    # Even chests can be opened by odd keys\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    total_matches = matches_odd_chest_even_key + matches_even_chest_odd_key\n    print(total_matches)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
