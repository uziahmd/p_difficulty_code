    "thought": "**My Competitive Programming Strategy**\n\nAlright, here's the game plan for this lexicographical string problem. I've got to find the smallest string I can make by swapping some characters. First off, I'm noting the key constraints: I can swap '0' with '1' and '1' with '2', but '0' and '2' are off-limits. This is crucial.\n\nSo, '0's can move past '1's, '2's can move past '1's, but the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*. That's my big insight.\n\nTo make the string small, I'll count the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's.  I want as many '0's as early as possible. '1's are flexible, but also need to be strategically placed. I construct a simplified version of the string (`temp_s`) containing only '0's and '2's while keeping their original relative order. All the ones will be inserted later.\n\nThen, I'll find where the *first* '2' appears in `temp_s`. The ideal spot for '1's? Right before that first '2', if there is one. That way I maximize the numbers of zeros before the ones. If no '2' exists, I just put all the 1's at the end. I insert the calculated number of ones (`num_ones`) in this place.\n\nThat's my strategy! I make sure the string is built so all the '0's, then the '1's, then the '2's are grouped together without letting the forbidden 0 and 2 cross. That guarantees the lexicographically smallest.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing specific adjacent character swaps: '0' with '1' (\"01\" <-> \"10\") and '1' with '2' (\"12\" <-> \"21\"). Swapping '0' with '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1.  **'0' and '1'**: A '0' can move past a '1' (left or right).\n2.  **'1' and '2'**: A '1' can move past a '2' (left or right).\n3.  **'0' and '2'**: These characters cannot swap directly.\n\nThe crucial observation is the interaction between '0's and '2's. Since '0's and '2's cannot swap, their relative order in the string is invariant. This means if a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it will always appear before that '2' in any string obtained through allowed operations. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it will always remain so.\n\nOn the other hand, '1's are highly mobile. A '1' can swap with a '0' and a '1' can swap with a '2'. This means a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or '2'. If there are multiple '1's, they can also swap with each other (e.g., \"11\" remains \"11\"). This implies that all '1's can be grouped together into a single contiguous block, and this block can be placed at any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's is maintained.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1.  **Separate '1's from '0's and '2's**: Iterate through the input string `s`. Count all occurrences of '1's (let this be `num_ones`). Collect all '0's and '2's into a temporary string (or a list of characters) in their original relative order. Let's call this `temp_s`.\n    *   Example: If `s = \"100210\"`, `num_ones = 2`, and `temp_s = \"0020\"`.\n\n2.  **Determine insertion point for '1's**: Now we have `num_ones` '1's to insert into `temp_s`. To make the final string lexicographically smallest, we want to place the '1's after all possible '0's and before all possible '2's. Given that the relative order of '0's and '2's in `temp_s` is fixed, the optimal place to insert the block of '1's is right before the *first* '2' in `temp_s`.\n    *   If `temp_s` contains no '2's (e.g., `s = \"010\"` resulting in `temp_s = \"00\"`), then all '1's should be appended at the end of `temp_s` (after all '0's).\n    *   If `temp_s` contains no '0's (e.g., `s = \"11222121\"` resulting in `temp_s = \"222\"`), then all '1's should be prepended at the beginning of `temp_s` (before all '2's).\n    *   This logic is covered by finding the index of the first '2' in `temp_s`. If no '2' is found, we effectively set this index to `len(temp_s)`.\n\n3.  **Construct the final string**:\n    *   Take the part of `temp_s` from its beginning up to (but not including) the index of the first '2'.\n    *   Append `num_ones` '1's.\n    *   Append the rest of `temp_s` (from the first '2' onwards).\n\nLet's walk through an example: `s = \"100210\"`\n1.  `num_ones = 0`, `temp_s_parts = []`\n    *   `'1'` (at index 0): `num_ones = 1`\n    *   `'0'` (at index 1): `temp_s_parts = ['0']`\n    *   `'0'` (at index 2): `temp_s_parts = ['0', '0']`\n    *   `'2'` (at index 3): `temp_s_parts = ['0', '0', '2']`\n    *   `'1'` (at index 4): `num_ones = 2`\n    *   `'0'` (at index 5): `temp_s_parts = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n    `temp_s = \"\".join(temp_s_parts)` which is `\"0020\"`.\n\n2.  Find the first '2' in `temp_s = \"0020\"`. It's at index `2`. So, `idx_first_2 = 2`.\n\n3.  Construct the result:\n    *   `temp_s[0:idx_first_2]` = `temp_s[0:2]` = `\"00\"`\n    *   `'1' * num_ones` = `'1' * 2` = `\"11\"`\n    *   `temp_s[idx_first_2:]` = `temp_s[2:]` = `\"20\"`\n    Concatenating these gives `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis approach ensures that all '0's that can possibly come before '1's do so, and all '1's that can possibly come before '2's do so, while respecting the immutable relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) because we iterate through the string once, and string operations like `find`, slicing, and `join` are proportional to the string length. The space complexity will also be O(N) for storing temporary string parts. Given N up to 10^5, this is efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    temp_s_parts = [] # Use a list to efficiently build the string of '0's and '2's\n\n    # Iterate through the input string to separate '1's from '0's and '2's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            temp_s_parts.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the parts to form the string containing only '0's and '2's\n    temp_s = \"\".join(temp_s_parts)\n\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in temp_s.\n    # This is where the block of '1's should be inserted.\n    # If '2' is not found, str.find() returns -1.\n    idx_first_2 = temp_s.find('2')\n    \n    # If no '2' is found in temp_s, all '1's should be appended after all '0's.\n    # In this case, we set the insertion index to the end of temp_s.\n    if idx_first_2 == -1:\n        idx_first_2 = len(temp_s)\n    \n    # Construct the final lexicographically smallest string\n    result_parts = []\n    # 1.
