    "thought": "**Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to find the smallest ternary string I can create using these specific swap rules. I'm focusing on minimizing the string lexicographically, and I have to work with these '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21' swaps.\n\nFirst, I see that '0's and '1's can freely change places. Also, '1's and '2's can move around without restriction. The crux of the matter is the interplay between '0's and '2's. Can a '0' ever end up after a '2', or vice versa?\n\nI've experimented with trying to move a '0' past a '2' using intermediate '1's. For example, starting with \"012\", I can get to \"120\" and \"021\", but I can't force the '0' past the '2' or the '2' past the '0'. This is telling me that the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*. If I initially have \"0...2\" in the string, that '0' will always come before that '2', no matter what.\n\nThinking about it more concretely: If I have a '0' at index *i* and a '2' at index *j* where *i* < *j*, can I make *i* > *j*? No, the swaps only allow for adjacent movement, and the swapping rules essentially preserve the order of any '0' and '2'. \n\nTherefore, my main observation is that all the '0's clump together, all the '2's clump together, and the original relative order of the '0's and '2's determines their final position. The '1's are basically the 'buffer', they can be interspersed and rearranged freely among the '0's and '2's. So, I have to figure out the right *order* of 0s, 1s, and 2s to minimize the string lexicographically. The challenge is in the fact that any two '0' and '2' can't swap, so their starting order must be preserved.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by repeatedly applying two types of swaps: '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. Swapping '0' and '2' directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' can swap with '1'. This means a '0' can move past any '1', and a '1' can move past any '0'.\n2. '1' can swap with '2'. This means a '1' can move past any '2', and a '2' can move past any '1'.\n\nWhat about '0's and '2's? A '0' cannot directly swap with a '2'. Can they swap indirectly?\nConsider the sequence \"012\".\n- Swapping '0' and '1': \"102\". The '0' is still before '2'.\n- Swapping '1' and '2': \"021\". The '0' is still before '2'.\nIt appears that '0's and '2's cannot move past each other. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the initial string, it will always appear before that specific '2' in any subsequent string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it will always appear before that specific '0'.\n\nThis is the crucial observation: the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant.\nAll '0's can be moved past all '1's. All '2's can be moved past all '1's.\nThis implies that all '1's can be grouped together and moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as they don't violate the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning of the string.\nSince '0's can move past '1's, we can bring all '0's to the left, pushing '1's to the right.\nHowever, a '0' cannot move past a '2'. So, a '0' can only move left until it hits another '0' or a '2'.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- Count all '0's.\n- Count all '1's.\n- Count all '2's.\n\nWe want to put '0's first. All '0's can be grouped together.\nThen, we want to put '1's. All '1's can be grouped together.\nThen, we want to put '2's. All '2's can be grouped together.\n\nIf there were no '2's in the string, we could simply sort it to get all '0's, then all '1's. E.g., \"1001\" -> \"0011\".\nIf there were no '0's in the string, we could simply sort it to get all '1's, then all '2's. E.g., \"1212\" -> \"1122\".\n\nThe problem arises when both '0's and '2's are present.\nConsider the string \"012\". The '0' must stay before the '2'. The '1' can be anywhere in between.\nThe lexicographically smallest string would be \"012\".\nConsider \"210\". The '2' must stay before the '0'. The '1' can be anywhere.\nThe lexicographically smallest string would be \"210\".\n\nSince '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' that appears before the first '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning. Any '0' that appears after a '2' must stay after that '2'. This is incorrect. The relative order of *all* '0's and *all* '2's is fixed.\n\nLet's rephrase: The string can be thought of as a sequence of '0's and '2's, with '1's being \"interchangeable\" elements that can move freely among '0's and '2's.\nBecause '0's and '2's cannot swap, their relative order is fixed.\nFor example, if the string is \"010210\", the sequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\".\nThe '1's can effectively be moved past any '0' or '2'.\nThis means all '1's can be collected together into a single block.\nWhere should this block of '1's be placed to make the string lexicographically smallest?\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nSo, we should collect all '0's and place them at the beginning.\nThen, we should collect all '1's.\nThen, we should collect all '2's.\n\nHowever, we cannot move a '0' past a '2'.\nSo, if the original string contains characters '0', '1', '2', we can extract all '1's.\nLet's say we have `count_0` zeros, `count_1` ones, and `count_2` twos.\nThe '1's can move freely. The '0's and '2's cannot cross each other.\nThis means the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must be preserved.\nFor example, if the string is \"20\", the result must be \"20\". It cannot be \"02\".\n\nConsider the string `s`.\nWe can construct a new string `s_prime` by removing all '1's from `s`.\nFor example, if `s = \"100210\"`, then `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\nThe characters in `s_prime` ('0's and '2's) must maintain their relative order.\nAll the '1's that were removed from `s` (let's say there are `k` of them) can be inserted anywhere into `s_prime`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nSo, we should place all '1's *after* all the '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in `s_prime`.\nMore precisely, we want to place all '1's after all '0's and before all '2's, if possible.\n\nLet's iterate through the input string `s`.\nWe collect all '0's into a `zeros` list/string.\nWe collect all '2's into a `twos` list/string.\nWe count all '1's. Let this be `num_ones`.\n\nThe final string will consist of some '0's, then all '1's, then the remaining '0's and '2's.\nThis is incorrect. The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n\nThe most straightforward way to think about this is:\n1. Identify all '0's and '2's in their original relative order. This forms a subsequence.\n   Example: \"100210\" -> \"0020\"\n2. All '1's can be moved to any position relative to this subsequence of '0's and '2's.\n   To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's as early as possible.\n   This means any '1' should come *after* any '0' that precedes it, and *before* any '2' that follows it.\n   So, all '1's should be inserted at the first position where a '2' appears in the subsequence of '0's and '2's.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\nIterate through the string `s`.\n- If we see a '0', append it to our result string.\n- If we see a '1', count it. Do not append it yet.\n- If we see a '2', this is the first '2' we've encountered (or a subsequent one). At this point, all '0's that were before this '2' have been appended. Now, we should append all the '1's we've counted so far, because placing them after these '0's and before this '2' is lexicographically optimal. After appending all '1's, we append the '2'.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `s[0] = '1'`: count `num_ones = 1`.\n2. `s[1] = '0'`: append '0'. Result: \"0\".\n3. `s[2] = '0'`: append '0'. Result: \"00\".\n4. `s[3] = '2'`: This is the first '2'. Append all `num_ones` (which is 1) '1's. Result: \"001\". Then append '2'. Result: \"0012\". Reset `num_ones = 0`.\n5. `s[4] = '1'`: count `num_ones = 1`.\n6. `s[5] = '0'`: append '0'. Result: \"00120\".\n\nAfter iterating through the whole string: `num_ones` might still be non-zero. Append any remaining '1's to the end. Result: \"00120\".\nThis is not the example output. Example output for \"100210\" is \"001120\". My strategy produced \"00120\".\nThe example output suggests that all '1's should be grouped together and placed at a specific point.\n\nLet's re-evaluate.\nAll '0's are equivalent. All '1's are equivalent. All '2's are equivalent.\nThe relative order of any '0' and any '2' is fixed.\nThis means we can construct the final string by taking all '0's and '2's from the input, preserving their relative order. Let this be `subsequence_02`.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`. `subsequence_02 = \"0020\"`.\nAll '1's (let's say there are `N_1` of them) can be inserted as a block anywhere into `subsequence_02`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place this block of `N_1` ones such that it comes after as many '0's as possible, and before any '2's if possible.\nThis means we find the *first* occurrence of '2' in `subsequence_02`. All '1's should be inserted right before this first '2'.\nIf there are no '2's in `subsequence_02`, then all '1's should be appended to the end of `subsequence_02`.\n\nLet's apply this revised strategy:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `num_ones`.\n2. Build a new string `s_02` by taking all '0's and '2's from `s` in their original order.\n   Example: `s = \"100210\"`\n   `num_ones = 2` (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`).\n   `s_02 = \"0020\"` (from `s[1], s[2], s[3], s[5]`).\n3. Find the index of the first '2' in `s_02`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n   - If `s_02 = \"0020\"`, `first_two_idx = 2`.\n   - If `s_02` contains no '2's (e.g., \"000\"), `first_two_idx` would be -1 or not found.\n4. Construct the result:\n   - If `first_two_idx` is found:\n     `result = s_02[0 : first_two_idx]` + (`'1'` repeated `num_ones` times) + `s_02[first_two_idx : ]`\n     For `s = \"100210\"`:\n     `s_02[0:2]` is \"00\".\n     `'1'` repeated `num_ones=2` times is \"11\".\n     `s_02[2:]` is \"20\".\n     `result = \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\"`. This matches the example output!\n\nLet's test with other examples:\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `num_ones = 4` (from `s[0], s[1], s[5], s[7]`).\n2. `s_02 = \"2222\"` (from `s[2], s[3], s[4], s[6]`).\n3. `first_two_idx = 0`.\n4. `result = s_02[0:0]` + \"1111\" + `s_02[0:]`\n   `result = \"\"` + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\". This matches the example output!\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `s_02 = \"20\"`.\n3. `first_two_idx = 0`.\n4. `result = s_02[0:0]` + \"\" + `s_02[0:]`\n   `result = \"\"` + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\". This matches the example output!\n\nExample with no '2's: `s = \"10010\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `s_02 = \"000\"`.\n3. `first_two_idx` is not found (no '2's in `s_02`).\n4. If `first_two_idx` is not found, append all '1's to the end of `s_02`.\n   `result = s_02` + (`'1'` repeated `num_ones` times)\n   `result = \"000\" + \"11\" = \"00011\"`. This seems correct.\n\nThis strategy seems robust.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string once to count '1's and build `s_02`.\n- Find the index of '2' in `s_02`.\n- Construct the final string using string slicing and concatenation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    s_02_chars = [] # To build s_02 efficiently\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Count '1's and build s_02\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n    \n    s_02 = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the insertion point for '1's\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_02)):\n        if s_02[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    # Step 4: Construct the result string\n    result = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in s_02, append all '1's at the end\n        result.append(s_02)\n        result.append('1' * num_ones)\n    else:\n        # Insert all '1's before the first '2'\n        result.append(s_02[0:first_two_idx])\n        result.append('1' * num_ones)\n        result.append(s_02[first_two_idx:])\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
