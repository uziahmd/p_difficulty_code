And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over K-Day Weeks**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the average sleep time across all possible 'k'-day weeks. Let me break this down. The input will be the total number of days (`n`), the week length (`k`), and a list of sleep times for each day (`a1` to `an`). A 'week' is just a consecutive set of `k` days. Since I'm aiming for efficiency, I want to avoid anything that's going to hit O(n^2).\n\nThe key insight here is the sliding window technique. Calculating the sum for each 'k'-day period independently would be too slow. I know that if I have the sum for the first window (the first `k` days), I can quickly get the sum for the next window by subtracting the first element of the previous window and adding the next element in the data stream. This is a classic sliding window optimization, which brings each window calculation down to O(1) time after the initial window sum which is O(k)\n\nSo, I'll calculate the sum for the first `k` days, and then iterate through the remaining windows, updating the sum with each step. This keeps me at a linear time complexity, O(n) or O(n-k) actually. Then, it's just a matter of dividing the total sum of the sleep times by the number of weeks (which is easily calculated as `n - k + 1`). This is definitely the optimal solution. I see how this is the way to tackle this.\n",
