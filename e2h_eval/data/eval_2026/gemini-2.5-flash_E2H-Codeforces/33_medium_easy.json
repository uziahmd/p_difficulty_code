You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to maximize a number `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit in `s` can only be used once. To maximize a number, we need to focus on the leftmost digits, as they are the most significant. A greedy approach seems natural: iterate through `a` from left to right, and for each digit, try to replace it with the *largest* digit from `s` that is greater than the current digit in `a`. If there's no suitable replacement, we keep the original digit.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Edge Case Considerations:**\n\nTo implement this, I'll need to represent `a` as a mutable structure (like a list of characters) so I can modify it.  The sequence `s` needs to be sorted in descending order to easily find the largest available digit. I must make *strictly* greater comparison to avoid consuming a digit from `s` without a number value change.\n\nI need to make sure I only replace digits if it improves the number. This means comparing the digits and making sure a replacement is beneficial. Also, I must keep track of which digits from `s` I've already used. A pointer or an index (`s_ptr`) to track the next largest available digit in `s` is the most efficient way to do that.\n\n**Detailed Implementation and Optimization:**\n\n1.  Read `a` and `s`. Convert `a` to a list of characters and `s` into a list of characters.\n2.  Sort `s` in descending order.\n3.  Iterate through `a` using a `for` loop, from left to right.\n4.  Within the loop, check if there are available digits in `s` using `s_ptr < len(s)`.\n5.  If an available digit is greater than the current digit in `a`, then replace and increment `s_ptr`. Otherwise, move to the next position in `a`.\n6.  Once you get to the end of your number's positions, reassemble it, and print to `sys.stdout`.\n\nTo make the algorithm more efficient, I will increment `s_ptr` instead of using `list.pop(0)`.  This avoids the `O(m)` time complexity of list element removal. The `s_ptr` keeps track of the largest usable digit at the current time.\n\nI need to handle edge cases where `s` is shorter than `a`, longer than `a`, or empty.  The conditions `s_ptr < m` and the fact that we break from the main loop if `s_ptr == m` should handle these cases properly.\n\n**Code and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use Python and the `sys` module for faster I/O. After writing the code, I'll do a time and space complexity analysis. This greedy approach should have O(n + m log m) time complexity due to the sorting step and O(n + m) space complexity for storing the lists. This is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 10^5). The code is as follows: (Insert Code) I'll also add a `break` in case all `s` digits have been used early.\n\nAfter writing this algorithm, I feel confident it will solve the problem optimally and efficiently. I will run it through a battery of tests to confirm it.\n",
