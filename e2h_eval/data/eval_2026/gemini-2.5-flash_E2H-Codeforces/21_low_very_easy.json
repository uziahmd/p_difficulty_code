The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Chest and Key Conundrum**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got this competitive programming problem where Neko wants to open as many chests as possible. The core of it boils down to matching chests with keys based on their parity—odd or even. \n\nFirst, the givens: `n` chests, `m` keys. Each chest has a number `a_i`, and each key has a number `b_j`. A key opens a chest if `a_i + b_j` is odd, meaning one must be odd and the other even. Importantly, a key unlocks at most one chest, and a chest is opened at most once. The goal is to maximize the number of opened chests.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, this is a clear matching problem. We need to categorize. I'll need to calculate the number of odd and even chests, as well as the number of odd and even keys. Let's call them `chests_odd`, `chests_even`, `keys_odd`, and `keys_even`.\n\nThe key condition `a_i + b_j` odd simplifies the matching process. If a chest is odd, it *needs* an even key. Conversely, if a chest is even, it *needs* an odd key.  No other combination works, naturally.\n\nThe maximum we can achieve is limited by the minimum of the available chests and keys for each parity pairing. Specifically:\n\n*   We can match up to `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` chests with keys of the opposite parity.\n*   Similarly, we can match up to `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSince a key can be used only once and a chest opened once, those matches are independent. An odd key won't help an odd chest; an even key won't help an even chest.  Therefore, the optimal solution is simply the sum of these two maximums. This strategy should give me the correct number of chests Neko can open: `max_opened_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`. Now let's code this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum `a_i + b_j` must be odd. This occurs if and only if one of the numbers (`a_i` or `b_j`) is odd and the other is even.\n*   If `a_i` is odd, then `b_j` must be even.\n*   If `a_i` is even, then `b_j` must be odd.\n\nThis observation simplifies the problem significantly. We can categorize chests and keys based on their parity:\n\n1.  **Count odd and even chests:**\n    *   Let `chests_odd` be the count of chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n    *   Let `chests_even` be the count of chests with an even number `a_i`.\n\n2.  **Count odd and even keys:**\n    *   Let `keys_odd` be the count of keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n    *   Let `keys_even` be the count of keys with an even number `b_j`.\n\nNow, we can determine the maximum number of successful pairings:\n\n*   **Odd chests need even keys:** The maximum number of odd chests we can open is limited by the number of available odd chests and the number of available even keys. This maximum is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\n*   **Even chests need odd keys:** Similarly, the maximum number of even chests we can open is limited by the number of available even chests and the number of available odd keys. This maximum is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSince an odd key can only open an even chest (and not an odd chest), and an even key can only open an odd chest (and not an even chest), these two types of pairings are completely independent. Keys used for odd chests cannot be used for even chests, and vice versa. The same applies to chests.\n\nTherefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two independent maximums:\n`max_opened_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_odd = 0`, `chests_even = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_odd = 0`, `keys_even = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n*   **Chests:**\n    *   `9` (odd)\n    *   `14` (even)\n    *   `6` (even)\n    *   `2` (even)\n    *   `11` (odd)\n    `chests_odd = 2`, `chests_even = 3`\n\n*   **Keys:**\n    *   `8` (even)\n    *   `4` (even)\n    *   `7` (odd)\n    *   `20` (even)\n    `keys_odd = 1`, `keys_even = 3`\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n    *   `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    *   `Total = 2 + 1 = 3`\n\nThe maximum number of chests Neko can open is 3.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    chests_odd = 0\n    chests_even = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n            \n    keys_odd = 0\n    keys_even = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # Number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys\n    matches1 = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    # Number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys\n    matches2 = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    print(matches1 + matches2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
