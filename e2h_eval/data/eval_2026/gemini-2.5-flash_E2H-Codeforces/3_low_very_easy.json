Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's basically about lighting up a street.  Let me break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem's constraints. We have a street of length `l`, a bunch of lanterns (`n` of them), and their positions along the street (`a_i`). Each lantern illuminates a certain distance `d` in both directions. The objective is to find the *minimum* value of `d` needed to ensure the entire street from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\nNow, my initial plan:\n\n1.  **Input is key:** I'll start by reading in the values for `n`, `l`, and the positions of all the lanterns (`a_i`).\n2.  **Sorting is smart:** Sorting the lantern positions is going to be incredibly useful. It will make it significantly easier to identify the gaps between lanterns.\n3.  **Edge cases demand attention:** The beginning and end of the street are crucial.\n    *   The first lantern needs to cover the point 0, so the minimum `d` has to be at least the position of that first lantern (`a[0]`).\n    *   Similarly, the last lantern has to reach the end of the street `l`, meaning `d` has to be at least `l - a[n-1]`.\n4.  **Gap Analysis is the core:** After sorting, I need to focus on the spaces between the lanterns. To cover any gap between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, I have to make sure the illuminated sections overlap or meet.  `a[i] + d` should be greater or equal than `a[i+1] - d`. That means `d` has to be at least half the distance between those lanterns: `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`. The largest of these gap values is what matters.\n5.  **Finding the sweet spot:** To solve this fully, I need to consolidate the conditions:\n    *   The distance at the start `d >= a[0]`\n    *   The distance at the end `d >= l - a[n-1]`\n    *   The distance required to fill gaps `d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`\n\nUltimately, the minimum `d` I'm after is the *largest* value from these three requirements.\n\n**Implementation Thoughts:**\n\nI'll read `n`, `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`. Sorting `a` with `a.sort()` is quick and simple. Next, I initialize a variable `max_d` to store the largest distance requirement I've encountered so far.  I then iterate through the sorted list, checking the start and end of the street and also the largest gap between lanterns.  The final value of `max_d` will be my solution.\n\nI will need to treat these distances as floating point values, as `d` may not always be an integer value.\n",
