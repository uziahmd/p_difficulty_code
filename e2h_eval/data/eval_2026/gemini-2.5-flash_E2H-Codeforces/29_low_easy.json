Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Substitutes in Number Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down my thinking.  The core of the problem is about manipulating a string of digits (`s`) based on a series of replacement queries (`di -> ti`).  The final result is the numerical value of the modified string, modulo a large prime.\n\nThe naive approach, directly substituting characters in the string for each query, is immediately a red flag. The string could grow exponentially large with the number of queries, quickly exceeding memory limits. That's a classic sign we need to work *symbolically*. I'm an expert in this, so this is natural thinking.\n\nMy key insight is to realize that the final *numerical value* modulo `1000000007` is what matters. This means I don't need to build the giant intermediate strings. Instead, I should track the numerical value and the length of the string transformations.\n\nI'm thinking of this in terms of tables. For each digit (`0` to `9`), I'll maintain two pieces of information: `val[d]` (the numerical value it transforms into, modulo `MOD`) and `len[d]` (the length of the final string it represents). Initially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\nThe trick, of course, is how to update these tables with each query. The *order* of queries is absolutely critical here. If I have `2 -> 00` and then `0 -> 7`, the final value of '2' is going to be '77', not '00'. This means I have to apply queries in *reverse* order. That's a game-changer!\n\nWhy reverse order? When I'm building up the final value, I'm effectively concatenating transformed strings. I need to know how much each part of the string will contribute to the overall value. Thinking about the final string as `T_0 T_1 ... T_{k-1}`, I can calculate the final numerical value by summing up contributions of each digit in `s`, transformed by the queries.\n\nMy script will then build the `val` and `len` tables step-by-step, working backward through the queries. Then, I can take the initial string `s`, and process each digit by using the appropriate `val` and `len` arrays, and efficiently calculate the final numerical value modulo `MOD`.  I'm confident I can make this efficient. I just need to write the Python now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the numerical value of a string `s` after a series of digit replacements, modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become extremely long, so direct string manipulation is not feasible. We need a method to track the numerical value and length of the transformed strings symbolically.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nThe key insight is to process the queries in reverse order. When a query `di -> ti` is processed, it means that any occurrence of `di` *at that point in time* will be replaced by `ti`. If `ti` itself contains digits that are later affected by queries, those subsequent replacements will apply to the digits within `ti`. By processing queries in reverse, we can determine the final value and length for each initial digit `0-9` directly.\n\nLet's maintain two arrays for each digit `d` from '0' to '9':\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length (modulo `MOD-1` for exponentiation, or just the actual length) that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n\n**Initialization (before any queries are processed):**\nInitially, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\nFor `d` from '0' to '9':\n*   `val[d] = int(d)`\n*   `length[d] = 1` (a single digit has length 1)\n\n**Processing Queries (in reverse order):**\nSuppose we have a query `di -> ti`. This means that from this point onwards (backwards in time), any `di` will be replaced by `ti`.\nWe need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti` and the current `val` and `length` values for the digits in `ti`.\n\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_length_di = 0`.\nWe iterate through the string `ti` from right to left (or left to right, accumulating powers of 10). Let's iterate from right to left to make the calculation of powers of 10 easier.\n\nFor each character `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n*   `digit_c = int(c)`\n*   `new_val_di = (val[digit_c] * pow(10, new_length_di, MOD) + new_val_di) % MOD`\n*   `new_length_di = (length[digit_c] + new_length_di) % (MOD - 1)` (Lengths are added. We take modulo `MOD-1` because `pow(10, X, MOD)` uses `X % (MOD-1)` by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`, `new_val_di` and `new_length_di` represent the final value and length for `di`. We then update:\n*   `val[int(di)] = new_val_di`\n*   `length[int(di)] = new_length_di`\n\nIf `ti` is an empty string:\n*   `val[int(di)] = 0`\n*   `length[int(di)] = 0`\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` store the final numerical value and length for each initial digit `d`.\nNow, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`.\nWe iterate through `s` from right to left (or left to right). Again, right to left is simpler for accumulating powers of 10.\n\nLet `final_result = 0` and `current_power_of_10 = 0`.\nFor each character `c` in the initial string `s` (from right to left):\n*   `digit_c = int(c)`\n*   `final_result = (val[digit_c] * pow(10, current_power_of_10, MOD) + final_result) % MOD`\n*   `current_power_of_10 = (length[digit_c] + current_power_of_10) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nThe `final_result` will be the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (222, 2->0, 0->7):**\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Queries (in reverse order):**\n1.  `0 -> 7`:\n    *   `di = '0'`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    *   `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_length_0 = 0`\n    *   For `c = '7'` in `ti`:\n        *   `digit_c = 7`\n        *   `new_val_0 = (val[7] * pow(10, new_length_0, MOD) + new_val_0) % MOD`\n            `= (7 * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_length_0 = (length[7] + new_length_0) % (MOD - 1)`\n            `= (1 + 0) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n    *   Update `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`\n    *   `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  `2 -> 0`:\n    *   `di = '2'`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    *   `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_length_2 = 0`\n    *   For `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n        *   `digit_c = 0`\n        *   `new_val_2 = (val[0] * pow(10, new_length_2, MOD) + new_val_2) % MOD`\n            `= (7 * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_length_2 = (length[0] + new_length_2) % (MOD - 1)`\n            `= (1 + 0) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n    *   Update `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`\n    *   `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Final Calculation for initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_result = 0`, `current_power_of_10 = 0`\n\n1.

This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(10)\n*   Processing queries: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of all `ti` is `S_ti <= 10^5`. Each character processing involves a `pow` operation (logarithmic time). So, `O(S_ti * log(MOD))`.\n*   Final calculation: Iterate through initial string `s`. Length of `s` is `|s| <= 10^5`. Each character involves a `pow` operation. So, `O(|s| * log(MOD))`.\nTotal time complexity: `O((S_ti + |s|) * log(MOD))`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\nSpace complexity: O(10) for `val` and `length` arrays, plus storage for input strings.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9\n    # val[d]: numerical value that digit d transforms into\n    # length[d]: length of the string that digit d transforms into\n    # length values are taken modulo (MOD - 1) for exponentiation\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        query_str = queries_raw[i]\n        d_char, t_str = query_str.split('->')\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        if not t_str:  # Empty string replacement\n            val[d_int] = 0\n            length[d_int] = 0\n        else:\n            new_val_d = 0\n            new_length_d = 0\n            # Iterate through t_str from right to left\n            for char_t in reversed(t_str):\n                digit_t = int(char_t)\n                \n                # Calculate the contribution of current digit_t\n                # It's (val[digit_t] * 10^(power_of_10)) % MOD\n                # where power_of_10 is the accumulated length of digits to its right\n                \n                term_val = (val[digit_t] * pow(10, new_length_d, MOD)) % MOD\n                new_val_d = (new_val_d + term_val) % MOD\n                \n                # Update total length for digits to the right\n                new_length_d = (new_length_d + length[digit_t]) % (MOD - 1)\n            \n            val[d_int] = new_val_d\n            length[d_int] = new_length_d\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n    current_power_of_10 = 0 # This accumulates the total length of segments to the right\n\n    # Iterate through the initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Calculate the contribution of the current digit_s's transformed value\n        # It's (val[digit_s] * 10^(current_power_of_10)) % MOD\n        term_val = (val[digit_s] * pow(10, current_power_of_10, MOD)) % MOD\n        final_result = (final_result + term_val) % MOD\n        \n        # Update the total length for digits to the right for the next iteration\n        current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 + length[digit_s]) % (MOD - 1)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
