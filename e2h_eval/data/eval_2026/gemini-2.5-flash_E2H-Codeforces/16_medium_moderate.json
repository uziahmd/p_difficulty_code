Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "**My Plan for \"Crazy Town\"**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Crazy Town,\" and my goal is a Python script that solves it efficiently and correctly. After analyzing the problem, I've got a solid plan.\n\nFirst off, the input consists of the home and university coordinates, the number of roads, and the equation for each road. The critical constraint is the movement rule: you move between blocks (regions) only if they share a common border, which means crossing a line.  The core idea is that each road divides the plane into two regions. Moving from one block to another equates to crossing a line (road). The problem reduces to finding the fewest lines to cross to get from home to the university.\n\nDetermining which side of a line a point is on is straightforward: plug the coordinates into the line equation `ax + by + c = 0`.  If the result is positive, the point is on one side; negative, the other.  The key insight is that *we need to cross a line only if the home and university are on opposite sides*.  If they're on the same side, we can hypothetically navigate around that line. The \"minimum steps\" equals the number of lines \"separating\" the two points (those with opposite signs).\n\nI'm making sure to address a potential edge case: what about points on a road. The problem states that neither the home nor university coordinates are on any road. That's good to know, no special handling. Integer arithmetic is perfectly fine. The maximum number `ai*x + bi*y + ci` is about `2*10^12`, a standard 64-bit integer will handle that.\n\nMy code's algorithm will:\n1.  Read the home and university coordinates and the number of roads.\n2.  Iterate through each road.\n3.  For each road, determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of it.\n4.  If so, increment a counter (`crossings`).\n5.  Finally, print the counter.\n\nI'll use the compact form `val_home * val_uni < 0` to check if the two points are on opposite sides of a road, and use `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast I/O. I checked this logic against the problem's provided examples, and they matched up. My logic works as expected. The result is an efficient and clean solution to the \"Crazy Town\" problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block to an ending block. A \"step\" is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one, meaning crossing a common border of non-zero length. This is equivalent to crossing a single road line.\n\nEach road is an infinite line defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`. This line divides the plane into two open half-planes: `ax + by + c > 0` and `ax + by + c < 0`. A \"block\" is a region formed by the intersection of these half-planes.\n\nTo move from one block to another, you must cross at least one road line. The minimum number of steps required to get from your home block to the university block is simply the number of road lines that separate your home point `(x1, y1)` from the university point `(x2, y2)`.\n\nWe can determine if a line separates two points by evaluating the expression `ax + by + c` for each point:\n1.  For a given line `ax + by + c = 0`, calculate `val_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n2.  Calculate `val_uni = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n\nSince it's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road, `val_home` and `val_uni` will never be zero. They will always be strictly positive or strictly negative.\n\n*   If `val_home` and `val_uni` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then both points lie on the same side of the line. You do not need to cross this particular line to get from home to university.\n*   If `val_home` and `val_uni` have different signs (one positive, one negative), then the points lie on opposite sides of the line. Any path connecting your home to the university *must* cross this line.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps is the count of lines for which `val_home` and `val_uni` have different signs. This condition can be compactly checked by `val_home * val_uni < 0`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read the coordinates of your home `(x1, y1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of the university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `crossings = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_uni = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val_home * val_uni < 0`, increment `crossings`.\n6.  Print the final `crossings` count.\n\nThe coordinates and coefficients can be up to `10^6`, so `a*x + b*y + c` can be up to `2 * 10^12 + 10^6`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle these values without overflow. The number of roads `n` is up to 300, making this approach very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Initialize a counter for the number of roads that separate home and university\n    crossings = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients (a, b, c) for the current road: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the home point (x1, y1)\n        # The sign of this value indicates which side of the line (x1, y1) lies on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the university point (x2, y2)\n        # The sign of this value indicates which side of the line (x2, y2) lies on.\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If the product of val_home and val_uni is negative, it means they have\n        # different signs.
