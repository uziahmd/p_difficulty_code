The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Tackling the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and it looks like a graph problem, which is always interesting. My task is to write a Python script. I have to process the input, which is the total number of districts `n`, the number of districts to remove `k`, and a list of `n-1` edges that define a tree structure. The output should be a sorted list of the `k` district numbers that I need to remove.\n\nThe core challenge, as I see it, boils down to maximizing the remaining \"fan\" count, with the constraint that the remaining contestants must be connected. The fan count for each district `i` is `2^i`. It's clear that maximizing `2^i` is the key – the problem wants me to retain districts that give a large sum of fans. So, this screams of either a greedy approach or dynamic programming, but let's see which one to go with.\n\nBecause the fan count is `2^i`, I need to remove the districts with the smallest indices. However, the connection is the tricky part. Simply removing the first `k` nodes, or removing the lowest indexed nodes greedily won't guarantee connectivity. I need a connected component with a maximum sum.\n\nWe're dealing with a tree, so removing a node *can* disconnect the remaining nodes if the right node is removed. That's the key constraint. So the reverse is, find a way to keep nodes with a maximum sum with the connectivity. What is the maximum that can be kept? Well, `n-k` nodes. It should be possible to start by building a connected subgraph by trying to include nodes with indices `n`, `n-1`, and so on.\n\nLet's rephrase this. To maximize the kept fans, let's look at it as minimizing the *removed* fans. We'd prefer to remove nodes with small fan counts; that is, nodes with low indices. So, the question becomes, among the nodes with lower indices, can we safely remove `k` nodes that will keep the graph in one connected component? That's the line I need to go down. This should set me in the right direction. It looks like I need a strategy to identify the set of `k` nodes that, when removed, guarantees a connected component with a high fan count. Time to dig deeper into graph algorithms!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. We need to output the `k` removed district numbers in increasing order.\n\nThe number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`. To maximize the total number of fans of the *remaining* contestants, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. Conversely, this means we should prioritize removing districts with *smaller* indices.\n\nThe core constraint is that the remaining `n-k` districts must form a connected component. This implies that the set of removed districts `R` must be chosen such that `V \\setminus R` is connected.\n\nConsider the districts in reverse order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. If we can keep the `n-k` districts with the largest indices (`n, n-1, ..., n-k+1`) and they form a connected component, that would be the optimal solution because `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`. However, these `n-k` districts might not form a connected component.\n\nInstead, let's think about which districts we *must* remove. Since we want to maximize the sum, we should remove districts with the smallest indices, *unless* removing them would disconnect the graph in a way that forces us to remove more high-indexed districts later.\n\nConsider the `n` districts as nodes in a tree.\nWe want to select a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of `2^i`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that minimizes the sum of `2^i` for the *removed* nodes.\n\nLet's try to find the `n-k` nodes to keep.\nThe most \"valuable\" node is `n`, then `n-1`, and so on.\nWe can use a strategy based on a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from the node `n` (or any high-indexed node) to find a connected component of `n-k` nodes.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach exists:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes, we should remove nodes with the smallest possible indices.\nLet's try to remove nodes `1, 2, 3, ...` in increasing order of their indices.\nWhen we consider removing node `x`, we check if removing it would disconnect the graph such that we can no longer form a connected component of size `n-k` using the remaining nodes (especially the high-indexed ones).\n\nA key observation for trees: If we remove a node `u`, it splits the tree into several connected components, each consisting of `u`'s neighbors and their respective subtrees (excluding `u`). If we want to keep a connected component of size `n-k`, this component must be entirely contained within one of these subtrees, or it must be the entire tree minus `u` and some other nodes.\n\nConsider the problem from the perspective of keeping nodes. We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet's try to keep the node `n`. Then we need to pick `n-k-1` more nodes connected to `n` (directly or indirectly) such that the total `n-k` nodes form a connected component and have maximum sum.\nThis suggests a greedy approach:\n1. Initialize a set of `kept` nodes, initially empty.\n2. Initialize a set of `removed` nodes, initially empty.\n3. We need to keep `n-k` nodes.\n4. Iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n   For each district `i`:\n   If we have already kept `n-k` nodes, we are done.\n   If district `i` is not yet removed:\n     Try to add `i` to the `kept` set.\n     After adding `i`, check if the current `kept` set can still form a connected component of size `n-k`. This check is complex.\n\nA more effective greedy strategy:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. The `k` nodes we remove should be the \"cheapest\" ones (smallest `i`) that we *can* remove without disconnecting the `n-k` most valuable remaining nodes.\n\nLet's use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or a similar structure to keep track of connected components.\nThe problem can be rephrased: find a connected subgraph of size `N = n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `N` that contains the largest possible indices.\nThe nodes we *don't* pick for this subgraph are the ones to be removed.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the node with the largest index, `n`.\nWhy `n`? Because it has the maximum fan count `2^n`. We definitely want to keep `n` if possible.\nIf we start a BFS/DFS from node `n` and explore its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, we are essentially building a connected component starting from `n`.\nWhen we explore, we prioritize adding nodes with larger indices. If we have a choice between `u` and `v` to add to our component, and `u` is connected to the current component and `v` is also connected, we should pick the one with the larger index.\nThis is exactly what a BFS/DFS does, but we need to limit its size to `n-k`.\n\nConsider a BFS starting from node `n`.\nQueue `Q` for BFS. `Q = [n]`.\n`visited` set to keep track of nodes in our component. `visited = {n}`.\n`component_size = 1`.\n`removed_nodes = []`.\n\nWhile `Q` is not empty and `component_size < n-k`:\n  `u = Q.pop_front()` (or `Q.pop()` for DFS).\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    If `v` is not `visited`:\n      Add `v` to `Q`.\n      Add `v` to `visited`.\n      `component_size += 1`.\n      If `component_size == n-k`, we stop adding nodes.\n\nThis simple BFS/DFS strategy would build a connected component of size `n-k` rooted at `n`. The nodes *not* in `visited` would be the removed nodes.\nHowever, this might not be optimal. A simple BFS/DFS explores neighbors in an arbitrary order (e.g., based on adjacency list order). We want to prioritize neighbors with larger indices.\n\nLet's refine the BFS/DFS:\n1. Initialize an empty set `kept_nodes`.\n2. Initialize a priority queue `pq` (max-heap) to store candidate nodes to add to our component. The priority should be the node index.\n3. Add node `n` to `kept_nodes`.\n4. Add all neighbors of `n` to `pq`.\n5. While `len(kept_nodes) < n-k` and `pq` is not empty:\n   Pop the node `u` with the highest index from `pq`.\n   If `u` is already in `kept_nodes`, continue (it was added via another path).\n   Add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\n   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n     If `v` is not in `kept_nodes`:\n       Add `v` to `pq`.\n\nThis modified BFS/DFS (using a priority queue) builds a connected component of size `n-k` starting from `n`, always adding the highest-indexed available neighbor. This is the optimal strategy.\nThe nodes *not* in `kept_nodes` are the ones to be removed.\n\nLet's trace with an example: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `n-k=3` nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\n1. `kept_nodes = {}`\n2. `pq = PriorityQueue()` (max-heap)\n3. Add `n=6` to `kept_nodes`. `kept_nodes = {6}`. `len(kept_nodes) = 1`.\n4. Neighbors of `6`: `2, 5`. Add `2, 5` to `pq`. `pq = {6:2, 5:5}` (node:priority).\n5. `len(kept_nodes) = 1 < 3`. `pq` not empty.\n   Pop `u=5` from `pq`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5}`. `len(kept_nodes) = 2`.\n   Neighbors of `5`: `6`. `6` is in `kept_nodes`. Do nothing.\n   `pq = {6:2}`.\n6. `len(kept_nodes) = 2 < 3`. `pq` not empty.\n   Pop `u=2` from `pq`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5, 2}`. `len(kept_nodes) = 3`.\n   `len(kept_nodes) == n-k`. Stop.\n\nThe `kept_nodes` are `{6, 5, 2}`.\nThe `removed_nodes` are `V \\setminus kept_nodes = {1, 3, 4}`.\nOutput `1 3 4` in increasing order. This matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy works because:\n*   We always include `n` (the most valuable node).\n*   We expand the connected component by adding the most valuable *available* node that is adjacent to the current component. This ensures that the `n-k` nodes we keep are the `n-k` highest-indexed nodes that can form a connected component rooted at `n`. If there's another component of size `n-k` that has a higher sum, it would have to contain nodes with even higher indices than those chosen by this greedy strategy, which is impossible since we always pick the highest available.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n*   Use `collections.defaultdict(list)` for adjacency list.\n*   Use `heapq` for the priority queue. Python's `heapq` is a min-heap, so store `(-node_index, node_index)` to simulate a max-heap on `node_index`. Or simply `(-node_index)` and retrieve `abs(val)`.\n*   A `visited` set (or a boolean array) can be used instead of checking `in kept_nodes` for efficiency.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: O(N) where N is `n`.\n*   Priority Queue operations: Each node is added to PQ at most once, and extracted at most once. Each insertion/extraction is O(log N). Total for PQ: O(N log N).\n*   Traversal: Each edge is visited at most twice. O(N).\n*   Overall time complexity: O(N log N).\n*   Space complexity: O(N) for adjacency list, `kept_nodes` (or `visited` array), and priority queue.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible (`10^6 * log(10^6) approx 10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # We need to keep n-k nodes.\n    # We want to maximize sum(2^i) for kept nodes,\n    # which means we want to keep nodes with larger indices.\n    # We use a modified BFS/DFS starting from node n (the largest index)\n    # and always prioritize adding nodes with larger indices to our component.\n\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    # Max-heap for candidate nodes: stores (-node_index, node_index)\n    # The first element is for priority (negative index for max-heap behavior)\n    # The second element is the actual node index.\n    pq = [] \n\n    # Start with the node with the largest index, n.\n    # It has the maximum fan count, so we want to keep it if possible.\n    kept_nodes.add(n)\n    \n    # Add neighbors of n to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # Keep adding nodes until we have n-k nodes\n    while len(kept_nodes) < n - k and pq:\n        _, u = heapq.heappop(pq) # Pop the node with the highest index (max-heap behavior)\n\n        if u in kept_nodes: # Already added through another path\n            continue\n\n        kept_nodes.add(u)\n        \n        # Add neighbors of u to the priority queue\n        for neighbor in adj[u]:\n            if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # All nodes not in kept_nodes are the ones to be removed\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # The problem asks to remove k contestants.\n    # If the loop finished and len(kept_nodes) is less than n-k, \n    # it means the largest connected component reachable from n (prioritizing high indices) \n    # is smaller than n-k.
