The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Problem Understanding and Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have `n` houses in a circle, `m` tasks, and an array `a` where `a_i` tells us which house the `i`-th task is at. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete these tasks in order. Moving to an adjacent house takes one unit of time, and the traffic is clockwise. The goal is to find the minimum total time.\n\n**Algorithm Design**\n\nMy plan is to keep track of Xenia's current house, initially 1. I'll also have a `total_time` variable, initialized to 0. For each task, I'll calculate the time needed to move from the current house to the task's house, and add it to `total_time`.\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n1.  If the task house is equal to or ahead of the current house, it's a straightforward clockwise move: `time = target_house - current_house`.\n2.  If the task house is behind the current house, she has to go all the way around: `time = n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI'll iterate through the tasks and update `current_house` after each move.\n\n**Example Tracing and Verification**\n\nLet's quickly trace the provided example (`n=4, m=3, a=[3, 2, 3]`). Initially, `current_house = 1, total_time = 0`.\n*   Task 1 (`a[0] = 3`): `time = 3 - 1 = 2`. `total_time = 2`, `current_house = 3`.\n*   Task 2 (`a[1] = 2`): `time = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3`. `total_time = 5`, `current_house = 2`.\n*   Task 3 (`a[2] = 3`): `time = 3 - 2 = 1`. `total_time = 6`, `current_house = 3`. This seems correct.\n\nI'll also test another example.\n\n**Optimization and Edge Cases**\n\nThe time complexity will be linear, O(m), since I'm just iterating through the tasks once. The space complexity is O(m) to store the input array. The largest value will be m*n as worst case (alternating `n` and `1`), which fits in python's `int`. The only edge case I see is where current_house == target_house, and that works fine as the time delta is zero.\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nI'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for faster input/output. I can read the input as a string and parse it, but list comprehension looks cleaner. I am handling all input as one-indexed and using the formulas accordingly. I need to make sure I am writing the correct calculations.\n\n**Final Code Check and Polish**\n\nLet me write the code with all the ideas. I'll remove any unnecessary comments and double-check all the calculations. Everything is now good.\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent_house = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target_house in a:\n    if target_house >= current_house:\n        time_taken = target_house - current_house\n    else:\n        time_taken = n - current_house + target_house\n    \n    total_time += time_taken\n    current_house = target_house\n\nsys.stdout.write(str(total_time) + '\\n')\n```\n",
