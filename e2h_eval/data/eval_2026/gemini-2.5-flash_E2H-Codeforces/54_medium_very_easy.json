Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my thought process on solving this problem.  I'm aiming for an efficient solution and want to ensure I understand all the geometric principles involved.**\n\nFirst, I realize this boils down to finding three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a given angle 'a'.  The key insight is recognizing that all angles in a regular n-gon can be expressed in the form *k*(180/n) where *k* is an integer. This is because any inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is a multiple of (360/n).\n\nSince the problem is looking for the *closest* angle, I'll need to figure out which *k* gives me the closest value to 'a'. I fix one vertex (v2 = vertex 1, as that makes calculations simpler and the choice doesn't actually matter), calculate `base_angle` to be `180/n`. I express the target angle to be `k * base_angle`. I then need to find which *k* from 1 to n-2 would minimize the difference between target angle and the given angle *a*. So, I'm essentially looking for an integer *k* to minimize `|k * (180/n) - a|`.\n\nTo make the process more efficient, I want to avoid a brute-force approach.  The idea is to transform the problem to finding `target_k_float = a * n / 180.0` and round it to get the closest integer. This simplifies to just finding the closest integer to the result of `a * n / 180`. So I use `k_candidate = int(round(target_k_float))` .\n\nHowever, I need to make sure this `k_candidate` is within the valid range of *k*, which is from 1 to *n*-2.   So I just make sure `optimal_k = max(1, min(n - 2, k_candidate))`.\n\nFinally, since I fixed vertex 2 to be 1, the `v1` is `2`.  Then the vertex `v3` will then be `2 + optimal_k`. This is guaranteed to produce vertices with the appropriate `k` to find an approximate solution. The distinctness of the three vertices is guaranteed.\n\nThe algorithm is therefore to calculate base angle, target angle, round, clamp the results, then map to vertices in an array with zero indexed array. I have to make sure the vertices chosen are distinct, that the calculations are correct, and the solution isn't unnecessarily computationally intensive. The process is extremely simple, and the algorithm itself is O(1) in time because the math can be calculated and clamped with no iteration.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Circumcircle:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of a polygon inscribed in a circle (an inscribed angle) is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.\n3.  **Arc Measure:** In a regular `n`-gon, the arc between any two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n\nLet `v1, v2, v3` be three distinct vertices. The angle `v1-v2-v3` intercepts the arc between `v1` and `v3` that does not contain `v2`.\nLet `k` be the number of sides (or segments) on this intercepted arc.\nThe measure of this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\nTherefore, the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is `(1/2) * k * (360/n) = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Values of k**\n\n*   The minimum number of segments `k` on an arc between two distinct vertices (not containing a third chosen vertex) is 1. For example, if `v2` is vertex 1, `v1` is vertex 2, and `v3` is vertex 3, the angle `2-1-3` intercepts the arc `2-3`, which has 1 segment. The angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\n*   The maximum number of segments `k` occurs when `v1` and `v3` are as far apart as possible from `v2` on the arc. For example, if `v2` is vertex 1, `v1` is vertex 2, and `v3` is vertex `n`, the angle `2-1-n` intercepts the arc `2-n`. This arc has `n-2` segments. The angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. This is the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon.\n\nSo, the possible values for `k` range from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles are `1 * (180/n), 2 * (180/n), ..., (n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal k**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `|k - a * (n/180)|`.\nLet `target_k_float = a * n / 180.0`.\nWe are looking for an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `target_k_float`.\n\nThe integer closest to `target_k_float` is `round(target_k_float)`. Let's call this `k_candidate`.\nWe then need to adjust `k_candidate` to ensure it falls within the valid range `[1, n-2]`:\n*   If `k_candidate < 1`, the closest valid `k` is `1`.\n*   If `k_candidate > n-2`, the closest valid `k` is `n-2`.\n*   Otherwise, `k_candidate` itself is the optimal `k`.\n\nThis can be concisely written as `optimal_k = max(1, min(n - 2, int(round(target_k_float))))`.\n\n**Constructing the Vertices**\n\nOnce `optimal_k` is found, we need to output `v1, v2, v3`. We can choose them systematically:\n1.  Let `v2` be vertex `1`.\n2.  Let `v1` be vertex `2`.\n3.  Then `v3` should be vertex `2 + optimal_k`.\n\nLet's check if these vertices are distinct and valid:\n*   `v2 = 1`.\n*   `v1 = 2`.\n*   `v3 = 2 + optimal_k`.\nSince `optimal_k` is at least 1, `v3` will be at least `2 + 1 = 3`.\nSince `optimal_k` is at most `n-2`, `v3` will be at most `2 + (n-2) = n`.\nSo, `v1=2`, `v2=1`, and `v3` (which is between 3 and `n` inclusive) are always distinct and valid vertex indices.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=68)**\n\n1.  `n=4`, `a=68`.\n2.  `target_k_float = 68 * 4 / 180.0 = 272 / 180.0 = 1.511...`\n3.  `k_candidate = int(round(1.511...)) = int(2) = 2`.\n4.  Valid range for `k` is `[1, n-2] = [1, 4-2] = [1, 2]`.\n5.  `optimal_k = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`.\n6.  Vertices: `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=2+optimal_k = 2+2 = 4`.\n7.  Output: `2 1 4`. This matches one of the example correct outputs.\n\nThis approach is `O(1)` as it involves a few arithmetic operations and is highly efficient. Floating-point precision should be sufficient for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate target_k_float:\n    # We want to minimize |k * (180/n) - a|\n    # This is equivalent to minimizing |k - a * (n/180)|\n    # So we calculate the ideal k value as a float.\n    target_k_float = float(a) * n / 180.0\n    \n    # Find the integer k_candidate closest to target_k_float.\n    # Python's round() function rounds to the nearest even number for values exactly halfway (e.g., 2.5 rounds to 2, 3.5 rounds to 4).\n    # This behavior is acceptable because if two k values are equally close, any of them is a valid solution.\n    k_candidate = int(round(target_k_float))\n\n    # Ensure optimal_k is within the valid range [1, n-2].\n    # The smallest possible k is 1, and the largest is n-2.\n    optimal_k = max(1, min(n - 2, k_candidate))\n\n    # Construct the vertices using the optimal_k.\n    # We can fix v2 to be vertex 1.\n    # We can fix v1 to be vertex 2.\n    # Then v3 will be vertex (2 + optimal_k).\n    # This ensures v1, v2, v3 are distinct:\n    # v2 = 1\n    # v1 = 2\n    # v3 = 2 + optimal_k.
