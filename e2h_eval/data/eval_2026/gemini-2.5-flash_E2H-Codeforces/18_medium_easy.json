    "thought": "**My Goal: To efficiently calculate the sum of reachable points for a frog jumping problem.**\n\nI'm given a frog that can jump `+a` or `-b` within the interval `[0, x]`. My ultimate task is to sum the number of distinct reachable integers, `f(i)`, from 0 to `m`.\n\nMy thought process starts by rigorously defining what \"reachable\" means in this context. It's not just whether a number *can* be reached, but *whether it can be reached via a path that remains entirely within the bounds of `[0, x]`*. This quickly becomes a reachability problem on a directed graph, where nodes are integers and edges are the jumps.\n\nI then focus on the structure of these reachable points. They must be multiples of the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `a` and `b`.  If `gcd(a, b) = g`, I can rewrite the problem with scaled numbers and essentially assume that `a` and `b` are coprime. This simplification leads me to consider the Frobenius coin problem which helps me to reason about integers `N >= (a-1)(b-1)`. I get that the reachable integers will eventually just be all integers greater than some threshold.\n\nA crucial concept emerges:  I need a function `dist[i]`. It represents the *minimum maximum value encountered* along a valid path to reach integer `i`, staying within the range `[0, X]`. The key is defining the optimal `X`.  Initially, I try using Breadth-First Search (BFS) for reachability, but quickly see this is too slow for large values of `x`.\n\nI explore the idea of a `0-1 BFS` algorithm, to calculate the `dist[i]` array. By analyzing how points beyond a certain threshold will have `dist[p] = p`, I come to a conclusion that I only need to compute `dist[p]` for values of p up to `2 * max(a, b)` for the most efficient solution.\n\nI'm convinced, that this approach to calculating the `dist[]` array to find the *maximum value encountered* on any path to `i` is the right strategy.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it starts at `0` and never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `dist[p]` be the minimum `X` such that `p` is reachable from `0` and all intermediate positions on the path are within `[0, X]`. If `p` is unreachable, `dist[p] = infinity`.\n`f(x)` is then the count of all `p` such that `0 <= p <= x` and `dist[p] <= x`.\n\nThe values `a` and `b` can be up to `10^5`, while `m` can be up to `10^9`. This suggests that we cannot iterate through all `i` from `0` to `m` or compute `dist[p]` for all `p` up to `m`.\n\n**1. Properties of Reachable Points**\nAll reachable points `p` must be of the form `k*a - l*b` for non-negative integers `k, l`.\nThus, all reachable points are multiples of `g = gcd(a, b)`. We can divide `a, b, m` by `g` and multiply the final sum by `g`. For simplicity, let's assume `g=1` for now.\n\n**2. Computing `dist[p]`**\nWe can compute `dist[p]` using a 0-1 BFS (Dijkstra with a deque).\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[p] = infinity` for `p > 0`.\nThe states in our BFS are `(position, max_val_on_path)`.\nWhen processing `(u, current_max)`:\n- To jump `u -> u+a`: `next_pos = u+a`, `new_max = max(current_max, next_pos)`. If `new_max < dist[next_pos]`, update `dist[next_pos]` and push `(next_pos, new_max)` to the right of the deque (cost 0 jump).\n- To jump `u -> u-b`: `next_pos = u-b`, `new_max = current_max` (since `u-b < u`). If `next_pos >= 0` and `new_max < dist[next_pos]`, update `dist[next_pos]` and push `(next_pos, new_max)` to the left of the deque (cost 0 jump).\n\nThe critical observation is that for `p` large enough, `dist[p]` will be equal to `p`.\nThis is because if `p >= a`, then `p` can be reached from `p-a` by a `+a` jump. If `dist[p-a] = p-a`, then `dist[p]` would be `max(dist[p-a], p) = max(p-a, p) = p`.\nThe values `dist[p]` can be greater than `p` only for relatively small `p`. For example, to reach `0` from `0` via `a -> a-b -> a-2b -> ... -> 0`, the maximum value seen is `a`. So `dist[0]` could be `a` if `a` is the smallest such maximum. (In our BFS, `dist[0]` is initialized to `0`, but it can be updated if a path `0 -> ... -> 0` with a larger maximum is found, but we only care about minimum maximums, so `dist[0]` will stay `0`.)\n\nThe maximum `p` for which `dist[p]` might be greater than `p` is typically around `max(a, b)`. Let's consider `L = a + b`. If `p >= L`, then `p` can be reached from `p-a` by a `+a` jump. If `p-a` is reachable, then `dist[p]` is at most `max(dist[p-a], p)`. If `dist[p-a]` is `p-a`, then `dist[p]` is `p`.\nIt can be shown that for `p >= 2*max(a, b)`, `dist[p] = p`. A safe upper bound for `p` to compute `dist[p]` explicitly is `A_MAX = 2 * (a + b)`. Since `a, b <= 10^5`, `A_MAX` is about `4 * 10^5`.\nWe will compute `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `A_MAX`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Sum `sum(f(i))`**\nAfter computing `dist[p]` for `p` up to `A_MAX`:\nFor `i` from `0` to `m`: `f(i)` is the count of `p` such that `0 <= p <= i` and `dist[p] <= i`.\nLet `count_le[X]` be the number of reachable points `p` such that `dist[p] <= X`.\nThis can be computed by sorting all `p` (that are reachable with `dist[p] < infinity`) by their `dist[p]` values.\nLet `reachable_points` be a list of `(dist[p], p)` pairs for all `p` such that `dist[p] < infinity`.\nSort `reachable_points` by `dist[p]`.\nIterate `X` from `0` to `A_MAX`. Maintain a running count `current_reachable_count`.\nWhen `X` increases, add points `p` for which `dist[p] == X` to `current_reachable_count`.\nLet `num_points_up_to_X[X]` be the number of reachable points `p` such that `dist[p] <= X` AND `p <= X`.\nThis is exactly `f(X)` for `X <= A_MAX`.\n\nFor `i > A_MAX`:\n`f(i)` is the number of `p` such that `0 <= p <= i` and `dist[p] <= i`.\nWe know that for `p > A_MAX`, `dist[p] = p`.\nSo, for `p` such that `A_MAX < p <= i`, `dist[p] = p`. Since `p <= i`, `dist[p] <= i` is satisfied.\nThe points `p` in `[0, A_MAX]` such that `dist[p] <= i` are also counted.\nSo, `f(i) = (number of reachable points p in [0, A_MAX] with dist[p] <= i) + (number of reachable points p in (A_MAX, i] with dist[p] <= i)`.\nThe second term is simply `(i - A_MAX) / g` (if `g=1`, then `i - A_MAX`). This is because all `p` in `(A_MAX, i]` are reachable and `dist[p]=p`.\nThe first term can be found efficiently. Let `cnt_le_dist[k]` be the number of reachable points `p <= A_MAX` such that `dist[p] <= k`. This can be precomputed.\nSo, for `i > A_MAX`, `f(i) = cnt_le_dist[i] + (i - A_MAX)` (if `g=1`).\n\n**Corrected approach for `f(i)` calculation:**\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`.\nDivide `a, b, m` by `g`. `a' = a/g, b' = b/g, m' = m/g`.\nCompute `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `A_MAX = 2 * (a' + b')`.\n`dist[p]` stores the minimum `X'` such that `p*g` is reachable within `[0, X'*g]`.\nSo, `dist[p]` is `X'`.\nLet `reachable_points_data` be a list of `(dist[p], p)` for `p` from `0` to `A_MAX` where `dist[p]` is finite.\nSort this list by `dist[p]`.\nCreate a prefix sum array `cnt_le_dist[k]` where `cnt_le_dist[k]` is the number of points `p <= A_MAX` such that `dist[p] <= k`.\n`cnt_le_dist` array size is `A_MAX + 1`.\n\nTotal sum `S = 0`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `min(m', A_MAX)`:\n  `f(i)`: Count `p` in `[0, i]` such that `dist[p] <= i`.\n  This can be done by iterating through `reachable_points_data`.\n  `current_f_i = 0`\n  For `(d, p_val)` in `reachable_points_data`:\n    If `p_val <= i` and `d <= i`:\n      `current_f_i += 1`\n  `S += current_f_i`\n\nThis is still slow for `min(m', A_MAX)`.\nInstead, we can use a sweep line approach or another prefix sum.\nLet `points_at_dist[k]` be a list of `p` values such that `dist[p] = k`.\n`points_at_dist` is an array of lists, indexed by `k` up to `A_MAX`.\n\n`ans = 0`\n`num_reachable_p_le_i = 0`\n`current_p_values = [0] * (A_MAX + 1)` # `current_p_values[j]` = 1 if `j` is reachable and `dist[j] <= i`, 0 otherwise.\n`current_p_count = 0`\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `min(m', A_MAX)`:\n  For `p_val` in `points_at_dist[i]`:\n    If `current_p_values[p_val] == 0`: # If this point `p_val` was not counted yet\n      `current_p_values[p_val] = 1`\n      `current_p_count += 1`\n  `ans += current_p_count`\n\nThis is `O(A_MAX^2)` or `O(A_MAX * log A_MAX)` if we sort points. Too slow. `A_MAX` is `4*10^5`.\n`A_MAX` is roughly `2*(a+b)`.\nThe `dist` values can also be `A_MAX`.\nThe sum `f(i)` is `sum_{i=0}^m (count of p in [0, i] s.t. dist[p] <= i)`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{p=0}^m (count of i in [p, m] s.t. dist[p] <= i)`.\nFor a fixed `p`, we need to count `i` such that `p <= i <= m` and `dist[p] <= i`.\nThis means `i >= max(p, dist[p])`.\nSo for a fixed `p`, the count of `i` is `m - max(p, dist[p]) + 1`, if `m >= max(p, dist[p])`. Otherwise `0`.\n\nSo, `S = sum_{p=0}^{m'} max(0, m' - max(p, dist[p]) + 1)`.\nThis is for `p` up to `m'`.\nWe need to split this into two parts:\n1. `p` from `0` to `A_MAX`: `sum_{p=0}^{A_MAX} max(0, m' - max(p, dist[p]) + 1)`\n2. `p` from `A_MAX+1` to `m'`: For these `p`, `dist[p] = p`.\n   So, `sum_{p=A_MAX+1}^{m'} max(0, m' - max(p, p) + 1) = sum_{p=A_MAX+1}^{m'} max(0, m' - p + 1)`.\n   This is an arithmetic series: `(m'- (A_MAX+1) + 1) + (m' - (A_MAX+2) + 1) + ... + (m' - m' + 1)`.\n   Which is `(m' - A_MAX) + (m' - A_MAX - 1) + ... + 1`.\n   This sum is `(m' - A_MAX) * (m' - A_MAX + 1) / 2`. Let `K_prime = m' - A_MAX`. The sum is `K_prime * (K_prime + 1) / 2`.\n   This part is only added if `m' > A_MAX`.\n\nThe first part `sum_{p=0}^{A_MAX} max(0, m' - max(p, dist[p]) + 1)` can be computed by iterating `p` from `0` to `A_MAX`.\nFor each `p`, if `dist[p]` is finite:\n  `lower_bound_for_i = max(p, dist[p])`\n  If `m' >= lower_bound_for_i`:\n    `ans += (m' - lower_bound_for_i + 1)`\n\nFinally, multiply the total `ans` by `g`.\n\n**Example 1: m=7, a=5, b=3**\n`g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`. `m'=7, a'=5, b'=3`.\n`A_MAX = 2 * (5+3) = 16`.\nCompute `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `16`.\n`q = deque([(0,0)])`, `dist = [inf]*17`, `dist[0]=0`\n\nBFS steps:\n- `(0,0)`:\n  - `+5`: `(5,5)`. `dist[5]=5`. `q.append((5,5))`\n  - `-3`: Not allowed (`<0`).\n- `(5,5)` (from `q.popleft()`):\n  - `+5`: `(10,10)`. `dist[10]=10`. `q.append((10,10))`\n  - `-3`: `(2,5)`. `dist[2]=5`. `q.appendleft((2,5))`\n- `(2,5)`:\n  - `+5`: `(7,7)`. `dist[7]=7`. `q.append((7,7))`\n  - `-3`: Not allowed (`<0`).\n- `(10,10)`:\n  - `+5`: `(15,15)`. `dist[15]=15`. `q.append((15,15))`\n  - `-3`: `(7,10)`. `dist[7]` is `7`. `10` is not `<7`.

But `2*(a+b)` is safer. For `a=1, b=10^5`, `A_MAX` is `2*(1+10^5) = 200002`. This is small enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # Scale down m, a, b by gcd(a, b)\n    # The actual sum will be (scaled_sum) * g\n    m_scaled = m // g\n    a_scaled = a // g\n    b_scaled = b // g\n\n    # A_MAX is the upper bound for positions for which we explicitly compute dist[p]\n    # For p > A_MAX, we assume dist[p] = p.\n    # A safe upper bound for A_MAX is 2 * (a_scaled + b_scaled)\n    # This ensures that any \"problematic\" dist[p] (where dist[p] > p) are covered.\n    # The actual maximum value needed for dist array could be smaller (e.g. max(a,b) or a+b)\n    # but 2*(a_scaled+b_scaled) is a robust choice.\n    A_MAX = 2 * (a_scaled + b_scaled)\n    \n    # If m_scaled is very small, A_MAX can be capped at m_scaled\n    # However, for the BFS, we need to consider positions up to A_MAX for dist calculation\n    # Let's keep A_MAX as computed and just limit the loop for sum calculation.\n\n    # dist[p] stores the minimum X such that p is reachable from 0 and all intermediate points are in [0, X].\n    # Initialize dist with infinity.\n    dist = [-1] * (A_MAX + 1) # Using -1 for infinity for non-negative distances\n\n    q = deque()\n\n    # Start at 0, max_val_on_path is 0\n    dist[0] = 0\n    q.append((0, 0)) # (position, max_val_on_path)\n\n    while q:\n        curr_pos, curr_max = q.popleft()\n\n        # If we found a better path to curr_pos already, skip\n        # Note: dist[curr_pos] could be updated by a path with same max_val,\n        # but popleft ensures we process nodes in non-decreasing order of max_val.\n        # So if curr_max > dist[curr_pos], it means we found a path with a larger max_val\n        # that was pushed earlier, so we can skip.\n        if curr_max > dist[curr_pos] and dist[curr_pos] != -1: # -1 indicates infinity\n            continue\n\n        # Try jump +a_scaled\n        next_pos_a = curr_pos + a_scaled\n        new_max_a = max(curr_max, next_pos_a)\n        \n        if next_pos_a <= A_MAX:\n            if dist[next_pos_a] == -1 or new_max_a < dist[next_pos_a]:\n                dist[next_pos_a] = new_max_a\n                q.append((next_pos_a, new_max_a)) # Add to right (cost 0)\n        # If next_pos_a > A_MAX, we don't store its dist value explicitly.\n        # For such points, dist[p] = p, which will be handled in the summation.\n\n        # Try jump -b_scaled\n        next_pos_b = curr_pos - b_scaled\n        new_max_b = curr_max # Max value on path doesn't change when jumping down.\n        \n        if next_pos_b >= 0:\n            if next_pos_b <= A_MAX:\n                if dist[next_pos_b] == -1 or new_max_b < dist[next_pos_b]:\n                    dist[next_pos_b] = new_max_b\n                    q.appendleft((next_pos_b, new_max_b)) # Add to left (cost 0)\n            # If next_pos_b > A_MAX, we don't store its dist value explicitly.\n\n    total_sum_f_i = 0\n\n    # Part 1: Sum for i from 0 to min(m_scaled, A_MAX)\n    # For each p in [0, A_MAX], if dist[p] is finite, calculate its contribution\n    for p in range(A_MAX + 1):\n        if dist[p] != -1: # If p is reachable\n            # f(i) counts p such that p <= i and dist[p] <= i\n            # For a fixed p, we need to count i such that:\n            #   p <= i <= m_scaled\n            #   dist[p] <= i <= m_scaled\n            # This means i >= max(p, dist[p])\n            \n            lower_bound_for_i = max(p, dist[p])\n            \n            if m_scaled >= lower_bound_for_i:\n                total_sum_f_i += (m_scaled - lower_bound_for_i + 1)\n    \n    # Part 2: Sum for i from A_MAX + 1 to m_scaled\n    # For p in (A_MAX, m_scaled], we know dist[p] = p.\n    # We need to sum max(0, m_scaled - max(p, dist[p]) + 1)\n    # Which simplifies to max(0, m_scaled - p + 1) since dist[p] = p\n    \n    if m_scaled > A_MAX:\n        # This is an arithmetic series: (m_scaled - (A_MAX+1) + 1) + ... + (m_scaled - m_scaled + 1)\n        # = (m_scaled - A_MAX) + (m_scaled - A_MAX - 1) + ... + 1\n        # Let K_prime = m_scaled - A_MAX.
