Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for counting those non-degenerate triangles.**\n\nThe problem's set up: we're given ranges for integer side lengths (x, y, z) and need to find how many valid triangles we can form.  A non-degenerate triangle needs to satisfy the triangle inequality. Since the ranges are defined as  `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, a few inequalities are always true. The critical check boils down to `x + y > z`.\n\nMy strategy: I'm going to iterate through the possible values of *x* and *y* systematically. Once I've fixed *x* and *y*, figuring out the valid values of *z* becomes relatively straightforward. The key is to find the suitable range for *z* given that  `C <= z <= D` and also `z < x + y` (based on the triangle inequality). I want to count the number of *z* values in the intersection of these two ranges. The formula `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` precisely does this, ensuring we count only valid *z* values and avoid negative counts.\n\nThe core of the problem becomes optimizing the nested loops.  Simply iterating all `x` and `y` combinations from their respective ranges would be too slow. This is where I start thinking in terms of sums. I define a new variable *S = x + y*.  I then iterate the possible sums of `x` and `y` values.  Now, the number of valid `z` values is derived efficiently based on the minimum and maximum `S` value. For a fixed *S*, I need to find the number of pairs *(x, y)* that give the specific *S* value within the specified `x` and `y` range. The approach `[max(A, S-C), min(B, S-B)]` helps me achieve this, thus finding a lower bound and an upper bound. The `N_S` variable represents this count of such `(x, y)` pairs. I need to sum `N_S` multiplied by a function of `z` over the relevant values of S. The valid *z* range is [C, `min(D, S-1)`]. I also need to make sure the loop that does this is efficient, and doesn't take too long.\n\nLet me think about how to write the code: I'll use nested loops. It will iterate over all possible values of `S = x + y` and calculate the number of pairs `N_S` by taking `S = x + y`.\nThe time complexity hinges on the ranges of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. The constraints are that these values can be as large as `5 * 10^5`. I will need to verify that this nested loop approach is fast enough. The `sum` calculation will be a time of `O(B+C)`. With the use of Python, and not many variables the `B+C` approach is well within the time limit. Also, I need to make sure that the calculation `max(0, ...)` is correct. There is no major optimization here that can be done. I'll trace through a few examples to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\nThe final step is the implementation: Based on the constraints, this approach should be efficient. I will write a simple code, including these steps, making sure to handle the edge cases. I can handle this in Python. I'll make sure to verify that the edge cases are correct, and all the loops are valid. Then, I am done.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequalities must hold:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, it implies `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z` (and since `x, y, z` are positive integers, `x >= A >= 1`):\n- `y + z > x`: Since `z >= y` and `y >= x`, we have `y + z >= y + y >= y + x > x`. This condition is always satisfied.\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This condition is also always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA brute-force approach iterating over all `x`, `y`, `z` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1))`, which is too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over possible values of `x` and `y`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, counting valid `z` values.\nThe range for `x` is `[A, B]`.\nThe range for `y` is `[B, C]`.\nThe total number of `(x, y)` pairs is `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1)`, which can be up to `(5 * 10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}`, still too many pairs to iterate.\n\nA more efficient approach is to iterate over the sum `S = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `S` is `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`).\nThe maximum possible value for `S` is `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`).\nSo, `S` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value for `B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`. This range is manageable for iteration.\n\nFor each possible sum `S` in `[A+B, B+C]`:\n1. **Count `N_S`**: Determine how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `x + y = S`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\n   Since `y = S - x`, the condition `B <= y <= C` becomes `B <= S - x <= C`.\n   This can be rewritten as two inequalities for `x`:\n   - `S - x <= C  => x >= S - C`\n   - `S - x >= B  => x <= S - B`\n   Combining these with `A <= x <= B`, `x` must satisfy:\n   `max(A, S - C) <= x <= min(B, S - B)`\n   The number of such `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs) is `N_S = max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\n\n2. **Count `count_z`**: For a fixed `S = x + y`, determine how many `z` values exist such that `C <= z <= D` and `x + y > z` (i.e., `S > z`).\n   Combining these, `z` must satisfy:\n   `C <= z <= min(D, S - 1)`\n   The number of such `z` values is `count_z = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is the sum of `N_S * count_z` for all possible `S`:\n`TotalTriangles = sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} (N_S * count_z)`\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is `O(B+C)`, which is at most `O(10^6)` operations. This is efficient enough for the given constraints. The space complexity is `O(1)`.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n- `x` in `[1, 2]`\n- `y` in `[2, 3]`\n- `z` in `[3, 4]`\n- `S = x + y` ranges from `A+B=1+2=3` to `B+C=2+3=5`.\n\n- **For `S = 3`**:\n  - `x` must be in `[max(1, 3-3), min(2, 3-2)] = [max(1,0), min(2,1)] = [1, 1]`. So `x=1` (and `y=2`). `N_3 = 1`.\n  - `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 3-1)] = [3, min(4,2)] = [3, 2]`. No valid `z` (`z_lower_bound > z_upper_bound`). `count_z = 0`.\n  - Contribution: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n- **For `S = 4`**:\n  - `x` must be in `[max(1, 4-3), min(2, 4-2)] = [max(1,1), min(2,2)] = [1, 2]`. So `x=1` (y=3) or `x=2` (y=2). `N_4 = 2`.\n  - `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 4-1)] = [3, min(4,3)] = [3, 3]`. So `z=3`. `count_z = 1`.\n  - Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`. (Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`)\n\n- **For `S = 5`**:\n  - `x` must be in `[max(1, 5-3), min(2, 5-2)] = [max(1,2), min(2,3)] = [2, 2]`. So `x=2` (and `y=3`). `N_5 = 1`.\n  - `z` must be in `[3, min(4, 5-1)] = [3, min(4,4)] = [3, 4]`. So `z=3` or `z=4`. `count_z = 2`.\n  - Contribution: `1 * 2 = 2`. (Triangles: `(2,3,3)`, `(2,3,4)`)\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
