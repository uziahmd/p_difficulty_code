There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Thought Process: Knockout Tournament Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem where I need to figure out the most games a winner can play in a knockout tournament, but there's a catch: players can only compete if the difference in their game counts is at most one. I'm calling the number of games a player has played 'k'.\n\nMy initial approach is to consider the winner and how many games, 'X', they play. To play 'X' games, they've got to win them all. I'll call the winner 'W'. So, the rule means that if W has played 'k' games, their opponent has to have played either k-1, k, or k+1 games. Since everyone starts at zero games, the very first game is between two players who have also played zero games.\n\nI want to know how many players are needed to get a winner who has played 'k' games. I am using `f(k)` to capture this, but it turns out I don't need this to be the core strategy.  I define `N(k)` to the smallest number of *active* players.\n\nI start by looking at base cases. If k=1, the winner plays one game. That means we need two players. If k=2, it's a bit more complex, and I'm looking at how we can minimize the players to make it work. I realize that how the games are arranged (which player plays which) will determine how many games the winner can ultimately play.\n\nThinking deeper, I rephrase the problem in terms of building up the games. The most players that can play each other have to be active players with as many games played as possible. The more equal the amount of games played the more games the winner can play.\n\nI introduce P(k) as the minimum initial players to get a winner who played k games.  I try to define the relationship between `P(k-1)` and `P(k)`.  \n\nThis leads me to a crucial observation from an example case. If n=4 (4 players), the rule means that two players can play 2 games. This made me think that the balanced structure is key, instead of sequential games.  If a player plays against more advanced players it will take fewer rounds of matches (the example showed this). The strategy should allow the number of games to increase as efficiently as possible.\n\nI keep refining the idea. I'm calling the final match of the winner against an opponent. I reframe it as `N(k)`, trying to build the recursion.\n\nI'm starting to formalize a recurrence relation to figure out the number of players. If the winner has played 'k' games, the final game needs an opponent with a game count differing by at most 1. I try to express it as `P(k) = P(k-1) + P(j)` where `j` represents the opponent's game count. I choose the best j.  It leads me to think that minimizing this becomes the key to efficiency. I realize that the number of players needed grows in a Fibonacci-like pattern.  `dp[k]` means minimum players for the winner to play k games. Then `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. We are given the total number of initial players, `n`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the recurrence for `dp[k]`:\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   `k=0`: A player who hasn't played any games is a potential winner. `dp[0] = 1`.\n    *   `k=1`: To play 1 game, a player `W` (0 games played) must play an opponent `O` (0 games played). The rule `|0-0| <= 1` is satisfied. `W` wins. This requires 2 players. So, `dp[1] = dp[0] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n2.  **General Case for `dp[k]` (where `k >= 2`):**\n    To produce a winner `W` who has played `k` games, `W` must win their `k`-th (final) game.\n    Before this `k`-th game, `W` has already played `k-1` games and won them all.\n    `W` needs an opponent `O`. Let `O` have played `j` games.\n    According to the rule, `| (k-1) - j | <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n\n    To minimize the total number of initial players `dp[k]`, we need to consider the minimum players required to produce `W` (who has played `k-1` games) and `O` (who has played `j` games). These two groups of players must be disjoint.\n    *   If `O` has played `j = k-2` games: The total players needed would be `dp[k-1]` (for `W`) + `dp[k-2]` (for `O`).\n    *   If `O` has played `j = k-1` games: The total players needed would be `dp[k-1]` (for `W`) + `dp[k-1]` (for `O`).\n    *   If `O` has played `j = k` games: This means `O` has played *more* games than `W` before their match. This scenario is generally not considered when defining `dp[k]` as the minimum players for the *overall* winner to play `k` games, as it implies `O` is the more \"advanced\" player. If `O` were to win, it would be `O` playing `k+1` games, not `W` playing `k` games. So, for `W` to be the winner of `k` games, `W` must come from `dp[k-1]` players, and `O` from `dp[j]` players where `j <= k-1`.\n\n    Comparing the first two options:\n    `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` vs `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`.\n    Since `dp` values are non-decreasing (`dp[0]=1, dp[1]=2`), `dp[k-2]` will always be less than or equal to `dp[k-1]`.\n    Therefore, `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` will always be the minimum choice for `dp[k]`.\n\n    So, the recurrence relation is `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n    This is the Fibonacci sequence!\n\nLet's list the first few terms:\n*   `dp[0] = 1`\n*   `dp[1] = 2`\n*   `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n*   `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`\n*   `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n*   `dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 8 + 5 = 13`\n\nThis sequence corresponds to `F_{k+2}` where `F_i` is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, ...`.\nSo `dp[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe are given `n` (number of players, `2 <= n <= 10^18`). We need to find the maximum `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nThe algorithm is to generate Fibonacci numbers `F_i` until `F_i` exceeds `n`. The maximum `k` will be `i-2`.\n\nExample walkthrough:\n*   `n=2`:\n    *   `k=0`: `dp[0]=1 <= 2`.\n    *   `k=1`: `dp[1]=2 <= 2`. Maximum `k=1`.\n*   `n=3`:\n    *   `k=0`: `dp[0]=1 <= 3`.\n    *   `k=1`: `dp[1]=2 <= 3`.\n    *   `k=2`: `dp[2]=3 <= 3`. Maximum `k=2`.\n*   `n=4`:\n    *   `k=0`: `dp[0]=1 <= 4`.\n    *   `k=1`: `dp[1]=2 <= 4`.\n    *   `k=2`: `dp[2]=3 <= 4`.\n    *   `k=3`: `dp[3]=5 > 4`. Maximum `k=2`.\n*   `n=10`:\n    *   `k=0`: `dp[0]=1 <= 10`.\n    *   `k=1`: `dp[1]=2 <= 10`.\n    *   `k=2`: `dp[2]=3 <= 10`.\n    *   `k=3`: `dp[3]=5 <= 10`.\n    *   `k=4`: `dp[4]=8 <= 10`.\n    *   `k=5`: `dp[5]=13 > 10`. Maximum `k=4`.\n\nThis matches the example outputs.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. `F_90` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So `k` will be around `88`. We can simply iterate and calculate Fibonacci numbers.\n\nImplementation details:\nInitialize `a = 1` (representing `dp[0]`) and `b = 2` (representing `dp[1]`).\nInitialize `ans = 1` (for `n=2`, `k=1` is the answer).\nIf `n=2`, the loop won't run, `ans` will be 1.\nIf `n > 2`, we start from `k=2`.\nLoop:\n  Calculate `c = a + b`.\n  If `c > n`, then the current `k` (which corresponds to `b`) is the maximum.\n  Update `a = b`, `b = c`.\n  Increment `ans`.\n\nThe loop should continue as long as `b <= n`.\nLet `a` and `b` be `dp[k-1]` and `dp[k]` respectively.\nInitially, `a=1` (`dp[0]`), `b=2` (`dp[1]`). `games_played = 1`.\nWhile `b <= n`:\n  `next_dp = a + b`\n  If `next_dp > n`: break (cannot achieve `games_played + 1` games)\n  `a = b`\n  `b = next_dp`\n  `games_played += 1`\nReturn `games_played`.\n\nConsider `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, games_played=1`.\nLoop condition `b <= n` (2 <= 2) is true.\n`next_dp = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n`next_dp > n` (3 > 2) is true. Break.\nReturn `games_played = 1`. Correct.\n\nConsider `n=3`:\n`a=1, b=2, games_played=1`.\nLoop 1: `b <= n` (2 <= 3) is true.\n  `next_dp = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n  `next_dp > n` (3 > 3) is false.\n  `a = 2`, `b = 3`.\n  `games_played = 2`.\nLoop 2: `b <= n` (3 <= 3) is true.\n  `next_dp = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n  `next_dp > n` (5 > 3) is true. Break.\nReturn `games_played = 2`.
