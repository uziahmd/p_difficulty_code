Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My primary objective here is to tackle the \"Colored Boots\" problem, a competitive programming challenge.**  The core of the issue involves pairing left and right boots, where each boot has a color, either a specific letter or a wildcard '?'. The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs, meaning boots with the same specific color or where one (or both) boots have the wildcard '?'.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:** I've carefully broken down the problem: we have `n` left and `n` right boots, their colors as input, and compatibility rules. The output requires the maximum number of pairs and the index of the matched boots.\n\n**Strategy - Greedy Approach:** My instinct says a greedy approach is best. I should prioritize pairings that are the most restrictive first. This maximizes the utilization of specific boots. The prioritization order is as follows: (1) Match boots with the same specific color. (2) Pair specific boots with wildcard boots. (3) Match wildcard boots with other wildcard boots. This prioritizes definitive matches before any wildcards, maximizing possible later combinations.\n\n**Data Structures:** To efficiently handle this, I am using a `defaultdict(list)` called `left_indices` and `right_indices`. Each color ('a' to 'z' and '?') gets a list containing the 1-indexed indices of boots with that color, this helps with fast lookups.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n1. Populate `left_indices` and `right_indices`.\n2. I need to store the matched pairs, a list called `result_pairs`.\n3. In Phase 1, match boots of the same color, iterating through 'a' to 'z'. If `left_indices` and `right_indices` for a color `char` are not empty, I pair them, adding the indices to `result_pairs`.\n4. In Phase 2, handle the next most restricted pairs: pairing `left_indices[char]` with `right_indices['?']` and `left_indices['?']` with `right_indices[char]`.\n5. Finally, Phase 3: Pair remaining wildcards, `left_indices['?']` with `right_indices['?']`.\n6. Output the number of pairs and the list of boot pairings.\n\n**Complexity & Considerations:** My time complexity should be O(N), as each boot will be visited a constant number of times for lookup or for pairing. Memory should also be O(N) to store the boot indices. Python's `list.pop()` is O(1). I must always remember the 1-based indexing for output. The logic is now implemented with sys read and write, as is normal in the environment.\n\n**Edge Cases and Validation:** I'm testing edge cases - single boot pairs and scenarios with all wildcards.  I've reviewed examples and the steps with different specific boots to make certain my process works. The core idea should work as the prioritized scheme and pop functionality allows a constant-time access to any possible viable boot pair and pair them immediately.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left and one right boot. Boot colors can be specific (lowercase Latin letters) or indefinite ('?'). Compatibility rules are:\n1.  Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2.  An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe need to output the total number of pairs and the indices of the boots in each pair.\n\n**Greedy Strategy**\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should prioritize matches that are more restrictive. If a boot can only be matched in a very specific way, we should make that match first. This leaves more flexible boots ('?') available for other matches where they might be the only option.\n\nThe priority order for matching is:\n\n1.  **Specific color with the same specific color (e.g., 'a' with 'a'):** These are the most restrictive matches. A left boot of color 'c' and a right boot of color 'c' can only be perfectly matched with each other. If either is matched with a '?' boot, it consumes a flexible '?' boot that could have been used for other purposes. Thus, it's always optimal to pair identical specific colors first.\n\n2.  **Specific color with an indefinite color (e.g., 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a'):** After exhausting all identical specific color matches, any remaining specific color boot ('c') must be matched with a '?' boot if it is to be paired at all. Similarly, any '?' boot that can be matched with a specific color boot ('c') should do so, as this uses up a specific boot that might otherwise go unmatched. The order between `(c, ?)` and `(?, c)` doesn't affect the total count for a given specific color `c`, as each boot is used once.\n\n3.  **Indefinite color with an indefinite color ('?' with '?'):** These are the least restrictive matches. '?' boots can match anything. They should be used as a last resort, after all specific color boots have been considered for pairing.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    We'll use `defaultdict(list)` to store the 1-indexed indices of boots for each color.\n    `left_indices[char]` will store a list of indices for left boots of color `char`.\n    `right_indices[char]` will store a list of indices for right boots of color `char`.\n\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    Iterate through the input strings `l` and `r` from `i = 0` to `n-1`. For each boot, add its `(i+1)` index to the corresponding `left_indices` or `right_indices` list based on its color.\n\n3.  **Phase 1: Specific-Specific Matches (c, c)**\n    Iterate through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each `char`:\n    While there are available left boots of `char` and available right boots of `char`:\n        Pop an index from `left_indices[char]` and `right_indices[char]`.\n        Add this pair to our `result_pairs` list.\n\n4.  **Phase 2: Specific-Indefinite Matches (c, ?) and (?, c)**\n    Iterate through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each `char`:\n    a.  **Left `char` with Right `?`:** While there are available left boots of `char` and available right boots of `'?'`:\n        Pop an index from `left_indices[char]` and `right_indices['?']`.\n        Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n    b.  **Left `?` with Right `char`:** While there are available left boots of `'?'` and available right boots of `char`:\n        Pop an index from `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices[char]`.\n        Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n\n5.  **Phase 3: Indefinite-Indefinite Matches (?, ?)**\n    While there are available left boots of `'?'` and available right boots of `'?'`:\n        Pop an index from `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']`.\n        Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n\n6.  **Output:**\n    Print the total number of pairs found (`len(result_pairs)`).\n    Then, print each pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` on a new line.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 7`\n`l = \"abaca?b\"`\n`r = \"zabbbcc\"`\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    `left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4], '?': [6]}\n    `right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}\n    `result_pairs = []`\n\n2.  **Phase 1 (c, c) matches:**\n    *   'a': `left_indices['a']` has [1,3,5], `right_indices['a']` has [2].\n        Match (5, 2). `result_pairs = [(5, 2)]`. `left_indices['a']` becomes [1,3], `right_indices['a']` becomes [].\n    *   'b': `left_indices['b']` has [2,7], `right_indices['b']` has [3,4].\n        Match (7, 4). `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4)]`. `left_indices['b']` becomes [2], `right_indices['b']` becomes [3].\n        Match (2, 3). `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3)]`. `left_indices['b']` becomes [], `right_indices['b']` becomes [].\n    *   'c': `left_indices['c']` has [4], `right_indices['c']` has [5,6,7].\n        Match (4, 7). `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7)]`. `left_indices['c']` becomes [], `right_indices['c']` becomes [5,6].\n    *   No other specific color matches.\n\n    **After Phase 1:**\n    `left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [], '?': [6]}\n    `right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [5, 6], '?': []}\n    `result_pairs = [(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7)]`\n\n3.  **Phase 2 (c, ?) and (?, c) matches:**\n    *   'a': `left_indices['a']` has [1,3], `right_indices['?']` is empty. `left_indices['?']` has [6], `right_indices['a']` is empty.
