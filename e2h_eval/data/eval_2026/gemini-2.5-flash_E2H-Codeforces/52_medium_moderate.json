Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic Journey Through the Candlelight Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"New Year Candles\" conundrum. My goal: craft a Python script to illuminate the solution. The core of the problem: maximize the burn time of candles given an initial supply and a crafting mechanism. The strategy is clear: we want to milk every single hour of light from those candles.\n\n**Understanding the Burning Mechanism**\n\nThe heart of it is this: we're simulating a process. I'll need to meticulously track:\n\n*   `total_hours`: The cumulative burn time, our main objective.\n*   `current_new_candles`: The stock of fresh candles.\n*   `burned_out_candles`: The spent, but potentially reusable, candles.\n\nThe logic unfolds as follows:\n\n1.  **Ignite the room:** Burn every available new candle. Add the burn time to `total_hours`, and \"recycle\" the used candles, by adding them to the `burned_out_candles`.  `current_new_candles` resets to zero, signifying the consumption.\n\n2.  **Craft new life:** Based on the crafting ratio (`b`), create new candles from the `burned_out_candles`. Integer division (`//`) is key here to determine how many whole new candles can be made.  The remainder (`%`) tells us what's left over.  We add the freshly made candles back into the `current_new_candles` pool.\n\n**The Loop and the Flame**\n\nWe'll execute this loop until we can no longer make new candles: `current_new_candles` hits zero and no more can be crafted, signifying a dead end.\n\nI tested a couple of examples with a pen and paper.  The numbers work out as intended, giving me confidence in this approach. The constraints keep this simulation within reasonable bounds.\n\n**Input's Unveiling**\n\nNow, the input format. The problem description mentions a single line containing two integers `a` and `b`. While the examples present a list format, the problem statement prevails - I'll stick with reading a single line. The output is a single integer, the result.\n\nWith this in mind, my final script will: read the values, execute the simulation loop, and print the calculated total hours to standard output. The code is written assuming a standard competitive programming environment, but I'll add error handling and validation if time allows.\n",
