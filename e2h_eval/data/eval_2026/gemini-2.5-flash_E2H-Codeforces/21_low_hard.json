The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Chest-Key Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is clear: maximize the number of chests I can open.  I've got this set of chests, each with a number `a_i`, and a set of keys, each with a number `b_j`. The rule is simple: a chest opens if the sum of its number and a key's number is odd (i.e., `a_i + b_j` is odd). This means they have to have different parities – one has to be even and the other odd.\n\nMy first thought is to categorize everything. I'll split the chests and keys into even and odd groups. I'll keep track of `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. This helps me visualize the potential matches.\n\nTo actually *open* a chest, if it's even, I *need* an odd key, and vice versa.  This looks like a classic matching problem.  Each chest can only use one key, and each key can only open one chest.\n\nNow, how do I maximize? Well, the even chests need odd keys. I have `keys_odd` available. The most even chests I can open is the minimum of those two numbers: `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.  It's the same logic for the odd chests and even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe crucial insight is that opening an even chest with an odd key doesn't affect the availability of the even keys needed for odd chests, and vice versa. The parities are independent. I can just sum these two maximums together to get my final answer! My thought is that: Total opened chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` + `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nI want to test my reasoning. Let's make sure this works with an example. Alright. Let's verify... everything seems sound, so far.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given a set of chests and keys. A chest with number `a_i` can be opened by a key with number `b_j` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. This condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` implies that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities. That is, one must be even and the other must be odd. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n\n1.  **Even Chests**: Chests with an even number `a_i`.\n2.  **Odd Chests**: Chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n3.  **Even Keys**: Keys with an even number `b_j`.\n4.  **Odd Keys**: Keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nLet:\n*   `count_chests_even` be the number of even chests.\n*   `count_chests_odd` be the number of odd chests.\n*   `count_keys_even` be the number of even keys.\n*   `count_keys_odd` be the number of odd keys.\n\nTo open an even chest (which has an even number `a_i`), we need a key with an odd number `b_j` (since `even + odd = odd`). The maximum number of even chests we can open is limited by the number of even chests available and the number of odd keys available. Thus, we can open `min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd)` even chests.\n\nTo open an odd chest (which has an odd number `a_i`), we need a key with an even number `b_j` (since `odd + even = odd`). The maximum number of odd chests we can open is limited by the number of odd chests available and the number of even keys available. Thus, we can open `min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)` odd chests.\n\nSince using an odd key for an even chest does not affect the availability of even keys (which are needed for odd chests), and vice-versa, these two types of pairings are independent. Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximums from these two independent categories.\n\nTotal opened chests = `min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd)` + `min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `count_chests_even = 0`, `count_chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers. For each `a_i`:\n    *   If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `count_chests_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `count_chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `count_keys_even = 0`, `count_keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers. For each `b_j`:\n    *   If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `count_keys_even`.\n    *   Else, increment `count_keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate the result: `min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd) + min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)`.\n7.  Print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then performing a few constant-time operations. The time complexity will be O(N + M), which is well within limits for N, M up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    count_chests_even = 0\n    count_chests_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_chests_odd += 1\n            \n    count_keys_even = 0\n    count_keys_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # To open an even chest, we need an odd key.\n    # Max pairings: min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd)\n    \n    # To open an odd chest, we need an even key.\n    # Max pairings: min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)\n    \n    # The total maximum is the sum of these two independent pairings.\n    result = min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd) + min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
