He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. I'm aiming for an efficient Python script.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the input and output. The input gives me `2n-2` strings, each a prefix or suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.  The key insight is that for each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`, there will be *exactly* one prefix and one suffix.  This is the crux of the problem.\n\nMy initial thought is to store the input strings along with their original indices to ensure I can produce the 'P'/'S' output in the right order.\n\nNext, I need to identify `s`.  Since I have two strings of length `n-1`, one *must* be the prefix of length `n-1` and the other the suffix. There are two possibilities to check:\n\n1.  `s_prefix_n_minus_1` + `s_suffix_n_minus_1[-1]` (check if `s_prefix_n_minus_1[1:] == s_suffix_n_minus_1[:-1]`)\n2.  `s_suffix_n_minus_1` + `s_prefix_n_minus_1[-1]` (check if `s_suffix_n_minus_1[1:] == s_prefix_n_minus_1[:-1]`)\n\nThe problem guarantees a solution, so at least one of these should work.\n\nOnce I have `s`, the approach is straightforward. For each input string, I check if it's a prefix or suffix of `s`, marking it 'P' or 'S' accordingly.  I will have two sets, one of the real prefixes, one of the real suffixes to efficiently match these with the input strings. To handle duplicate prefixes or suffixes in the input, which might exist due to the problem definition, I need to remember to *remove* an input string from the correct set once it has been matched as P or S. I need to make sure that I don't accidentally check one input string as the \"opposite\" of what is supposed to be.\n\nThe time complexity should be reasonably fast - O(N^2) at most. Since N <= 100, this runtime should be fast enough.\n\nI am confident this covers all necessary details, and this should produce the correct output! Let's get to it.\n",
