    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tricky Graph Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and it's asking for a couple of things related to a directed graph.  First, I need to figure out the smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to create a graph with a specific \"reachability\" property, denoted by `p`.  Then, among all those minimal graphs, I have to maximize the number of \"unidirectional pairs\".  Let's break this down.\n\nThe core concept seems to be this idea of \"reachable from each other\".  Two nodes, `u` and `v`, are reachable from each other if there's a path from `u` to `v` and vice versa. That immediately screams \"strongly connected components\" (SCCs) to me.  This means `u` and `v` must be within the same SCC. The problem further refines this by specifying `u < v`, so we're only counting ordered pairs where the first node is numbered lower.\n\nIf I've got an SCC with `k` nodes, I know that every pair of distinct nodes within that SCC satisfies this reachability condition.  The way the problem counts these pairs, using `u < v`, it essentially translates to choosing two nodes from the SCC and ordering them. Thinking about it, the number of such pairs within an SCC of size `k` is just k choose 2 or k*(k-1)/2. The graph is considered \"p-reachable\" when the total number of such pairs is exactly `p`.\n\nNow, minimizing the number of nodes `n` becomes the key. The most \"efficient\" way to generate a certain number of reachable pairs is to pack as many nodes as possible into a single, massive SCC. Basically, I want to form this sum p from SCCs of size k_i using the formula `p = sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` .\n\nSo, to minimize `n`, I need to find the optimal sizes of the SCCs, and I suspect a greedy approach of using the largest possible SCCs will probably work well. This will lead to the minimal value for `n`. Once I know `n`, I need to figure out how to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs in my optimal graph.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable graphs with `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n\n**1. Reachable from each other:**\nAn ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is \"reachable from each other\" if there's a path from `u` to `v` AND a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nA graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nSo, `p` is the sum of `k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2` for all SCCs of size `k_i` that have at least 2 nodes.\n\n**Goal 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, we should use nodes as \"efficiently\" as possible to generate `p`. The most efficient way to generate `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs is to put `k` nodes into a single SCC.\nThe function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` is convex and grows quadratically. To minimize the sum of `k_i` for a fixed sum of `f(k_i)`, we should try to make `k_i` values as large as possible. This means we should try to form one large SCC as much as possible.\n\nLet's find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\nWe can iterate `k` starting from 0:\n`k=0: f(0)=0`\n`k=1: f(1)=0`\n`k=2: f(2)=1`\n`k=3: f(3)=3`\n...\nWe continue increasing `k` until `f(k)` exceeds `p`. Let this `k` be `k_max`.\nThe number of nodes used so far is `k_max`. The remaining `p_rem = p - f(k_max)` needs to be generated.\nTo generate `p_rem` pairs, we need additional nodes. Each additional node can be put into its own SCC of size 1 (contributing 0 to `p`) or combined with other nodes to form new SCCs.\nIf `p_rem > 0`, we need to add more nodes. Each additional node added to the graph can be placed in an SCC of size 1, contributing 0 to `p`. If we need to generate `p_rem` pairs, we can add a new SCC of size `k'` such that `k' * (k' - 1) / 2 = p_rem`. However, this `k'` might be small, and we want to minimize total nodes.\nThe most node-efficient way to achieve `p_rem` is to use `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. Each such SCC contributes 1 to `p` and uses 2 nodes. So, `p_rem` SCCs of size 2 would use `2 * p_rem` nodes.\nA more general approach: we can form `k_max` nodes into one SCC. Then, for the remaining `p_rem` pairs, we add `p_rem` nodes, each forming an SCC of size 2 with one of the `k_max` nodes. This is incorrect.\nThe simplest way to generate `p_rem` pairs is to add `p_rem` SCCs of size 2, each contributing 1 to `p`. This would take `2 * p_rem` nodes.\nHowever, we can just add `p_rem` nodes, each forming an SCC of size 2 with one of the existing `k_max` nodes. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe optimal strategy for minimizing nodes `n` is to find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`. Let `nodes_in_main_scc = k`.\nThe number of pairs generated by this SCC is `p_main = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nThe remaining pairs needed are `p_rem = p - p_main`.\nTo generate `p_rem` pairs, we need `p_rem` additional nodes. Each of these `p_rem` nodes will form an SCC of size 2 with one of the `k` nodes from the main SCC. This is possible by adding an edge `(new_node, old_node)` and `(old_node, new_node)`. This uses `k + p_rem` nodes.\nAlternatively, we can form `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. This uses `2 * p_rem` nodes.\nThe total nodes would be `k` (for the main SCC) + `p_rem` (for `p_rem` additional nodes, each forming an SCC of size 2 with one of the `k` nodes).\nSo, `n = k + p_rem`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `n = k + p_rem`.\nExample: `p=3`.\n`k=0: f(0)=0`\n`k=1: f(1)=0`\n`k=2: f(2)=1`\n`k=3: f(3)=3`. `k_max = 3`. `f(3)=3`.\n`p_rem = 3 - 3 = 0`.\nSo, `n = k_max + p_rem = 3 + 0 = 3`. This matches the example.\n\nExample: `p=4`.\n`k=0: f(0)=0`\n`k=1: f(1)=0`\n`k=2: f(2)=1`\n`k=3: f(3)=3`.\n`k=4: f(4)=6`. This is `> p`. So `k_max = 3`. `f(3)=3`.\n`p_rem = 4 - 3 = 1`.\nSo, `n = k_max + p_rem = 3 + 1 = 4`. This matches the example. (Wait, example output is 5 for p=4. What went wrong?)\n\nThe issue is that `k + p_rem` is not necessarily the minimum. If `p_rem > 0`, we need to add nodes. Each new node we add can either be part of an existing SCC (making it larger) or form a new SCC.\nIf we add `p_rem` new nodes, and each forms an SCC of size 2 with one of the `k` nodes, this only works if the `k` nodes are distinct for each `p_rem` pair. If `p_rem` is large, we might reuse nodes.\nThe most node-efficient way to get `p` pairs is to use `k` nodes in one SCC, where `k` is the largest integer such that `k*(k-1)/2 <= p`.\nLet `p_current = k*(k-1)/2`. We need `p - p_current` more pairs.\nEach additional pair `(u,v)` with `u < v` and `u,v` reachable from each other requires at least 2 nodes. If we add a new node `x` to the graph, and we want it to form a reachable pair with some existing node `y`, we need to make `x` and `y` part of the same SCC. The minimum size of an SCC that contributes to `p` is 2.\nSo, if `p_rem = p - k*(k-1)/2 > 0`, we need to add `p_rem` pairs. Each such pair means we need to add at least one more node (if it forms an SCC with an existing node) or two more nodes (if it forms a new SCC of size 2).\nThe minimum number of nodes for `p_rem` pairs is `p_rem` if we can make each of them an SCC of size 2 with one of the `k` nodes. This means we add `p_rem` new nodes. Total `k + p_rem`.\nThis strategy is only valid if we can indeed make `p_rem` distinct pairs, each involving one new node and one old node.\nFor example, if `p=4`, `k=3`, `p_rem=1`. We have nodes `{1,2,3}` in an SCC. We need 1 more pair. Add node `4`. Make `{3,4}` an SCC. Total nodes `3+1=4`. This results in `p=f(3)+f(2)=3+1=4`. This works.\n\nLet's re-examine `p=4` output `5 6`. My logic yields `4`.\nThe problem states \"minimum number of nodes required\".\nIf we have `k` nodes in an SCC, `p_k = k*(k-1)/2`.\nIf we have `k` nodes in an SCC and `m` nodes in another SCC, `p = k*(k-1)/2 + m*(m-1)/2`. Total nodes `k+m`.\nTo minimize `n`, we want to make the SCCs as large as possible.\nSo, we find the largest `k` such that `k*(k-1)/2 <= p`.\nLet `p_rem = p - k*(k-1)/2`.\nIf `p_rem = 0`, then `n = k`.\nIf `p_rem > 0`, we need to account for these `p_rem` pairs. Each pair requires at least 2 nodes.\nA new SCC of size 2 adds 1 to `p` and 2 to `n`.\nA new SCC of size 3 adds 3 to `p` and 3 to `n`.\nA new SCC of size `x` adds `x*(x-1)/2` to `p` and `x` to `n`.\nThe ratio `(x*(x-1)/2) / x = (x-1)/2`. This ratio increases with `x`. So larger SCCs are more efficient in terms of `p` per node.\nThis means we should try to make one large SCC, then another large SCC, etc.\nSo, we should find `k_1` such that `k_1*(k_1-1)/2` is the largest possible value `p_1 <= p`.\nThen find `k_2` such that `k_2*(k_2-1)/2` is largest possible value `p_2 <= p - p_1`.\nAnd so on, until `p` is exhausted.\nThe total number of nodes `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\n\nExample: `p=4`.\n`k=0: f(0)=0`\n`k=1: f(1)=0`\n`k=2: f(2)=1`\n`k=3: f(3)=3`.\n`k=4: f(4)=6`.\nLargest `k` such that `f(k) <= 4` is `k=3`. `p_1 = f(3)=3`. `n_1=3`.\nRemaining `p_rem = 4-3=1`.\nFor `p_rem=1`, largest `k'` such that `f(k') <= 1` is `k'=2`. `p_2=f(2)=1`. `n_2=2`.\nRemaining `p_rem = 1-1=0`.\nTotal nodes `n = n_1 + n_2 = 3 + 2 = 5`. This matches the example output for `p=4`.\n\nSo, the algorithm for minimum `n`:\nInitialize `n=0`, `current_p=p`.\nWhile `current_p > 0`:\n  Find largest `k` such that `k*(k-1)/2 <= current_p`.\n  `n += k`.\n  `current_p -= k*(k-1)/2`.\nThis is a greedy approach. Does it work? Yes, because `f(k)` is convex, to minimize sum of `k_i` for a fixed sum of `f(k_i)`, we should make `k_i` as large as possible.\n\nLet's precompute `k*(k-1)/2` values. For `p=2*10^5`, `k*(k-1)/2` needs to be up to `2*10^5`.\n`k^2/2 approx 2*10^5 => k^2 approx 4*10^5 => k approx sqrt(4*10^5) = sqrt(40*10^4) approx 2*10^2 = 200`.\nSo `k` goes up to about 632. `632 * 631 / 2 = 199396`. `633 * 632 / 2 = 200028`.\nWe can precompute `scc_pairs[k] = k*(k-1)/2` for `k` from 0 to 633.\n\nAlgorithm for `min_n`:\n1. Precompute `f[k] = k*(k-1)/2` for `k` from 0 to 633.\n2. Initialize `min_n = 0`.\n3. While `p > 0`:\n    a. Find the largest `k_val` such that `f[k_val] <= p`. This can be done by binary search on the `f` array or by iterating `k` downwards from 633.\n    b. `min_n += k_val`.\n    c. `p -= f[k_val]`.\n4. Return `min_n`.\n\n**Goal 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\nAn ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\nThis means `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `SCC(u)` to `SCC(v)` in the condensation graph (DAG of SCCs).\n\nLet the graph have `N` nodes and `M` SCCs: `C_1, C_2, ..., C_M`. Let `|C_i| = k_i`.\nThe total number of nodes is `n = sum(k_i)`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{i \\neq j, C_i \\to C_j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nTo maximize this sum, we want to maximize `k_i * k_j` for pairs of SCCs `(C_i, C_j)` where there's a path from `C_i` to `C_j`.\nThe maximum number of unidirectional pairs occurs when the condensation graph is a simple path (a linear ordering of SCCs).\nFor example, `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_M`.\nIn this case, for any `i < j`, there is a path from `C_i` to `C_j`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs would be `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nLet the SCCs be `C_1, C_2, ..., C_M` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_M`.\nThe total number of nodes is `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_M`.\nThe total number of pairs `(u,v)` with `u \\neq v` is `n * (n - 1)`.\nPairs `(u,v)` where `u,v` are in the same SCC: `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1))`.\nPairs `(u,v)` where `u,v` are in different SCCs: `n * (n-1) - sum(k_i * (k_i - 1))`.\nThese pairs are either unidirectional or bidirectional (if there's a path `u -> v` and `v -> u`, which means they are in the same SCC, but we've already excluded those). So these are all pairs where `u,v` are in different SCCs.\nIf the condensation graph is a path `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_M`, then for any `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j` with `i < j`, `(u,v)` is unidirectional.\nThe total number of such pairs is `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nConsider the sum `(k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_M)^2 = n^2`.\n`n^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = (n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `(n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nTo maximize this value for a fixed `n`, we need to minimize `sum(k_i^2)`.\nTo minimize `sum(k_i^2)` given `sum(k_i) = n`, we should make the `k_i` values as close to each other as possible.\n\nHowever, the `k_i` values are determined by the first part of the problem (minimizing `n` for a given `p`).\nThe `k_i` values are found by the greedy approach: `k_1` is the largest such that `f(k_1) <= p`, `k_2` is the largest such that `f(k_2) <= p - f(k_1)`, and so on.\nThis greedy approach tends to make one `k_i` very large and the others smaller. This means `sum(k_i^2)` will be large, which implies `(n^2 - sum(k_i^2))/2` will be small.\nThis means the greedy approach for `min_n` might not maximize unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `p=4`.\n`min_n = 5`. The SCC sizes were `k_1=3, k_2=2`.\n`n=5`, `k_1=3, k_2=2`.\nUnidirectional pairs: `k_1 * k_2 = 3 * 2 = 6`. This matches the example output.\nThe condensation graph is `C_1 -> C_2`.\n\nWhat if we could choose different `k_i`s that sum to `n` and sum to `p`?\nNo, the problem asks for \"among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes\". So the `k_i` values are fixed by the greedy algorithm for `min_n`.\n\nSo, the strategy for `max_unidirectional_pairs` is:\n1. Determine the set of SCC sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_M` using the greedy algorithm for `min_n`.\n2. Calculate `n = sum(k_i)`.\n3. Construct a graph where these SCCs form a path in the condensation graph: `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_M`.\n4. The number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`. This can be calculated as `(n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nLet's verify this formula.\n`sum(k_i * k_j)` for `i < j`.\n`n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_M`.\n`n^2 = (k_1 + ... + k_M)^2 = k_1^2 + ... + k_M^2 + 2 * (k_1 k_2 + k_1 k_3 + ... + k_{M-1} k_M)`.\n`2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i k_j) = n^2 - sum(k_i^2)`.\n`sum_{i < j} (k_i k_j) = (n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nThis formula is correct.\n\nLet's apply this to `p=3`.\n`min_n = 3`. The SCC sizes are `k_1=3`.\n`n=3`, `k_1=3`.\n`sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 = 9`.\n`max_unidirectional_pairs = (3^2 - 9) / 2 = (9 - 9) / 2 = 0`. This matches the example output.\n\nLet's apply this to `p=0`.\n`min_n = 0`. (If `p=0`, we need 0 pairs, so 0 nodes is sufficient. An empty graph has 0 nodes and 0 pairs).\n`n=0`. `sum(k_i^2) = 0`.\n`max_unidirectional_pairs = (0^2 - 0) / 2 = 0`. This matches the example output.\n\nThe algorithm seems solid.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Precompute `f[k] = k*(k-1)/2` up to `k=633`.\n- `min_n` calculation:\n  - `scc_sizes = []`\n  - `current_p = p`\n  - `total_nodes = 0`\n  - While `current_p > 0`:\n    - Find `k_val` (largest `k` such that `f[k] <= current_p`).\n    - `scc_sizes.append(k_val)`\n    - `total_nodes += k_val`\n    - `current_p -= f[k_val]`\n  - If `p=0`, `total_nodes = 0`.\n- `max_unidirectional_pairs` calculation:\n  - `sum_k_squared = 0`\n  - For `k_val` in `scc_sizes`:\n    - `sum_k_squared += k_val * k_val`\n  - `max_unidirectional_pairs = (total_nodes * total_nodes - sum_k_squared) // 2`\n  - If `p=0`, `max_unidirectional_pairs = 0`.\n\nEdge case: `p=0`.\n`min_n` loop: `current_p=0`, loop doesn't run. `total_nodes = 0`.

Python handles large integers automatically.\n\nThe precomputation array size is small (around 633). The loop for `min_n` runs at most `log p` times (roughly, as `k` is `sqrt(p)` and `p` decreases). Inside the loop, finding `k_val` is `O(log K_max)` or `O(K_max)` if linear scan. `K_max` is 633, so it's fast.\nThe `max_unidirectional_pairs` calculation iterates over `scc_sizes`, which has at most `log p` elements.\nOverall complexity is very low.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Precompute f[k] = k * (k - 1) // 2\n    # Max p is 2 * 10^5. k * (k - 1) // 2 approx 2 * 10^5 => k^2 approx 4 * 10^5 => k approx 632.\n    # So we need to compute up to k = 633.\n    MAX_K = 633\n    f_values = [0] * (MAX_K + 1)\n    for k in range(1, MAX_K + 1):\n        f_values[k] = k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    min_n = 0\n    scc_sizes = []\n    current_p = p\n\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k_val such that f_values[k_val] <= current_p\n        k_val = 0\n        # Binary search can be used here, but linear scan downwards is also fast enough\n        # given MAX_K is small (633).\n        # We can optimize by starting k_val from previous k_val or just from MAX_K.\n        # Since current_p decreases, the k_val we're looking for will also decrease or stay small.\n        # A simple linear scan from MAX_K is fine.\n        for k_idx in range(MAX_K, -1, -1):\n            if f_values[k_idx] <= current_p:\n                k_val = k_idx\n                break\n        \n        if k_val == 0: # Should not happen if current_p > 0, as f_values[2]=1.\n                       # This check handles cases where current_p is 1 but k_val could somehow be 0 (e.g. if f_values only had 0,1)\n            break\n            \n        scc_sizes.append(k_val)\n        min_n += k_val\n        current_p -= f_values[k_val]\n\n    # Handle p=0 case explicitly for min_n\n    if p == 0:\n        min_n = 0\n\n    # Calculate max_unidirectional_pairs\n    # This is (n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2 for SCCs k_i forming a linear chain.\n    sum_k_squared = 0\n    for k_val in scc_sizes:\n        sum_k_squared += k_val * k_val\n    \n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_k_squared) // 2\n\n    # Handle p=0 case explicitly for max_unidirectional_pairs\n    if p == 0:\n        max_unidirectional_pairs = 0\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{min_n} {max_unidirectional_pairs}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
