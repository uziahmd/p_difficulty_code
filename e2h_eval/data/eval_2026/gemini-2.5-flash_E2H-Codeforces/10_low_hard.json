Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Feed the Golorp - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to tackle it. The core of this seems to be finding the smallest lexicographical sequence of digits that satisfies the golorp's diet. Forget the \"jaws\" and \"stomach\" fluff – it's all about assigning values to variables.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\n\nThe golorp diet (the \"Golorp Name\") is structured. It has an expression inside parentheses, which determines the variables, and a set of conditions after \"`-`\", defining the constraints. The critical thing is the \"lexicographically smallest\" part. That tells me to build a search strategy where smaller digits are tried first for earlier variables.\n\n**Structure & Interpretation:**\n\nThe Golorp Name has a specific structure: `?(` *expression* `):-` *conditions* `.` I need to parse the expression and conditions. Each underscore \"_\" is a variable, but multiple underscores in a row represent a multi-digit number. For instance, `___` is a three-digit number formed by three individual variables.\n\n**Parsing Strategy:**\n\nI need to extract the variables, their positions, and the arithmetic operations in the expression, and then translate the conditions. I'm thinking I'll need a way to build numbers from the assigned variable values and evaluate the resulting arithmetic expression.\n\n**Example and Revised Understanding:**\n\nLet's use the example `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` to solidify my thinking. I've got seven variables: `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `x5`, and `x6`. The expression is then `x0 - x1 / (100*x2 + 10*x3 + x4) * (10*x5 + x6)`. The condition `___>__` becomes  `100*x2 + 10*x3 + x4 > 10*x5 + x6`.\nI need to be able to extract these variables and their constraints from the input string.\nI must carefully assign indices to each underscore so that when grouped they form the specified number.\nI need to prioritize lexicographically small assignments! Let's get to it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) for variables `x0, x1, ..., xN-1` that satisfy a given set of arithmetic and comparison constraints. The input is a string representing the \"golorp's name,\" which defines these constraints.\n\n**Problem Breakdown and Approach:**\n\n1.  **Parsing the Golorp Name:**\n    The golorp's name has the structure `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n    *   **Variables (`_`):** Each `_` represents a unique variable `x_i`. We need to assign indices to these variables in the order they appear in the entire string.\n    *   **Expression (`<expression>`):** This part contains `_`s and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). It defines an arithmetic expression that must be evaluable. The result of this expression doesn't seem to be explicitly constrained by the examples, but its evaluation might involve division by zero, which would make the diet impossible.\n    *   **Conditions (`<conditions>`):** This part contains comma-separated conditions. Each condition is of the form `<term1><operator><term2>`, where `<operator>` is `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `>`, `<`, or `=`.\n        *   **Terms:** A term can be a multi-digit number formed by consecutive `_`s (e.g., `___` represents `x_i*100 + x_j*10 + x_k`), or a single `_`.\n\n2.  **Representing Variables and Terms:**\n    *   We'll count the total number of `_`s to determine `N`, the number of variables.\n    *   Each `_` will be replaced by a placeholder like `x[i]`.\n    *   When multiple `_`s form a number (e.g., `___`), we need to parse this into an arithmetic expression like `x[i]*100 + x[j]*10 + x[k]`. This requires careful handling of string replacement to avoid issues like `_` being replaced by `x[i]` and then `__` being replaced by `x[j]*10+x[k]`, potentially double-counting variables. The best way is to iterate through the string and identify `_`s, assigning them indices. Then, when evaluating expressions, map `_`s to their corresponding `x_i` values.\n    *   For the purpose of `eval()`, we'll convert the parsed string into a Python-compatible expression. E.g., `x0*100 + x1*10 + x2`.\n\n3.  **Solving Strategy (Backtracking/Brute Force with Pruning):**\n    Since we need the *lexicographically smallest* sequence, this suggests a backtracking approach.\n    *   We have `N` variables, `x0, x1, ..., xN-1`.\n    *   We try to assign values to `x0`, then `x1`, and so on, from `0` to `9`.\n    *   For `x0`, we try `0`, then `1`, ..., `9`.\n    *   For `x1`, we try `0`, then `1`, ..., `9`.\n    *   And so on.\n    *   **Pruning:** After assigning a value to `x_k`, we should check if the current partial assignment (for `x0` through `x_k`) already violates any of the conditions. If it does, we can immediately backtrack and try the next value for `x_k`. This is crucial for efficiency.\n    *   **Division by Zero:** Division by zero is a critical edge case. If any division in the expression or conditions results in division by zero, that particular assignment is invalid.\n    *   **Leading Zeros:** A number formed by multiple `_`s (e.g., `__`) cannot have a leading zero if it's not the number `0` itself. However, the problem statement and examples don't explicitly forbid this. In competitive programming, if not specified, leading zeros are usually allowed unless they change the value (e.g., `01` is `1`). Given `___ > __`, `010 > 01` (10 > 1) is valid. Let's assume leading zeros are allowed unless they appear as the first digit of a number that is explicitly stated to be non-zero (which is not the case here). The problem implies each `_` is just a digit.\n\n**Detailed Parsing and Evaluation:**\n\nTo handle the variable mapping and `eval()` safely:\n\n1.  **Count Variables and Map `_` to Indices:**\n    Iterate through the input string. Each time `_` is encountered, assign it a unique index `i` (from `0` to `N-1`). Store these mappings.\n\n2.  **Substitute `_` in the String:**\n    Create a modified version of the input string where each `_` is replaced by `x[i]`. This allows `eval()` to use a `x` array.\n\n3.  **Identify Terms and Operators:**\n    The original problem statement is ambiguous about how `_`s interact with operators when forming numbers.\n    *   `_-_/___*__` could be `x0 - (x1 / (x2*100+x3*10+x4)) * (x5*10+x6)`\n    *   Or it could be `x0 - x1 / (x2*100+x3*10+x4) * (x5*10+x6)` (standard operator precedence).\n    *   The examples clarify that `___` is a single number. This means we need to group consecutive `_`s first.\n\n    Let's refine the parsing:\n    *   **Step 1: Replace `_` with unique `x[i]` placeholders.**\n        Example: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n        Becomes: `?(x[0]x[1]-x[2]+x[3]/x[4]x[5]x[6]x[7]x[8]):-x[2]x[3]x[4]>x[5]x[6],x[4]x[5]x[6]x[7]x[8]<x[0]x[1].` (This is still not Python-evaluable)\n\n    *   **Step 2: Convert grouped `x[i]` placeholders into arithmetic expressions.**\n        This is the tricky part. We need to identify sequences like `x[0]x[1]` and convert them to `x[0]*10 + x[1]`.\n        A regular expression can help here. `re.findall(r'(x\\[\\d+\\])+', modified_string)` might find groups of `x[i]`s.\n        Then, for each group `x[i]x[j]...x[k]`, convert it to `x[i]*10^(len-1) + x[j]*10^(len-2) + ... + x[k]`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Handle operators in conditions.**\n        The conditions `___>__` translate to `(x2*100+x3*10+x4) > (x5*10+x6)`.\n        The input format `_-_/___*__` implies standard operator precedence for arithmetic.\n\n**Revised Parsing Strategy (Robust Approach):**\n\n1.  **Extract Expression and Conditions:**\n    Use string slicing or regex to get the `expression_str` and `conditions_str`.\n\n2.  **Map `_` to `x[i]` and Count `N`:**\n    Iterate through the *entire* original input string. When `_` is found, replace it with a placeholder like `_VAR_idx_` and increment `idx`. Store `N = idx`.\n    Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    `_VAR_0_-_VAR_1_/_VAR_2__VAR_3__VAR_4_*_VAR_5__VAR_6_`\n    `_VAR_2__VAR_3__VAR_4_>_VAR_5__VAR_6_`\n    `N = 7`\n\n3.  **Convert `_VAR_idx_` to `x[idx]` and Group Numbers:**\n    This is the most critical step. We need to identify sequences of `_VAR_idx_` that form numbers.\n    A simpler approach: Scan the modified string.\n    If we see `_VAR_i_` followed by `_VAR_j_`, it's part of a multi-digit number.\n    If we see `_VAR_i_` followed by an operator or end of string, it's a single digit or the last digit of a number.\n\n    Let's use a `re.sub` approach with a custom replacer function.\n\n    ```python\n    import re\n\n    def parse_golorp_name(name_str):\n        # 1. Extract expression and conditions\n        match = re.match(r'\\?\\((.*?)\\):-(.*?)\\.', name_str)\n        expression_raw = match.group(1)\n        conditions_raw = match.group(2)\n\n        # 2.
