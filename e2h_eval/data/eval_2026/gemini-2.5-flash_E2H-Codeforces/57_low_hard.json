His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Olympiad Rank Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad problem, and it's all about figuring out the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, given some tricky constraints. I've got `n` participants, their scores from two tours, and a minimum total score `x` that Vasya achieved. The results table ranks participants by their total points, with ties broken by the jury – that's the key wrinkle here.\n\nThe catch is, I *don't* know which score from the first tour corresponds to which score from the second tour for Vasya.  I only know his *total* score is at least `x`. This screams \"matching problem\" at me. I've got these two lists, `a` and `b`, and I need to pair them up in some way to get total scores. And since Vasya is a participant, one pair in the matching will be his.\n\nThe crucial part is the \"jury decides\" tiebreaker. For the *best* rank, I need to imagine Vasya being ranked *first* amongst everyone who has his total points. For the *worst* rank, I need to imagine Vasya being ranked *last* amongst everyone with his score.\n\nThis forces me to interpret the problem carefully. Is it that:\n1. I pick a pair `a_i` and `b_j` for Vasya (such that `a_i + b_j >= x`), fix Vasya's total, and then rearrange the remaining scores to create other participants' totals, looking at how the best/worst possible score positioning affects rank? \n2. Or is it that I try *one* possible combination from the two score lists, one pairing for everyone. That produces `n` total scores (including Vasya's, which we know is at least `x`), and I assess his rank within *that* combination? Then I look at the best and worst rankings across *all* possible score combinations?\n\nThe problem statement seems to imply the latter interpretation is correct: I create a *single* matching of scores, Vasya is part of it, and I then analyze the range of possible ranks for Vasya across all matchings.\n\nI need to figure out an efficient algorithm to enumerate and analyze these matchings to find the extreme rank possibilities.  This sounds like I'll need to sort and then manipulate the lists strategically to determine the minimal and maximal placement of a potential score S.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` for Vasya, and two lists of `n` scores each, `a` for the first tour and `b` for the second tour. The scores in `a` and `b` are not associated with specific participants. Participants are ranked by total score (sum of tour 1 and tour 2 scores) in decreasing order. If multiple participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily among them.\n\nLet's denote the participants' scores for tour 1 as `a_1, ..., a_n` and for tour 2 as `b_1, ..., b_n`. Since we don't know which `a_i` belongs to which `b_j`, we have to consider all possible matchings between the `a` scores and `b` scores to form `n` total scores. Vasya is one of these `n` participants, and his total score is at least `x`.\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the best rank, Vasya wants to maximize his score and minimize the scores of others.\nSuppose Vasya scores `S_V`. His rank will be `1 + (number of participants with total score > S_V)`. If there are participants with the same score `S_V`, Vasya can be ranked first among them. So, his best rank is `1 + (number of participants with total score > S_V)`.\n\nTo maximize `S_V`, Vasya should take the highest possible `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet's sort `a` in descending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a_sorted_desc = [a_1', a_2', ..., a_n']`\n`b_sorted_desc = [b_1', b_2', ..., b_n']`\n\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he should take `a_1'` and `b_1'`. If `a_1' + b_1' >= x`, then Vasya can achieve `a_1' + b_1'`. This is the maximum possible score any participant can get. If Vasya gets this score, no one can get a higher score. So, the number of participants with total score > `S_V` is 0. Vasya's best rank would be 1.\n\nThe problem guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This means it's always possible for Vasya to achieve a score of at least `x`.\nIf Vasya takes the highest `a_i` and highest `b_j` (i.e., `a_1'` and `b_1'`), his score will be `a_1' + b_1'`. This score is the maximum possible sum for any participant. Since `a_1' + b_1' >= x` (because `a_1' >= a_i` and `b_1' >= b_j` for any `i,j` that satisfy the condition, so `a_1' + b_1'` must be at least `x`), Vasya can achieve the maximum possible score. No one can score higher. Thus, Vasya's best rank is always **1**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the worst rank, Vasya wants to minimize his score (while still being at least `x`) and maximize the scores of others.\nVasya's worst rank is `1 + (number of participants with total score > S_V) + (number of participants with total score = S_V and ranked higher than Vasya)`. To make this as large as possible, we want to maximize the number of people who score strictly greater than Vasya, and then maximize the number of people who score equal to Vasya.\n\nConsider a fixed matching of `a` and `b` scores. Let `P_k = (a_i, b_j)` be Vasya's pair, and `S_k = a_i + b_j` be his total score. For this specific matching, Vasya's rank would be `1 + (count of participants with score > S_k) + (count of participants with score = S_k, excluding Vasya)`.\n\nWe need to find a matching and a pair for Vasya such that this rank is maximized.\nTo maximize the number of people who score higher than Vasya, we should try to create as many high scores as possible for other participants. This can be achieved by pairing the highest `a` scores with the highest `b` scores.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_sorted_asc = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_sorted_asc = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`.\n\nTo maximize the number of participants with scores greater than or equal to Vasya's score, consider the following strategy:\nPair the largest `a_i` with the smallest `b_j`, and the second largest `a_i` with the second smallest `b_j`, and so on. This is equivalent to sorting `a` in descending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a_desc = sorted(a, reverse=True)`\n`b_asc = sorted(b)`\n\nNow, try to form pairs `(a_desc[i], b_asc[i])` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThese pairs would be `(a_desc[0], b_asc[0]), (a_desc[1], b_asc[1]), ..., (a_desc[n-1], b_asc[n-1])`.\nThe sums would be `S_i = a_desc[i] + b_asc[i]`.\nThese sums are not necessarily sorted. However, this pairing strategy aims to create a wide range of scores.\n\nLet's use a two-pointer approach for the worst case.\nSort `a` in ascending order: `a_sorted = sorted(a)`.\nSort `b` in descending order: `b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)`.\n\nWe want to find a matching such that Vasya's rank is maximized. This means we want to maximize the count of participants `P_k` such that `S_k >= S_Vasya`.\nLet `a_i` be Vasya's score in tour 1 and `b_j` be his score in tour 2. His total score is `S_Vasya = a_i + b_j`. We know `S_Vasya >= x`.\nTo maximize his rank, we want to maximize the number of other participants who also score `S_other >= S_Vasya`.\n\nConsider `a_sorted` and `b_sorted_desc`.\nWe can iterate through `a_sorted` from largest to smallest (i.e., `a_sorted[n-1]` down to `a_sorted[0]`). For each `a_i` from `a_sorted`, we try to match it with a `b_j` from `b_sorted_desc` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet's keep track of available `b` scores. A `multiset` or `collections.Counter` for `b` scores is useful.\nFor each `a_i` in `a_sorted`:\nWe need to find a `b_j` from the available `b` scores such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of people who score `S_k >= x`, we should try to pair `a_i` with the smallest `b_j` that satisfies `a_i + b_j >= x`. If no such `b_j` exists, then `a_i` cannot contribute to a score of `x` or more.\nIf we pair `a_i` with the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, this `b_j` is `x - a_i` or greater.\nUsing `bisect_left` on `b_sorted_desc` (which is sorted descending) would be tricky. It's easier to use `bisect_left` on `b_sorted_asc`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_asc = sorted(a)`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_asc = sorted(b)`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis is a standard greedy matching problem.\nIterate through `a_asc` from smallest to largest (`a_asc[0]` to `a_asc[n-1]`). For each `a_val = a_asc[i]`, we need to find a `b_val` from `b_asc` (that hasn't been used yet) such that `a_val + b_val >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of such pairs, for a given `a_val`, we should use the smallest possible `b_val` that satisfies the condition `b_val >= x - a_val`. This leaves larger `b_val`s for larger `a_val`s, which is beneficial.\n\nAlgorithm for worst rank:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order: `a_asc = sorted(a)`.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order: `b_asc = sorted(b)`.\n3. Initialize `count_ge_x = 0`.\n4. Use two pointers: `ptr_a` for `a_asc` (starts at 0) and `ptr_b` for `b_asc` (starts at `n-1`).\n5. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n   If `a_asc[ptr_a] + b_asc[ptr_b] >= x`:\n     This pair `(a_asc[ptr_a], b_asc[ptr_b])` forms a total score of at least `x`. We can consider this as one of the participants (potentially Vasya, or someone else who scores >= x). Increment `count_ge_x`. Move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a += 1`) and `ptr_b` backward (`ptr_b -= 1`) because both scores are used.\n   Else (`a_asc[ptr_a] + b_asc[ptr_b] < x`):\n     The current `a_asc[ptr_a]` is too small to combine with the current `b_asc[ptr_b]` (which is the largest available `b` score) to reach `x`. Since `a_asc` is sorted ascending, any `a_asc[k]` where `k < ptr_a` will be even smaller and also won't work with `b_asc[ptr_b]`. So, `a_asc[ptr_a]` must be paired with some smaller `b_j` (if any), which would result in an even smaller sum. This means `a_asc[ptr_a]` cannot be part of any pair that sums to `x` or more with the currently available `b` scores. So, we must discard `a_asc[ptr_a]` for the purpose of forming sums >= x. Move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a += 1`). The `b_asc[ptr_b]` is still available.\n\nThe `count_ge_x` found by this greedy strategy is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a total score of at least `x`.\nIf Vasya is one of these `count_ge_x` participants, and the jury decides to rank him last among them, his rank would be `count_ge_x`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `a = [4,3,5,6,4,4]`, `b = [8,6,0,4,3,4]`, `x = 7`\n`n=6`\n\n1. `a_asc = [3,4,4,4,5,6]`\n2. `b_asc = [0,3,4,4,6,8]`\n   `b_sorted_desc` is not needed for this algorithm.\n\n3. `count_ge_x = 0`\n4. `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 5`\n\nIteration 1:\n`a_asc[0] = 3`, `b_asc[5] = 8`\n`3 + 8 = 11 >= 7`. Yes.\n`count_ge_x = 1`.\n`ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n\nIteration 2:\n`a_asc[1] = 4`, `b_asc[4] = 6`\n`4 + 6 = 10 >= 7`. Yes.\n`count_ge_x = 2`.\n`ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n\nIteration 3:\n`a_asc[2] = 4`, `b_asc[3] = 4`\n`4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. Yes.\n`count_ge_x = 3`.\n`ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n\nIteration 4:\n`a_asc[3] = 4`, `b_asc[2] = 4`\n`4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. Yes.\n`count_ge_x = 4`.\n`ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n\nIteration 5:\n`a_asc[4] = 5`, `b_asc[1] = 3`\n`5 + 3 = 8 >= 7`. Yes.\n`count_ge_x = 5`.\n`ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n\nIteration 6:\n`a_asc[5] = 6`, `b_asc[0] = 0`\n`6 + 0 = 6 < 7`. No.\n`ptr_a = 6`.\n\nLoop terminates because `ptr_a = 6` (which is `n`).\n\n`count_ge_x = 5`.\nSo, the worst rank Vasya could get is 5.\n\nThis greedy strategy correctly finds the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Why?\nSuppose we have `a_asc` and `b_asc`. We want to form `k` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThe greedy strategy pairs `a_asc[ptr_a]` with `b_asc[ptr_b]` if `a_asc[ptr_a] + b_asc[ptr_b] >= x`. This uses the smallest remaining `a` and largest remaining `b`.\nIf `a_asc[ptr_a] + b_asc[ptr_b] < x`, then `a_asc[ptr_a]` cannot form a sum `>= x` with any remaining `b` (since `b_asc[ptr_b]` is the largest remaining `b`). So `a_asc[ptr_a]` must be discarded.\nIf `a_asc[ptr_a] + b_asc[ptr_b] >= x`, we form a pair. This is optimal because using `a_asc[ptr_a]` (the smallest available `a`) with `b_asc[ptr_b]` (the largest available `b`) maximizes the chances for the remaining `a` values to form sums `>= x` with the remaining `b` values. Any other choice for `a_asc[ptr_a]` would involve a smaller `b_k` (if `b_k` could satisfy the condition), leaving `b_asc[ptr_b]` for a larger `a_m`. This doesn't improve the count and might reduce it.\n\nThe worst rank for Vasya is `count_ge_x`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBest rank: 1\nWorst rank: `count_ge_x` (calculated as above)\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can choose the highest score from tour 1 and the highest score from tour 2.\n    # Let a_max = max(a) and b_max = max(b).\n    # His score would be a_max + b_max.\n    # The problem guarantees that there exist i, j such that a[i] + b[j] >= x.\n    # Since a_max >= a[i] and b_max >= b[j], it implies a_max + b_max >= a[i] + b[j] >= x.\n    # So Vasya can achieve the maximum possible score (a_max + b_max).\n    # No one can score higher than this.\n    # If multiple participants get the same maximum score, Vasya can be assigned the 1st place among them by the jury.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst possible rank for Vasya.\n    # To find the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of participants\n    # who score greater than or equal to Vasya's score (which must be at least x).\n    # If Vasya gets a score S_V, and k other people get scores >= S_V,\n    # then Vasya can be ranked k+1 (if he's last among those with >= S_V).\n    # We want to find the maximum possible number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # This number will be Vasya's worst rank.\n\n    # Sort 'a' in ascending order.\n    a.sort()\n    # Sort 'b' in ascending order.\n    b.sort()\n\n    count_ge_x = 0\n    ptr_a = 0  # Pointer for the smallest available score in 'a'\n    ptr_b = n - 1 # Pointer for the largest available score in 'b'\n\n    # Greedy approach:\n    # To maximize the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x,\n    # we iterate through 'a' from smallest to largest.\n    # For each a[ptr_a], we try to pair it with the largest possible b[ptr_b]\n    # to satisfy the condition a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x.\n    # If it satisfies, we count it as a valid pair and use both scores.\n    # If not, a[ptr_a] is too small to reach 'x' even with the largest available 'b',\n    # so we discard a[ptr_a] and try the next smallest 'a'.\n    while ptr_a < n and ptr_b >= 0:\n        if a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x:\n            # This pair (a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b]) sums to at least x.\n            # We count this as one participant who scored >= x.\n            count_ge_x += 1\n            # Move both pointers as these scores are now 'used'.\n            ptr_a += 1\n            ptr_b -= 1\n        else:\n            # a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x.\n            # Since b[ptr_b] is the largest available 'b' score,\n            # a[ptr_a] cannot form a sum >= x with any other available 'b' score either.\n            # So, a[ptr_a] cannot be part of a pair that sums to >= x.\n            # We discard a[ptr_a] and move to the next smallest 'a'.\n            ptr_a += 1\n            # b[ptr_b] is still available for potentially larger 'a' scores.\n\n    worst_rank = count_ge_x\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
