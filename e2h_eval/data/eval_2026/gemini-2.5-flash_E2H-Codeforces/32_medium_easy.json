Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's the breakdown of my thinking:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the Array Stabilization problem. I need a Python script to find the minimum instability possible after removing one element from the array.  The instability of an array is just the difference between its maximum and minimum values.\n\nMy first thought is to understand what affects this instability.  Clearly, to make it small, I want the max to be as small as possible and the min as big as possible. I know the input will be an array `a` of `n` integers, where `n` is between 2 and 100,000, and each element is between 1 and 100,000.\n\nAfter pondering, it clicked: the key is that when I remove an element, the max and min of the *new* array are determined by the *remaining* `n-1` elements. I considered sorting the array first, which would make the identification of the minimum and maximum easier. That will take O(n log n).\n\nIf I remove the smallest element, the new minimum will be the second smallest and the maximum remains the original largest, making the instability `a[n-1] - a[1]`. If I remove the largest, the new minimum is the original smallest and the new max will be the second largest which gives `a[n-2] - a[0]`. Removing anything else doesn't change the overall range. This is the crux. So, to minimize the instability, I should just compare the results of the two cases and take the smaller one.\n\nI checked for the edge case where `n=2`. The logic still holds up, as the formula will accurately return 0 when the array contains only two equal numbers. I need to make sure my sorting is done efficiently, but `list.sort()` is generally well-optimized.\n\nThe time complexity is dominated by sorting, so it's O(n log n), which is fine for the given input constraints. Space complexity is O(n) because I store the array, which is also acceptable. I am thinking of `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast input, but I think the typical `input()` is fine.\n\nI sketched out an algorithm: read `n`, read the array, sort it, calculate the two potential instabilities, then print the minimum.\n\nI made a Python script to do this. I've double-checked the logic and edge case. The final solution is concise and satisfies all the conditions.\n",
