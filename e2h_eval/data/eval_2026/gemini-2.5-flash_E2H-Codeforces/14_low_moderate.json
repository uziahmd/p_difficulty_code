    "thought": "**Decoding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, I've got this competitive programming problem: find all positive integers 'n' whose factorial ends in exactly 'm' zeroes.  First things first, I need to nail down how to *calculate* the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It boils down to the number of times 10 is a factor.  Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the problem reduces to counting the factors of 5.\n\nThat's where Legendre's formula comes in: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` I'll keep going with that sum until the denominator gets larger than `n`.  It's a pretty elegant way to capture all those multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\nNow, analyzing this `Z(n)` function is key.  It's non-decreasing; it either stays the same or goes up as 'n' increases. It only *increases* at multiples of 5, and the amount of the increase varies depending on how many factors of 5 the number has.  For instance, `Z(25)` jumps because both 5 and 25 (and potentially higher powers of 5) contribute.\n\nThe question wants `Z(n)` to *equal* 'm'.  Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, once I find a solution, the next number whose factorial has the same number of trailing zeroes must also be a solution, and so on.   `Z(n)` changes only by multiples of the number of 5s in the current `n`. I'll need to figure out the behavior and the number of steps that I can step forward. So, I will calculate the range of all such numbers. It should be pretty straightforward. It shouldn't be too bad now.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nThe function `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nSpecifically, `Z(n)` increases by `v_5(n)` (the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of `n`) when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nFor example:\n`Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0`\n`Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1`\n`Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, ..., Z(14)=2`\n`Z(15)=3, ..., Z(19)=3`\n`Z(20)=4, ..., Z(24)=4`\n`Z(25)=6` (Notice the jump from 4 to 6, because 25 contributes two factors of 5: one from `25/5` and one from `25/25`)\n\nThis pattern implies that if `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, then `Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` will also be `m`, provided that none of `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are multiples of 5.\nIf `n` is a multiple of 5, then `Z(n+1)` will be greater than `Z(n)`.\nThe key observation is that `Z(n)` can never take values like `5, 10, 15, 20, ...` (multiples of 5 minus 1) because `Z(n)` increases by at least 1 when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nMore precisely, if `Z(n) = k`, then `Z(n+1)` is `k` unless `n+1` is a multiple of 5. If `n+1` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n+1)` will be `k + v_5(n+1)`.\nSince `v_5(n+1) >= 1`, `Z(n+1)` will be at least `k+1`.\nConsider `Z(n)` values:\n`Z(4)=0`\n`Z(5)=1`\n`Z(9)=1`\n`Z(10)=2`\n`Z(14)=2`\n`Z(15)=3`\n`Z(19)=3`\n`Z(20)=4`\n`Z(24)=4`\n`Z(25)=6` (Here `Z(n)` jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5.)\n\nThis means that if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` can never achieve (like 5), then there will be no `n` for which `Z(n)=m`.\nIf `m` is a value that `Z(n)` *can* achieve, say `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n_0-1)` must be less than `m`.\nIf `Z(n_0-1) = m-1`, then `n_0` must be a multiple of 5.\nThen, `Z(n_0), Z(n_0+1), Z(n_0+2), Z(n_0+3), Z(n_0+4)` will all be `m`, because `n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4` are not multiples of 5.\n`Z(n_0+5)` will be greater than `m`.\nSo, if `Z(n_0) = m` and `n_0` is a multiple of 5, then `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4` are the exactly 5 values of `n` for which `Z(n)=m`.\nIf `Z(n_0)=m` but `n_0` is not a multiple of 5, then `n_0` must be `n_1+k` for some `k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}` where `n_1` is a multiple of 5 and `Z(n_1)=m`. In this case, the set of solutions is still `n_1, n_1+1, n_1+2, n_1+3, n_1+4`.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1. Implement the `Z(n)` function.\n2. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\n   - The maximum value for `m` is 100,000.\n   - `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`. So, `n` will be around `4*m`. For `m=100,000`, `n` could be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search would be `5*m` or `500,000`.\n3. Perform a binary search for `n` in the range `[1, 5 * m]` to find the smallest `n_min` such that `Z(n_min) = m`.\n   - If no such `n` exists (i.e., `Z(n_min)` is always less than `m`, or `Z(n_min)` jumps over `m`), then there are 0 solutions.\n   - If `Z(n_min) = m`, then we need to ensure `n_min` is the *smallest* such `n`. The binary search finds the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`. After the search, we check if `Z(n_min) == m`. If not, there are 0 solutions.\n4. If `Z(n_min) = m`, then `n_min` must be a multiple of 5. If it's not, it means `Z(n_min-1)` was also `m`, and we didn't find the true smallest multiple of 5. To correct this, we can find the smallest multiple of 5, say `n_base`, such that `Z(n_base) = m`.\n   `n_base = (n_min // 5) * 5`. If `Z(n_base)` is not `m`, then `n_base = ((n_min // 5) + 1) * 5`.\n   A simpler approach: once we find *any* `n_candidate` such that `Z(n_candidate) = m`, we can then find the `n_base` by repeatedly decrementing `n_candidate` until `Z(n_candidate-1) < m`.\n   The actual smallest `n` for which `Z(n)=m` must be a multiple of 5. Let this be `n_start`.\n   The numbers of zeroes `Z(n_start-1)` must be less than `m`.\n   Then, the values of `n` that satisfy the condition are `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`.\n   There will be exactly 5 such values.\n\nLet's refine step 3 and 4:\nFind `n_low` using binary search, which is the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\nIf `Z(n_low) == m`:\n  The smallest `n` for which `Z(n) = m` must be `n_low - (n_low % 5)`. Let's call this `n_base`.\n  If `n_low % 5 == 0`, then `n_base = n_low`.\n  If `n_low % 5 != 0`, then `n_base = n_low - (n_low % 5)`.\n  However, `Z(n_base)` must be equal to `m`. It is possible that `Z(n_base)` is `m-1` or something else.\n  The correct way is:\n  If `Z(n_low) == m`, then the solutions are `n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4` (if `Z(n_low+4)` is still `m`).\n  Actually, it's simpler: if `Z(n_low) == m`, then `n_low` is the smallest `n` such that `Z(n)=m`.\n  Then the numbers `n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4` are the five values of `n` that satisfy `Z(n)=m`. This is because `n_low` must be a multiple of 5 for `Z(n_low)` to jump to `m` from `m-1` (or whatever `Z(n_low-1)` was). And `Z(n_low+5)` will be `m+v_5(n_low+5) > m`.\n  So, if `Z(n_low) == m`, then the answer is 5, and the numbers are `n_low, n_low+1, n_low+2, n_low+3, n_low+4`.\n  This is true because `Z(n)` only changes at multiples of 5. If `Z(n_low)=m`, then `Z(n_low-1)` must be `<m`. This implies `n_low` itself must be a multiple of 5 for `Z(n_low)` to be `m` and `Z(n_low-1)` to be less than `m`.\n  Example: `m=1`. `Z(4)=0`. `Z(5)=1`. Smallest `n` with `Z(n)>=1` is `n=5`. `Z(5)=1`. So solutions are `5,6,7,8,9`.\n  Example: `m=6`. `Z(24)=4`. Smallest `n` with `Z(n)>=6` is `n=25`. `Z(25)=6`. So solutions are `25,26,27,28,29`.\n  This logic holds.\n\nMaximum `m = 100,000`.\n`Z(n)` calculation:\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n```\nBinary search range: `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m`.\nLet's test the upper bound. If `m=100000`, `high=500000`.\n`Z(400000)`:\n`400000/5 = 80000`\n`400000/25 = 16000`\n`400000/125 = 3200`\n`400000/625 = 640`\n`400000/3125 = 128`\n`400000/15625 = 25`\n`400000/78125 = 5`\n`400000/390625 = 1`\nSum = `80000 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 99999`.\nSo for `m=100000`, `n` is slightly above `400000`.\n`Z(400005)`:\n`400005/5 = 80001`\n`400005/25 = 16000`\n`400005/125 = 3200`\n`400005/625 = 640`\n`400005/3125 = 128`\n`400005/15625 = 25`\n`400005/78125 = 5`\n`400005/390625 = 1`\nSum = `80001 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 100020`.\nSo `Z(400000) = 99999`.\n`Z(400001) = 99999`\n`Z(400002) = 99999`\n`Z(400003) = 99999`\n`Z(400004) = 99999`\n`Z(400005) = 100020`.\nIf `m=100000`, the binary search for smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= 100000` would yield `n=400005`.\nBut `Z(400005)` is `100020`, not `100000`.\nThis means `m=100000` is one of those \"skipped\" values. So the count should be 0.\n\nThe binary search should find the smallest `n_candidate` such that `Z(n_candidate) >= m`.\nIf `Z(n_candidate) == m`, then `n_candidate` is the first number in the sequence `n_candidate, n_candidate+1, ..., n_candidate+4`.\nIf `Z(n_candidate) > m`, then `m` is a skipped value, and there are no solutions.\n\nLet's refine binary search:\n`low = 1`, `high = 5 * m` (or `m * 5 + 10` for safety), `ans_n = -1`.\nWhile `low <= high`:\n  `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n  `zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)`\n  If `zeroes >= m`:\n    `ans_n = mid`\n    `high = mid - 1`  (try to find an even smaller `n`)\n  Else (`zeroes < m`):\n    `low = mid + 1`\n\nAfter the loop, `ans_n` will hold the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\nNow check `Z(ans_n)`.\nIf `Z(ans_n) == m`:\n  Print 5.\n  Print `ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4`.\nElse (`Z(ans_n) > m` or `ans_n` is still -1 if `m=0` which is not allowed by constraints):\n  Print 0.\n\nThis logic seems sound and covers the skipped values correctly.\n\nExample walkthrough: `m=1`\n`low=1, high=5, ans_n=-1`\n1. `mid = 3`, `Z(3)=0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 4`.\n2. `low=4, high=5`. `mid = 4`. `Z(4)=0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 5`.\n3. `low=5, high=5`. `mid = 5`. `Z(5)=1`. `1 >= 1`. `ans_n = 5`. `high = 4`.\n4. `low=5, high=4`. Loop terminates.\n`ans_n = 5`.\nCheck `Z(ans_n) == m`: `Z(5) == 1`. True.\nOutput:\n`5`\n`5 6 7 8 9`\nThis matches the example.\n\nExample walkthrough: `m=100000`\n`low=1, high=500000, ans_n=-1`\n... binary search ...\nEventually, `ans_n` will be `400005`.\nCheck `Z(ans_n) == m`: `Z(400005) == 100000`. False, `Z(400005)` is `100020`.\nOutput:\n`0`\nThis is correct.\n\nThe maximum value of `m` is 100,000.\nThe maximum value of `n` to check is `5 * 100,000 = 500,000`.\nThe `count_trailing_zeroes` function will run `log_5(N)` times. For `N=500,000`, `log_5(500000)` is about `log(500000)/log(5) = 5.69/0.69 = 8.2`. So about 8 iterations.\nBinary search takes `log(500000)` iterations, which is about 19 iterations.\nTotal operations: `19 * 8` which is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    This is equivalent to the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        # Prevent overflow for very large n, though not strictly necessary for this problem's constraints.\n        # For competitive programming, it's safer to check for potential overflow if power_of_5 can grow extremely large.\n        # Here, n is up to 500,000, so power_of_5 will go up to 390625, which fits in standard integer types.\n        if sys.maxsize // 5 < power_of_5: # Check if next multiplication would overflow\n            break\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n is roughly 5 * m, as Z(n) is approximately n/4.\n    # For m=100,000, n is around 400,000.
