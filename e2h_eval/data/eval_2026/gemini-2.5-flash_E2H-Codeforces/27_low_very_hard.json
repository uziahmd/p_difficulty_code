On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the LNDS Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subsegment of a sequence. The sequence is composed of only ones and twos, and the length can be up to 2000.  Knowing this, the solution should be, at worst, an O(n^2) or O(n^3) solution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the characteristics of a non-decreasing subsequence with just ones and twos.  It can only be a sequence of ones followed by a sequence of twos. The length is just the sum of the number of ones and twos.  That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nNow, imagine the original sequence is `a`. I pick a segment `[l, r]` to reverse, creating a new sequence `b`. I need to figure out how to maximize the LNDS of `b`.  It seems reversing a section is all that is needed.\n\nI'm thinking about how to form this LNDS.  It'll be all ones up to some point, and all twos from that point on.  I can visualize it:  I want to pick the most ones from the start of the sequence and the most twos from the end.  But, wait, that's not necessarily correct.  I'm trying to over-simplify the problem.\n\nLet me try a different approach.  An LNDS will consist of some 1s followed by some 2s.  I can think of the last 1 in the subsequence at index `i` and the first 2 at index `j`, where `i < j`.  The ones come from the prefix up to index `i`, and the twos come from the suffix starting at index `j`.  The key is to determine how many 1s and 2s can be chosen within these bounds, based on the reversed sub-segment.\n\nAlright, that's a much cleaner way to think about it. Now, it seems I need a way to efficiently calculate the number of ones and twos in any prefix and suffix of a sequence, as I iterate through the possible reversed segments and positions of i and j. I think I have a solid understanding of the problem and where the solution may lie.  Time to get to code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subsegment `[l, r]` of the given sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. That is, it consists of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. The length of such a subsequence is the total count of 1s and 2s in it.\n\nLet the modified sequence be `b`. To find the LNDS of `b`, we can iterate through all possible \"split points\" `k` (from `0` to `n`). A split point `k` means we are looking for an LNDS that consists of 1s chosen from `b_1, ..., b_k` and 2s chosen from `b_{k+1}, ..., b_n`. The maximum number of 1s we can pick from `b_1, ..., b_k` is simply the count of 1s in that prefix. Similarly, the maximum number of 2s we can pick from `b_{k+1}, ..., b_n` is the count of 2s in that suffix.\nSo, for a fixed split point `k`, the length of the LNDS is `(count of 1s in b[1...k]) + (count of 2s in b[k+1...n])`.\nWe need to maximize this value over all possible `l, r` and `k`.\n\nLet's denote `count1(arr, i, j)` as the number of 1s in `arr[i...j]` and `count2(arr, i, j)` as the number of 2s in `arr[i...j]`.\nFor a chosen `l, r` and a split point `k`, the LNDS length is:\n`count1(b, 1, k) + count2(b, k+1, n)`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible `l` from `1` to `n` and `r` from `l` to `n`. For each pair `(l, r)`, we construct the modified sequence `b` and then find its LNDS. Constructing `b` explicitly and then counting for all `k` would be `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair, leading to an `O(N^3)` solution. Given `N=2000`, `N^3` is too slow (`8 * 10^9`). We need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet's fix `l` and `r`. The sequence `b` is `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\nThe total count of 1s in `b` is `count1(a, 1, n)`.\nThe total count of 2s in `b` is `count2(a, 1, n)`.\nLet `prefix1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[1...i]`.\nLet `suffix2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n]`.\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N)`.\n\nFor a fixed `l, r` and a split point `k`:\nThe 1s can come from three regions:\n1. `a[1...min(k, l-1)]` (unmodified prefix before `l`)\n2. `a[l...r]` (reversed segment, specifically `b[max(l, 1)...min(k, r)]` which corresponds to `a[l+r-min(k,r)...l+r-max(l,1)]`)\n3. `a[r+1...k]` (unmodified segment between `r` and `k`, if `k > r`)\n\nThe 2s can come from three regions:\n1. `a[1...l-1]` (unmodified prefix before `l`, if `k < l`)\n2. `a[l...r]` (reversed segment, specifically `b[max(l, k+1)...min(r, n)]` which corresponds to `a[l+r-min(r,n)...l+r-max(l,k+1)]`)\n3. `a[r+1...n]` (unmodified suffix after `r`, if `k+1 > r`)\n\nThis is still complicated. Let's simplify the structure of the LNDS.\nThe LNDS consists of:\n1. Some 1s from `a[1...l-1]` (prefix before `l`).\n2. Some 1s from `a[l...r]` (reversed segment).\n3. Some 2s from `a[l...r]` (reversed segment).\n4. Some 2s from `a[r+1...n]` (suffix after `r`).\n\nCrucially, all 1s must appear before all 2s in the LNDS.\nSo, we can pick 1s from `a[1...l-1]`, then 1s from the *reversed* `a[l...r]`, then 2s from the *reversed* `a[l...r]`, then 2s from `a[r+1...n]`.\nThe count of 1s from `a[1...l-1]` is `prefix1[l-1]`.\nThe count of 2s from `a[r+1...n]` is `suffix2[r+1]`.\nThese parts are fixed once `l, r` are chosen.\nThe problem then reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s that can be picked from the reversed segment `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`.\nLet `rev_seg = [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]`. We want to find `max_k (count1(rev_seg[1...k]) + count2(rev_seg[k+1...r-l+1]))`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the LNDS of `rev_seg`.\n\nSo, the total LNDS length for a given `l, r` is:\n`prefix1[l-1]` (1s before `l`)\n`+ LNDS_length(a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l)` (1s and 2s within `[l, r]`)\n`+ suffix2[r+1]` (2s after `r`)\n\nLet's define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum LNDS length within the segment `a_i, ..., a_j` if it were reversed.\nThis is `max_k (count1(a_j, ..., a_{j-k+1}) + count2(a_{j-k}, ..., a_i))`.\nThis is exactly `count1_in_reversed_prefix(a_j, ..., a_i, k') + count2_in_reversed_suffix(a_j, ..., a_i, k')`.\nLet's precompute `prefix1[i]` (count of 1s in `a[1...i]`) and `suffix2[i]` (count of 2s in `a[i...n]`).\nThe maximum LNDS for a reversed segment `a[l...r]` can be computed efficiently.\nFor a segment `a[l...r]`, when reversed, it becomes `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`.\nLet's iterate through all possible split points `p` within the original segment `a[l...r]`.\n`p` means elements `a_r, ..., a_p` are chosen as 1s, and `a_{p-1}, ..., a_l` are chosen as 2s.\nThe number of 1s from `a_r, ..., a_p` is `count1(a, p, r)`.\nThe number of 2s from `a_{p-1}, ..., a_l` is `count2(a, l, p-1)`.\nSo for segment `a[l...r]`, its LNDS length when reversed is:\n`max_{p=l-1 to r} (count1(a, p+1, r) + count2(a, l, p))`.\n(Here `p=l-1` means all elements are 2s, `p=r` means all elements are 1s).\nLet `ones[i][j]` be `count1(a, i, j)` and `twos[i][j]` be `count2(a, i, j)`.\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N^2)`.\n`ones[i][j] = ones[i][j-1] + (a[j]==1 ? 1 : 0)`.\n`twos[i][j] = twos[i][j-1] + (a[j]==2 ? 1 : 0)`.\nThen, for each `(l, r)` pair, `LNDS_reversed_segment = max_{p=l-1 to r} (ones[p+1][r] + twos[l][p])`.\nThis takes `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair, so `O(N^3)` overall. Still too slow.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation `max_{p=l-1 to r} (ones[p+1][r] + twos[l][p])`.\n`ones[p+1][r]` is `ones[1][r] - ones[1][p]`.\n`twos[l][p]` is `twos[1][p] - twos[1][l-1]`.\nSo we want to maximize `(ones[1][r] - ones[1][p]) + (twos[1][p] - twos[1][l-1])`.\nRearranging: `ones[1][r] - twos[1][l-1] + (twos[1][p] - ones[1][p])`.\n`ones[1][r]` and `twos[1][l-1]` are fixed for a given `l, r`.\nWe need to maximize `twos[1][p] - ones[1][p]` for `p` from `l-1` to `r`.\nLet `val[p] = twos[1][p] - ones[1][p]`.\nWe need to find `max_{p=l-1 to r} val[p]`.\nThis can be computed in `O(1)` if we precompute prefix maximums for `val`.\nSpecifically, for each `l, r`, we need `max(val[l-1], ..., val[r])`. This is a range maximum query.\nWe can precompute `val[p]` for all `p`.\nThen for each `l, r`, `max_val_in_segment_p` can be found in `O(N)` (iterating `p`).\nThis is `O(N^3)` overall.\nTo make it `O(N^2)`:\nIterate `l` from `1` to `n`.\nIterate `r` from `l` to `n`.\nWhen `r` increments, `max_val_in_segment_p` can be updated in `O(1)` by comparing with `val[r]`.\nSo, `LNDS_reversed_segment(l, r)` can be computed in `O(1)` after `O(N)` precomputation for `val` and `O(N)` for `prefix1`, `suffix2`.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Precompute `prefix1[i]` (count of 1s in `a[1...i]`) for `i=0...n`. `O(N)`\n2. Precompute `suffix2[i]` (count of 2s in `a[i...n]`) for `i=n+1...1`. `O(N)`\n3. Precompute `ones_overall[i]` (count of 1s in `a[1...i]`) and `twos_overall[i]` (count of 2s in `a[1...i]`) for `i=0...n`. `O(N)`\n4. Precompute `val[p] = twos_overall[p] - ones_overall[p]` for `p=0...n`. `O(N)`\n5. Initialize `max_lnds = 0`.\n6. Iterate `l` from `1` to `n`:\n   Initialize `current_max_val_p = val[l-1]`. (This handles `p=l-1` case)\n   Iterate `r` from `l` to `n`:\n     `current_max_val_p = max(current_max_val_p, val[r])`. (Update for `p=r` and all `p` in between)\n     `LNDS_reversed_segment = ones_overall[r] - twos_overall[l-1] + current_max_val_p`.\n     `current_total_lnds = prefix1[l-1] + LNDS_reversed_segment + suffix2[r+1]`.\n     `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_total_lnds)`.\nThis approach is `O(N^2)`. Given `N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6`, which is acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the `prefix1` and `suffix2` arrays for clarity.\n`prefix1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]` (using 0-indexed arrays).\n`suffix2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n`ones_overall[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n`twos_overall[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n`val[p] = twos_overall[p] - ones_overall[p]`.\nIndices for `l, r` are 1-based in problem, but 0-based in Python.

Reversed it's `[1, 2]`.\nNew array `b = [a[0], a_rev[0], a_rev[1], a[3]] = [1, 1, 2, 2]`.\nLNDS of `[1, 1, 2, 2]` is 4.\n\nMy calculation for `l=1, r=2`:\n`prefix1[l]` (`prefix1[1]`) is 1. (1s before `a[1]`)\n`suffix2[r+1]` (`suffix2[3]`) is 0. (2s after `a[2]`)\n`lnds_reversed_segment` for `a[1...2]` (`[2,1]`)\n  `current_max_f_val` for `l=1` starts at `f[1]=-1`.\n  For `r=1`: `current_max_f_val = max(-1, f[2]=0) = 0`.\n  For `r=2`: `current_max_f_val = max(0, f[3]=-1) = 0`.\n  `lnds_reversed_segment = prefix1[r+1] - twos_overall_prefix[l] + current_max_f_val`\n  `lnds_reversed_segment = prefix1[3] - twos_overall_prefix[1] + 0 = 2 - 0 + 0 = 2`.\n  `current_total_lnds = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3`.\n\nLet's re-check the definition of `lnds_reversed_segment`.\nFor `a[l...r]` reversed (i.e. `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`), an LNDS is `max_{p=l to r+1} (count1(a, p, r) + count2(a, l, p-1))`.\n`p` is the split point in the *original* sequence `a[l...r]`.\nIf `p=l`, it means `a[l...r]` are all 2s. This corresponds to `count1(a,l,r) + count2(a,l,l-1)`.\nIf `p=r+1`, it means `a[l...r]` are all 1s. This corresponds to `count1(a,r+1,r) + count2(a,l,r)`.\nThis is exactly `ones_overall_prefix[r+1] - twos_overall_prefix[l] + max_{p=l to r+1} f[p]`.\n\nLet's carefully check `l=1, r=2` (original `a[1...2]` is `[2,1]`).\n`prefix1[l]` is `prefix1[1] = 1`. (This is `a[0] = 1`)\n`suffix2[r+1]` is `suffix2[3] = 0`. (This is `a[3] = 2` which is after `r=2`. But it's `suffix2[3]` which is count of 2s in `a[3...3]`. `a[3]=2`, so `suffix2[3]=1`. Ah, `suffix2[i]` is count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n`suffix2[3]` is count of 2s in `a[3]`. `a[3]=2`, so `suffix2[3]=1`.\nMy `suffix2` array was `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.\n`suffix2[4]=0` (empty segment `a[4...3]`)\n`suffix2[3]=suffix2[4] + (a[3]==2 ? 1:0) = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n`suffix2[2]=suffix2[3] + (a[2]==2 ? 1:0) = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n`suffix2[1]=suffix2[2] + (a[1]==2 ? 1:0) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n`suffix2[0]=suffix2[1] + (a[0]==2 ? 1:0) = 2 + 0 = 2`.\nCorrect `suffix2`: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.\n\nRecalculate `l=1, r=2` (0-indexed):\n`a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\n`prefix1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`twos_overall_prefix = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`suffix2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`\n`f = [0, -1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\n`l=1, r=2`:\n`prefix1[l]` (`prefix1[1]`) is `1`.\n`suffix2[r+1]` (`suffix2[3]`) is `1`.\n`current_max_f_val` for range `p=[l, r+1] = [1, 3]`.\n`current_max_f_val = max(f[1], f[2], f[3]) = max(-1, 0, -1) = 0`.\n`lnds_reversed_segment = prefix1[r+1] - twos_overall_prefix[l] + current_max_f_val`\n`= prefix1[3] - twos_overall_prefix[1] + 0 = 2 - 0 + 0 = 2`.\n`current_total_lnds = prefix1[1] + lnds_reversed_segment + suffix2[3] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4`.\nThis matches the example! `max_lnds` becomes 4.\n\nThe logic seems correct now. The error was in `suffix2` calculation and then the manual trace.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n- `n=1`: `a=[1]` or `a=[2]`.\n  `n=1, a=[1]`:\n  `prefix1=[0,1]`, `twos_overall_prefix=[0,0]`, `suffix2=[0,0]` (oops, `suffix2[0]=0` if `a[0]=1`, `suffix2[0]=1` if `a[0]=2`).\n  `suffix2[1]=0`. `suffix2[0] = suffix2[1] + (1 if a[0]==2 else 0)`.\n  For `a=[1]`, `suffix2=[0,0]`.\n  `f=[0,-1]`.\n  `l=0, r=0`:\n    `prefix1[0]=0`, `suffix2[1]=0`.\n    `current_max_f_val = max(f[0], f[1]) = max(0, -1) = 0`.\n    `lnds_reversed_segment = prefix1[1] - twos_overall_prefix[0] + 0 = 1 - 0 + 0 = 1`.\n    `current_total_lnds = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`. `max_lnds = 1`.
