For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into Counting Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out how many ways we can choose these `c_s` values such that the biggest \"beautiful\" multiset has a specific size, `f`.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on what the problem's saying.  We've got these binary strings, `s`, with a length from 1 to `n`.  Each string has a corresponding `c_s` value between 0 and `k`.  A \"beautiful multiset\" is one where, for any `s`, the number of strings in the multiset that start with `s` is no bigger than `c_s`.\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out the maximum size of this beautiful multiset given those `c_s` values. I realized it's like a max-flow min-cut problem, so I envisioned a binary tree where each node represents a binary string.  The count of strings with `s` as a prefix must be limited by `c_s`, which means distributing these counts in the tree, trying to maximize the number of leaves (strings of length `n`) we can get. I defined `dp[s]` as the maximum number of length-`n` strings with `s` as a prefix. I deduced a greedy approach, where `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`, working this out from the bottom of the tree up. It turns out that the maximum multiset size is just `dp[0] + dp[1]`, where the empty string is the root of this binary string tree, but we're starting with binary strings of length 1, so the `0` and `1` strings are the roots of our considerations.\n\nNow, the main puzzle: we need to count how many sets of `c_s` values get us *exactly* `f` as the biggest beautiful multiset size. Each `c_s` has `k+1` choices, but there are a lot of `s` strings, so brute-forcing all combinations is out of the question.\n\nI hit on a dynamic programming idea. I'll build a table `g[L][val]` which says how many ways you can assign values `c_s` for strings of length `L` to `n` (and sub-trees) such that the maximum number of length-n strings with prefix `s` is `val`.  The base case is `L = n` where `g[n][val]` is 1 if `c_s=val` and 0 otherwise. For levels below `n`, I work through the possible `c_s`, and counts associated with sub-trees.  I need `h[L+1][S]`, a convolution-style sum that gives counts of sub-trees that add up to `S` for their total `dp` values. I then get this from the `h` value by determining the number of possible `c_s` values and doing a summation that gives us `g[L]` by using a precomputed suffix sum (using an array `P`) to optimise the process.  The crux of this is that the count of possibilities is reduced to counting the number of `c_s` values, using a range from 0 to `k`. The maximum value for dp will be at most `k`.\n\nThe key is the recursive relation: `g[L][val] = h[L+1][val] * (k - val + 1) + P[val+1]`. I'll build `g` level by level, using this relation.\n\nNow, I realized that I'll need to do convolutions of polynomials and a fast Fourier Transform is a standard and efficient way to handle this. I'll use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), where convolution turns into point-wise multiplication to perform these faster. The size of the polynomials (degree `2k`) means the transform size needs to be greater than or equal to `4 * 10^5`. I'll pick a power of 2, like `2^19=524288` that's large enough.\n\nThe final answer will be to compute a convolution of g[1] with itself, evaluated at `f`. So, I'll calculate all `g[L][val]`, and finally do the convolution and add the individual elements to get the count. I also need to make sure to do the arithmetic operations modulo the given prime. This all sounds like a solid plan.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to determine the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given all `c_s` values.\nA multiset `M` of binary strings of length `n` is beautiful if for every string `s` (length `1` to `n`), the number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\nLet `dp[s]` be the maximum number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix.\nIf `s` has length `n`, then `s` is a prefix only of itself. So, `dp[s] = c_s`.\nIf `s` has length `L < n`, then any string in `M` that has `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, the total count for `s` is the sum of counts for `s0` and `s1`. However, this sum must also respect the constraint `c_s`.\nSo, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp[0] + dp[1]`, where `0` and `1` are the binary strings of length 1. (These are the roots of the two main subtrees of strings of length `n`).\n\nThe problem requires us to count ways to choose `c_s` values such that `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\nSince all strings of the same length behave symmetrically, we can use dynamic programming on the length `L` of the string `s`.\nLet `g[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` for all strings `s'` in the subtree rooted at a generic string `s` of length `L`, such that `dp[s]` evaluates to `val`.\nThe `dp[s]` values can range from `0` to `k`.\n\n**Base Case:** `L = n`\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `dp[s] = c_s`. Since `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, `g[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step:** For `L` from `n-1` down to `1`\nTo compute `g[L][val]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`.\n`dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nLet `val_0 = dp[s0]` and `val_1 = dp[s1]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `dp[s0] = val_0` is `g[L+1][val_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `dp[s1] = val_1` is `g[L+1][val_1]`.\nThe total number of ways to achieve `dp[s0] + dp[s1] = S` is `h[S] = sum_{val_0=0 to S} (g[L+1][val_0] * g[L+1][S-val_0])`. This is a polynomial convolution: `h = g[L+1] * g[L+1]`.\nThe maximum value `S` can take is `k + k = 2k`.\n\nNow, for a fixed `S` and `val`, we need to count how many `c_s` values satisfy `min(c_s, S) = val`.\n*   If `val < S`: This implies `c_s = val`. There is `1` such `c_s` (provided `0 <= val <= k`).\n*   If `val = S`: This implies `c_s >= S`. There are `k - S + 1` such `c_s` (provided `0 <= S <= k`).\n*   If `val > S`: This is impossible.\n\nSo, `g[L][val]` can be expressed as:\n`g[L][val] = (h[val] * (k - val + 1)) % MOD` (if `0 <= val <= k`)\n            `+ sum_{S=val+1 to 2k} (h[S] * 1) % MOD` (if `0 <= val <= k`)\nLet `P[X] = sum_{i=X to 2k} h[i]` be the suffix sums of `h`.\nThen, `g[L][val] = (h[val] * (k - val + 1) + P[val+1]) % MOD`.\nWe need to ensure `val` and `S` are within valid bounds (`0` to `k` for `val`, `0` to `2k` for `S`).\n\n**Computational Complexity:**\nThe maximum value for `k` is `2 * 10^5`.\nThe length of `g[L]` polynomial is `k+1`.\nThe length of `h` polynomial is `2k+1`.\nComputing `h = g[L+1] * g[L+1]` using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) takes `O(k log k)` time.\nComputing suffix sums `P` takes `O(k)` time.\nComputing `g[L]` from `h` and `P` takes `O(k)` time.\nThere are `n` levels in the DP (from `n` down to `1`).\nTotal time complexity: `n * O(k log k)`.\nWith `n=15, k=2*10^5`, this is `15 * 2*10^5 * log(2*10^5) approx 15 * 2*10^5 * 18 approx 5.4 * 10^7`, which is feasible.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAfter computing `g[1]`, the total maximum size of the multiset is `dp[0] + dp[1]`.\nWe need `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\nThe number of ways is `sum_{val_0=0 to f} (g[1][val_0] * g[1][f - val_0]) % MOD`.\nSince `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` cannot exceed `k`, `val_0` and `f - val_0` must both be at most `k`.\nSo the sum is `sum_{val_0=max(0, f-k) to min(f, k)} (g[1][val_0] * g[1][f - val_0]) % MOD`.\nThis sum can be computed in `O(k)` time.\n\n**NTT Modulo and Primitive Root:**\nThe modulus is `998244353`. It is a prime number.\n`998244353 = 119 * 2^23 + 1`.\nA primitive root modulo `998244353` is `3`.\nThe NTT size `M` must be a power of 2, greater than or equal to `2k+1`.\nFor `k=2*10^5`, `2k+1 = 400001`. The smallest power of 2 greater than this is `2^19 = 524288`.\n`M = 524288`. Since `M` divides `MOD-1` (`524288` divides `998244352`), NTT is applicable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to perform modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute modular inverse (a^(mod-2) % mod)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT implementation\n# A: list of coefficients\n# invert: True for inverse NTT, False for forward NTT\ndef ntt(A, invert):\n    n = len(A)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_len = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            w_len = inv(w_len)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = A[i + j]\n                v = (A[i + len_half + j] * w) % MOD\n                A[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                A[i + len_half + j] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            A[i] = (A[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return A\n\n# Function to multiply two polynomials using NTT\ndef multiply_polys(poly1, poly2):\n    deg1 = len(poly1) - 1\n    deg2 = len(poly2) - 1\n    \n    # Determine the size of NTT (next power of 2 greater than deg1 + deg2)\n    size = 1\n    while size <= deg1 + deg2:\n        size <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials to NTT size\n    A = list(poly1) + [0] * (size - len(poly1))\n    B = list(poly2) + [0] * (size - len(poly2))\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    ntt(A, False)\n    ntt(B, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    C = [(A[i] * B[i]) % MOD for i in range(size)]\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    ntt(C, True)\n    \n    # Trim leading zeros if any, though not strictly necessary for this problem\n    # The result will have degree at most deg1 + deg2\n    return C[:deg1 + deg2 + 1]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_counts[val] stores g[L][val]\n    # Initialize for L = n\n    # g[n][val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= k\n    dp_counts = [1] * (k + 1)\n\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # 1.
