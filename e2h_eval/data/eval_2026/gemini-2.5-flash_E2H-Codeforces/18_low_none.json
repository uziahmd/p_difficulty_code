    "thought": "**Diving Deep into the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Frog Jumping\" problem, and the goal is to calculate a sum based on how many distinct positions the frog can reach within a given range.  It's pretty straightforward at first glance, but there are a few subtle constraints that I need to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, the frog's movement: It starts at zero and can jump either forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units. 'a' and 'b' are positive integers, which means there's always the possibility of movement. The critical part is the constraint: the frog can *never* leave the interval `[0, x]`. This is really important because it drastically changes how we determine the reachable positions. If a jump would land the frog outside this range, it's simply forbidden.\n\nSo, `f(x)` is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach *within the bounds* of `[0, x]`.  I'm not looking for a complete path to every point, just the total number of unique positions reachable given these jumping rules and the range limitation.\n\nThe overall task is to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 up to a large number 'm' (10^9).  'a' and 'b' are much smaller (up to 10^5), so there's a good chance this is where the optimization lies.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to effectively determine `f(x)`.  I'll call the set of reachable positions for a given 'x' as `R_x`. I'm starting from the base case. If x is zero, and we cannot move forward or backward (so a=b=0, this is not a valid condition). Then, the only reachable position is zero itself. So, `f(0)` is simply 1.\n\nThe bread and butter of this problem is finding `R_x` for any 'x'. My initial thought is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) would work well here. I'd begin with `R_x` containing just 0, and then I'd use a queue/stack to explore reachable positions. For each position 'p' I'm exploring, I'd check:\n* If `p + a <= x`, I'd add `p + a` to the reachable set and queue it.\n* If `p - b >= 0`, I'd add `p - b` to the reachable set and queue it.\n\nThis iterative approach should, in theory, explore every possible path and locate all reachable positions within the constraint.  The reachable positions must always be a subset of the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: I'm noticing a key pattern.  Since we're always adding or subtracting 'a' and 'b', all the reachable positions are multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b'. If a number 'p' is reachable, then all points that differ from 'p' by multiples of `gcd(a, b)` could potentially be reachable, provided they fall within the bounds of `[0, x]`. All of the reachable points 'p' must satisfy `p = 0 mod gcd(a,b)`. This insight could dramatically reduce the complexity because instead of evaluating every single position between 0 and x, I can limit myself to multiples of the GCD. I can make an optimization using this information.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `S = sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, given that it can jump `+a` or `-b`, and it must *never* jump outside the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nFirst, let's understand the set of reachable points. All reachable points must be non-negative. Since the frog starts at `0`, and all jumps are `+a` or `-b`, any reachable point `p` must be of the form `k_1 \\cdot a - k_2 \\cdot b` for some non-negative integers `k_1, k_2`. This implies that `p` must be a multiple of `g = gcd(a, b)`. So, `f(x)` counts only multiples of `g` within `[0, x]` that are reachable.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum position `k >= 0` such that `k \\equiv i \\pmod{a}` is reachable from `0` using jumps `+a` and `-b`, *without any upper bound constraint*. If `i` is not reachable, `dp[i] = infinity`.\nWe can find `dp[i]` for `i \\in [0, a-1]` using a Dijkstra-like algorithm. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = infinity` for `i \\in [1, a-1]`. Use a min-priority queue.\nWhen we extract `u` from the priority queue:\n1. Try jumping `+a`: `(u+a) % a = u % a`. This doesn't change the remainder modulo `a`. Since we are seeking the minimum non-negative value for each remainder, `u` is already the minimum for `u % a`.\n2. Try jumping `-b`: The new position would be `u-b`. The remainder modulo `a` would be `(u-b) % a`. Let this be `v_rem = (u-b % a + a) % a`. If `u-b` is non-negative, and `u-b < dp[v_rem]`, we update `dp[v_rem] = u-b` and push `(u-b, v_rem)` to the priority queue.\nThis process finds the smallest non-negative integer `dp[i]` for each `i \\in [0, a-1]` that is reachable from `0` by `k_1 a - k_2 b` jumps. All `dp[i]` values will be multiples of `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[i]` for all `i \\in [0, a-1]`:\nFor a given `x`, the frog can reach any position `p` if:\n1. `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps (i.e., `p = dp[p % a] + k \\cdot a` for some `k \\ge 0`).\n2. All intermediate positions on the path to `p` are within `[0, x]`.\n3. Any jump `+a` from `p'` must satisfy `p'+a <= x`.\n4. Any jump `-b` from `p'` must satisfy `p'-b >= 0`.\n\nThe condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" means that if we are at `p`, we can only jump to `p+a` if `p+a <= x`, and we can only jump to `p-b` if `p-b >= 0`. This is the standard BFS/DFS interpretation of reachability within bounds.\nThe set of reachable points `R_x` for a given `x` can be found by a BFS starting from `0`.\n`Q = {0}`, `visited = {0}`.\nWhile `Q` is not empty:\n  `curr = Q.pop_front()`\n  If `curr + a <= x` and `curr + a` not in `visited`:\n    `visited.add(curr + a)`\n    `Q.push_back(curr + a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`:\n    `visited.add(curr - b)`\n    `Q.push_back(curr - b)`\nThen `f(x) = |visited|`.\n\nThe `dp` array helps us optimize this. Let `max_reachable_val[i]` be the maximum value `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod{a}` and `p` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\nIf `p` is reachable, then any `p' = p + k \\cdot a` (for `k \\ge 0`) is also reachable *if `p' \\le x` and `p'` is not blocked by `-b` jumps*.\nSpecifically, if `p` is reachable, then `p, p+a, p+2a, ..., p+k_max a` are all reachable, where `p+k_max a \\le x`. The number of such points is `floor((x-p)/a) + 1`.\n\nThe `dp[i]` values are the smallest non-negative numbers congruent to `i \\pmod a` that are reachable.\nFor any `x`, the points reachable are `p` such that `p \\ge dp[p % a]` and `p \\le x`.\nThe actual `f(x)` is determined by the maximum point `max_val` reachable. If `max_val < dp[i]` for some `i`, then no points congruent to `i \\pmod a` are reachable.\nThe important observation is that if `p` is reachable and `p+a \\le x`, then `p+a` is also reachable. This means for each `i \\in [0, a-1]`, if `dp[i] \\le x` is reachable, then all points `dp[i], dp[i]+a, dp[i]+2a, \\dots, dp[i]+k \\cdot a` such that `dp[i]+k \\cdot a \\le x` are reachable. The number of such points is `(x - dp[i]) / a + 1`.\nThe number of distinct integers `f(x)` is `sum((x - dp[i]) / a + 1)` for all `i` such that `dp[i] \\le x`.\n\nThe values `dp[i]` can be up to `a \\cdot b`. Since `a, b \\le 10^5`, `a \\cdot b` can be `10^{10}`, which is too large for `dp` states directly. However, the maximum value for `dp[i]` (the smallest non-negative `k_1 a - k_2 b`) is bounded by `a+b`. This is because if `p \\ge a+b` is reachable, then `p-b` or `p-2b`, etc., must have been reachable previously, and we can find a smaller value. More formally, the smallest non-negative integer `p` for which `p \\equiv i \\pmod a` is reachable is bounded by `a \\cdot (b/g)`. Since `b/g \\le b`, this bound is `a \\cdot b`. This is incorrect. The maximum value for `dp[i]` is bounded by `a \\cdot b / g - a`. A tighter bound is `a+b`. Let's re-evaluate.\nThe actual bound for `dp[i]` is `a + b - gcd(a,b)`. For `a=5, b=3`, `g=1`. `dp[0]=0, dp[1]=5, dp[2]=2, dp[3]=(-3+5)=2`, no, `dp[3]=3` (from 0+3 is not allowed), from 0+5=5, then 5-3=2, then 2+5=7, 7-3=4, 4+5=9, 9-3=6, 6-3=3. So `dp[3]=3`. `dp[4]=4`. All `dp[i] <= 5`.\nThe `dp[i]` values are bounded by `max(a, b)`. Actually, the minimum positive value for `k_1 a - k_2 b` is `g`. The maximum value of `dp[i]` is bounded by `a+b-g`. For `a=1, b=2019`, `g=1`. `dp[0]=0`. All other `dp[i]` are `i` if `i < a=1`. So `dp[0]=0`.\nIf `a=1`, then `dp[0]=0`. `f(x) = (x-0)/1 + 1 = x+1`.\nIn the third example, `m=100, a=100000, b=1`. `g=1`. `dp[0]=0`. `dp[1]=100000-1*100000 = 0` (no, `dp[1]` is `100000-99999*1=1` if `1` is reachable).\nFor `a=100000, b=1`: `g=1`.\n`dp[0]=0`.\n`dp[1]` is the smallest `p \\ge 0` such that `p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100000}`.\n`p = 0 + k_1 \\cdot 100000 - k_2 \\cdot 1`.\nWe want `p=1`. This is reachable as `1 \\cdot 100000 - 99999 \\cdot 1 = 1`. So `dp[1]=1`.\nSimilarly, `dp[i]=i` for all `i \\in [0, 99999]`.\nSo for `a=100000, b=1`, `dp[i]=i` for all `i < a`.\nThen `f(x) = sum((x-dp[i])/a + 1)` for `dp[i] \\le x`.\nIf `x < a`, then only `dp[i]=i \\le x` are relevant. For these, `(x-i)/a + 1 = (x-i)/100000 + 1 = 0+1=1`.\nSo `f(x)` is the number of `i \\le x` such that `dp[i]=i`. This is `x+1`.\nFor `m=100`, `f(i)=i+1` for `i \\le 100`. Sum `sum(i+1 for i=0 to 100) = sum(j for j=1 to 101) = 101*102/2 = 5151`.\nThe example output is `101`. This suggests `f(i)=1` for `i \\le 100`.\nWhy `f(i)=1`? Because if `x < a`, then `0+a > x` is forbidden. The only allowed jump is `0-b` if `b=0` (not allowed). So only `0` is reachable. `f(x)=1` for `x < a`.\nThis means the `dp` array approach is not sufficient because it doesn't enforce the \"never jump outside `[0, x]`\" rule for *intermediate* steps. It only enforces `p \\le x` for the final `p`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f(x)`:\n`f(x)` is the number of reachable points `p` in `[0, x]` such that all steps `k \\to k+a` or `k \\to k-b` are within `[0, x]`.\nThis means we can only jump `+a` from `k` if `k+a \\le x`.\nWe can only jump `-b` from `k` if `k-b \\ge 0`.\n\nThe set of reachable points for `f(x)` is exactly the set of points `p` in `[0, x]` such that `p \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` AND `p` can be reached by a series of `+a` and `-b` jumps *where all intermediate points are in `[0, x]`*.\n\nLet `dist[i]` be the minimum number of `+a` jumps needed to reach a point `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod g` and `p` is reachable from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps within `[0, max_val]`. This is also not quite right.\n\nLet `reachable[p]` be true if `p` is reachable.\n`reachable[0] = true`.\nUse a BFS. `Q = {0}`.\nWhen `curr` is popped:\n  If `curr + a <= x`: add `curr+a` to `Q` if not visited.\n  If `curr - b >= 0`: add `curr-b` to `Q` if not visited.\nThis is exactly what the problem asks.\n\nThe issue is that `x` changes from `0` to `m`. A BFS for each `x` from `0` to `m` would be too slow (`m \\cdot (x/g)` states, `m \\cdot m` or `m \\cdot (a+b)`).\n`m` is `10^9`, `a, b` are `10^5`.\n\nNotice that `f(x)` is non-decreasing. `f(x+1) >= f(x)`.\nThe set of reachable points `R_x` can be found using a BFS. The maximum value in `R_x` is `max(R_x)`.\nIf `x < a`, then `0+a > x`, so no `+a` jumps are possible. Only `0-b` jumps are possible if `b=0` (not allowed). So only `0` is reachable. `f(x)=1` for `x < a`.\nThis explains example 3: `m=100, a=100000, b=1`. For `i \\le 100`, `i < a`. So `f(i)=1`. Sum is `101 * 1 = 101`. This matches.\n\nSo, for `i < a`, `f(i) = 1`.\nThe sum for `i \\in [0, min(m, a-1)]` is `min(m, a-1) + 1`. Let `m_0 = min(m, a-1)`. Sum is `(m_0+1) * 1`.\n\nNow consider `i >= a`.\nFor `x >= a`, `0+a` is a possible jump. So `a` is reachable.\nThe set of reachable points `R_x` is determined by the `a` and `b` values, and the upper bound `x`.\nThe maximum point reachable will be `x` itself, or some `p < x`.\nThe minimum point reachable will always be `0`.\n\nLet `max_reach[k]` be the maximum value `p` such that `p \\equiv k \\pmod g` and `p` is reachable from `0` *without any upper bound on `x`*. This is not quite right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum value `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate points are non-negative. This is the `dp` array we discussed earlier, found by Dijkstra. The values `dp[i]` are bounded by `a+b-g`.\n`g = gcd(a,b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`.\nThe state space for Dijkstra is `i \\in [0, a-1]`.\n`dijkstra_dist[i]` = minimum non-negative value `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod a` is reachable using `+a` and `-b` jumps, always staying non-negative.\nInitialize `dijkstra_dist[0] = 0`, others `infinity`. Priority queue stores `(value, remainder_mod_a)`.\nWhen `(u, u_rem)` extracted:\n  If `u-b >= 0`:\n    `v_rem = (u-b % a + a) % a`\n    If `u-b < dijkstra_dist[v_rem]`:\n      `dijkstra_dist[v_rem] = u-b`\n      `Q.push((u-b, v_rem))`\n  // We don't need to consider `u+a` for `dijkstra_dist` because `u` is already the minimum for `u_rem`.\n\nAfter computing `dijkstra_dist` for `i \\in [0, a-1]`:\nThese `dijkstra_dist[i]` values are the \"base\" points for each congruence class modulo `a`.\nFor any `x`, the points `p` reachable are those `p \\in [0, x]` such that `p \\ge dijkstra_dist[p % a]`.\nThe count `f(x)` is `sum_{i=0}^{a-1} ( (x - dijkstra_dist[i]) / a + 1 )` for all `i` where `dijkstra_dist[i] \\le x`.\nThis is still not quite right, because this counts points `p` that are reachable *without an upper bound on intermediate jumps*.\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n`g = gcd(5,3) = 1`.\nDijkstra for `dijkstra_dist[i]` for `i \\in [0, 4]`:\n`dijkstra_dist = {0:0, 1:inf, 2:inf, 3:inf, 4:inf}`. Q = `{(0,0)}`.\nPop `(0,0)`:\n  `0-3 < 0`, skip.\n  No `+a` jumps for `dijkstra_dist`.\nPop `(0,0)` again (error, should be `(value, rem)`).\n`dijkstra_dist[0]=0`.\n`Q = [(0,0)]`\nPop `(0,0)`:\n  `0-3 < 0`.\n  No `+a` to consider.\n  This is wrong. The `dp[i]` values are minimum non-negative values reachable for each remainder modulo `a`.\n  Consider `a=5, b=3`.\n  `0` is reachable.\n  `0+5=5` reachable.\n  `5-3=2` reachable.\n  `2+5=7` reachable.\n  `7-3=4` reachable.\n  `4-3=1` (no, `4-3=1` is reachable).\n  `1+5=6` reachable.\n  `6-3=3` reachable.\n  All `0,1,2,3,4` are reachable.\n  `dijkstra_dist[0]=0`.\n  `dijkstra_dist[1]=1`.\n  `dijkstra_dist[2]=2`.\n  `dijkstra_dist[3]=3`.\n  `dijkstra_dist[4]=4`.\n  These are `dijkstra_dist[i] = i`.\n  Let's calculate `f(x)` using these `dijkstra_dist[i]`:\n  `f(0)`: `dijkstra_dist[0]=0 \\le 0`. `(0-0)/5+1 = 1`. All others `>0`. `f(0)=1`. Correct.\n  `f(1)`: `dijkstra_dist[0]=0 \\le 1`, `(1-0)/5+1 = 1`. `dijkstra_dist[1]=1 \\le 1`, `(1-1)/5+1 = 1`. `f(1)=2`. Example says `f(1)=1`. This is the problem.\n  The `dijkstra_dist` method counts points reachable *if only `p \\ge 0` is required*. It doesn't enforce `p \\le x` for *intermediate* steps.\n\nThe constraint \"never jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`\" means that for a given `x`, the set of reachable points `R_x` is fixed.\n`f(x)` is the size of `R_x`.\nThe `f(x)` function will be:\n- `f(x) = 1` for `x < a`.\n- For `x \\ge a`:\n  The set `R_x` grows as `x` increases.\n  `R_x` is the union of `R_{x-1}` and potentially new points that become reachable because `x` increased.\n  A point `p` can become reachable at `x` if `p \\le x` and `p` was not in `R_{x-1}`, and either `p-a` was in `R_x` and `p-a+a \\le x` (true for `p \\le x`), or `p+b` was in `R_x` and `p+b-b \\ge 0` (true for `p \\ge 0`).\n  This is still confusing. Let's simplify.\n  The set `R_x` is the set of all `p \\in [0, x]` such that `p \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` and `p` is reachable by `+a` and `-b` jumps where all intermediate points `k` satisfy `0 \\le k \\le x`.\n\nLet `reachable_pts[k]` be the set of reachable points `p` in `[0, k]`.\n`f(k) = |reachable_pts[k]|`.\nThis is a standard BFS problem on a graph where nodes are `[0, x]` and edges are `(k, k+a)` and `(k, k-b)`.\nThe maximum value of `x` for which the BFS is small enough is `a+b`.\nThe maximum value of `a,b` is `10^5`. So `a+b` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nWe can compute `f(x)` for `x` from `0` to `A_MAX = 2 \\cdot 10^5` (or `max(a,b) + b` or something similar).\nLet `X_max = max(a,b) + b`. For `x > X_max`, the behavior of `f(x)` might become simpler.\n\nLet `max_val_reachable_from_0_in_interval[i]` be the maximum value `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod g` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]`.\nThis is still not good.\n\nLet's look at the structure of reachable points.\nFor a fixed `x`, we can find `R_x` using BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`, `visited = {0}`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr + a <= x` and `curr + a` not in `visited`:\n    `visited.add(curr + a)`\n    `q.append(curr + a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`:\n    `visited.add(curr - b)`\n    `q.append(curr - b)`\n`f(x) = len(visited)`.\n\nThe crucial insight often comes from the fact that once `x` is large enough, the \"upper bound\" constraint `k+a \\le x` becomes less restrictive.\nSpecifically, if `x` is large enough such that all `p \\in [0, a-1]` which are reachable modulo `g` (i.e. `p=k \\cdot g`) are reachable within `[0, x]`, then `f(x)` grows linearly.\nThe maximum value that `dp[i]` (minimum non-negative for `i \\pmod a`) could take is `a+b-g`.\nLet `L = max(dijkstra_dist[i])` over all `i`. This `L` is `a+b-g`.\nIf `x >= L`, then all `dijkstra_dist[i]` are `\\le x`.\nIf `x >= L`, then for any `p` reachable in `[0, x]`, `p \\in [0, x]`.\nThe set of reachable points for `x \\ge L` will be all multiples of `g` in `[0, x]`.\nWhy? If `x \\ge L = a+b-g`, then all values `0, g, 2g, ..., a+b-g` are reachable.\nAnd since `a, b` are multiples of `g`, any `k \\cdot g` can be expressed as `k_1 a - k_2 b`.\nSo if `x \\ge L`, all multiples of `g` in `[0, x]` are reachable.\n`f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1` for `x \\ge L`.\n\nLet's verify this claim.\nIf `x \\ge a+b-g`, then any `p \\in [0, x]` that is a multiple of `g` is reachable.\nThis is a standard result from Frobenius Coin Problem / Linear Diophantine Equations. Any multiple of `g` greater than or equal to `a+b-g` can be expressed as `k_1 a + k_2 b` for non-negative `k_1, k_2`.\nHere we have `k_1 a - k_2 b`. Any multiple of `g` is reachable by `k_1 a - k_2 b` if we don't have the non-negativity constraint.\nWith the non-negativity constraint, `dp[i]` values are the smallest non-negative values.\nThe maximum value among `dp[i]` (for `i \\in [0, a-1]`) is `a+b-g`. So all `p \\in [0, a+b-g]` which are multiples of `g` are reachable.\nIf `x \\ge a+b-g`, then all `p \\in [0, x]` which are multiples of `g` are reachable.\nProof: Let `p = k \\cdot g \\le x`. If `p < a+b-g`, it is reachable. If `p \\ge a+b-g`, then `p = k_1 a + k_2 b` for `k_1, k_2 \\ge 0`.\nThis is for `+a` and `+b` jumps. For `+a` and `-b` jumps, it is more complex.\nThe set of reachable points (always `\\ge 0`) is `\\{ k \\cdot g \\mid k \\ge 0 \\}`.\nThe `dijkstra_dist[i]` values are the smallest non-negative values for each `i \\pmod a`.\nThe maximum of these `dijkstra_dist[i]` values is `a+b-g`.\nLet `L_0 = max(dijkstra_dist[i])`.\nFor `x \\ge L_0`, `f(x)` should be `x/g + 1`. This is because for any `p \\in [0, x]` that is a multiple of `g`, `p` can be written as `dijkstra_dist[p % a] + k \\cdot a` for some `k \\ge 0`. Since `p \\ge dijkstra_dist[p % a]`, this `k` is non-negative.\nAnd `dijkstra_dist[p % a]` is reachable *staying non-negative*.\nSo if `x \\ge L_0`, then `f(x) = x/g + 1`.\n`L_0` can be up to `a+b-g`.\nFor `a=5, b=3, g=1`. `L_0 = 5+3-1 = 7`.\nSo for `x \\ge 7`, `f(x) = x/1 + 1 = x+1`.\nLet's check example 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n`f(0)=1`.\n`f(1)=1`.\n`f(2)=1`.\n`f(3)=1`.\n`f(4)=1`.\n`f(5)=3`. (0, 5, 2 reachable)\n`f(6)=3`. (0, 5, 2 reachable)\n`f(7)=8`. (0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3 reachable)\nSum: `1+1+1+1+1+3+3+8 = 19`.\nMy `L_0` logic: `f(x) = x+1` for `x \\ge 7`. So `f(7)=7+1=8`. This matches.\nFor `x < 7`, `f(x)` is not `x+1`.\nSo we need to compute `f(x)` explicitly for `x` up to `L_0`.\n`L_0 = a+b-g`. Max `L_0` is `10^5 + 10^5 - 1 = 2 \\cdot 10^5 - 1`.\nThis range is small enough to compute `f(x)` using BFS.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Compute `dijkstra_dist[i]` for `i \\in [0, a-1]`.\n   `dijkstra_dist[i]` is the minimum non-negative value `p` such that `p \\equiv i \\pmod a` is reachable using `+a` and `-b` jumps (staying non-negative).\n   Use Dijkstra:\n     `dijkstra_dist = array of size a, initialized to infinity`\n     `dijkstra_dist[0] = 0`\n     `pq = PriorityQueue()`\n     `pq.put((0, 0))` // (value, remainder_mod_a)\n     While `pq` is not empty:\n       `val, rem = pq.get()`\n       If `val > dijkstra_dist[rem]`: continue\n       `next_val = val - b`\n       `next_rem = (next_val % a + a) % a`\n       If `next_val >= 0` and `next_val < dijkstra_dist[next_rem]`:\n         `dijkstra_dist[next_rem] = next_val`\n         `pq.put((next_val, next_rem))`\n3. Find `L_0 = max(dijkstra_dist[i])` for `i \\in [0, a-1]`.\n   This `L_0` is the threshold where `f(x)` becomes `x/g + 1`.\n   `L_0` can be up to `a+b-g`.\n4. Calculate `f_vals[i]` for `i \\in [0, min(m, L_0)]`.\n   We can do this incrementally.\n   `visited = {0}`\n   `q = deque([0])`\n   `current_sum = 0`\n   `max_x_to_compute = min(m, L_0)`\n   `f_values_up_to_L0 = [0] * (max_x_to_compute + 1)`\n   `f_values_up_to_L0[0] = 1`\n\n   To compute `f(x)` for `x` from `1` to `max_x_to_compute`:\n   We need to know `f(x-1)` to compute `f(x)`.\n   The `f(x)` function is `len(visited)` for BFS on `[0, x]`.\n   So, `f(x)` can be computed by taking `f(x-1)` and adding any new points that become reachable *because the upper bound increased from `x-1` to `x`*.\n   A point `p` becomes reachable at `x` if `p=x`, and `p` can be reached from `R_x` (i.e. `p-a \\in R_x` or `p+b \\in R_x`).\n   This suggests a BFS where the upper bound `x` is gradually increased.\n   Start BFS for `x=0`: `visited={0}`, `q={0}`. `f(0)=1`.\n   For `x=1, \\dots, max_x_to_compute`:\n     `f(x) = f(x-1)`.\n     Check if `x` itself is reachable. If `x-a` is in `visited` or `x+b` is in `visited` (and `x+b` is reachable from `0` when `x+b` is the max), then `x` becomes reachable.\n     This is tricky. We need to add `x` to `q` if it's reachable, and then continue BFS from `x`.\n     This means `visited` and `q` should persist.\n     `visited = {0}`\n     `q = deque([0])`\n     `total_sum = 0`\n     `curr_f_val = 1`\n     For `x` from `0` to `max_x_to_compute`:\n       `total_sum += curr_f_val`\n       If `x == max_x_to_compute`: break\n       // Now update for `x+1`\n       // Any point `p` that was reachable in `[0, x]` is still reachable in `[0, x+1]`.\n       // We only need to check if `x+1` itself becomes reachable.\n       // `x+1` becomes reachable if `x+1-a` was reachable in `[0, x+1]` or `x+1+b` was reachable in `[0, x+1]`\n       // The problem is that the `q` and `visited` are for a fixed `x`.\n       // We need to re-run BFS for each `x`. This is too slow. `L_0` can be `2 \\cdot 10^5`. `L_0^2` is `4 \\cdot 10^{10}`.\n\nA better way to compute `f(x)` for `x \\in [0, L_0]`:\nUse a BFS-like approach.\nLet `min_cost[rem]` be the minimum `value` such that `value \\equiv rem \\pmod g` and `value` is reachable.\n`min_cost` is an array of size `g`.\n`min_cost[0] = 0`.
