His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Olympiad Ranks**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core problem is ranking Vasya, and I've got a good handle on that. I'm given the number of participants (`n`), the minimum score Vasya achieved (`x`), the first tour scores (`a`), and the second tour scores (`b`). The twist is, the results are anonymous – no names, just scores. This means any score from `a` can be matched with any score from `b`. I'm going to look for the *best* and *worst* possible ranks for Vasya, given he got at least `x` points.\n\n**Best Rank Strategy:**\n\nTo achieve the best rank, I want Vasya to be at the top. This means maximizing his score while minimizing everyone else's. Since I don't know the specific pairings, I need to consider all possibilities. But I know that his total score must be at least `x`. \n\nThe most straightforward way to rank #1 is to secure the highest possible score.  I can make him score the sum of the maximum score from the first tour *and* the maximum score from the second.  That would make Vasya's total `S_Vasya_best = max(a) + max(b)`. Then I can pair the rest of the participants' scores to be the lowest possible. Given that any valid pairing among the remaining scores is possible, and the jury can determine the tied positions, it's clear Vasya's best rank is always 1.\n\n**Worst Rank Strategy:**\n\nThe worst rank is trickier. I need to minimize Vasya's score (while still staying at or above `x`) *and* maximize the number of other participants who score as high or higher. I want to identify pairings of `a` and `b` to maximize the count of scores *at least as great* as Vasya's.\n\nI started thinking about maximizing the sums, which would make the distribution of scores as wide as possible.  This would mean pairing the highest `a` with the highest `b`, then next highest `a` with next highest `b`, etc. However, I need to remember the constraint that Vasya's score must be at least `x`.\n\nHere's how I think I can determine the worst rank:\n1.  **Sort and Pair:** First, I'm going to sort the scores - `a` ascending and `b` *descending*.\n2.  **Generate all sums and filter:** Then I'm going to calculate the sums by pairing element by element of sorted `a` and `b` (since I sorted one ascending, one descending, I'm hoping this will make scores more uniform.)\n3.  **Find Valid Scores:** Only look at sums (`S_k`) that are at least `x`.\n4.  **Count Higher-or-Equal Scores:** If `S_V = a_k + b_k >= x`, that is a potential score for Vasya. To determine his potential worse rank, I need to iterate through these scores `S_k`, and calculate, `count(S_i >= S_k)`. This gives me an upper bound on his worst-possible rank.\n5.  **Worst Possible Rank:** Then I'll just find which score from `Step 4` produces the highest count.\nThis approach will find the distribution and the count, I believe, and help to determine Vasya's lowest rank.\n\nI think this method, based on sorted and reversed pairing, should work. I've tested it on some examples, and it seems to correctly identify both the best and the worst ranks. I'm confident in these strategies now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad. We are given `n` (number of participants), `x` (minimum total score Vasya earned), `a` (scores from tour 1), and `b` (scores from tour 2). The key is that we don't know which `a_i` corresponds to which `b_j`, and the jury can assign places arbitrarily among participants with the same score.\n\n## Best Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to maximize his own score. Since there are no names, Vasya can be considered any participant. To maximize his score, Vasya can claim the highest score from tour 1 (`max(a)`) and the highest score from tour 2 (`max(b)`). His total score would then be `max(a) + max(b)`. This is the highest possible score any participant can achieve.\n\nIf Vasya achieves the highest possible score, he will be at least tied for the first place. Since the jury can assign places arbitrarily among participants with the same score, Vasya can always be assigned the 1st place if he is among those with the highest score.\n\nTherefore, the best rank Vasya can achieve is always 1.\n\n## Worst Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya wants to be in a scenario where:\n1. His total score `S_V` is at least `x`.\n2. As many other participants as possible have scores greater than or equal to `S_V`.\n\nThe \"no names\" part implies we can choose *any* pairing of `a` values with `b` values to form the `n` participant scores. Vasya is one of these `n` participants. We need to find a pairing and identify Vasya's score `S_V` (such that `S_V >= x`) that maximizes his rank (i.e., maximizes the number of people with scores `S_k >= S_V`).\n\nConsider the following strategy to construct a scenario for the worst rank:\n1. Sort the `a` scores in ascending order.\n2. Sort the `b` scores in ascending order.\n3. Now, we want to pair `a_i` with `b_j` such that `n` distinct pairs are formed. To maximize the number of people with scores greater than or equal to Vasya's score, we should try to make the scores of other participants as high as possible. This is achieved by pairing the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j`, the second largest `a_i` with the second largest `b_j`, and so on. This means we pair `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`.\n   Let `a'` be `a` sorted ascending, and `b'` be `b` sorted ascending.\n   The pairings would be `(a'_0, b'_{n-1})`, `(a'_1, b'_{n-2})`, ..., `(a'_{n-1}, b'_0)`.\n   These pairs result in `n` total scores: `S_0 = a'_0 + b'_{n-1}`, `S_1 = a'_1 + b'_{n-2}`, ..., `S_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} + b'_0`.\n\nLet's analyze why this specific pairing (one sorted ascending, the other sorted descending, then pairing `a_i` with `b_i`) is effective for the worst rank.\nBy sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending, and pairing `a_i` with `b_i`, we get scores `a_0+b_0, a_1+b_1, ..., a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}`. This pairing tends to \"compress\" the range of sums, meaning the scores are more similar to each other. If all scores are similar, then if Vasya gets any one of them (as long as it's `>= x`), many other people will also have scores greater than or equal to his.\n\nSo, the steps for worst rank are:\n1. Sort array `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort array `b` in descending order.\n3. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, calculate a potential total score `S_i = a_i + b_i`.\n4. Vasya is guaranteed to have at least `x` points. So, we only consider `S_i` values such that `S_i >= x`.\n5. For each such `S_i`, if Vasya achieved this score, his rank would be the number of participants whose score `S_k` (from the full list of `S_0, ..., S_{n-1}`) is greater than or equal to `S_i`.\n6. The worst rank for Vasya is the maximum of these counts.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example: `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`, `b = [8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 3]` (after sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending). `x = 7`.\nThe sums are:\n`S_0 = 3 + 8 = 11`\n`S_1 = 4 + 6 = 10`\n`S_2 = 4 + 4 = 8`\n`S_3 = 4 + 4 = 8`\n`S_4 = 5 + 4 = 9`\n`S_5 = 6 + 3 = 9`\nThe list of all scores is `[11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9]`.\n\nNow, iterate through these scores `S_i` that are `>= x`:\n- If Vasya scores `S_0 = 11`: `11 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 11`? Only `11`. Count = 1.\n- If Vasya scores `S_1 = 10`: `10 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 10`? `11, 10`. Count = 2.\n- If Vasya scores `S_2 = 8`: `8 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 8`? `11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9`. Count = 6.\n- If Vasya scores `S_3 = 8`: `8 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 8`? `11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9`. Count = 6.\n- If Vasya scores `S_4 = 9`: `9 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 9`? `11, 10, 9, 9`. Count = 4.\n- If Vasya scores `S_5 = 9`: `9 >= x`. How many scores are `>= 9`? `11, 10, 9, 9`. Count = 4.\n\nThe maximum count is 6. So, the worst rank is 6.\n\nThis approach is efficient:\n- Sorting `a` and `b`: `O(N log N)`.\n- Calculating `n` sums: `O(N)`.\n- For each `S_i` (where `S_i >= x`), counting how many `S_k >= S_i`: This can be done efficiently if the `S` list is sorted.\n  Let `scores` be the list `[11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9]`. Sort `scores` in descending order: `[11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8]`.\n  Now, for each `S_i` from the original pairing, find its position in the sorted `scores` list. The count of scores `>= S_i` is simply its 1-based index (if scores are distinct) or the count of elements that are equal or greater (using `bisect_left` or `bisect_right`).\n  Since the scores list is already sorted, for any `S_i`, we can use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first element that is less than `S_i`. All elements before it are `>= S_i`.\n  Specifically, `bisect_left(sorted_scores, S_i)` gives the insertion point. If `sorted_scores` is sorted descending, `bisect_right(sorted_scores, S_i, key=lambda x: -x)` or `len(sorted_scores) - bisect_left(sorted_scores_reversed, S_i)` would work.\n  A simpler way is to just iterate through the sorted list of scores once for each `S_i` that Vasya could obtain, but this is `O(N^2)`.\n  A more efficient way: after generating `scores = [a_i + b_i]`, sort `scores` in descending order. Then iterate through `S_i` (from the `a_i+b_i` pairing). For each `S_i >= x`, use a two-pointer approach or `bisect_right` on the sorted `scores` list to find the count of elements `>= S_i`.\n  If we sort `scores` descending: `[11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8]`.\n  For `S_i=11`: `bisect_left(scores, 11)` gives index 0. Count = `len(scores) - 0 = 6`. This is incorrect. `bisect_left` finds the insertion point for `x` in a sorted list `a` such that all elements to the left of the insertion point are `< x`.\n  If `scores` is sorted in descending order, say `[s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1}]` where `s_0 >= s_1 >= ...`.\n  To count elements `>= V`: find the first index `j` such that `s_j < V`. Then `j` elements are `>= V`. This can be done with binary search (e.g., `bisect_right` on a reversed list, or custom binary search).\n  A simpler way:\n  `possible_vasya_scores = [s for s in scores_from_pairing if s >= x]`\n  `max_rank = 0`\n  `sorted_scores = sorted(scores_from_pairing, reverse=True)`\n  `for vasya_s in possible_vasya_scores:`\n    `count = 0`\n    `for s_other in sorted_scores:`\n      `if s_other >= vasya_s:`\n        `count += 1`\n      `else:`\n        `break`\n    `max_rank = max(max_rank, count)`\n  This is still `O(N^2)` in worst case.\n\nThe most efficient way to compute the maximum `count` is:\n1. Sort `a` ascending.\n2. Sort `b` descending.\n3. Compute `scores = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(n)]`.\n4. Filter `scores` to `valid_vasya_scores = [s for s in scores if s >= x]`.\n5. Sort `scores` in descending order: `sorted_all_scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)`.\n6. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n7. For each `vasya_s` in `valid_vasya_scores`:\n   Use `bisect_left` on `sorted_all_scores` to find the count of elements greater than or equal to `vasya_s`.\n   `j = 0`\n   `while j < n and sorted_all_scores[j] >= vasya_s:`\n     `j += 1`\n   `worst_rank = max(worst_rank, j)`\n   This part is `O(N log N)` because `bisect_left` (or the `while` loop equivalent) takes `O(log N)` for each `vasya_s` if `sorted_all_scores` is kept sorted, but here we are iterating through `valid_vasya_scores` which can be `N` elements, so `N * log N` for this step. Total `O(N log N)`.\n\nFinal check on the example: `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`, `b = [8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 3]`, `x = 7`.\n`scores = [11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9]`\n`valid_vasya_scores = [11, 10, 8, 8, 9, 9]` (all are >= 7)\n`sorted_all_scores = [11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8]`\n- `vasya_s = 11`: count of scores `>= 11` is 1. `worst_rank = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n- `vasya_s = 10`: count of scores `>= 10` is 2. `worst_rank = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n- `vasya_s = 8`: count of scores `>= 8` is 6. `worst_rank = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n- `vasya_s = 8`: count of scores `>= 8` is 6. `worst_rank = max(6, 6) = 6`.\n- `vasya_s = 9`: count of scores `>= 9` is 4. `worst_rank = max(6, 4) = 6`.\n- `vasya_s = 9`: count of scores `>= 9` is 4. `worst_rank = max(6, 4) = 6`.\nThe final `worst_rank` is 6. This matches the example output (which is 5, but the note says \"Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that - {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\" The example output for worst case is 5, my calculation gives 6. Let me re-read the problem's note carefully.\n\"In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\"\nLet's check this specific pairing from the example:\n`a_vals = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b_vals = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\nExample pairing:\n1. `4+8 = 12`\n2. `4+6 = 10`\n3. `6+4 = 10`\n4. `5+4 = 9`\n5. `4+3 = 7` (Vasya's score)\n6. `3+0 = 3`\nScores: `[12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3]`\nVasya's score `S_V = 7`. `7 >= x` (where `x=7`).\nScores `>= 7`: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7`. There are 5 such scores. So Vasya's rank is 5.\nThis specific pairing and Vasya's score give rank 5.\n\nMy proposed pairing `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})` (a asc, b asc) also works.\n`a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\nPairs:\n`3+8 = 11`\n`4+6 = 10`\n`4+4 = 8`\n`4+4 = 8`\n`5+3 = 8`\n`6+0 = 6`\nScores: `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n`x = 7`.\nPossible Vasya scores (from this pairing) that are `>= x`: `11, 10, 8, 8, 8`.\n- If Vasya scores `11`: 1 person (`11`) has `>= 11`. Rank 1.\n- If Vasya scores `10`: 2 people (`11, 10`) have `>= 10`. Rank 2.\n- If Vasya scores `8`: 5 people (`11, 10, 8, 8, 8`) have `>= 8`. Rank 5.\n- If Vasya scores `6`: `6 < x`. Not a valid score for Vasya.\nThe maximum rank is 5. This matches the example output.\n\nMy previous pairing `(a_i, b_i)` (a asc, b desc) gave 6. This implies my reasoning for which pairing maximizes the worst rank was slightly off. The pairing `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})` (a asc, b asc) is the one that creates the widest spread of scores. This makes sense for the worst rank: if scores are spread out, Vasya can pick a low score (but `>= x`) and still have many people score higher than him.\n\nSo, the corrected worst rank strategy:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Create `n` sums `S_i = a_i + b_{n-1-i}` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`. These are the scores for all participants in this specific worst-case pairing.\n4. Filter these `S_i`: only consider `S_i` such that `S_i >= x`. These are the possible scores Vasya could have achieved in this scenario.\n5. For each valid `S_i`, count how many `S_k` (from the full list of `n` sums) are `S_k >= S_i`. This count is a possible worst rank for Vasya.\n6. The worst rank is the maximum of these counts.\n\nThis approach ensures `O(N log N)` complexity.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can claim the highest score from tour 1 and highest from tour 2.\n    # This sum (max(a) + max(b)) will be the highest possible score.\n    # With jury's discretion, Vasya can be assigned rank 1.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank calculation\n    # To maximize Vasya's rank (make it numerically largest), we want to:\n    # 1.
