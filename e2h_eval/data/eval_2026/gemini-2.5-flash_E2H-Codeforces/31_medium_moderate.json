            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. The core is to minimize the new cards Vanya needs to reach a zero sum.  I've got the constraints: `n` cards, maximum value `x`, and the values can be anything from `-x` to `x`.  My first step is to add up the current values, which I'll call `S`.  I then need to figure out the *difference* needed to make the total zero: that's `-S`.  To get the fewest cards, I want each new card to be the biggest help I can get.  So, if `-S` is positive, I want cards with value `x`; if `-S` is negative, I want cards with value `-x`.  This boils down to finding the smallest number of cards with an absolute value of `x` to match the *absolute value* of `S`.\n\nThe key insight is to recognize that the minimum number of cards is the *ceiling* of the absolute value of `S` divided by `x`. Mathematically, that's `ceil(|S| / x)`.  If `S` is zero, I need zero new cards; that's trivial.  For any other value, I just do the calculation and round up to the nearest integer because I can't have fractional cards!  I'm using `math.ceil` to make sure I get the rounding right, and it will handle `S=0` safely. I need to make sure I handle the edge cases like a current sum of zero or needing a card with a value perfectly divisible by x. The algorithm will read `n`, `x`, the card values, calculate `S`, then `abs(S)`, and if it's not zero I'll apply the `ceil(abs(S) / x)` operation, and that's it! I verified the examples and some edge cases, and all is good. This should work efficiently and correctly.\n",
