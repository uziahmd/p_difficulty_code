Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving \"Substitutes in Number\": A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and my initial thought is, direct string manipulation is going to be a disaster. The string can blow up exponentially, making the usual Python string methods far too slow and memory-intensive. I need a more clever approach.\n\nThe problem screams \"modulo arithmetic\" – the remainder modulo 1000000007 is the key.  I need to track the numerical value, not the massive string itself, and keep everything within that mod.  That's my starting point.\n\nThe order of the queries is crucial. Initially, I thought about just applying each query in sequence, but then I realized this could become very complex to track with nested replacements.  The real insight came when I flipped the process around in my head: What if I work backwards? If I know what each digit *eventually* represents after all queries, I can just traverse the original string and compute the final value easily.\n\nSo, I'm thinking of defining `val[d]` and `len[d]` to hold the eventual numerical value and length of the substitution string for each digit `d` from 0 to 9. Before any queries, `val[d]` is simply `d`, and `len[d]` is 1 (the digit itself).\n\nNow, the genius is in the reverse iteration. If I go through the queries from the *last* one to the first, when I see a query `di -> ti`, I know that any `di` at that point becomes `ti`. I can build up the final value and length for each digit *as* I go through these queries, updating `val[d]` and `len[d]`. It's all about how `di` changes and becomes what `ti` represents after all the other potential transformations.\n\nI'm thinking I'll initialize with those base cases: `val[d] = d`, `len[d] = 1`, and then reverse the queries. For a query `di -> ti`, I have to figure out what `ti` eventually represents in terms of `val` and `len`. So, for each digit in `ti`, I recursively look up its `val` and `len` and combine them, taking the modulo `1000000007` to avoid those huge numbers. I'll maintain `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` for each digit and, for a query `di -> ti` update `current_val[di]` with value I calculated by composing `ti`'s constituents and `current_len[di]` with the corresponding length.\n\nThat's the direction I'm taking to crack this problem. I think I'm onto something that keeps the solution efficient and manageable.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string replacements and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string can grow extremely large, making direct string manipulation infeasible.\n\nWe need to observe that each replacement `di -> ti` effectively defines how a single digit `di` transforms into a sequence of other digits. Since these replacements are sequential, a digit `d` might be replaced by `t`, and then a digit `x` within `t` might be replaced by `t'`. This structure suggests that we can determine the final value and length for each initial digit `0-9` by processing the queries in reverse.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\nFor each digit `d` from `0` to `9`, we want to keep track of two values:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that `d` eventually represents.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that `d` eventually represents.\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` represents itself:\n`val[d] = d`\n`length[d] = 1`\n\nNow, we process the `n` queries in reverse order. This is crucial because a query `di -> ti` defines how `di` will behave for *all subsequent queries*. By processing in reverse, when we consider `di -> ti`, we already know the final `val[c]` and `length[c]` for every character `c` that might appear in `ti`.\n\nFor a query `di -> ti`:\nWe need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti`.\nIf `ti` is empty:\n`val[di] = 0`\n`length[di] = 0`\nIf `ti` is not empty:\n`new_val_di = 0`\n`new_length_di = 0`\nIterate through `char` in `ti` from left to right:\n`d_char = int(char)`\n`new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[d_char], MOD) + val[d_char]) % MOD`\n`new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[d_char])`\n(Note: `new_length_di` can exceed `MOD`, but we only need it for `pow(10, ..., MOD)`, so `new_length_di` modulo `MOD-1` is sufficient for the exponent. However, since the maximum total length is `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10` (if `t` is \"1111...\" and then \"1\" becomes \"1111...\"), the length can still be large. For `pow(10, X, MOD)`, we need `X % (MOD-1)` because `MOD` is prime. So `new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[d_char]) % (MOD-1)` is correct for the exponent, but `new_length_di` itself might be larger than `MOD-1`. If `new_length_di` is used as a length for another `pow(10, ..., MOD)`, it needs to be `new_length_di % (MOD-1)` if it's an exponent, or just `new_length_di` if it's the actual length. The problem statement implies we need the actual length for concatenation. Let's re-evaluate: the sum of lengths of `ti` is `10^5`. A single `di` can transform into a string of length up to `10^5`. If this `di` then transforms into `t_j` where `t_j` has `10^5` copies of `di`, the length can grow exponentially. The sum of lengths of `ti` constraint is for the *input* strings `ti`. The *actual* length of the string can indeed be huge. Thus, `new_length_di` should also be taken modulo `MOD-1` for use as an exponent, and `0` if `new_length_di` becomes `0` because `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is `1`.)\n\nLet's refine the length handling:\n`new_length_di = 0`\nFor `char` in `ti` from left to right:\n`d_char = int(char)`\n`new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[d_char], MOD) + val[d_char]) % MOD`\n`new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[d_char])`\nSince `length[d_char]` can itself be large, `new_length_di` can grow very large. We need `new_length_di` modulo `MOD-1` because `pow(10, X, MOD)` is `pow(10, X % (MOD-1), MOD)` by Fermat's Little Theorem (since 10 is not a multiple of `MOD`). If `X` is 0, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1. If `X % (MOD-1)` is 0, then we should use `MOD-1` as the exponent if `X` itself is not 0. A simpler way is to just let `new_length_di` grow normally and only take modulo `MOD-1` when it's used as an exponent. But `new_length_di` itself can be `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10` if `ti` is `10^5` times `d_char` and `length[d_char]` is `10^5`. This requires `new_length_di` to be stored as a `long long` in C++ or Python's arbitrary precision integers. Python handles large integers automatically.\n\nSo, the update rule for `val[di]` and `length[di]` is:\n`current_val = 0`\n`current_len = 0`\nFor `char` in `ti`:\n`digit = int(char)`\n`current_val = (current_val * pow(10, length[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD`\n`current_len = current_len + length[digit]`\nFinally, `val[di] = current_val` and `length[di] = current_len`.\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, we have the final `val[d]` and `length[d]` for each original digit `d`.\nNow, process the initial string `s` from left to right:\n`final_ans = 0`\n`final_len = 0` (not strictly needed, but conceptually follows)\nFor `char` in `s`:\n`digit = int(char)`\n`final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, length[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD`\n`final_len = final_len + length[digit]`\n\nThe constraints: `|s| <= 10^5`, `n <= 10^5`, sum of lengths of `ti` <= `10^5`.\nThe total operations for processing queries in reverse:\nFor each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of `ti` is `L_sum <= 10^5`.\nInside the loop, `pow(10, length[digit], MOD)` takes `O(log(length[digit]))` time. `length[digit]` can be `10^5 * 10^5` in worst case, so `log(10^10)` is about `33`.\nTotal time for queries: `O(L_sum * log(MaxLen))`. `10^5 * log(10^10)` is roughly `10^5 * 33`, which is feasible.\n\nFinal string processing:\nIterate `|s|` times. Each time, `pow(10, length[digit], MOD)` takes `O(log(MaxLen))` time.\nTotal time for final string: `O(|s| * log(MaxLen))`. `10^5 * 33` is feasible.\n\nExample Walkthrough (222, 2->0, 0->7):\nMOD = 1000000007\nInitial:\nval = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nlength = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nQueries:\n1. `2->0`\n2. `0->7`\n\nProcess in reverse:\nQuery 2: `0->7`\nUpdate `val[0]` and `length[0]`. `ti = \"7\"`.\n`char = '7'`, `digit = 7`.\n`current_val = (0 * pow(10, length[7], MOD) + val[7]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`current_len = 0 + length[7] = 0 + 1 = 1`\nSo, `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n`val` becomes `[7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`length` becomes `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nQuery 1: `2->0`\nUpdate `val[2]` and `length[2]`. `ti = \"0\"`.\n`char = '0'`, `digit = 0`.\n`current_val = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`current_len = 0 + length[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`\nSo, `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n`val` becomes `[7,1,7,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`length` becomes `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nAll queries processed. Now apply to initial string `s = \"222\"`.\n`final_ans = 0`\n`final_len = 0`\n\n1. `char = '2'`, `digit = 2`.\n   `final_ans = (0 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n   `final_len = 0 + length[2] = 1`\n2. `char = '2'`, `digit = 2`.\n   `final_ans = (7 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (7 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (70 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n   `final_len = 1 + length[2] = 2`\n3. `char = '2'`, `digit = 2`.\n   `final_ans = (77 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (77 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (770 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n   `final_len = 2 + length[2] = 3`\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the example.\n\nOne edge case for `pow(10, X, MOD)`: If `X` is 0, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1. This is correct. `length[digit]` can be 0 if `digit` maps to an empty string.\n\nThe maximum value of `length[digit]` can be large. For `pow(10, length[digit], MOD)`, we should use `length[digit] % (MOD - 1)` as the exponent because `MOD` is prime. If `length[digit]` is 0, the exponent should be 0. If `length[digit]` is a multiple of `MOD-1` but not 0, the exponent should be `MOD-1`.\nSo, `exponent = length[digit] if length[digit] == 0 else (length[digit] % (MOD - 1))` is not quite right.\nA robust way to handle this for `pow(base, exp, mod)` when `mod` is prime:\nIf `exp == 0`, result is 1.\nElse, `exp = exp % (mod - 1)`. If `exp == 0` *after* modulo, set `exp = mod - 1`.\nThen calculate `pow(base, exp, mod)`.\nPython's `pow(base, exp, mod)` handles `exp=0` correctly. For `exp > 0`, `exp % (mod-1)` is the correct exponent. If `exp % (mod-1)` is 0 and `exp > 0`, it means `exp` is a multiple of `mod-1`, and the result should be `pow(base, mod-1, mod)`.\nPython's `pow(base, exp, mod)` does not automatically apply Fermat's Little Theorem. We need to do `exp % (MOD-1)` ourselves.\nLet `p_exp = length[digit]`. If `p_exp == 0`, `p_val = 1`. Else `p_val = pow(10, p_exp % (MOD-1) if p_exp > 0 else 0, MOD)`.\nNo, this is wrong. `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1. If `length[digit]` is `MOD-1`, `length[digit] % (MOD-1)` is `0`. But `pow(10, MOD-1, MOD)` is `1`. If `length[digit]` is `2*(MOD-1)`, `length[digit] % (MOD-1)` is `0`. But `pow(10, 2*(MOD-1), MOD)` is `1`.\nThe standard way is `exp = length[digit] % (MOD-1)`. If `exp` is `0` *and* `length[digit]` is not `0`, then `exp` should be `MOD-1`.\nSo, `exponent = length[digit]`\n`if exponent == 0: actual_exp = 0`\n`else: actual_exp = exponent % (MOD-1)`\n`if actual_exp == 0 and exponent != 0: actual_exp = MOD-1`\n`p_val = pow(10, actual_exp, MOD)`\n\nThis logic for exponent handling is correct for Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_MINUS_1 = MOD - 1 # For Fermat's Little Theorem exponent modulo\n\n    # Initialize val[d] and length[d] for each digit d (0-9)\n    # val[d]: numerical value that digit d eventually represents\n    # length[d]: string length that digit d eventually represents\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    # This way, when we process di -> ti, val[c] and length[c] for c in ti\n    # already reflect their final transformations.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        query_str = queries_raw[i]\n        di_char, ti = query_str.split('->')\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n\n        if not ti: # If ti is an empty string\n            current_val = 0\n            current_len = 0\n        else:\n            for char_in_ti in ti:\n                digit_in_ti = int(char_in_ti)\n                \n                # Calculate the power of 10 for concatenation\n                # Exponent for pow(10, X, MOD) should be X % (MOD-1) if X > 0, else 0.\n                # If X % (MOD-1) is 0 and X > 0, the exponent should be MOD-1.\n                \n                exp_for_pow = length[digit_in_ti]\n                \n                if exp_for_pow == 0:\n                    power_of_10 = 1 # 10^0 = 1\n                else:\n                    actual_exp = exp_for_pow % MOD_MINUS_1\n                    if actual_exp == 0: # If exp_for_pow is a multiple of MOD_MINUS_1 and exp_for_pow > 0\n                        actual_exp = MOD_MINUS_1\n                    power_of_10 = pow(10, actual_exp, MOD)\n                \n                current_val = (current_val * power_of_10 + val[digit_in_ti]) % MOD\n                current_len = current_len + exp_for_pow # Use original length for actual string length accumulation\n\n        val[di] = current_val\n        length[di] = current_len\n\n    # After processing all queries, calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    \n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n\n        exp_for_pow = length[digit_s]\n\n        if exp_for_pow == 0:\n            power_of_10 = 1\n        else:\n            actual_exp = exp_for_pow % MOD_MINUS_1\n            if actual_exp == 0:\n                actual_exp = MOD_MINUS_1\n            power_of_10 = pow(10, actual_exp, MOD)\n\n        final_ans = (final_ans * power_of_10 + val[digit_s]) % MOD\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
