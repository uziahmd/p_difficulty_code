The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Golden Plate Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the total gilded cells in a series of nested rings on a rectangular plate. The key is understanding how the size of each ring's inner rectangle is determined. The problem states that the *i*-th ring has dimensions of `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This means each ring effectively \"eats up\" 4 cells (2 on each side) from the width and height with each new ring.\n\nMy first thought was to figure out the formula for the number of cells in the border of a rectangle. The usual perimeter formula (2*W + 2*H - 4) works, but only when both width and height are greater than 1. I needed a more robust way to calculate the cells at the border that would handle rectangles with either or both sides equal to 1. After some careful thought, I came up with the `X * Y - max(0, X - 2) * max(0, Y - 2)` formula, which is the total area minus the non-bordering area.\n\nNext, I needed to check the constraints. The critical one is `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This turns out to be important, because it guarantees that each ring will have a minimum width and height of at least 3, making the simple perimeter formula usable.  This means I could use the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` which is equivalent to `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`.\n\nWith that in hand, I can now simply loop through each ring from 1 to `k`. In each iteration, I'll calculate the width and height of the inner rectangle for the current ring, use the perimeter formula, and accumulate the result. I’ll print the total at the end. I then made sure to test this solution with various examples. The implementation uses Python's `map` function to read input and a simple loop to calculate the result. This approach is efficient enough given the constraints on the input size. The solution is now complete.\n",
