Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Knapsack with a Twist: Small Weights, Big Optimization**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got the classic knapsack problem, but with a crucial detail: the item weights are tiny (1, 2, or 3). That's the key to making this run efficiently. A straightforward dynamic programming approach, like the standard 0/1 knapsack, would be way too slow. The usual `O(n*m)` complexity would be a killer here, given the constraints of `n` (up to 100,000) and `m` (up to 300,000).\n\nSo, the game plan is to sort the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights and then sort each group by cost in descending order. This allows us to make \"greedy\" choices, grabbing the most valuable items first. We can then precompute prefix sums for the costs within each group. The prefix sums will provide us with `ps1`, `ps2`, and `ps3`, the sum of the costs of the `k` most valuable items of each weight.\n\nThe heart of the solution lies in iterating through the possible numbers of weight 3 items we can take (up to m/3). For each number of weight 3 items, we calculate the remaining weight, and we need to determine the maximum cost of items of weight 1 and 2 that can fill the remaining weight. This essentially defines a subproblem for which we require efficient computation.\n\nNow, we need to efficiently compute the best combination of weight 1 and weight 2 items, which is the problem S(W) that we defined. We iterate the number of weight 2 items with `k2`, and then determine the optimal number of weight 1 items based on `k2` and W. The crucial observation here is that the functions for summing these costs are concave, which suggests optimization techniques like ternary search or sliding window could be useful.\n\nThe bottleneck here becomes the inner loop where we must repeatedly calculate `dp12[w]`. The computation `dp12[w]` requires looping for each `k2` value. So `O(m/2 * m)` is still way too slow. We must optimize the calculation of `dp12[w]`.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming approach might be optimal.  Instead of computing `dp[w]` as the optimal cost for `w` using *any* of the items, it seems we must consider only items of weight 1 and 2 to create a more efficient method. This seems the optimal approach, and the key will be computing the values of `S(W)` more efficiently than an `O(m^2)` approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`, such that the total weight does not exceed `m` and the total cost is maximized. The key constraints are `n <= 100000`, `m <= 300000`, and `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThis is a variation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem. A standard dynamic programming approach `dp[w]` (maximum cost for weight `w`) would take `O(n*m)` time, which is too slow given `n` and `m`. However, the small range of `w_i` values (1, 2, 3) allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nLet's categorize the souvenirs by their weights:\n- `items1`: costs of souvenirs with weight 1.\n- `items2`: costs of souvenirs with weight 2.\n- `items3`: costs of souvenirs with weight 3.\n\nTo maximize cost, for any given number of items of a certain weight, we should always pick the most expensive ones. So, we sort `items1`, `items2`, and `items3` in descending order of cost.\nThen, we compute prefix sums for each list:\n- `ps1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1.\n- `ps2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 2.\n- `ps3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 3.\n(Note: `ps[0]` will be 0, `ps[k]` will store sum up to `k` items, so `len(ps)` will be `len(items)+1`).\n\nThe overall strategy is to iterate over the number of items of weight 3 we take. Let this be `k3`.\nFor each `k3` from 0 up to `len(items3)` (or until `3*k3 > m`):\n1. Calculate the weight consumed by `k3` items of weight 3: `weight3 = 3 * k3`.\n2. Calculate the cost obtained from these items: `cost3 = ps3[k3]`.\n3. Determine the remaining weight capacity: `remaining_weight = m - weight3`.\n4. If `remaining_weight < 0`, we cannot take `k3` items of weight 3, so we break the loop.\n5. For the `remaining_weight`, we need to find the maximum cost we can achieve using only items of weight 1 and 2. Let's call this `max_cost12(remaining_weight)`.\n6. The total cost for this `k3` is `cost3 + max_cost12(remaining_weight)`. We update our overall maximum answer.\n\nThe core challenge is to efficiently calculate `max_cost12(W)` for various `W` (from 0 to `m`).\n`max_cost12(W)` is the maximum cost using `k1` items of weight 1 and `k2` items of weight 2 such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= W`.\nThis can be expressed as:\n`max_cost12(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n\nA naive calculation of `max_cost12(W)` for all `W` from 0 to `m` would be `O(m * (m/2)) = O(m^2)`, which is too slow.\nWe need to compute `max_cost12(W)` for all `W` in `O(m)` time.\n\nLet `dp12[W]` store `max_cost12(W)`. We can compute this array using a two-pointer approach or a sliding window maximum.\nConsider `dp12[W]` and `dp12[W-1]`.\nWhen we increase `W` by 1, we gain 1 unit of weight capacity. This extra capacity can be used to:\n1. Take one more item of weight 1 (if available).\n2. Potentially adjust the combination of weight 1 and weight 2 items.\n\nLet's define `f(k2, W) = ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)]`.\nWe want to compute `dp12[W] = max_{k2} f(k2, W)`.\nThe key observation is that `ps1` and `ps2` are prefix sums of sorted-descending costs, which means they are concave functions. The sum of two concave functions is concave. Thus, `f(k2, W)` is a concave function of `k2`.\nHowever, `ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)]` is not simply `ps1[W - 2*k2]`. The `min` operator might make it non-concave or harder to analyze directly.\n\nA simpler approach for `dp12[W]` computation:\nWe can compute `dp12[W]` by iterating `k1` (number of items of weight 1) from `0` to `len(items1)` (or `m`).\nFor each `k1`:\n1. `cost1 = ps1[k1]`.\n2. `weight1 = k1`.\n3. `remaining_weight_for_w2 = W - weight1`.\n4. If `remaining_weight_for_w2 < 0`, break.\n5. The maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is `k2_max = min(len(items2), remaining_weight_for_w2 / 2)`.\n6. `cost2 = ps2[k2_max]`.\n7. `dp12[W] = max(dp12[W], cost1 + cost2)`.\nThis is still `O(m * n1)` or `O(m * m)` if `n1` is large.\n\nThe most efficient way to compute `dp12[W]` for all `W` is using a technique similar to the \"two pointers\" or \"meet-in-the-middle\" for the fixed `W` loop:\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_idx = len(items1)` (initially, we take all weight 1 items possible)\n`current_cost1 = ps1[len(items1)]`\n`for k2_idx from 0 to len(items2):`\n  `current_cost2 = ps2[k2_idx]`\n  `weight2 = 2 * k2_idx`\n  `// Now, for the current number of weight 2 items, we want to find the best k1`\n  `// We need k1 + weight2 <= W. So k1 <= W - weight2.`\n  `// The maximum k1 we can take is min(len(items1), W - weight2).`\n  `// As k2_idx increases, weight2 increases, so (W - weight2) decreases.`\n  `// This means we can take fewer weight 1 items.`\n  `// We can maintain k1_idx by decrementing it as needed.`\n  `for W from 0 to m:`\n    `// This is the tricky part. We need to fill dp12[W] efficiently.`\n    `// Let's reformulate: iterate W from 0 to m.`\n    `// For each W, we want to maximize ps2[k2] + ps1[k1] where k1+2k2 <= W.`\n    `// Let k1_max = W. We start with max possible k1 items and 0 k2 items.`\n    `// Then we iterate, taking one more k2 item, and removing two k1 items.`\n\nLet's try a different DP state. `dp[w]` is the max cost for weight `w`.\nWe process items of weight 1 first:\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`for i in range(len(items1)):`\n  `for j in range(m, 0, -1):`\n    `if j >= 1: dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1] + items1[i])`\nThis is `O(len(items1) * m)`, too slow if `len(items1)` is large.\nHowever, if we have multiple items of the same weight, and we want to pick the most expensive ones, we can just use prefix sums for `dp[j] = ps1[j]` for `j <= len(items1)`.\nSo, `dp[j] = ps1[j]` for `j` from `0` to `min(m, len(items1))`.\nFor `j > len(items1)`, `dp[j]` is still `ps1[len(items1)]`.\n\nNow, we add items of weight 2.\n`new_dp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`for k2_idx from 0 to len(items2):`\n  `cost2 = ps2[k2_idx]`\n  `weight2 = 2 * k2_idx`\n  `for j from 0 to m:`\n    `if j >= weight2:`\n      `new_dp[j] = max(new_dp[j], dp[j - weight2] + cost2)`\nThis is `O(len(items2) * m)`, still too slow.\n\nThe key to solving `max_cost12(W)` for all `W` in `O(m)` time is using a two-pointer approach for the values of `k1` and `k2`.\nLet `dp12[W]` be the maximum cost for weight `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_count = 0` (number of weight 1 items taken)\n`current_cost_k1 = 0`\n`for k2_count in range(len(items2) + 1):`\n    `cost_k2 = ps2[k2_count]`\n    `weight_k2 = 2 * k2_count`\n    `if weight_k2 > m: break`\n\n    `// For current k2_count, we want to find the best k1_count`\n    `// such that k1_count + weight_k2 <= W`\n    `// We iterate W from weight_k2 to m`\n    `// We need to maximize cost_k2 + ps1[k1_count]`\n\n    `// This is the correct approach: iterate on k2_count (number of items of weight 2)`\n    `// For a fixed k2_count, and fixed W, k1_count is fixed as W - weight_k2`\n    `// The issue is that ps1[k1_count] is not necessarily optimal if we just take W - weight_k2`\n    `// We need to take min(len(items1), W - weight_k2)`\n\nLet's use the two-pointer approach for `dp12`.\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`ptr1 = len(items1)` // index for `items1` (representing `k1_count`)\n`current_sum1 = ps1[ptr1]` // sum of costs for `ptr1` items of weight 1\n\n`for k2_count in range(len(items2) + 1):`\n    `cost_k2 = ps2[k2_count]`\n    `weight_k2 = 2 * k2_count`\n\n    `// Adjust ptr1 for the current k2_count and remaining weight capacity`\n    `// The total weight capacity for k1 items is (m - weight_k2)`\n    `// We should not take more than (m - weight_k2) items of weight 1.`\n    `// So, ptr1 should be at most (m - weight_k2).`\n    `// Also ptr1 cannot be more than len(items1).`\n    `// We are iterating on k2_count, and ptr1 should decrease or stay same.`\n    `while ptr1 >= 0 and (ptr1 + weight_k2 > m):`\n        `ptr1 -= 1`\n        `if ptr1 >= 0: current_sum1 = ps1[ptr1]`\n        `else: current_sum1 = 0`\n\n    `if ptr1 < 0: break` // No more valid combinations for current k2_count\n    \n    `// At this point, for the current k2_count and corresponding weight_k2,`\n    `// we have ptr1 items of weight 1 such that ptr1 + weight_k2 <= m.`\n    `// The combined weight is (ptr1 + weight_k2).`\n    `// The total cost is current_sum1 + cost_k2.`\n    `// This combination is a candidate for dp12[ptr1 + weight_k2].`\n    `// However, this approach only finds one specific combination for each k2_count.`\n    `// We need to fill all dp12[W] values.`\n\nThe correct `O(m)` computation for `dp12[W]` for all `W`:\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`// First, fill dp12 with only weight 1 items`\n`for W in range(1, min(m, len(items1)) + 1):`\n    `dp12[W] = ps1[W]`\n`for W in range(min(m, len(items1)) + 1, m + 1):`\n    `dp12[W] = ps1[len(items1)]`\n\n`// Now, consider adding weight 2 items.

Inside that loop, we need `max_cost12(W)` in `O(1)`.\nSo, we need to precompute `max_cost12(W)` for all `W` in `O(m)` time.\n\nThis can be done with a monotonic queue (deque) optimization.\nLet `dp12[W]` be the maximum cost for weight `W` using items of type 1 and 2.\n`dp12[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= W/2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)])`.\nLet `g(k2, W) = ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)]`.\nWe want `dp12[W] = max_{k2} g(k2, W)`.\nThe `ps1` and `ps2` arrays are prefix sums of sorted-descending numbers, so they are concave.\n`ps1[idx] + ps2[k2]` where `idx + 2*k2 <= W`.\nThis is a standard \"knapsack with small weights\" trick.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 1 is `m`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `m/2`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `m/3`.\n\nConsider the total weight `W`. We want `max(ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` where `k1 + 2*k2 = W' <= W`.\nIt's always optimal to use maximum possible weight. So `k1 + 2*k2 = W`.\n`dp12[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= W/2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2])`. (assuming `W-2*k2 <= len(items1)`)\nThe `min(len(items1), ...)` part makes it tricky.\n\nLet's simplify the inner `max_cost12(W)` computation.\nWe can compute `max_cost_1_and_2_items[W]` for `W` from `0` to `m`.\n`max_cost_1_and_2_items = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_idx = 0` // current count of weight 1 items\n`current_cost1 = 0`\n`for W in range(m + 1):`\n    `// Try to add a weight 1 item`\n    `if k1_idx < len(items1) and (k1_idx + 1) <= W:`\n        `current_cost1 = ps1[k1_idx + 1]`\n        `k1_idx += 1`\n    `max_cost_1_and_2_items[W] = current_cost1`\n\n    `// Now, we need to consider weight 2 items. This is not simple.`\n    `// The above only considers adding weight 1 items greedily.`\n\nThe most common approach for small weights is to iterate over the number of items of one type (say, weight 2), and then use a monotonic queue for the other type (weight 1).\nLet `dp[W]` be the maximum value for weight `W`.\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`// Populate dp with weight 1 items only`\n`for i in range(1, min(m + 1, len(items1) + 1)):`\n    `dp[i] = ps1[i]`\n`for i in range(min(m + 1, len(items1) + 1), m + 1):`\n    `dp[i] = ps1[len(items1)]`\n\n`// Now, integrate weight 2 items`\n`// For each k2_count from 1 to len(items2):`\n`// We want to update dp[W] = max(dp[W], dp[W - 2*k2_val] + ps2[k2_count])`\n`// This is not quite right.

Read input, categorize items into `items1`, `items2`, `items3`.\n2. Sort `items1`, `items2`, `items3` in descending order of cost.\n3. Compute prefix sums `ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3`.\n4. Initialize `max_total_cost = 0`.\n\n5. Compute `dp12[W]` for `W` from `0` to `m`:\n   `dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n   `ptr1 = 0` // Number of weight 1 items considered\n   `for W in range(m + 1):`\n       `// Option A: Take items of weight 1 up to W`\n       `while ptr1 < len(items1) and (ptr1 + 1) <= W:`\n           `ptr1 += 1`\n       `dp12[W] = ps1[ptr1]` // Max cost using only weight 1 items for weight W\n\n   `// Now, incorporate weight 2 items. This is the tricky part.`\n   `// We iterate over the number of weight 2 items (k2_count)`\n   `// For each k2_count, we can choose to take (ps2[k2_count]) and fill remaining weight with weight 1 items.`\n   `// This is the O(m^2) loop we want to avoid.`\n\nThe solution for this kind of problem often involves iterating over the counts of the *heavier* items and using a more efficient way to select the lighter items.\nSince `m` can be up to `300000`, `m/3` is `100000`. So, the outer loop over `k3_count` is `O(m)`.\nInside, we need `max_cost12(W)` in `O(1)`. This means `max_cost12` must be precomputed in `O(m)`.\n\nLet `f(W) = max_cost12(W)`.\n`f(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)])`.\nThis can be computed in `O(m)` using a deque (sliding window maximum).\nFor a fixed `W`, we want to maximize `ps2[k2] + ps1[k1]` where `k1 = W - 2*k2`.\nLet `h(k2) = ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)]`.\nThe values `ps1[k]` and `ps2[k]` are concave (prefix sums of non-increasing sequences).\nThe sum of a concave function and a concave function (with a linear transformation `W - 2*k2`) is concave.\nThe maximum of a concave function on a discrete domain can be found using ternary search, but this is for a single `W`. We need it for all `W`.\n\nA common technique for this form: `max_{k} (A[k] + B[C - k])` or `max_{k} (A[k] + B[C - 2k])` is using a two-pointer approach where `k` increases and `C-k` decreases.\n`max_cost_1_and_2_items = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_idx = 0`\n`k2_idx = 0`\n`current_cost = 0`\n`for W in range(m + 1):`\n    `// We want to achieve weight W. We can either add a weight 1 item or a weight 2 item.`\n    `// This is not standard DP. We need to iterate over k2_idx and adjust k1_idx.`\n\nThe `O(M)` computation for `dp12[W]` is as follows:\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`ptr1 = 0`\n`for w in range(m + 1):`\n    `// Maximize cost for weight w using only items of weight 1`\n    `while ptr1 < len(items1) and (ptr1 + 1) <= w:`\n        `ptr1 += 1`\n    `dp12[w] = ps1[ptr1]`\n\n`// Now, iterate over the number of items of weight 2. This is the part that needs optimization.`\n`// For each k2_count of items of weight 2, we update dp12[W].`\n`// This is not a simple linear scan. It's a standard knapsack problem with two item types.`\n`// This is the part that is O(M) using a deque.`\n`// For each k2, we want to maximize ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2] for W.`\n`// Let f_k2(W) = ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2].`\n`// We want dp12[W] = max_{k2} f_k2(W).`\n\n`// This is a standard problem. For fixed W, we want max of g(k2) = ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2].`\n`// Iterate k2 from 0 to len(items2).`\n`// For each k2, we have an item (2, items2[k2-1]).`\n`// We can use a deque for each remainder modulo 2.`\n`// dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-2] + current_cost_w2)`\n`// This is for unbounded knapsack. For 0/1 knapsack, we need to iterate items.`\n\nOkay, the constraints `w_i <= 3` and `m <= 300000` strongly hint at a DP approach where `dp[w]` is computed in `O(m)` total time for each item type using specific optimizations for small weights.\nFor items of weight `W_k` and `N_k` items, we can use a deque-based optimization for `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - W_k] + cost_of_kth_item_of_type_W_k)`.\nThis specific optimization allows processing all `N_k` items of weight `W_k` in `O(M)` time, instead of `O(N_k * M)`.\n\nAlgorithm for `dp12`:\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`// Process items of weight 1`\n`for i in range(1, min(m + 1, len(items1) + 1)):`\n    `dp12[i] = ps1[i]`\n`for i in range(min(m + 1, len(items1)) + 1, m + 1):`\n    `dp12[i] = ps1[len(items1)]`\n\n`// Process items of weight 2 using deque optimization`\n`from collections import deque`\n`for r in range(2):`  // Iterate for remainders modulo 2\n    `q = deque()`\n    `for k2_idx in range(r, m + 1, 2):`\n        `// Remove elements from front of deque that are too far or worse`\n        `while q and q[0] < k2_idx - 2 * len(items2):`\n            `q.popleft()`\n        \n        `// Add current element to back of deque`\n        `// The value to store in deque is (index k, dp[k] - (k/2)*cost_of_w2_item)`\n        `// This is for standard bounded knapsack. Here costs are distinct.`\n        `// This is not the right application of deque for this problem.`\n\nThe simpler approach for `max_cost_1_and_2_items` is the one with two pointers for `k1` and `k2` that fill a specific `W`.\n`max_cost_1_and_2_items = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_count = min(m, len(items1))` // Start with max possible weight 1 items\n`for k2_count in range(len(items2) + 1):`\n    `current_cost2 = ps2[k2_count]`\n    `current_weight2 = 2 * k2_count`\n    `if current_weight2 > m: break`\n\n    `// Adjust k1_count to fit remaining capacity`\n    `while k1_count >= 0 and (k1_count + current_weight2 > m):`\n        `k1_count -= 1`\n    \n    `if k1_count < 0: break`\n\n    `// Now, (k1_count, k2_count) is a valid combination that uses exactly (k1_count + current_weight2) weight.`\n    `// And gives cost (ps1[k1_count] + current_cost2).`\n    `// This combination represents the maximum cost for this specific total weight, considering exactly k2_count items of weight 2.`\n    `// We need to fill all dp12[W] values.`\n\nThis `O(M)` approach for `dp12` is actually simpler:\n`dp12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_idx = 0`\n`for k2_idx in range(len(items2) + 1):`\n    `current_cost2 = ps2[k2_idx]`\n    `current_weight2 = 2 * k2_idx`\n    `if current_weight2 > m: break`\n\n    `// For current k2_idx, we iterate through possible total weights W.`\n    `// The remaining weight for items of type 1 is W - current_weight2.`\n    `// We need to find the optimal k1_idx for that remaining weight.`\n    `// The maximum k1_idx for a given remaining_weight is min(len(items1), remaining_weight).`\n    `// As k2_idx increases, current_weight2 increases.`\n    `// As W increases, W - current_weight2 increases.`\n\n    `// This is the correct O(M) way to compute dp12:`\n    `// Iterate over k2_idx.
