    "thought": "**My approach to the \"Tree Sum\" problem centers around a deep understanding of the problem's constraints and the nature of \"good\" trees.** The core challenge lies in calculating the sum of distances, `d(1, n)`, across all valid edge-weighted trees, where edge weights can only be 1 or -1, and each vertex's incident edge weights multiply to -1. The number of such trees is the critical concept. My initial thought process involved exploring the implications of the \"good\" tree definition. This led to the discovery that for a good tree to exist, the number of vertices, *n*, must be even. With an odd number of vertices, there are no valid \"good\" trees, making the answer 0.\n\nOnce I established *n* is even, I recognized the next step would involve finding out the count. Through careful analysis, I proved that given any tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign edge weights to make it \"good\". This is because the weight of any edge is solely determined by the sizes of the components created when that edge is removed. If removing edge (u, v) separates the tree into two components, then the weight of that edge depends on whether the component containing u (or v) has an odd or even number of vertices.\n\nTo get the sum of distances, I knew there was a clever approach to be found. The main insight here, I think, is to change how the edge weights are being considered. I wanted to use edge-centric analysis. By switching the perspective and focusing on edges, I can find the total distance, that's by summing over edges that belong in the paths between node 1 and *n*. This, however, requires careful bookkeeping. I understand the calculation hinges on counting the number of good trees in which any given edge, `(u, v)`, lies on the path from 1 to *n*, which might be tricky but doable. I know the number of good trees with a particular edge on the 1 to *n* path, can be expressed in terms of the sizes of the sub-trees created when we remove edge `(u,v)`. It would be a case of finding the count for each type of tree, using edge inclusion-exclusion techniques, if necessary. And also that might simplify to something involving Cayley's formula and combinations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1,n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$. A tree is \"good\" if the weight of each edge is $1$ or $-1$, and for each vertex $i$, the product of the weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$. $d(u,v)$ is the sum of edge weights on the unique path from $u$ to $v$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the \"good\" condition. For each vertex $i$, let $E_i$ be the set of edges incident to $i$. The condition is $\\prod_{e \\in E_i} w(e) = -1$.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{e \\in E_i} w(e) \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nOn the left side, each edge $e=(u,v)$ appears twice in the product (once for $u$ and once for $v$), so its weight $w(e)$ contributes $w(e)^2$. Since $w(e) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $w(e)^2 = 1$.\nThus, the left side simplifies to $\\prod_{e \\in E} w(e)^2 = \\prod_{e \\in E} 1 = 1$.\nSo, we must have $1 = (-1)^n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, and thus the sum of $d(1,n)$ is $0$. This covers the $n=1$ case in the examples.\n\nNow, assume $n$ is even.\nFor a given tree structure $T$, let's determine the edge weights. Let $y_e = (1-w(e))/2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$, so $w(e) = (-1)^{y_e}$. The condition $\\prod_{e \\in E_i} w(e) = -1$ becomes $\\sum_{e \\in E_i} y_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ with $n-1$ variables (the $y_e$ for each edge $e$). It can be shown that one equation is redundant (e.g., the $n$-th equation is implied by the first $n-1$ equations if $n$ is even). The remaining $n-1$ equations are independent, so there is a unique solution for the $y_e$'s. This means for any tree structure $T$, there is exactly one way to assign weights to its edges to make it a good tree.\nTherefore, there are $n^{n-2}$ good trees (by Cayley's formula).\n\nLet's find the weight of an edge $(u,v)$ in a good tree $T$. If we remove $(u,v)$, the tree splits into two components, say $T_u$ containing $u$ and $T_v$ containing $v$. Let $|T_u|$ be the number of vertices in $T_u$.\nConsider the product of conditions for all vertices in $T_u$: $\\prod_{x \\in V(T_u)} \\left( \\prod_{e \\in E_x} w(e) \\right) = \\prod_{x \\in V(T_u)} (-1) = (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThe left side evaluates to $w(u,v) \\cdot \\prod_{e \\in E(T_u)} w(e)^2 = w(u,v) \\cdot 1 = w(u,v)$.\nSo, $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u|}$. Similarly, $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_v|}$. Since $|T_u| + |T_v| = n$ and $n$ is even, $(-1)^{|T_u|} = (-1)^{n-|T_v|} = (-1)^n (-1)^{-|T_v|} = (-1)^{|T_v|}$. This is consistent.\n\nWe need to calculate $S = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{e \\in P_T(1,n)} w_e(T)$.\nWe can swap the summations: $S = \\sum_{\\text{all possible edges } (u,v)} \\sum_{T \\text{ good, } e=(u,v) \\in P_T(1,n)} w(u,v)$.\nFor an edge $(u,v)$ to be on the path $P_T(1,n)$, removing $(u,v)$ must separate vertices $1$ and $n$.\nLet $T_1$ be the component containing vertex $1$ (and $u$ or $v$) and $T_n$ be the component containing vertex $n$ (and the other endpoint of $(u,v)$).\nThen $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_1|}$.\nThe sum becomes $S = \\sum_{u,v \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}, u \\neq v} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{T \\text{ good, } e=(u,v) \\in P_T(1,n), |T_1|=k} (-1)^k$.\n\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices such that a specific edge $(u,v)$ exists and separates $1$ and $n$ into two components of sizes $k$ and $n-k$ (with $1$ in the component of size $k$ and $n$ in the component of size $n-k$) is given by:\nIf $u=1$ and $v=n$: The number of ways to pick $k-2$ additional vertices for $T_1$ from $n-2$ available vertices is $\\binom{n-2}{k-2}$. Then, form a tree on these $k$ vertices (containing $1$) and a tree on the remaining $n-k$ vertices (containing $n$). This is $\\binom{n-2}{k-2} k^{k-2} (n-k)^{n-k-2}$. This formula is valid for $k \\ge 1$ and $n-k \\ge 1$, with $k^{k-2}=1$ if $k=1$ or $k=2$.\nIf $u=1$ and $v \\neq n$: $v$ is in $T_n$. The number of ways to pick $k-1$ additional vertices for $T_1$ from $n-2$ available vertices is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$. Then, form a tree on these $k$ vertices (containing $1$) and a tree on the remaining $n-k$ vertices (containing $n$ and $v$). This is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-2} (n-k)^{n-k-2}$.\nIf $u \\neq 1$ and $v=n$: Similar to the previous case, $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-2} (n-k)^{n-k-2}$.\nIf $u \\neq 1$ and $v \\neq n$: Both $u$ and $v$ are \"internal\" to their respective components. The number of ways to pick $k-1$ additional vertices for $T_1$ from $n-2$ available vertices (excluding $1$ and $n$) such that $u$ is among them is not $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$. It's $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ ways to choose the set of $k$ vertices containing $1$ and $u$. This is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ if $u$ is chosen, $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ if $u$ is not chosen.\n\nA simpler approach is to use the result that the number of trees $T$ on $n$ vertices where removing an edge $(u,v)$ splits the graph into components of size $k$ and $n-k$ is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n}{k-1}$.\nThis counts pairs $(T, (u,v))$ where $T$ is a tree and $(u,v)$ is an edge in $T$ that splits $V$ into two sets $A, B$ of sizes $k, n-k$ respectively.\nWe need $1 \\in A$ and $n \\in B$.\nThe number of such trees is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nThis expression counts, for a fixed $k$, the number of trees $T$ and edges $(u,v)$ in $T$ such that $u \\in A, v \\in B$ where $A$ is the component containing $1$ of size $k$ and $B$ is the component containing $n$ of size $n-k$.\nThis formula is valid for $1 \\le k \\le n-1$.\nThe term $k^{k-1}$ for $k=1$ is $1$. The term $k^{k-1}$ for $k=n-1$ is $(n-1)^{n-2}$.\nThe sum we want is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\cdot \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\n\nLet $j=k-1$. The sum is $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^j (n-j-1)^{n-j-2}$.\nThis is a known identity related to tree enumeration, sometimes called Abel's identity or a variation of it.\nThe identity is $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (k+a)^k (n-k+b)^{n-k} = n! \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{(a+b)^k}{k!} \\frac{(n-k)!}{(n-k)!}$\nA more relevant identity is $\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (k+x)^{k-1} (n-k+y)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{n(n+x+y)^{n-2}}{xy}$ for $x,y \\ne 0$.\nA specific case of Abel's identity is $\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (k+a)^{k-1} (n-k+b)^{n-k-1} = (a+b) n^{n-2} \\dots$ No, this is also not quite right.\n\nLet $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nLet's check small values of $n$ (must be even).\n$n=2$:\n$k=1$: $(-1)^1 \\binom{0}{0} 1^{1-1} (2-1)^{2-1-1} = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1^0 = -1$.\nThe result for $n=2$ is $-1 \\pmod{998244353}$, which is $998244352$. This matches the example.\n\n$n=4$:\n$S_4 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (4-k)^{4-k-1}$.\n$k=1: (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{0} 1^0 (3)^{2} = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = -9$.\n$k=2: (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{1} 2^1 (2)^{1} = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n$k=3: (-1)^3 \\binom{2}{2} 3^2 (1)^{0} = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = -9$.\n$S_4 = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10 \\pmod{998244353}$, which is $998244343$. This matches the example.\n\nThe formula seems correct. We need to compute this sum efficiently.\n$S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^j (n-j-1)^{n-j-2}$.\nThis can be computed in $O(N \\log N)$ or $O(N)$ time using precomputed factorials and their inverses for binomial coefficients, and modular exponentiation for powers.\n$(j+1)^j$ and $(n-j-1)^{n-j-2}$ should be handled carefully for $j=0,1$ and $n-j-1=0,1$.\n$x^0=1$ for $x \\neq 0$. $0^0=1$ (standard for combinatorics).\nIf $j=0$, $(j+1)^j = 1^0 = 1$.\nIf $j=1$, $(j+1)^j = 2^1 = 2$.\nIf $n-j-1=1$, $(n-j-1)^{n-j-2} = 1^{-1}$ is not well-defined.\nLet's check the terms $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor $k=1$, $1^{1-1} = 1^0 = 1$.\nFor $k=n-1$, $(n-1)^{n-1-1} = (n-1)^{n-2}$.\nFor $(n-k)=1$, $(n-k)^{n-k-1} = 1^0 = 1$.\nFor $(n-k)=2$, $(n-k)^{n-k-1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nSo, all terms are well-defined.\n\nThe maximum value of $n$ is $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\nWe need to compute factorials and inverse factorials up to $n-2$.\n$N_{MAX} = 5 \\cdot 10^5$.\nModular inverse for $a^b \\pmod M$ can be done with `pow(a, b, M)`.\n\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.

Print `total_sum`.\n\nSpecial cases for `power(base, exp)`:\n`power(0, 0)` should be 1. Our base $k$ is $1 \\dots n-1$, so $k \\ge 1$. $n-k$ is also $1 \\dots n-1$. So base is never 0.\nExponent $k-1$ can be $0$ (when $k=1$). Exponent $n-k-1$ can be $0$ (when $n-k=1$).\n`power(base, 0)` should return 1. Standard `pow(base, 0, M)` returns 1.\n\nExample $n=4$:\n$k=1$: `nCr(2,0)=1`. `power(1,0)=1`. `power(3,2)=9`. Term: $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$. $k=1$ is odd, `total_sum = (0 - 9 + MOD) % MOD = -9`.\n$k=2$: `nCr(2,1)=2`. `power(2,1)=2`. `power(2,1)=2`. Term: $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$. $k=2$ is even, `total_sum = (-9 + 8 + MOD) % MOD = -1`.\n$k=3$: `nCr(2,2)=1`. `power(3,2)=9`. `power(1,0)=1`.
