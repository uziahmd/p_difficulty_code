He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design and Optimization for String Formation Verification**\n\nOkay, so the task is to determine if a string `S` adheres to the prescribed rules for its construction. We're given a specific pattern: a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, then 'c's, with certain constraints on the counts of each character. My approach involves a robust, linear-time algorithm to accomplish this.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure the order of characters in `S` is valid. It must start with 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's, with no deviations.  I've devised a state machine that validates the character sequence and counts the occurrences simultaneously.  The approach employs three key counts: `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c`.\n\nNow, considering the rules.  We must ensure that:\n\n1.  We have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (`count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, `count_c >= 1`). This establishes a base level, derived directly from the problem statement's inherent structures.\n2.  The number of 'c's is either equal to the number of 'a's or equal to the number of 'b's (`count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b`). This is the core constraint imposed on the count relation between characters, and we check if one or the other condition holds true.\n\nI also considered other solutions, like utilizing the `in_a_section`, `in_b_section`, and `in_c_section` booleans as indicators. I decided on the state-machine approach, tracking the `current_char_type` using `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.\n\nI subsequently refined it, simplifying the approach further by finding the indices separating the blocks of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to improve efficiency.\n\nThe algorithm now proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Iterate through `S`. Count 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in their order (a, b, then c). At any point, the appearance of a character out of order should yield a \"NO\" print and terminate, e.g. `'c', then 'a'` or `'a', then 'c'`, etc.\n2.  After the initial character order is correct and the string fully read, we finally do the core validity checks:\n    a. Check `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, and `count_c >= 1`. If these conditions are met, then proceed.\n    b. Check if `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`. If so, print \"YES\".  Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n3. The index based code also achieves correctness. The counts can be determined by the difference between block end points in the string, and character ordering is implicitly checked.\n\nThe improved code is linear-time complexity (O(n)) with constant space (O(1)). This is a very efficient solution for this problem given the length of the string as constraint. The algorithm should run quickly and be able to handle strings of many characters.\n\nTests with example cases and boundary conditions (single characters, order violations, etc.) confirmed its correctness. I've now integrated this solution for this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the necessary conditions:\n\n1.  **Stage A (A's string):** The string starts with `N_a` lowercase 'a's, where `N_a \\ge 1`.\n2.  **Stage B (B appends 'b's):** B appends `N_b` lowercase 'b's to the end of A's string. At this point, the string is `N_a` 'a's followed by `N_b` 'b's. The rule states that \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\". This means `N_a \\ge 1` (already established) and `N_b \\ge 1`.\n3.  **Stage C (C appends 'c's):** C appends `N_c` lowercase 'c's to the end of the string. The string becomes `N_a` 'a's, followed by `N_b` 'b's, followed by `N_c` 'c's. The crucial rule here is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`. Since `N_a \\ge 1` and `N_b \\ge 1`, it implies `N_c` must also be at least 1 (`N_c \\ge 1`).\n\nCombining these rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*   **Structure/Order:** The string must consist of a contiguous block of 'a's, followed by a contiguous block of 'b's, followed by a contiguous block of 'c's. No 'a' can appear after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' can appear after a 'c'.\n*   **Minimum Counts:**\n    *   The number of 'a's (`count_a`) must be at least 1.\n    *   The number of 'b's (`count_b`) must be at least 1.\n    *   The number of 'c's (`count_c`) must be at least 1.\n*   **C's Rule:** The number of 'c's (`count_c`) must be equal to `count_a` OR equal to `count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can check these conditions efficiently by iterating through the string once to identify the blocks of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n1.  **Find `count_a`:** Iterate from the beginning of the string `S` to find the first character that is not 'a'. The number of 'a's encountered before this point is `count_a`. Let `idx_a_end` be the index of the first non-'a' character (or `len(S)` if all characters are 'a').\n2.  **Find `count_b`:** Starting from `idx_a_end`, iterate to find the first character that is not 'b'. The number of 'b's encountered in this segment is `count_b`. Let `idx_b_end` be the index of the first non-'b' character after the 'a's (or `len(S)` if all remaining characters are 'b').\n3.  **Find `count_c`:** Starting from `idx_b_end`, iterate to find the first character that is not 'c'. The number of 'c's encountered in this segment is `count_c`. Let `idx_c_end` be the index of the first non-'c' character after the 'b's (or `len(S)` if all remaining characters are 'c').\n4.  **Validate Structure:** After determining `idx_c_end`, we must ensure that `idx_c_end` is equal to the length of the string `n`. If `idx_c_end != n`, it means there are characters in the string that come after the 'c' block, or characters that are not 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the expected sequence (e.g., `aabcx` or `abac`). In such cases, the string is invalid.\n5.  **Validate Counts and C's Rule:** Finally, check if `count_a \\ge 1`, `count_b \\ge 1`, `count_c \\ge 1`, AND (`count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`). If all these conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`S = \"aaabccc\"`):**\n\n*   `n = 7`\n*   **Step 1 (a's):**\n    *   `S[0] = 'a'`, `S[1] = 'a'`, `S[2] = 'a'`.\n    *   `S[3] = 'b'`, so `idx_a_end = 3`. `count_a = 3`.\n*   **Step 2 (b's):**\n    *   Start from `idx_a_end = 3`.\n    *   `S[3] = 'b'`.\n    *   `S[4] = 'c'`, so `idx_b_end = 4`. `count_b = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n*   **Step 3 (c's):**\n    *   Start from `idx_b_end = 4`.\n    *   `S[4] = 'c'`, `S[5] = 'c'`, `S[6] = 'c'`.\n    *   End of string, so `idx_c_end = 7`. `count_c = 7 - 4 = 3`.\n*   **Step 4 (Structure):**\n    *   `idx_c_end == n` (7 == 7) is true. Structure is valid.\n*   **Step 5 (Counts and C's Rule):**\n    *   `count_a = 3 \\ge 1` (True)\n    *   `count_b = 1 \\ge 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c = 3 \\ge 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) is True. (The OR condition is met).\n    *   All conditions met. Print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(|S|) because we iterate through the string a constant number of times. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few variables. Given `|S| \\le 5000`, this is highly efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(S)\n\n    # 1.
