            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is a competitive programming problem where we're given three tiles and need to determine the minimum number of additional tiles required to form a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence).  I'm dealing with Mahjong-like tiles, which are represented as (number, suit) tuples like ('1', 'm') or ('9', 's').  The goal is to determine the minimum draws (0, 1, or 2) required to complete a mentsu.  The problem states that any tile can be drawn infinitely, and that, ultimately, one must find at least one mentsu.\n\nI'll structure the solution around three main scenarios: 0 draws, 1 draw, and 2 draws. The complexity arises in figuring out what constitutes a \"near miss\" - when only one or two draws can make a mentsu.  The critical challenge is to efficiently identify these states.\n\n**Tile Representation & Initial Checks**\n\nFirst, let's get the tile data in a usable format.  The input's string form (\"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\") need to be parsed into (number, suit) tuples, which should be relatively easy.  I can then sort these tiles - by suit and then by number - to streamline the checks for sequences (shuntsu). I will represent tiles as a list of tuples, e.g. `[(1, 'm'), (2, 'm'), (3, 's')]`.\n\n**Zero Draws - Easy Check**\n\nIf the initial three tiles already form a mentsu, the answer is 0.  This is a straightforward check:\n\n*   **Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical? (i.e., `t1 == t2 == t3`).\n*   **Shuntsu:** Do the tiles form a sequence? This is the tricky part. It boils down to the same suit (`t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]`) and sequential numbers.\n\n**One Draw - More Elaborate**\n\nIf the initial tiles don't make a mentsu, could a single tile make it happen? This needs further examination.  If we add one draw, we'll have four tiles to analyze.\n\nKey question: How do we determine if one draw is enough?  This means that with two tiles that could either be a pair (for Koutsu) or almost a sequence (for shuntsu).\n\n*   **Koutsu with one draw:** If any two of the starting tiles are identical, drawing the third one creates a koutsu. (Example: \"1m 1m 2p\" needs a \"1m\" draw)\n*   **Shuntsu with one draw**: Two tiles of the same suit are \"close\" enough to form a shuntsu, just a single number out:  (\"1m 2m\" needs a \"3m\" draw).\n\n**Two Draws - The Safety Net**\n\nIf both 0 and 1 draw scenarios fail, the answer has to be 2. It guarantees you can form a mentsu. It is always possible to make some kind of mentsu if there are at most two extra draws. If you draw two of an existing tile, you make a koutsu. If you draw other tiles (one by one), then it is always possible to build a mentsu.\n\n**The Strategy & Implementation**\n\nIn essence, the strategy is:\n\n1.  **Parse the input into a list of (number, suit) tuples.**\n2.  **Check for 0 draws:** Is a mentsu possible with the given tiles?\n3.  **Check for 1 draw:** Can one draw complete a mentsu, given that now we have 4 tiles?\n    *   **Koutsu:** Do we have at least a pair to draw a third tile?\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Do we have a same suit number that are close? `abs(n1 - n2) <= 2`\n4.  **If both checks fail, the answer is 2.**\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one \"mentsu\" (meld). A mentsu can be either a \"koutsu\" (triplet of three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any tiles infinitely.\n\nThe minimum number of extra tiles can be 0, 1, or 2. We can determine the answer by checking these possibilities in increasing order:\n\n1.  **0 extra tiles:**\n    Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical? (e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m])\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Are all three tiles of the same suit, and their numbers are sequential? (e.g., [1s, 2s, 3s], [5p, 6p, 7p])\n\n    If either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **1 extra tile:**\n    If 0 extra tiles are not enough, check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. When she draws one tile, she will have a total of four tiles. She needs to find if any three of these four tiles form a mentsu. This can happen in two main ways:\n    *   **Form a Koutsu:** If she has two identical tiles among her initial three (e.g., [1m, 1m, 2p]), she can draw a third identical tile (another 1m) to form a koutsu ([1m, 1m, 1m]).\n    *   **Form a Shuntsu:** If she has two tiles of the same suit whose numbers are \"close\" (differ by 1 or 2), she can draw the missing tile to complete a shuntsu.\n        *   If numbers differ by 1 (e.g., [1m, 2m, 5p]), she can draw the third tile (3m) to form [1m, 2m, 3m].\n        *   If numbers differ by 2 (e.g., [1m, 3m, 5p]), she can draw the middle tile (2m) to form [1m, 2m, 3m].\n\n    If any of these conditions are met, the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **2 extra tiles:**\n    If neither 0 nor 1 extra tile is sufficient, then 2 extra tiles must be enough. This is because she can always draw two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles to form a koutsu. For example, if she has [1m, 2p, 3s], she can draw two 1m tiles to form [1m, 1m, 1m]. This guarantees a mentsu with 2 draws.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by checking these cases in order.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Tiles are represented as `(number, suit)` tuples (e.g., `(1, 'm')`).\n*   To check for a shuntsu, it's helpful to sort the numbers of the three tiles of the same suit.\n*   For the 1-draw case, we iterate through all pairs of initial tiles to check if they can form a shuntsu with one draw. We also count tile occurrences to check for a koutsu with one draw.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for s in s_tiles:\n        tiles.append((int(s[0]), s[1]))\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a koutsu\n    def is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a shuntsu\n    def is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        # Must be same suit\n        if not (t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]):\n            return False\n        \n        # Must be sequential numbers\n        nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n        return nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]\n    \n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # Check if the initial 3 tiles already form a mentsu.\n    if is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]) or \\\n       is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # With 1 draw, we will have 4 tiles.
