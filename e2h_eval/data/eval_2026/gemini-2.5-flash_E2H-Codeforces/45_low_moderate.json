There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Knockout Tournament's Dynamics**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this knockout tournament scenario. The core challenge is maximizing the games a single winner can play, given this specific rule: opponents can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one.  I'm thinking of this in terms of \"experience levels\" – the number of games a player has won.\n\nMy initial thought is to map this out. Let `f(k)` represent the minimum number of players needed to have a winner with `k` games, or equivalently, `g(k)` is the maximum games possible with `k` initial players. I'm focusing on the *winner's* journey.\n\nLet's break down how this works game by game.  If a player, let's call them 'W', wins their *k*th game, they must have won *k-1* games previously. The opponent, 'O', can't be too far behind in experience.  The rule restricts the experience gap. If W has *k-1* games, O must have *k-2*, *k-1*, or *k* games. But, if O has *k* games, it breaks the progression.\nNow, if W with *k-1* games is playing the opponent, it means that `|games_W - games_O| <= 1`. Therefore, it means the opponent must have at most *k* games to fulfill the requirements, but the condition for the tournament is that the opponent has to win all the games until the current stage. Therefore, O can have *k-1* or *k-2* games only. This sets the stage for the winner to progress with the right strategy.\n\nLet's trace some steps: In the first game (0 -> 1 experience), W could play someone with 0 or 1. If W (with 1) plays against O (with 0), W would proceed.  Now, the next game (1 -> 2), W could play someone with 1 or 2 games. Suppose W plays someone with 1 game. This makes sense. The winner has 2.  Then consider W with 1 and the opponent having 2, with the winner having 3.\n\nThis is a really interesting problem. I see the recursive nature emerging. It's about building this tournament structure strategically, game by game, to hit that maximum win count for a single player within the given constraint. I need to figure out this optimal build-up. The challenge seems to be in minimizing the number of players needed at each stage to ensure the winner gets as many games as possible.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has played (and won) as their \"experience level\". A player starts with 0 experience games. When two players play, the winner's experience level increases by 1.\n\nConsider the players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. Let `N(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games.\n\n*   To play 0 games: This is an initial player. `N(0) = 1`.\n*   To play 1 game: A player must beat an opponent. Both start with 0 games. They play. The winner has 1 game. This requires 2 players. `N(1) = 2`.\n*   To play 2 games: A player `W` must win their first game (becoming 1-experience) and then win a second game (becoming 2-experience).\n    *   For the second game, `W` (with 1 experience) must play an opponent `O`. The rule `|exp(W) - exp(O)| <= 1` means `O` must have 0, 1, or 2 experience. Since `O` must have won games to reach this point, `O` must have 1 or 2 experience.\n    *   If `W` (1 exp) plays `O` (1 exp): `W` wins, becomes 2 exp. To get `W` (1 exp) requires `N(1)=2` players. To get `O` (1 exp) requires `N(1)=2` players. Total players needed: `N(1) + N(1) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n    *   If `W` (1 exp) plays `O` (2 exp): `W` wins, becomes 2 exp. This is not optimal for `W` to maximize their games. If `W` plays `O` (2 exp), `O` has already played more games. This scenario is more about `O` trying to maximize their games.\n    *   Let's focus on `W` trying to maximize their games. To play `k` games, `W` must have played `k-1` games and then played one more. When `W` has `k-1` games, they need an opponent `O`. The opponent `O` must have `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k` games.\n    *   To minimize the total number of players `N(k)` for a winner to reach `k` games, we should try to reuse players as much as possible. A player `W` with `k-1` games will play an opponent `O`.\n        *   If `O` has `k-1` games: `W` (k-1 exp) vs `O` (k-1 exp). `W` wins, becomes `k` exp. This requires `N(k-1)` players for `W`'s path and `N(k-1)` players for `O`'s path. Total `N(k-1) + N(k-1) = 2 * N(k-1)`.\n        *   If `O` has `k-2` games: `W` (k-1 exp) vs `O` (k-2 exp). `W` wins, becomes `k` exp. This requires `N(k-1)` players for `W`'s path and `N(k-2)` players for `O`'s path. Total `N(k-1) + N(k-2)`.\n    *   To minimize the number of players `N(k)` for a winner to reach `k` games, we should choose the second option: `N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)`. This is because `N(k-1)` would be larger than `N(k-2)`, so `N(k-1) + N(k-2)` is generally smaller than `2 * N(k-1)`. This strategy allows the winner to play against an opponent who has played fewer games, which means that opponent's \"sub-tournament\" used fewer players. This is the definition of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet's compute the sequence `N(k)`:\n`N(0) = 1` (a single player who hasn't played yet)\n`N(1) = 2` (Player A (0 exp) vs Player B (0 exp). Winner A has 1 exp. Requires 2 players.)\n`N(2)`: Player A (1 exp) vs Player B (0 exp). A wins, becomes 2 exp.\n    To get Player A (1 exp) requires `N(1)=2` players.\n    To get Player B (0 exp) requires `N(0)=1` player.\n    Total players `N(2) = N(1) + N(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n`N(3)`: Player A (2 exp) vs Player B (1 exp). A wins, becomes 3 exp.\n    To get Player A (2 exp) requires `N(2)=3` players.\n    To get Player B (1 exp) requires `N(1)=2` players.\n    Total players `N(3) = N(2) + N(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n\nThis sequence `N(k)` is the Fibonacci sequence, where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`.\nSpecifically, `N(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n`N(0) = F_2 = 1`\n`N(1) = F_3 = 2`\n`N(2) = F_4 = 3`\n`N(3) = F_5 = 5`\n...\n\nWe are given `n` players. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `N(k) <= n`.\nSo, we need to find the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nThe input `n` can be up to `10^18`. We need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently until they exceed `n`.\nFibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `F_m` is approximately `phi^m / sqrt(5)`, where `phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 approx 1.618`.\n`phi^m` will exceed `10^18` for `m` around `10^18 / log10(phi) approx 18 / 0.209 approx 86`.\nSo, `k+2` will be around 86. This means `k` will be around 84. We can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively.\n\nLet's compute the Fibonacci sequence:\n`F_0 = 0`\n`F_1 = 1`\n`F_2 = 1`\n`F_3 = 2`\n`F_4 = 3`\n`F_5 = 5`\n`F_6 = 8`\n`F_7 = 13`\n`F_8 = 21`\n`F_9 = 34`\n`F_{10} = 55`\n...\n`F_{80} = 23416728348467685`\n`F_{81} = 37989345236306596`\n`F_{82} = 61406073584774281`\n`F_{83} = 99395418821080877`\n`F_{84} = 160801492405855158`\n`F_{85} = 260196911226936035`\n`F_{86} = 421000003632791193`\n`F_{87} = 681196914859727228`\n`F_{88} = 1102200000000000000` (approximately `1.1 * 10^18`)\n`F_{89} = 1783396914859727228` (approximately `1.78 * 10^18`)\n`F_{90} = 2885596914859727228` (approximately `2.88 * 10^18`)\n\nWe are looking for the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\nLet `a = F_{idx}` and `b = F_{idx+1}`. We start with `idx=2`, `a=1`, `b=2`.\nThe number of games played is `idx-2`.\nIf `n=2`:\n`k=0`: `N(0)=1 <= 2`.\n`k=1`: `N(1)=2 <= 2`. Max `k=1`.\nIf `n=3`:\n`k=0`: `N(0)=1 <= 3`.\n`k=1`: `N(1)=2 <= 3`.\n`k=2`: `N(2)=3 <= 3`. Max `k=2`.\nIf `n=4`:\n`k=0`: `N(0)=1 <= 4`.\n`k=1`: `N(1)=2 <= 4`.\n`k=2`: `N(2)=3 <= 4`. Max `k=2`.\nIf `n=10`:\n`N(0)=1`\n`N(1)=2`\n`N(2)=3`\n`N(3)=5`\n`N(4)=8`\n`N(5)=13 > 10`. Max `k=4`.\n\nThe strategy is to iterate through Fibonacci numbers `F_m` starting from `F_2=1, F_3=2, ...` and keep track of the index `m`. The maximum number of games will be `m-2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, ...\n    # N(k) = F_{k+2}\n    # We want to find max k such that F_{k+2} <= n\n\n    # Initialize F_m and F_{m+1}\n    # Let a = F_{m} and b = F_{m+1}\n    # We are looking for F_{k+2}.\n    # Let's track the current Fibonacci number and the previous one.\n    # fib_prev corresponds to F_{current_k_plus_2 - 1}\n    # fib_curr corresponds to F_{current_k_plus_2}\n    \n    # Initial values:\n    # k = 0: N(0) = F_2 = 1\n    # k = 1: N(1) = F_3 = 2\n    # k = 2: N(2) = F_4 = 3\n    \n    # We can start with fib_prev = F_2 = 1, fib_curr = F_3 = 2\n    # This means for k=1, we need 2 players.\n    \n    fib_prev = 1  # Corresponds to N(k-1) or F_{k+1}\n    fib_curr = 2  # Corresponds to N(k) or F_{k+2}\n    max_games = 1 # We know for n>=2, at least 1 game is possible.\n                  # This max_games corresponds to k in N(k).\n                  # So, if fib_curr = F_{k+2}, then max_games = k.\n                  # When fib_curr = 2 (F_3), max_games = 1.\n\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence (F_{k+3} or N(k+1))\n        next_fib = fib_prev + fib_curr\n        \n        # If this number of players exceeds n, we can't achieve k+1 games.\n        # The maximum games is the current max_games (which is k).\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        \n        # Otherwise, we can achieve k+1 games.
