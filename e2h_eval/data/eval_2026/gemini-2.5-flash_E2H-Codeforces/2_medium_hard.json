Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Detecting \"X\" Pattern in a Grid**\n\nAlright, I've got this Python script, and my goal is to figure out if a given grid of letters forms this \"X\" pattern, following specific rules. Let me break it down:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Rules:** Basically, the letters along both diagonals have to be the same, and all the other letters need to be the same, but *different* from the diagonal letters. The grid is guaranteed to be an odd size, which helps simplify things.\n\n2.  **Input and Grid Representation:** I'm going to read the grid size, `n`, and then read the grid itself, storing it as a 2D list. Each cell will be `grid[row][col]`.\n\n3.  **Core Logic:**\n    *   I'll initialize some variables to hold the characters found on the diagonals and the non-diagonals.\n    *   Then, I'll iterate through the grid, cell by cell.\n    *   For each cell, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it is, I'll make sure it matches the diagonal character. If it's not on a diagonal, I'll check if it's consistent with the other non-diagonal characters. If there's ever a mismatch, I can stop right away and print \"NO.\"\n\n4.  **Final Check:** After going through the whole grid, I'll just need to make sure the diagonal character and the non-diagonal character are different. If they are, I print \"YES,\" otherwise \"NO.\"\n\n5.  **Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n    *   The fact that `n` is odd means I don't have to worry about the center element messing up the logic.\n    *   I also need to remember that even if all the characters are the same, it's not an \"X,\" so the final check is crucial. I could initialize `diagonal_char` and `other_char` to `None` and make sure both are set to a character at some point.\n\nIt seems pretty straightforward, but I have to make sure to handle every possible input scenario correctly, especially with the corner cases. I have double-checked the cases where I could encounter edge cases.\nI'm confident this solution works.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given `n x n` grid of lowercase English letters forms the letter \"X\" according to specific rules. The rules are:\n1.  All letters on both main diagonals of the square paper must be the same.\n2.  All other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain a single letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n3.  `n` is an odd number and `3 <= n < 300`.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n1.  **Input Reading**: We first read the integer `n`. Then, we read `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, to form our grid. We'll store this grid as a list of strings.\n\n2.  **Character Tracking**: We need to keep track of two distinct characters:\n    *   `diagonal_char`: The character expected on all diagonal positions.\n    *   `other_char`: The character expected on all non-diagonal positions.\n    Initially, these can be `None` as we haven't encountered any characters yet.\n\n3.  **Grid Traversal**: We iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `n x n` grid, where `r` is the row index and `c` is the column index (both 0-indexed).\n\n    *   **Diagonal Check**: A cell `(r, c)` is on a diagonal if:\n        *   It's on the main diagonal: `r == c`\n        *   It's on the anti-diagonal: `r + c == n - 1`\n        If the current cell `grid[r][c]` is on a diagonal:\n        *   If `diagonal_char` is `None`, this is the first diagonal character we've seen, so we set `diagonal_char = grid[r][c]`.\n        *   If `diagonal_char` is already set, we check if `grid[r][c]` is equal to `diagonal_char`. If not, the condition \"all letters on both diagonals are the same\" is violated. We immediately know it's not an \"X\", so we can print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n    *   **Non-Diagonal Check**: If the current cell `grid[r][c]` is *not* on a diagonal:\n        *   If `other_char` is `None`, this is the first non-diagonal character we've seen, so we set `other_char = grid[r][c]`.\n        *   If `other_char` is already set, we check if `grid[r][c]` is equal to `other_char`. If not, the condition \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\" is violated. We print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n4.  **Final Condition Check**: If we complete the entire grid traversal without finding any violations, it means:\n    *   All diagonal characters are the same (`diagonal_char` holds this character).\n    *   All non-diagonal characters are the same (`other_char` holds this character).\n    The last rule to check is \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is *different* from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n    So, we must verify that `diagonal_char` is not equal to `other_char`.\n    *   If `diagonal_char != other_char`, then all conditions are met, and we print \"YES\".\n    *   Otherwise (if `diagonal_char == other_char`), the condition is violated, and we print \"NO\".\n\nSince `n` is guaranteed to be odd and `n >= 3`, there will always be at least one diagonal element and at least one non-diagonal element, ensuring `diagonal_char` and `other_char` are always set to a character.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    diagonal_char = None\n    other_char = None\n    possible_x = True\n\n    for r in range(n):\n        for c in range(n):\n            current_char = grid[r][c]\n\n            # Check if the current cell (r, c) is on either the main diagonal (r == c)\n            # or the anti-diagonal (r + c == n - 1).\n            if r == c or r + c == n - 1:\n                # This character is on a diagonal.\n                if diagonal_char is None:\n                    # If this is the first diagonal character encountered, set it.\n                    diagonal_char = current_char\n                elif current_char != diagonal_char:\n                    # If it's not the first, but it's different from the established diagonal_char,\n                    # then the \"X\" pattern is violated.\n                    possible_x = False\n                    break  # Exit inner loop\n            else:\n                # This character is not on a diagonal.\n                if other_char is None:\n                    # If this is the first non-diagonal character encountered, set it.\n                    other_char = current_char\n                elif current_char != other_char:\n                    # If it's not the first, but it's different from the established other_char,\n                    # then the \"X\" pattern is violated.\n                    possible_x = False\n                    break  # Exit inner loop\n        \n        if not possible_x:\n            break  # Exit outer loop if a violation was found\n\n    # After checking all cells, perform the final condition check.\n    # If possible_x is still True, it means all diagonal characters were the same,\n    # and all non-diagonal characters were the same.\n    # The last condition is that the diagonal character must be different from the other character.\n    if possible_x and diagonal_char != other_char:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"YES\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program.\nsolve()\n\n```",
