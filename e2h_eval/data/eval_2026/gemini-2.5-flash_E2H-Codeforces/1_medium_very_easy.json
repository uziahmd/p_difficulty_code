The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for the Golden Plate**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Golden Plate\" problem. The core is figuring out the gilded cells on a rectangular plate with some rings.  We're given `w` and `h` for the plate dimensions and `k` for the rings. Each ring is a border around a shrinking inner rectangle.\n\nMy thought process began by breaking down a single ring. For the first ring, dimensions are just `w` and `h`.  A crucial step was determining how to calculate the border cells, which is essentially the perimeter of the rectangle. I considered a simple perimeter formula, `2 * (w + h) - 4`, but I realized this wouldn't work with plates of size 1xN or Nx1 or 1x1.  I had to handle those edge cases.  The standard perimeter is good for cases where both dimensions are greater than one.\n\nA helpful insight: I realized that counting the border cells could be done by subtracting the cells of the inner rectangle (assuming its dimensions are at least 2x2) from the total cells.  That became my preferred method:  `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`.  This worked well for all cases when W and H are at least 2.\n\nNow, handling the shrinking rectangles for each ring, it became: `current_w * current_h - (current_w - 2) * (current_h - 2)`. I noticed the constraints gave us a maximum rings of `floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)`, and that the ring dimensions always remain greater than or equal to 3, meaning this formula is safe.\n\nTracing an example helped confirm the logic. The algorithm takes those key inputs, then iterates through each ring. For each ring, it calculates the dimensions and border cells, and sums those to get the result.\n\nThe maximum value of k is small (25), so the algorithm's performance is great. The rest is just translating that into Python! No complex structures needed, just basic math and a loop.  Now, the plan is to implement it and see it work.\n",
