Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to figure out if we can match rebel spaceships to bases without their paths crossing. The input gives us `R` rebels and `B` bases, and the core constraint is that these paths, which are straight line segments, can't intersect (except at endpoints, which is fine).  Since `R` and `B` are small (up to 10), the approach is clear: try every possible matching!\n\nFirst, if `R` doesn't equal `B`, it's an immediate \"No\". Then, we read in the coordinates of the rebels and the bases.\n\nWe then generate all permutations of base assignments to rebels. Each permutation represents a potential solution.  For each permutation, we construct the line segments connecting the assigned rebel to its assigned base.  Then, we check if *any* two of these segments intersect. We need to be careful with the definition of \"intersection\". The problem says \"do not intersect,\" which generally means *strict* intersection.\n\nTo determine if two segments intersect, we use standard geometric principles, specifically cross products to determine the orientation of points.  We define an `orientation` function, which determines if a point is to the left, right, or collinear with a line segment.  Since the problem guarantees no three points are collinear (a huge simplification!), we don't have to worry about the collinear case for distinct points.\n\nThe `segments_intersect` function uses the `orientation` to determine if two segments strictly intersect. Two segments intersect if and only if each segment's endpoints lie on opposite sides of the other segment (as determined by the orientation). If any pair of segments intersects, that's a \"No\" for that permutation, and we move on.\n\nIf we check all the segment pairs in a matching and find no intersections, that means we found a valid solution, so we print \"Yes\" and exit. If we exhaust all permutations and never find a valid matching, the answer is \"No\".\n\nThe key here is the small size of `R` and `B`, which makes trying all matchings feasible. It's a brute-force approach, but it works within the time constraints of the \"easy\" level. I am confident in the correctness of this approach and the edge cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship (a perfect matching), and no two paths (straight line segments from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect. The coordinates are 2D, and `R, B` are small (up to 10).\n\n**1. Basic Constraint: Equal Numbers of Spaceships and Bases**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships (`R`) must be equal to the number of bases (`B`). If `R != B`, it's impossible to form such an assignment, so we immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Handling Small Constraints (`R, B <= 10`)**\nThe small values of `R` and `B` are a strong hint that we can try all possible matchings. If `R = B = N`, there are `N!` ways to assign `N` spaceships to `N` bases. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is a feasible number of matchings to check within typical time limits, especially since the check for each matching is relatively fast.\n\n**3. Algorithm Outline**\n*   Read `R` and `B`, and the coordinates of all spaceships and bases.\n*   If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n*   Generate all permutations of base assignments. A permutation `p` of `[0, 1, ..., N-1]` means that the `i`-th Rebel spaceship (`rebels[i]`) is assigned to the `p[i]`-th base (`bases[p[i]]`).\n*   For each permutation (representing a potential matching):\n    *   Form `N` line segments, where the `i`-th segment connects `rebels[i]` and `bases[p[i]]`.\n    *   Check if any two of these `N` segments intersect.\n        *   Iterate through all unique pairs of segments. There are `N * (N-1) / 2` such pairs.\n        *   Use a geometric function `segments_intersect(seg1, seg2)` to check for intersection.\n        *   If an intersection is found, this matching is invalid. Stop checking this matching and move to the next permutation.\n    *   If no intersections are found after checking all pairs for a given matching, then this is a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\" and exit immediately.\n*   If all permutations are checked and none result in a valid, non-intersecting assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**4. Geometric Primitives: Segment Intersection**\nTo check if two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect, we can use the concept of orientation (cross product).\n\n*   **Orientation Function `orientation(p, q, r)`:**\n    This function calculates the cross product of vectors `(q - p)` and `(r - q)`.\n    `val = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)`\n    *   If `val > 0`, `r` is counter-clockwise (left turn) with respect to vector `pq`.\n    *   If `val < 0`, `r` is clockwise (right turn) with respect to vector `pq`.\n    *   If `val == 0`, `p, q, r` are collinear.\n    The problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", so `orientation` will always return a non-zero value for distinct points `p, q, r` from the input set.\n\n*   **Segment Intersection Function `segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`:**\n    Two segments `p1q1` and `p2q2` strictly intersect if and only if:\n    1.  `p1` and `q1` are on opposite sides of the line containing `p2q2`.\n    2.  `p2` and `q2` are on opposite sides of the line containing `p1q1`.\n\n    This can be checked using the `orientation` function:\n    *   `o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)`\n    *   `o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)`\n    *   `o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)`\n    *   `o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)`\n\n    The segments intersect if `(o1 * o2 < 0)` AND `(o3 * o4 < 0)`.\n    The condition `o1 * o2 < 0` means `o1` and `o2` have different signs, implying `p2` and `q2` are on opposite sides of `p1q1`. Similarly for `o3 * o4 < 0`.\n\n    **Important Note on \"Intersection\":** The problem states \"do not intersect\", which usually implies *strict* intersection (crossing). If two segments share an endpoint, they are not considered to be intersecting in a way that causes a \"collision\". Our `segments_intersect` logic correctly handles this: if an endpoint is shared (e.g., `p1 == p2`), then `orientation(p2, q2, p1)` (which is `o3`) would be 0. This makes `o3 * o4` equal to 0, which is not `< 0`, so `segments_intersect` returns `False`, as desired for shared endpoints.\n\n**5. Time Complexity**\n*   Generating permutations: `N!`\n*   For each permutation:\n    *   Forming `N` segments.\n    *   Checking `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs of segments.\n    *   Each `segments_intersect` call involves 4 `orientation` calls, which are constant time (a few arithmetic operations).\nTotal complexity: `O(N! * N^2)`. For `N=10`, this is roughly `3.6 * 10^6 * 10^2 = 3.6 * 10^8` operations, which might be on the higher side for Python but should pass given the simple arithmetic operations involved.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough (Mental Check):**\nRebels: `R0(0,0), R1(2,0), R2(3,1)`\nBases: `B0(-2,1), B1(0,3), B2(2,2)`\nIf we connect `R0-B0`, `R1-B1`, `R2-B2`:\nSegments: `S0=((0,0),(-2,1))`, `S1=((2,0),(0,3))`, `S2=((3,1),(2,2))`\nVisually, these segments do not intersect.
