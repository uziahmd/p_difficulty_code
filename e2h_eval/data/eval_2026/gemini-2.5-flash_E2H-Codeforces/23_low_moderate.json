            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Mahjong Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a mahjong problem where I need to figure out the minimum number of tiles to draw to form at least one \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence).  I'm starting with three tiles, and I'm allowed to draw zero, one, or two more. The goal is to minimize those draws.\n\nFirst, I need to define what makes a \"mentsu.\" A \"koutsu\" (triplet) is easy: three identical tiles (like three \"1s\" or three \"9m\"). A \"shuntsu\" (sequence) is three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit (like \"4s\", \"5s\", \"6s\" or \"7m\", \"6m\", \"8m\"). Order doesn't matter for the shuntsu, so I'll need to sort them as I check.\n\nLet's think through the scenarios:\n\n**Case 0: No Draws Needed**\nThis is the simplest.  I already have a mentsu in my hand. So, I need to quickly check: Are all three tiles identical? If yes, koutsu! If not, can I rearrange them and find a shuntsu?  Same suit? Numbers sequential? If that checks out, zero draws are needed.\n\n**Case 1: One Draw Needed**\nHere, I'm thinking, \"Can I complete a mentsu with just one more tile?\"  Essentially, I need to see if any pair of my initial tiles, combined with a potential fourth tile, could make a mentsu.  I'll call my tiles T1, T2, and T3, and I'll hypothetically draw T4. I need to see if any three tiles from {T1, T2, T3, T4} form a mentsu.\n\nThis boils down to looking at the initial pairs (T1, T2), (T1, T3), and (T2, T3).\n\n*   **For Koutsu**: Do any two tiles make a pair? Like, two \"2s\" or two \"m8\"? If I draw another tile of that same type, boom, koutsu.\n*   **For Shuntsu**: Do any two tiles form a near-sequence? Same suit, and numbers are either consecutive or offset by one. For example, a \"3m\" and a \"5m\" - I could draw a \"4m\". Or a \"1s\" and a \"2s\" - I could draw a \"3s\" (or a \"0s\" if it were a valid option).\n\n**Case 2: Two Draws Needed**\n\nIf neither case 0 nor case 1 works, I'm pretty sure that I'll need to draw two tiles to form the mentsu.\n\nSo, I will analyze the initial tile set against case 0 and 1, and the outcome will be 0, 1, or 2. I have a clearer picture now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nWe need to check for 0, 1, or 2 draws in that order. The first number of draws that allows her to form a mentsu is the answer.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input tiles. Each tile is a string like \"1s\". We can represent it as a tuple `(number, suit)`, e.g., `(1, 's')`. It's helpful to sort the tiles for easier sequence checking.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nShe needs 0 draws if her current hand of three tiles already contains a mentsu.\n1.  **Check for Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical?\n    *   `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`.\n2.  **Check for Shuntsu:** Are all three tiles of the same suit and form a sequence?\n    *   Sort the tiles by number within the same suit. Let the sorted tiles be `(n1, s), (n2, s), (n3, s)`.\n    *   Check if `s1 == s2 == s3` (same suit) AND `n1 + 1 == n2` AND `n2 + 1 == n3` (sequential numbers).\n\nIf either of these conditions is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, she needs 1 draw if she can form a mentsu by adding one tile. With one draw, she will have 4 tiles. A mentsu uses 3 tiles. This means that among her initial three tiles, there must be two tiles that can form a mentsu with one additional tile.\nLet the initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. We consider all pairs: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\n\nFor each pair of tiles `(tile_A, tile_B)`:\n1.  **Can form Koutsu with 1 draw?**\n    *   If `tile_A == tile_B`, she can draw a third identical tile to form a koutsu.\n        *   Example: `[1s, 1s, X]`. Draw `1s`.\n2.  **Can form Shuntsu with 1 draw?**\n    *   If `tile_A` and `tile_B` are of the same suit:\n        *   Let their numbers be `nA` and `nB`. Sort them: `n_min, n_max`.\n        *   If `n_max - n_min == 0` (e.g., `[1s, 1s]`): She can draw `1s-1` or `1s+1` (if valid, i.e., numbers 1-9) to form a shuntsu.\n            *   Example: `[1s, 1s, X]`. Draw `2s` to get `[1s, 1s, 2s]` (not a shuntsu), or draw `2s` to get `[1s, 2s, 1s]` (still not a shuntsu). This case `n_max - n_min == 0` is incorrect for shuntsu. A shuntsu requires distinct numbers. So, `[1s, 1s]` cannot form a shuntsu with one draw.\n        *   If `n_max - n_min == 1` (e.g., `[1s, 2s]`): She can draw `1s-1` (i.e., `0s`, invalid) or `1s+2` (i.e., `3s`). Or `2s+1` (i.e., `3s`).\n            *   She can draw `n_min - 1` (if `n_min > 1`) or `n_max + 1` (if `n_max < 9`).\n            *   Example: `[1s, 2s, X]`. Draw `3s` to get `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\n            *   Example: `[2s, 3s, X]`. Draw `1s` to get `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\n        *   If `n_max - n_min == 2` (e.g., `[1s, 3s]`): She can draw `n_min + 1` (i.e., `2s`).\n            *   Example: `[1s, 3s, X]`. Draw `2s` to get `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\n\nIf any of these conditions for any pair is true, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is enough, she will always be able to form a mentsu with 2 draws.\nThis is because she can always draw two identical tiles to match one of her existing tiles to form a koutsu.\nExample: If she has `[1m, 2p, 3s]`.\nShe can draw `1m, 1m` to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\nSo, the maximum number of draws needed is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   To handle tile comparisons and sorting, convert tiles to a comparable format. A tuple `(suit_char, number_int)` works well, or `(number_int, suit_char)`. Sorting by number first is useful for shuntsu checks.\n*   Use a `set` to store the initial tiles to easily check for duplicates.\n*   Iterate through all pairs of tiles to check for 1 draw.\n*   The `check(tiles)` function can encapsulate the logic for 0 draws.\n\nLet's refine the logic for 1 draw more carefully:\nWe need to check if *any* pair of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from the initial three can form a mentsu with one extra tile `t_k`.\n*   **Koutsu:** If `t_i` and `t_j` are identical (e.g., `(1, 's'), (1, 's')`), she can draw another `(1, 's')`.\n*   **Shuntsu:** If `t_i` and `t_j` are of the same suit, say `s`. Let their numbers be `n_i` and `n_j`.\n    *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 1` (e.g., `(1, 's'), (2, 's')`): She can draw `(n_i-1, s)` (if `n_i > 1`) or `(n_j+1, s)` (if `n_j < 9`). For `(1, 's'), (2, 's')`, she can draw `(3, 's')`. For `(8, 's'), (9, 's')`, she can draw `(7, 's')`.\n    *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 2` (e.g., `(1, 's'), (3, 's')`): She can draw `(n_i+1, s)` (which is `(n_j-1, s)`). For `(1, 's'), (3, 's')`, she can draw `(2, 's')`.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    s = input().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into a list of tuples (number, suit)\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in s:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier sequence checking\n    # Sort primarily by suit, then by number\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu already exists in the initial 3 tiles.\n    \n    # Check for Koutsu (triplet of identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu (sequence of 3 tiles of same suit)\n    # Tiles are already sorted by suit then number\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]: # Same suit\n        if tiles[0][0] + 1 == tiles[1][0] and tiles[1][0] + 1 == tiles[2][0]: # Sequential numbers\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We can form a mentsu by drawing one additional tile.\n    # This means two of the current tiles can form a mentsu with one drawn tile.\n    \n    # Get all unique pairs of tiles from the hand\n    # Using a set to avoid duplicate checks if initial hand has duplicates\n    unique_tiles = list(set(tiles))\n    \n    # Check if any pair can form a mentsu with one draw\n    for i in range(len(unique_tiles)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_tiles)):\n            t1 = unique_tiles[i]\n            t2 = unique_tiles[j]\n\n            # Koutsu possibility: two identical tiles\n            if t1 == t2: # This condition only happens if original `tiles` had duplicates, and `unique_tiles` would not contain `t1` twice.\n                         # This check should be on the original `tiles` list.\n                         # Let's re-evaluate:\n                         # If tiles are [1s, 1s, 2s], unique_tiles will be [(1,'s'), (2,'s')].\n                         # We need to count occurrences of tiles in original hand.\n                pass # Handled below by counting original tiles.\n\n    # Count occurrences of each tile\n    tile_counts = collections.Counter(tiles)\n\n    # Check for Koutsu with 1 draw:\n    # If any tile appears twice, we can draw a third one.\n    for count in tile_counts.values():\n        if count >= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Check for Shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    # Iterate through all combinations of 2 tiles (from the original 3)\n    # This covers cases like [1s, 2s, 5s] where (1s, 2s) can form a shuntsu.\n    # It also covers [1s, 1s, 2s] where (1s, 2s) can form a shuntsu.\n    \n    # Get all unique pairs from the original tiles (order doesn't matter for pairs)\n    # We use a set of frozensets to store unique pairs to avoid redundant checks.\n    # E.g., for [1s, 2s, 3s], pairs are {(1s,2s), (1s,3s), (2s,3s)}\n    # For [1s, 1s, 2s], pairs are {(1s,1s), (1s,2s)}\n    \n    pairs_to_check = set()\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n            pair = tuple(sorted([tiles[i], tiles[j]])) # Sort within pair for consistent representation\n            pairs_to_check.add(pair)\n\n    for p1, p2 in pairs_to_check:\n        if p1[1] == p2[1]: # Same suit\n            n1, s = p1\n            n2, _ = p2\n            \n            # Case 1: Numbers are consecutive (e.g., 1s, 2s).
