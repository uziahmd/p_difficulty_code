Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Feed the Golorp - My Solution Approach**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and it's time to break it down. My initial thought is that all this \"jaws\" and \"stomach\" stuff is just flavor text. The core of this challenge revolves around parsing some kind of program (the Golorp's name), which consumes variables represented by underscores, and finding the smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that make the program \"happy.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at the Golorp's name. It has this structure: `?(<expression>):-<condition1>,<condition2>,...,<conditionN>.`. Inside the parentheses, we've got an expression with operators (+, -, *, /). After the `):-`, there's a list of conditions joined with commas, using `>` and `<`. The key here is the underscore sequences. Each unique sequence seems to stand for a distinct variable.\n\nMy initial interpretation of this problem was wrong, so let's try a new one. The problem says, \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" If we call the variables in the order of appearance in the expression part \"jaws\", we want to assign a value to it that satisfies the expression and conditions parts. The length of the underscore group is not the key, but the unique underscore groups from the expression's structure are the variables.\n\nI'm thinking, it looks like each unique underscore sequence (like `_`, `__`, `___`) in the *expression part* actually defines a distinct variable. Now, if an underscore sequence appears multiple times within both the expression and the conditions, it represents the *same* variable. Let's call them v0, v1, v2, so on based on their first appearance.\n\nThe challenge is to find a set of variable values that makes the expression and conditions true, and that forms the lexicographically smallest output string possible. I need to iterate and try the possible digit combinations for each variables, while making sure I'm following the order of variables derived from their *first appearance in the expression*.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp's name:** Grab the expression inside `?()` and the conditions after `):-`.\n2.  **Identify our variables:** Go through the *expression only*, and make a list of unique underscore sequences from that part (these are our placeholders). Also, save an ordered list of these underscore sequences based on their *first appearance* in the expression part.\n3.  **Variable replacement for easier processing:** Map each unique underscore sequence to an internal variable identifier like `_var_0`, `_var_1`, etc. so we can easily substitute these for the real underscore in the expression and conditions. Replace all underscore sequences (expression and conditions).\n4.  **Iterate and find the solution:** For the solution, we're going to use backtracking. It's the process of finding the lexicographically smallest output in the list of valid assignments for all variables so that all expression and conditions parts are true.\n    1.  Assign digits (`0` to `9`) to each *unique* underscore string/variable (not each underscore in the whole input string) to minimize the variable's value for the output.\n    2.  Check whether each assignment makes the expression and condition true.\n    3.  If a valid combination is found, the result is the correct solution.\n    4.  If not, the combination doesn't work, so it continues looking for combinations.\n5.  **Return the output:** If a valid assignment is found, make sure all numbers of the found variable are connected to each other, and it's a valid solution. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBasically, I need to methodically check variable assignments while ensuring the output is lexicographically small. Let's get cracking!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfy a given Golorp's \"name\". The name consists of an expression and a set of conditions.\n\nLet's break down the Golorp's name structure and variable interpretation based on the examples:\n\n1.  **Structure:** A Golorp's name follows the pattern `?(<expression>):-<condition1>,<condition2>,...,<conditionN>.`.\n2.  **Variables:** Variables are represented by sequences of underscores (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`).\n    *   A key insight from the examples is that `_` (single underscore), `__` (two underscores), `___` (three underscores), etc., represent *distinct types* of variables. For instance, all occurrences of `_` will take the same value, all occurrences of `__` will take the same value, and so on.\n    *   Let's call these \"underscore types\" the *independent variables*.\n3.  **Output Sequence:** The problem states: \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" The \"jaws\" are interpreted as the operands within the main expression (the part inside `?(` and `):-`).\n    *   If the expression is `_-_/___*__`, the operands are `_` (first), `_` (second), `___`, `__`.\n    *   The output sequence will consist of values corresponding to these operands, in this order.\n    *   For example, if `_` takes value `X`, `___` takes `Y`, and `__` takes `Z`, then for `_-_/___*__`, the output sequence would be `X X Y Z`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp's Name:**\n    *   Extract the `expression_string` (between `?(` and `):-`).\n    *   Extract the `conditions_string` (between `):-` and `.`).\n\n2.  **Identify Independent Variables and Output Variable Sequence:**\n    *   **Independent Variables:** Find all unique underscore sequences (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) present anywhere in the *entire Golorp's name* (expression + conditions). Sort these unique underscore strings by length in descending order to ensure correct replacement (e.g., replace `___` before `__`).\n    *   Map each unique underscore string to an internal placeholder variable name (e.g., `_var_0`, `_var_1`, `_var_2`). This mapping will be used to assign values. Let's call these `independent_vars_map`.\n    *   **Output Variable Sequence:** Scan the `expression_string` for *all* occurrences of underscore sequences. For each occurrence, determine which independent variable (`_var_0`, `_var_1`, etc.) it corresponds to based on its underscore type. Store these internal variable names in `output_vars_sequence` in their order of appearance. The length of this sequence will be the length of the final output string.\n\n3.  **Pre-process Expression and Conditions:**\n    *   Replace all underscore sequences in both `expression_string` and `conditions_string` with their corresponding internal placeholder variable names from `independent_vars_map`. This creates `processed_expression` and `processed_conditions`.\n\n4.  **Iterate and Evaluate (Backtracking Search):**\n    *   We need to find values (0-9) for each `_var_i` (the independent variables) that satisfy all conditions and result in the lexicographically smallest `output_vars_sequence`.\n    *   Since we want the lexicographically smallest output, we should try values for the independent variables in an order that prioritizes the variables appearing earliest in `output_vars_sequence`. A standard backtracking approach is suitable.\n    *   We'll use a recursive function `solve(k, current_assignments)`:\n        *   `k`: The index of the current independent variable (`_var_k`) we are trying to assign a value to.\n        *   `current_assignments`: A dictionary mapping `_var_i` to its assigned digit value.\n        *   **Base Case:** If `k` equals the total number of independent variables, all independent variables have been assigned values.\n            *   Now, we construct the `output_string` by looking up the values for each variable in `output_vars_sequence` from `current_assignments`.\n            *   We then evaluate the `processed_expression` and `processed_conditions` using `current_assignments`.\n            *   **Expression Evaluation:** Use `eval()` safely. Handle division by zero. If `b/c` is encountered, `c` cannot be zero. If `b` is not divisible by `c` (i.e., `b % c != 0`), the expression is invalid as it implies non-integer results, and the problem states \"Golorps feed on variables... values from 0 to 9\". We assume intermediate results must be integers.\n            *   **Conditions Evaluation:** Evaluate each condition (e.g., `_var_X > _var_Y`). All must be true.\n            *   If all checks pass, we have found a valid solution. Since we are iterating values lexicographically, the first one found will be the smallest. Return this `output_string`.\n        *   **Recursive Step:** For the current `_var_k`:\n            *   Try assigning `digit` from 0 to 9.\n            *   `current_assignments[f'_var_{k}'] = digit`\n            *   Recursively call `solve(k + 1, current_assignments)`.\n            *   If a solution is found, propagate it up.\n\n5.  **Return Result:** If `solve()` returns a string, print it. If no solution is found after trying all combinations, `solve()` will return `None`, in which case print \"false\".\n\n**Refinement for Lexicographical Order:**\nThe backtracking search needs to be structured to prioritize the output variables. Instead of iterating `_var_0`, `_var_1`, ..., we should iterate `v_0, v_1, ...` where `v_i` is the `i`-th element of `output_vars_sequence`. However, `v_i` might not be an independent variable. It might be `_var_X` which is already defined by an earlier `v_j`.\n\nA more direct approach for lexicographical smallest output:\n*   Iterate `v_0` from 0 to 9.\n*   Iterate `v_1` from 0 to 9.\n*   ...\n*   Iterate `v_{N-1}` from 0 to 9.\n    *   For each combination `(v_0, ..., v_{N-1})`:\n        *   Create `current_assignments` for the *independent variables*. For example, if `_` maps to `_var_0`, `__` maps to `_var_1`, `___` maps to `_var_2`, and `output_vars_sequence` is `[_var_0, _var_0, _var_2, _var_1]`:\n            *   `_var_0` must be `v_0` (and `v_1`).\n            *   `_var_1` must be `v_3`.\n            *   `_var_2` must be `v_2`.\n            *   This means we need to check for consistency: if `output_vars_sequence[i]` is `_var_X` and `output_vars_sequence[j]` is `_var_X`, then `v_i` must equal `v_j`. If not, this combination is invalid.\n        *   If consistent, evaluate expression and conditions. If valid, print `v_0...v_{N-1}` and exit.\n*   If no solution found, print \"false\".\n\nThis approach is correct for lexicographical order but can be slow if there are many output variables. The number of output variables can be up to 1024, leading to `10^1024` combinations, which is too large.\n\nThe number of *independent* variables (unique underscore strings) is much smaller. A name like `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___)` has at most 22 distinct lengths of underscores (1 to 22), so at most 22 independent variables. `10^22` is still too large.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the maximum number of distinct underscore sequences. The problem states \"between 13 and 1024 characters long\". The maximum length of an underscore sequence could be 1024. This means the number of *distinct* underscore sequences could be up to 1024 (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`, ... up to `_` repeated 1024 times). This is still too many independent variables for a brute force `10^N` search.\n\nThe problem implies `N` is small enough for `10^N` search. The examples have:\n1.  `_-_/___*__`: `_`, `__`, `___` (3 distinct types)\n2.  `__-_+_/_____`: `_`, `__`, `_____` (3 distinct types)\n3.  `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___`: `_` (22 times), `_` (4 times), `_` (7 times), `_` (2 times), `_` (5 times), `_` (6 times), `_` (3 times). This is 7 distinct types.\n4.  `__+___+__-___`: `__`, `___` (2 distinct types)\n\nThe number of distinct underscore sequences seems to be small (up to ~7 in examples). If it's always small (e.g., <= 8), then `10^8` is feasible. Let's assume the number of *distinct* underscore sequences `M` is small enough (e.g., `M <= 8` or `M <= 10`).\n\n**Final Algorithm (assuming small number of distinct underscore types `M`):**\n\n1.  **Parse:** Extract `expression_string` and `conditions_string`.\n2.  **Identify Unique Underscore Types:**\n    *   Find all unique underscore sequences (`_`, `__`, etc.) from the *entire* Golorp name.\n    *   Store them in a list `unique_underscore_types`, sorted by length descending.\n    *   Create `independent_vars_map`: `{'underscore_type_str': f'_var_{idx}'}`.\n3.  **Construct Output Sequence:**\n    *   Scan `expression_string` for *all* underscore sequences. For each, add its corresponding `_var_idx` to `output_vars_sequence`.\n4.  **Pre-process for Evaluation:**\n    *   Create `eval_expression` and `eval_conditions_list` by replacing underscore types with `_var_idx` in `expression_string` and `conditions_string`.\n5.  **Backtracking Search (`find_solution`):**\n    *   `find_solution(k, current_assignments)`:\n        *   `k`: index of the current independent variable (`_var_k`) to assign.\n        *   `current_assignments`: `dict` mapping `_var_idx` to its value.\n        *   **Base Case (`k == len(unique_underscore_types)`):** All independent variables have values.\n            *   Check consistency: For each `_var_j` in `independent_vars_map`, if it appears in `output_vars_sequence`, ensure its assigned value (`current_assignments[_var_j]`) is consistent with the values of all `v_i`s in the `output_vars_sequence` that map to `_var_j`. (This check is implicitly handled by constructing `output_str` and then using `_var_j` values for evaluation).\n            *   Construct `output_str` from `output_vars_sequence` and `current_assignments`.\n            *   Evaluate `eval_expression`:\n                *   Substitute values from `current_assignments`.\n                *   Use a safe `eval` (or custom parser). Handle division by zero (invalid if denominator is 0) and non-integer results (invalid if `a % b != 0` for `a/b`).\n            *   Evaluate `eval_conditions_list`:\n                *   Substitute values.\n                *   All must be true.\n            *   If all valid, return `output_str`.\n        *   **Recursive Step:**\n            *   For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n                *   `current_assignments[f'_var_{k}'] = digit`\n                *   `result = find_solution(k + 1, current_assignments)`\n                *   If `result` is not `None`, return `result`.\n            *   Return `None`.\n6.  **Print Result:** Call `find_solution(0, {})`. If `None`, print \"false\".\n\n**Safety for `eval()`:**\nUsing `eval()` directly with user input can be a security risk. However, in competitive programming, the input format is strictly controlled. The expressions only contain `_var_X`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`. Conditions contain `_var_X`, `>`, `<`. This limited set of operations is safe for `eval()` if we provide `_var_X` values as integers.\nWe need to handle integer division and non-integer results carefully. Python's `/` is float division. We need integer division `//`.\nThe problem implies integer arithmetic. `a/b` should be `a // b`. If `b` is 0, it's an error. If `a % b != 0`, it's an error (not an integer result).\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    s = input()\n\n    # 1.
