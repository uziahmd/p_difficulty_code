    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for \"Array Stabilization\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, \"Array Stabilization.\" The core idea is this: I've got this array of numbers, and my job is to make it \"stable\" by removing just one element.  \"Instability\" is defined as the range, the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers in the array *after* I've removed an element. My goal is to minimize this range.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about it: I start by visualizing the array.  If I remove one element, I'm left with n-1 elements.  I need to compute the instability of this new array for every possible element I remove.\n\nFirst step, let's sort the array.  I sort it to make finding the min and max easier. Now, my sorted array becomes s1, s2, ... sn, in increasing order.  The original instability (before removing anything) would be sn - s1.\n\nNow, here's the clever bit: I realize that to *minimize* instability, I have to think about what happens to the min and max values in the array after the removal.\n\nIf I remove the smallest element (s1), the new minimum becomes s2, and the new maximum remains sn.  So, the new instability is sn - s2.\n\nIf I remove the largest element (sn), the new maximum becomes sn-1, and the new minimum remains s1.  So, the instability becomes sn-1 - s1.\n\nBut here's the key insight: if I remove *any other* element, the original min (s1) and original max (sn) are still going to be in the remaining array!  Therefore, the instability will simply be the same as the initial array sn-s1. This means, removing any element that is not the smallest or largest number in the array is not the optimal choice.\n\nOkay, so I'm down to two options. Comparing them: Sn - S2 and S(n-1) - S1. Since the array is sorted, I know s1 <= s2 and s(n-1) <= sn. Subtracting the inequalities gives me sn - s2 <= sn -s1 and s(n-1) - s1 <= sn -s1. Thus, the solution must be either sn - s2 or s(n-1) - s1.\n\nTo implement this, I read the array, sort it, and then calculate these two instability values.  I simply take the minimum of the two, and that's my answer!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from a given array `a` of `n` integers such that the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements is minimized. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in an array.\n\nLet the given array be `a`. To minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, it's always beneficial to remove an element that is either very small or very large, as these elements contribute most to the range (max - min).\n\nLet's sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order. Let the sorted array be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`, where `s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n`.\nThe original instability of the array is `s_n - s_1`.\n\nWhen we remove an element, there are three general cases:\n\n1.  **Remove the smallest element (`s_1`)**:\n    The remaining elements are `s_2, s_3, ..., s_n`.\n    The new minimum element is `s_2`.\n    The new maximum element is `s_n`.\n    The instability in this case is `s_n - s_2`.\n\n2.  **Remove the largest element (`s_n`)**:\n    The remaining elements are `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}`.\n    The new minimum element is `s_1`.\n    The new maximum element is `s_{n-1}`.\n    The instability in this case is `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n\n3.  **Remove any other element (`s_k` where `1 < k < n`)**:\n    If we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest, then both `s_1` (the original smallest) and `s_n` (the original largest) will still be present in the `n-1` element array.\n    The new minimum element is `s_1`.\n    The new maximum element is `s_n`.\n    The instability in this case is `s_n - s_1`.\n\nNow, let's compare these instabilities:\nSince `s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n`:\n*   `s_n - s_2 <= s_n - s_1` (because `s_2 >= s_1`)\n*   `s_{n-1} - s_1 <= s_n - s_1` (because `s_{n-1} <= s_n`)\n\nThis means that removing an element from the middle of the sorted array (i.e., not `s_1` or `s_n`) will always result in an instability value greater than or equal to the instability values obtained by removing either `s_1` or `s_n`. Therefore, to minimize instability, we only need to consider the first two cases.\n\nThe minimum possible instability will be `min( (s_n - s_2), (s_{n-1} - s_1) )`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`.\n2.  Read the `n` integers into a list.\n3.  Sort the list in non-decreasing order. Let's call the sorted list `a`.\n    After sorting, `a[0]` is `s_1`, `a[1]` is `s_2`, `a[n-2]` is `s_{n-1}`, and `a[n-1]` is `s_n`.\n4.  Calculate the instability if `s_1` (i.e., `a[0]`) is removed: `a[n-1] - a[1]`.\n5.  Calculate the instability if `s_n` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) is removed: `a[n-2] - a[0]`.\n6.  The minimum of these two values is the answer. Print this minimum.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`, `n = 4`\nSorted `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n*   `a[0] = 1` (`s_1`)\n*   `a[1] = 3` (`s_2`)\n*   `a[2] = 3` (`s_{n-1}`)\n*   `a[3] = 7` (`s_n`)\n\n1.  Remove `s_1` (value 1): Remaining `[3, 3, 7]`. Instability `7 - 3 = 4`. (Calculated as `a[3] - a[1]`)\n2.  Remove `s_n` (value 7): Remaining `[1, 3, 3]`. Instability `3 - 1 = 2`. (Calculated as `a[2] - a[0]`)\n\nMinimum instability = `min(4, 2) = 2`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Sorting the array takes `O(N log N)` time.\n*   Accessing elements and calculating differences takes `O(1)` time.\nOverall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nGiven `N <= 10^5`, `N log N` is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   Storing the array takes `O(N)` space.\nOverall space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, the number of elements in the array.\n    # sys.stdin.readline() is used for faster input in competitive programming.\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Read the n integers into a list.\n    # map(int, ...) converts each string element to an integer.\n    # .split() splits the line by whitespace into a list of strings.\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array in non-decreasing order.\n    # After sorting, a[0] is the smallest element, and a[n-1] is the largest.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Scenario 1: Remove the smallest element (a[0]).\n    # The remaining elements range from a[1] to a[n-1].\n    # The new minimum is a[1].\n    # The new maximum is a[n-1].\n    # Instability = max_new - min_new = a[n-1] - a[1].\n    instability_if_min_removed = a[n-1] - a[1]\n\n    # Scenario 2: Remove the largest element (a[n-1]).\n    # The remaining elements range from a[0] to a[n-2].\n    # The new minimum is a[0].\n    # The new maximum is a[n-2].\n    # Instability = max_new - min_new = a[n-2] - a[0].\n    instability_if_max_removed = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n    # The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two values.\n    # As analyzed, removing any other element will result in an instability\n    # that is greater than or equal to these two values.\n    min_instability = min(instability_if_min_removed, instability_if_max_removed)\n\n    # Print the result.\n    print(min_instability)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
