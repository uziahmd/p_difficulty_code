He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefix/Suffix Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a competitive programming problem. They've given me a set of strings, specifically $2n-2$ of them, and the goal is to figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string *s* of length *n*.  We're given all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes, meaning those of lengths from 1 up to *n-1*.  There are exactly two strings for each length.\n\nLet's use some clear notation.  If the string *s* is something like \"abcde\", then the prefixes would be \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abcd\" and the suffixes would be \"e\", \"de\", \"cde\", \"bcde\".  We have to determine who is prefix and suffix from the input.\n\nMy first thought is to call the prefix of length *k*  $P_k$ and the suffix of length *k* $S_k$. So, $P_k$ is the first *k* characters and $S_k$ is the last *k* characters of *s*.\n\nSince we know $P_n$ and $S_n$ are both equal to *s*, and that any $P_k$ is a prefix of all $P_{k+1}$ and likewise $S_k$ is a suffix of all $S_{k+1}$, I can see some patterns emerging.\n\nThe critical insight here is that knowing $P_{n-1}$ and $S_{n-1}$ unlocks the entire string *s*.  $P_{n-1}$ gives us the first *n-1* characters of *s*, and $S_{n-1}$ gives us the last *n-1* characters. Specifically, $P_{n-1}$ = *s[0...n-2]* and $S_{n-1}$ = *s[1...n-1]*. We need to get these two from the given strings.\n\nI can reconstruct *s* like this:  $s = P_{n-1} + s[n-1]$ and also $s = s[0] + S_{n-1}$.  This means the middle part ($P_{n-1}[1 \\dots n-2]$) and ($S_{n-1}[0 \\dots n-3]$) should be equal. Thus, the first character of *s* will be equal to the first character of $P_{n-1}$ and the last character will be the last of $S_{n-1}$.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the specific $P_{n-1}$ and $S_{n-1}$ among the $2n-2$ provided strings. With those, I can easily construct the full string *s* and that will determine what is a prefix and what is a suffix.  The first string is $P_{n-1}$ and the last one will be $S_{n-1}$.\n",
