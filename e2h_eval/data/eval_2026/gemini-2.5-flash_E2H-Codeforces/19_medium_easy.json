The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI'm faced with a competitive programming challenge. The objective is to select a subset of districts from a tree structure, aiming to maximize the sum of powers of 2 associated with those districts.  The catch is that the selected districts must form a connected component, and we are told which districts to remove.  The task is to identify these removed districts, in ascending order.\n\nMy initial thought is that the exponential growth of `2^i` values means that larger district indices have a proportionally huge impact on the final sum. This suggests a greedy approach could be effective – prioritize keeping districts with higher indices.\n\nTo keep things straight, I'm thinking of this: If we start with all districts and try to remove the districts with the lowest indices first, the problem is that removing districts might break the connectivity of the districts that remain. So, I have to find the \"right\" greedy strategy.\n\nI'm thinking that if we remove a district, the remaining districts must still form a connected subgraph (a subtree) in the original tree. It's like finding a connected component with `n-k` vertices that has maximum weight where each vertex `i` has a weight of `2^i`.\n\nSince the weights (`2^i`) are so large, I figure that, if possible, the optimal connected subgraph will always contain the vertex with the largest index. Then I want to try to keep the second largest if it's connected, and so on.\n\nLet's say we have the nodes in decreasing order from `n` to `1`. I need to figure out which `n-k` nodes will maximize the power of 2 sum while being a connected component. My intuition is to pick the nodes with largest indices one by one so long as the connectivity constraint is maintained. If a node cannot be kept because it breaks the connection, it's removed.\n\nI'm developing a greedy algorithm. I start by iterating through the districts in decreasing order of their index. At each step, I want to decide whether to keep a district. The rule is: I can only keep a district if it doesn't break the connectivity of the currently selected districts (which have to form a connected component).\n\nIf keeping a district makes the size of `kept_nodes` exceed `n-k`, I stop. The removed districts will be the ones that have not been included in the connected component.\n\nI need a way to efficiently check for the connectivity constraint. I'm imagining something like a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). If a newly considered node is either the first node or adjacent to any currently \"kept\" node, it can be kept. Otherwise, it's a candidate for removal.\n\nSo, the algorithm has to keep track of a set of currently kept nodes and check for connectivity. This sounds manageable, and the goal is to make a decision at each step.\n\nOkay, let's refine this.  I need to keep track of connectivity more efficiently than with a full graph search. I can use an array `is_connected_to_kept` to keep track of which *unkept* nodes have *neighbors* in the set of `kept_nodes`.\nWhen a node is kept, I update the neighbor array.  I will iterate from `n` down to `1`. In each iteration I add it to the kept set *only if* it has not been kept already and *either* the `kept` set is currently empty or it has a neighbor in the set of kept nodes.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is the fan count `2^i`. Since `2^i` grows exponentially, `2^i` is always greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < i`. For example, `2^5 = 32`, while `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2+4+8+16 = 30`. This property implies that to maximize the total number of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with higher indices. Specifically, we want to keep district `n` if possible, then `n-1` if possible, and so on. This suggests a greedy approach.\n\n**Greedy Strategy:**\n\nWe want to select `m = n - k` districts. We iterate through districts from `n` down to `1`. For each district `i`, we try to add it to our set of `kept_nodes` if two conditions are met:\n1.  We still need to select more districts (i.e., `count_kept < m`).\n2.  Adding `i` maintains the connectivity of the `kept_nodes` set.\n\nThe second condition means that if `kept_nodes` is currently empty, `i` can be the first node. If `kept_nodes` is not empty, `i` must have at least one neighbor that is already in `kept_nodes`. If this condition is met, adding `i` will extend the existing connected component without disconnecting it.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input and Build Adjacency List:** Read `n` and `k`. Then, read the `n-1` edges and build an adjacency list `adj` for the tree. `adj[u]` will store a list of districts connected to `u`.\n\n2.  **Initialize Data Structures:**\n    *   `kept_nodes`: A `set` to store the districts we decide to keep. Using a set allows for efficient `add` and `in` operations.\n    *   `count_kept`: An integer to track the current number of districts in `kept_nodes`. Initialize to `0`.\n    *   `is_connected_to_kept`: A boolean array of size `n+1`. `is_connected_to_kept[j]` will be `True` if district `j` has at least one neighbor that is currently in `kept_nodes` (and `j` itself is not in `kept_nodes`). Initialize all to `False`. This array helps efficiently check the connectivity condition.\n\n3.  **Greedy Selection Loop:** Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   **Check if enough nodes are kept:** If `count_kept` is already equal to `n - k`, we have selected enough districts. Break the loop.\n    *   **Check if `i` can be added:**\n        *   If `kept_nodes` is empty (`count_kept == 0`): District `i` must be the first node. Add `i` to `kept_nodes`. Increment `count_kept`.\n        *   Else (`kept_nodes` is not empty): Check `is_connected_to_kept[i]`. If it's `True`, it means `i` has a neighbor already in `kept_nodes`, so adding `i` will maintain connectivity. Add `i` to `kept_nodes`. Increment `count_kept`.\n    *   **Update `is_connected_to_kept`:** If district `i` was just added to `kept_nodes`:\n        For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n            If `v` is *not* in `kept_nodes` (i.e., `v` is an unselected district), set `is_connected_to_kept[v] = True`. This marks `v` as a potential candidate for future inclusion because it's now connected to the growing `kept_nodes` component.\n\n4.  **Identify Removed Districts:** After the loop finishes, `kept_nodes` contains the `n-k` districts that maximize the fan sum. To find the removed districts, iterate from `1` to `n`. If a district `j` is not in `kept_nodes`, add it to a `removed_nodes` list.\n\n5.  **Print Output:** Sort the `removed_nodes` list in increasing order and print them space-separated.\n\n**Why this greedy strategy is optimal:**\nThe choice of `2^i` as fan counts is crucial. Because `2^i` is so dominant, any set of `n-k` nodes that includes a higher-indexed node `x` will always have a greater total fan count than any set that excludes `x` but includes only lower-indexed nodes. The greedy strategy ensures that we always pick the highest possible indexed node `i` that can be added to the current connected component without exceeding the `n-k` limit. If `i` is chosen, it contributes `2^i`. If `i` is not chosen, it's because either we already have `n-k` nodes, or `i` cannot be connected to the existing `kept_nodes` without violating connectivity. In the latter case, we must choose other nodes, and any set of `n-k` nodes that *does* include `i` must necessarily drop some other node to make space for `i`, which would be a lower-indexed node than `i` (since we iterate downwards). This logic, combined with the exponential weights, ensures that prioritizing higher indices whenever connectivity allows leads to the optimal sum.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Building adjacency list: `O(N)` since there are `N-1` edges.\n    *   Greedy selection loop: The loop runs `N` times (from `N` down to `1`).\n        *   Inside the loop, set operations (`in`, `add`) take `O(1)` on average.\n        *   Updating `is_connected_to_kept`: When a node `i` is added, we iterate over its neighbors. Each edge `(u, v)` is processed at most twice (once when `u` is added, once when `v` is added). So, the total work for updating `is_connected_to_kept` across all iterations is `O(N)`.\n    *   Identifying and sorting removed nodes: `O(N log k)` if `k` is the number of removed nodes, or `O(N)` if `k` is small and we use counting sort for `N` elements. Since `k < N`, `O(N log N)` in the worst case for general sorting, but `O(N)` if we iterate and collect and then sort.\n    *   Overall time complexity: `O(N)`.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   Adjacency list: `O(N)`\n    *   `kept_nodes` set: `O(N)`\n    *   `is_connected_to_kept` array: `O(N)`\n    *   `removed_nodes` list: `O(k)`\n    *   Overall space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, an `O(N)` solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    count_kept = 0\n    \n    # is_connected_to_kept[j] is True if node j has a neighbor in kept_nodes\n    # and j itself is not in kept_nodes.\n    is_connected_to_kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # We need to keep n - k nodes\n    target_kept_count = n - k\n\n    # Iterate from n down to 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if count_kept == target_kept_count:\n            break # We have already selected enough nodes\n\n        can_add_i = False\n        if count_kept == 0:\n            # If kept_nodes is empty, 'i' can be the first node\n            can_add_i = True\n        elif is_connected_to_kept[i]:\n            # If kept_nodes is not empty, 'i' can be added if it has a neighbor\n            # already in kept_nodes (indicated by is_connected_to_kept[i] being True)\n            can_add_i = True\n\n        if can_add_i:\n            kept_nodes.add(i)\n            count_kept += 1\n            \n            # Update is_connected_to_kept for neighbors of 'i'\n            for neighbor in adj[i]:\n                if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n                    is_connected_to_kept[neighbor] = True\n\n    # Collect the nodes that were removed\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # The problem asks for output in increasing order of district number\n    # The list is already built in increasing order, so just print\n    print(*(removed_nodes))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
