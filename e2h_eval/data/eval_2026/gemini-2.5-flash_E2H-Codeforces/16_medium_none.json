Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The \"Crazy Town\" Conundrum**\n\nAlright, I'm facing this \"Crazy Town\" challenge. My objective is crystal clear: find the fewest steps to get from my home block to the university block, dodging a bunch of infinite lines that slice up the 2D plane.  These lines essentially create blocks or regions.  Each move is a single step, meaning a crossing of one of these lines into the next adjacent block.\n\nFirst, I digested the problem's setup: home and university coordinates, the number of lines, and the line equations themselves (aix + biy + ci = 0).  The core idea hinges on this: crossing a line means switching sides relative to that line.  The key insight is the `F(x, y) = ax + by + c` function.  Its sign dictates the side of the line a point resides on. If two points, home and the university, end up on opposite sides of a line, then we *must* cross that line.\n\nSince we are guaranteed that home and the university aren't *on* any lines, the function `F(x, y)` will always return a non-zero value.  This simplifies the logic considerably. If `F(x1, y1) * F(x2, y2) < 0`, then the points are separated by a line; if the product is positive, they are on the same side, and we can ignore that line.  The \"no jump\" restriction (adjacent regions having shared boundary) is already implicitly taken into account by this line crossing idea.\n\nMy strategy boils down to: count the lines separating home from the university. This is the minimum number of steps.  For each line, I compute the `F(x, y)` value for both home and the university. If the product of those values is negative, increment the step count.  I've checked the examples, and it holds.\n\nI've carefully considered potential edge cases, integer overflow, and any constraints, and I'm confident that the signs checking logic is sound. This solution seems efficient; just looping through the lines, constant-time operations inside, and with a `n` up to 300, it should be very fast.  With the Python code ready, I'll submit it and see what happens.\n",
