The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this \"Frog Jumping\" problem.**\n\nMy objective is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`.  `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, starting from 0, with a jump size of `a` or `-b`, and all intermediate positions staying within `[0, x]`.\n\nI've got a handle on what `f(x)` is about. It's really about figuring out all the `y` values I can get to with `+a` and `-b` jumps, staying positive all the way. A crucial aspect is that I can only jump to numbers that are within the `[0, x]` interval for `f(x)`.\n\nI started by considering the unrestricted reachability without the `x` constraint. Jumping by `+a` and `-b` gets you to the set of all integers. This set seems to be multiples of the `gcd(a, b)`. If `a` is a multiple of `b` or vice versa, this is trivial. Otherwise, the problem gets more interesting.\n\nI considered a Dijkstra-like approach.  I'll define `dp[i]` as the minimum \"maximum value encountered\" on any path from 0 to `i`. This means if I arrive at `i`, I store the smallest `max_value` that I had to go through to get there.\n\nThe tricky part is that I need to calculate this `dp[k]` array for all values up to `m`. It feels like I'm building a graph where nodes are numbers.  Edges connect `p` to `p+a` and `p-b`. The edge weights would be the maximum values encountered.\n\nThe reachability constraint makes this a bit more complicated. For example, if I consider `0, a, 2a, ...`, then the max value at each `j*a` is the same as `j*a` because these are achievable without any negative positions. However, paths with `-b` jumps might lead to different `max_val` because of the `>=0` restriction.\n\nMy intuition says the `dp` values won't grow indefinitely. They should eventually \"stabilize\" or repeat in a predictable pattern. If `gcd(a, b) = 1`, for example, I expect that for large enough `k` values, `dp[k] = k`.\n\nLet's say `f(x)` is the count of numbers that have a `dp[k]` value less than or equal to `x`. I'll compute the `dp` array using Dijkstra. Then, to get my final answer, I'll calculate `m - dp[k] + 1` for each `k` where `dp[k]` doesn't exceed `m`, and sum up these contributions. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum possible maximum position visited on a path from `0` to `k`. If `k` is unreachable, `dp[k] = infinity`.\nA position `k` is reachable within `[0, x]` if and only if `dp[k] <= x`.\nTherefore, `f(x)` is the count of `k` such that `dp[k] <= x`.\n\nThe sum we need to compute is `S = sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\nWe can rewrite this sum by changing the order of summation:\n`S = sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } dp[k] <= i} 1`\n`S = sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } dp[k] <= m} sum_{i=dp[k]}^{m} 1`\n`S = sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } dp[k] <= m} (m - dp[k] + 1)`\n\nThis means we need to compute `dp[k]` for all `k` such that `dp[k] <= m`.\nThe values `a, b` can be up to `10^5`, and `m` up to `10^9`.\nThe maximum `k` we might need to consider for `dp[k]` can be large. However, `dp[k]` is always `>= k`.\nSo, if `k > m`, then `dp[k] > m`, and such `k` will not contribute to the sum.\nTherefore, we only need to compute `dp[k]` for `k` in the range `[0, m]`. But `m` is too large for a direct `dp` array.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable positions must be multiples of `g`.\nWe can divide `a, b, m` by `g` and solve the problem for `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`, `m' = m/g`.\nIf we find `dp'[k']` for the scaled problem, then `dp[k'*g] = dp'[k'] * g`.\nThe total sum will be `g * sum_{k' \\text{ s.t. } dp'[k'] <= m'} (m' - dp'[k'] + 1)`.\nSo, we can assume `gcd(a, b) = 1` without loss of generality.\nThe maximum values for `a, b` are still `10^5`.\n\nThe `dp[k]` values can be computed using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nThe states in Dijkstra are positions `k`. The \"cost\" to reach `k` is `dp[k]`.\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[k] = infinity` for `k > 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue storing `(max_val, current_pos)`. Start with `(0, 0)`.\nWhen extracting `(current_max, u)` from the priority queue:\n1. If `current_max > dp[u]`, skip (a better path to `u` has already been found).\n2. Consider jumping `+a`: `v = u+a`. The new `max_val'` for `v` is `max(current_max, v)`.\n   If `max_val' < dp[v]`, update `dp[v] = max_val'` and push `(max_val', v)` to the priority queue.\n3. Consider jumping `-b`: `v = u-b`. If `v >= 0`, the new `max_val'` for `v` is `current_max` (since `v < u <= current_max`).\n   If `max_val' < dp[v]`, update `dp[v] = max_val'` and push `(max_val', v)` to the priority queue.\n\nThe maximum `k` for which `dp[k] > k` is bounded. For `k >= a*b - a - b` (if `gcd(a,b)=1`), it's known that `dp[k]=k` holds. However, `a*b` can be `10^{10}`, which is too large.\nA tighter bound is `max(a, b) * (max(a, b) - 1)`. More precisely, it's `a + b + C` for some `C`.\nFor `gcd(a,b)=1`, it is known that `dp[k]=k` for `k >= a*b - a - b` (Frobenius number).\nHowever, for this problem, the maximum value `k` for which `dp[k] > k` is bounded by `a+b` or `2a` or `2b`.\nA common bound for similar problems is `2 * max(a, b)`. Let `MAX_K_CONSIDER = 2 * max(a, b)`. For `a, b <= 10^5`, this is `2 * 10^5`.\nWe can run Dijkstra up to `k = MAX_K_CONSIDER` (or `k = 2*a` or `k = 2*b`).\nLet `N = 2 * max(a, b) + 10`. We can use `N = 2 * 10^5 + 5` to be safe.\nWe compute `dp[k]` for `k` up to `N`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[k]` for `k <= N`:\nFor `k > N`, if `dp[k]` exists and `dp[k] <= m`, then `dp[k]` must be equal to `k`.\nThis is because if `k` is large enough, any path to `k` can be constructed by repeatedly adding `a` (or `b` then `a`).\nIf `k` is large enough, we can always reach `k` by a path that never exceeds `k`.\nSpecifically, for `k >= N`, if `k` is reachable, then `dp[k] = k`.\nThe reachable values `k` for `k >= N` are `N, N+g, N+2g, ...` (where `g=gcd(a,b)`).\nSince we assumed `g=1`, these are `N, N+1, N+2, ...`.\nSo, for `k > N`, `dp[k] = k` for all reachable `k`.\nAll integers `k >= (a-1)(b-1)` are reachable (if `gcd(a,b)=1`).\nSo, for `k` large enough (e.g., `k >= a*b`), `dp[k]=k`.\nSince `a, b <= 10^5`, `a*b` can be `10^{10}`.\nThe bound `N` for Dijkstra should be `a+b` or slightly larger. Let's use `a+b`.\nThe maximum value `k` for which `dp[k] > k` is `a+b-gcd(a,b)`.\nSo for `k > a+b-gcd(a,b)`, `dp[k]=k` if `k` is reachable.\nLet `MAX_DP_K_GT_K = a+b`. We will run Dijkstra up to `2*MAX_DP_K_GT_K` to be safe.\nSet `LIMIT = 2 * (a+b)`. If `a+b` is up to `2*10^5`, `LIMIT` is `4*10^5`. This is feasible for Dijkstra.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Divide `a, b, m` by `g`: `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`, `m' = m/g`.\n3. Initialize `dp` array of size `LIMIT = 2 * (a' + b') + 5` with `infinity`. `dp[0] = 0`.\n4. Use Dijkstra:\n   `pq = [(0, 0)]` (min_max_val, current_pos).\n   While `pq` is not empty:\n     Pop `(current_max, u)` from `pq`.\n     If `current_max > dp[u]`, continue.\n     If `u > m'`, we don't need to explore further from `u` for its contribution to the sum, but we might need to update `dp` values for smaller `k`.\n     Consider `v = u+a'`:\n       If `v < LIMIT`:\n         `new_max = max(current_max, v)`.\n         If `new_max < dp[v]`: `dp[v] = new_max`, push `(new_max, v)` to `pq`.\n       Else (`v >= LIMIT`):\n         Since `v` is large, `dp[v]` will be `v`. This value `v` is only reachable if `current_max <= v`.\n         If `current_max <= v`, then `dp[v] = v`. This is implicitly handled by the `stable_points` logic below.\n     Consider `v = u-b'`:\n       If `v >= 0`:\n         `new_max = current_max`.\n         If `new_max < dp[v]`: `dp[v] = new_max`, push `(new_max, v)` to `pq`.\n5. Calculate the sum:\n   `total_sum = 0`.\n   `last_k_with_dp_gt_k = -1`.\n   For `k` from `0` to `min(m', LIMIT-1)`:\n     If `dp[k] <= m'`:\n       `total_sum += (m' - dp[k] + 1)`.\n       If `dp[k] > k`, then `last_k_with_dp_gt_k = k`.\n   \n   If `m'` is larger than `LIMIT-1`:\n     For `k` from `LIMIT` to `m'`:\n       At this point, `dp[k]` is `k` for all reachable `k`.\n       The positions `k` are reachable if `k` is a multiple of `g'` (which is 1 here).\n       So, `dp[k] = k` for all `k >= last_k_with_dp_gt_k + 1` (or `k >= LIMIT` if `LIMIT` is large enough).\n       The number of such `k` is `m' - LIMIT + 1`.\n       Each such `k` contributes `(m' - k + 1)` to the sum.\n       This is an arithmetic series: `sum_{k=LIMIT}^{m'} (m' - k + 1)`.\n       Let `j = m' - k + 1`. When `k=LIMIT`, `j = m' - LIMIT + 1`. When `k=m'`, `j = 1`.\n       So this is `sum_{j=1}^{m' - LIMIT + 1} j = (m' - LIMIT + 1) * (m' - LIMIT + 2) / 2`.\n       `count_stable = m' - LIMIT + 1`.\n       If `count_stable > 0`:\n         `total_sum += count_stable * (count_stable + 1) // 2`.\n\n6. Multiply `total_sum` by `g`. Print the result.\n\nEdge cases:\n- `a=b`: `g=a`. `a'=1, b'=1`. `dp'[k'] = k'`.\n  `f(x)` for `a'=1, b'=1` is `x+1`.\n  `sum_{i=0}^{m'} (i+1) = (m'+1)(m'+2)/2`.\n  Total sum `g * (m'+1)(m'+2)/2`.\n  Example 3: `m=100, a=100000, b=1`. `g=1`.\n  `a'=100000, b'=1`. `m'=100`.\n  `dp[0]=0`. `dp[1]=1`. `dp[2]=2`. ... `dp[100]=100`.\n  `f(i)=i+1`. `sum_{i=0}^{100} (i+1) = (101)*(102)/2 = 101*51 = 5151`.\n  Wait, example output is `101`. Why?\n  \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\"\n  If `a=100000, b=1`, `m=100`.\n  From 0, can jump to `a=100000`. This is `> x` for `x < 100000`.\n  So for `x < 100000`, the only reachable point is `0`. `f(x)=1`.\n  `f(0)=1, f(1)=1, ..., f(99999)=1`.\n  `f(100000)`: can reach `0, 100000`. `f(100000)=2`.\n  For `m=100`, `f(i)=1` for all `i <= 100`.\n  So `sum_{i=0}^{100} 1 = 101`. This matches example output.\n  My Dijkstra correctly computes `dp[k]` for `a=100000, b=1`.\n  `dp[0]=0`. `dp[1]=100000` (path `0->100000->99999->...->1`).\n  `dp[k] = 100000` for `k=1...99999`.\n  `dp[100000]=100000`.\n  For `m=100`:\n  `k=0: dp[0]=0 <= 100`. Contributes `(100-0+1)=101`.\n  `k=1: dp[1]=100000 > 100`. Does not contribute.\n  ...\n  `k=100: dp[100]=100000 > 100`. Does not contribute.\n  Total sum = `101`. Correct.\n\nThe `LIMIT` for Dijkstra should be `max(a', b') + b' + 5` or similar.\nThe values `k` for which `dp[k] > k` are roughly bounded by `a'+b'`.\nLet `MAX_K_UNSTABLE = a' + b'`.\nWe need to run Dijkstra up to `min(m', MAX_K_UNSTABLE + b')`.\nLet's choose `LIMIT = min(m', 2*(a'+b')+5)`.\nIf `m'` is small, we just iterate up to `m'`.\nIf `m'` is large, we iterate up to `2*(a'+b')+5` and then use the arithmetic series formula.\nThe maximum value of `a'+b'` is `2 * 10^5`. So `LIMIT` is about `4 * 10^5`.\nThis is a feasible number of states for Dijkstra.\n\nRefined Algorithm:\n1. `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. `a_prime = a // g`, `b_prime = b // g`, `m_prime = m // g`.\n3. `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA = 2 * (a_prime + b_prime) + 5` (a conservative bound).\n4. `dp = [float('inf')] * (MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA + 1)`.\n5. `dp[0] = 0`.\n6. `pq = [(0, 0)]` (min_max_val, current_pos).\n7.

Final result: `total_sum_prime * g`.\n\nLet's check `last_k_unstable` logic. If `dp[k] > k`, it means `k` is \"unstable\".\nIf `dp[k] == k`, it means `k` is \"stable\".\nThe `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA` should be chosen such that for any `k > MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA`, `dp[k]=k` holds if `k` is reachable.\nA safe bound for `k` where `dp[k] > k` is `a_prime + b_prime`. So `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA = a_prime + b_prime + 5` should be enough.\nLet `BOUND = a_prime + b_prime`.\nWe run Dijkstra up to `min(m_prime, BOUND + a_prime)`.\nIf `m_prime` is large, points `k > BOUND` will have `dp[k]=k` (if reachable).\nThe reachable points are `0, g', 2g', ...`. Since `g'=1`, all integers are reachable.\nSo for `k > BOUND`, `dp[k]=k`.\nThe `first_k_stable` should be `BOUND + 1`.\nSo the loop for `k` goes from `0` to `min(m_prime, BOUND)`.\nThen the stable part `k` from `BOUND+1` to `m_prime`.\n\nCorrected Algorithm for step 9 and 10:\n9. `total_sum_prime = 0`.\n   `limit_k_loop = min(m_prime, MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA)`.\n   For `k` from `0` to `limit_k_loop`:\n     If `dp[k] <= m_prime`:\n       `total_sum_prime += (m_prime - dp[k] + 1)`.\n\n10.
