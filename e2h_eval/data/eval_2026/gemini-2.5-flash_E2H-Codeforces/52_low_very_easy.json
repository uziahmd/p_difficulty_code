Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Craft a Python Solution for the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this problem in my sights: optimizing the light Vasily gets from these candles.  The core of it is efficiency. I need a Python script that nails down the total burn time.\n\nHere's the breakdown, the mental model I'm forming:\n\n*   **The Goal:** Maximize the hours of light Vasily gets from burning candles. Simple.\n*   **The Rules:** We start with `a` new candles. Each one burns for an hour.  Once they're \"burnt out,\" he can combine `b` burnt-out candles to make a new one.  It's a consumption and recycling loop.\n*   **The Strategy:** Always burn everything.  That's the fundamental principle.  Then, recycle the burnt-out candles as effectively as possible.\n\nMy thinking is an iterative approach will be the cleanest. It's like this:\n\n1.  **Burn:** Start with the new candles.\n2.  **Add:** Record the hours of light.\n3.  **Collect:** Count all the burnt-out candles.\n4.  **Recycle:** Figure out how many new candles can be made from those.\n5.  **Repeat:** Go back to step 1. Do this until there aren't enough burnt-out candles to make another new candle or no more new candles.\n\nTo really solidify this, I'm sketching out a test case: `a = 4` and `b = 2`.  Let's see the flow:\n\n*   **Start:** I have 4 new candles. Hours are at zero. Burnt candles, zero.\n*   **First Iteration:** I burn all 4. Total hours = 4. I now have 4 burnt-out candles. Converting, I get 2 new candles (4 // 2) and zero left over.\n*   **Second Iteration:** I burn those 2 new candles. Total hours become 6. I've got 2 burnt candles now. Converting, I get 1 new candle and nothing leftover.\n*   **Third Iteration:** I burn the remaining candle. Total becomes 7. Now I have only 1 burnt-out candle, which is less than 2, therefore unable to produce a new candle.\n*   **End:** I'm done. The grand total of light = 7 hours. The example confirms my logic.\n\nI'm translating this into an algorithm I can code:\n\n1.  Initialize total hours to zero.\n2.  Set `current_new_candles` to the initial value `a`.\n3.  Initialize `burned_out_candles` to zero.\n4.  Iterate while `current_new_candles > 0` or there are enough burned candles to make a new one, as shown in the walkthrough.\n\nNow I can start writing the script, confident that this thought process is leading me in the right direction. This should be a nice clean piece of code when I'm done.\n",
