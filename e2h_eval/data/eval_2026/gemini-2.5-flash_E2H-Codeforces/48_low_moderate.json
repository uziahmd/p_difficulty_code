He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down into a Python script. My goal is to create a program that can convert a number from any base `a` to base `b`.**\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. This means reading in `a`, `b`, and the number `c` itself. `b` can either be an integer or the string 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nNext, I'll convert the number `c`, which is currently in base `a`, to decimal. I'll create a function called `to_decimal(num_str, base)` to handle this.  This function needs to be robust, handling digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10. Each letter will represent a value, with 'A' being 10, 'B' being 11, and so on.\n\nOnce I have the decimal representation, the next step depends on the target base, `b`.\n\nIf `b` is an integer, I'll use a function `from_decimal(num_dec, base)` to convert the decimal number to the desired base `b`. This will also handle bases greater than 10, utilizing the same A-Z representation as before.\n\nIf `b` is 'R', I need a function `to_roman(num_dec)` to convert the decimal number into its Roman numeral equivalent. I don't have the implementation for that yet, but I know that's the final conversion I need.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** I will read in `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n2.  **Base `a` to Decimal:**  `to_decimal(c_str, a)`\n3.  **Decimal to Base `b`:**\n    *   If `b` is an integer, I'll use `from_decimal(decimal_value, b)`.\n    *   If `b` is 'R', I'll use `to_roman(decimal_value)`.\n\nI have the core conversion functions for converting to and from decimal (base 10) implemented. Now I just need to figure out the Roman numeral function. It seems straightforward:\n\nThe `to_decimal` function takes a string `num_str` and the base as an integer `base`. It converts it to decimal.\n\n```python\ndef to_decimal(num_str, base):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    # Iterate from right to left (least significant digit to most significant)\n    for char in reversed(num_str):\n        digit_value = 0\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            digit_value = int(char)\n        elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            digit_value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        else:\n            # This case should not happen given problem constraints\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character '{char}' for base {base}\")\n\n        if digit_value >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Digit '{char}' is out of range for base {base}\")\n\n        decimal_value += digit_value * (base ** power)\n        power += 1\n    return decimal_value\n```\n\nThe `from_decimal` function takes the decimal number `num_dec` and the target `base`, returning a string.\n\n```python\ndef from_decimal(num_dec, base):\n    if num_dec == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n\n    result_chars = []\n    while num_dec > 0:\n        remainder = num_dec % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            result_chars.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            result_chars.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        num_dec //= base\n    return \"\".join(reversed(result_chars))\n```\n\nNow I just need to code the overall flow and add error handling. The core logic for the conversion is solid!\n",
