    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Optimization Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem. My goal is to determine two crucial values: the minimum number of nodes (`n`) needed to construct a directed graph that satisfies a \"reachability\" condition, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs possible within that graph given `n`.  Let's break this down.\n\nThe \"reachability\" aspect boils down to identifying pairs of nodes `(u, v)` where there's a directed path from `u` to `v` *and* from `v` back to `u`, and crucially, `u < v`. We're given a specific target count for this, denoted as `p`.  These pairs essentially reside within strongly connected components (SCCs) of the graph.\n\nThe other term, \"unidirectional pair\", refers to pairs where there's a path from `u` to `v`, but not the reverse. So, they must be in different SCCs.\n\nThe total number of nodes in the graph is `n`.  We can decompose the graph into its SCCs, with sizes `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_k`. The core relationship here is `n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k`.  The challenge lies in finding the minimum `n` that allows us to achieve the desired `p` pairs within the constraints of strongly connected components.\n\nMy initial thought is to work with the definition of `p`. Within each SCC of size `s_i`, the number of pairs that meet the criteria (reachability and `u < v`) is `s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2`. The total `p` value is the sum of these contributions across all SCCs. So, `p = sum(s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2)`.\n\nTo minimize `n` (which is the sum of the `s_i` values), I need to strategically manipulate the sizes of these SCCs. Since `s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, I'm thinking I should aim to maximize the size of the SCCs, while still adhering to the target `p`.  If I can put most of the nodes into a single SCC, that would be ideal to minimize `n`. The challenge is that this might not always be possible and I need a system for adjusting the size and quantity of SCCs to minimize `n` for a given `p`.  I need to explore the relationship between `p` and the possible SCC configurations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all `p`-reachable graphs with this minimum `n`.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there's a path from `u` to `v`, and no path from `v` to `u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC in the condensation graph.\n\nLet the graph have `n` nodes, and let its SCCs have sizes `s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k`.\nThe total number of nodes is `n = s_1 + s_2 + \\ldots + s_k`.\n\n**1. Minimum Number of Nodes `n` for a given `p`:**\n\nFor an SCC of size `s_i`, the number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` where `u` and `v` are in this SCC is `s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2`.\nThus, `p = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{s_i(s_i-1)}{2}`.\nTo minimize `n = \\sum s_i` for a fixed `p`, we should try to use as few SCCs as possible, and make the sizes of these SCCs as large as possible. This is because `s(s-1)/2` grows quadratically, while `s` grows linearly. A single large SCC is more \"efficient\" at generating `p` pairs than many small SCCs.\n\nWe can use a greedy approach:\nStart with `p_rem = p` and `n_min = 0`.\nIterate `s` from a large value downwards (or `s` from `1` upwards, adding `s` nodes to an SCC as long as `s(s-1)/2 \\le p_rem`).\nIf we add an SCC of size `s`, it contributes `s(s-1)/2` to `p`.\nWe want to find the largest `s_1` such that `s_1(s_1-1)/2 \\le p`.\nThen, we find the largest `s_2` such that `s_2(s_2-1)/2 \\le p - s_1(s_1-1)/2`, and so on.\n\nLet `f(s) = s(s-1)/2`. We need to find `s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k` such that `\\sum f(s_i) = p` and `\\sum s_i` is minimized.\nThis is equivalent to finding the largest `s` such that `f(s) \\le p`. Let this be `s_max`.\nThen `p_rem = p - f(s_max)`. We add `s_max` to `n_min`.\nWe repeat this process with `p_rem`: find the largest `s'` such that `f(s') \\le p_rem`, subtract `f(s')` from `p_rem`, add `s'` to `n_min`, until `p_rem` becomes 0.\nThis greedy strategy works because `f(s)` is convex.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nIf `s(s-1)/2 = 2 \\cdot 10^5`, then `s^2 \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^5`, so `s \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 10^5} = 200 \\sqrt{10} \\approx 632`.\nSo `s` will not exceed 633. We can precompute `f(s)` for `s` from 0 to 633.\n\nLet `nodes_for_p[i]` store the minimum number of nodes required to form `i` pairs.\n`nodes_for_p[0] = 0`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `p`:\n`nodes_for_p[i] = infinity`.\nFor `s` from `1` to 633:\n  If `f(s) = s(s-1)/2 \\le i`:\n    `nodes_for_p[i] = min(nodes_for_p[i], s + nodes_for_p[i - f(s)])`.\nThis is a dynamic programming approach for the change-making problem.\n`dp[i]` represents the minimum number of nodes to achieve `i` pairs.\n`dp[0] = 0`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `p`:\n  `dp[i] = infinity`\n  For `s` from `1` to 633:\n    `val = s * (s - 1) // 2`\n    If `val <= i`:\n      `dp[i] = min(dp[i], s + dp[i - val])`\nThe final `n_min` will be `dp[p]`.\n\n**2. Maximum Unidirectional Pairs for `n_min` nodes:**\n\nLet `n = n_min`. We have `k` SCCs with sizes `s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k` such that `\\sum s_i = n` and `\\sum s_i(s_i-1)/2 = p`.\nThe total number of ordered pairs of distinct nodes is `n(n-1)`.\nPairs `(u, v)` where `u, v` are in the same SCC: `\\sum s_i(s_i-1) = 2p`.\nPairs `(u, v)` where `u, v` are in different SCCs: `n(n-1) - 2p`.\nEach such pair `(u, v)` where `u, v` are in different SCCs can be either unidirectional (`u \\to v` but not `v \\to u`) or non-reachable (`no path u \\to v` and `no path v \\to u`).\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to make all `n(n-1) - 2p` pairs of nodes from different SCCs unidirectional.\nThis can be achieved by arranging the `k` SCCs in a line (a total order). Let's say SCCs `C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k` are ordered. We add edges such that there is a path from any node in `C_i` to any node in `C_j` if `i < j`, and no path if `i > j`.\nFor example, add an edge from every node in `C_i` to every node in `C_{i+1}`. Or simply add an edge from one node in `C_i` to one node in `C_{i+1}` for all `i`.\nThis structure ensures that for any `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j`:\n- If `i = j`, `u` and `v` are in the same SCC.\n- If `i < j`, there is a path `u \\to v` but no path `v \\to u`. So `(u, v)` is unidirectional.\n- If `i > j`, there is a path `v \\to u` but no path `u \\to v`. So `(v, u)` is unidirectional.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is the sum of `s_i \\cdot s_j` for all `i \\ne j`.\nThis sum is `\\sum_{i \\ne j} s_i s_j`.\nWe know `(\\sum s_i)^2 = \\sum s_i^2 + \\sum_{i \\ne j} s_i s_j`.\nSo, `\\sum_{i \\ne j} s_i s_j = (\\sum s_i)^2 - \\sum s_i^2 = n^2 - \\sum s_i^2`.\nThis is exactly `n(n-1) - \\sum s_i(s_i-1) = n(n-1) - 2p`.\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `n_min(n_min-1) - 2p`.\n\n**Summary of Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `dp` array of size `p+1` with `infinity`, `dp[0] = 0`.\n2. Initialize `scc_sizes` array of size `p+1` (to store the sum of squares of SCC sizes, `\\sum s_i^2`). `scc_sizes[0] = 0`.\n3. Iterate `i` from `1` to `p`:\n   `dp[i] = infinity`\n   `scc_sizes[i] = infinity` (conceptually, we'll store the `\\sum s_i^2` for the `dp[i]` solution)\n   For `s` from `1` to 633:\n     `val = s * (s - 1) // 2`\n     If `val <= i`:\n       If `dp[i - val] != infinity`:\n         `current_nodes = s + dp[i - val]`\n         `current_s_sq_sum = s * s + scc_sizes[i - val]`\n         If `current_nodes < dp[i]`:\n           `dp[i] = current_nodes`\n           `scc_sizes[i] = current_s_sq_sum`\n         Else if `current_nodes == dp[i]`:\n           `scc_sizes[i] = min(scc_sizes[i], current_s_sq_sum)`\n   Note: The `scc_sizes` DP state needs to be carefully handled. We want to maximize `n(n-1) - \\sum s_i^2`, which means minimizing `\\sum s_i^2` for the chosen `n`. So, when `current_nodes == dp[i]`, we should pick the one that minimizes `current_s_sq_sum`.\n\nThe maximum `s` is about 633. The maximum `p` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThe DP table size is `2 \\cdot 10^5`. Each state takes about 633 operations.\nTotal time complexity: `O(p \\cdot \\sqrt{p})` (since `s` is roughly `sqrt(2p)`).\n`2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 633 \\approx 1.2 \\cdot 10^8`, which might be too slow for a typical 1-2 second time limit.\n\nLet's recheck the greedy strategy for `n_min`.\nThe greedy strategy for change-making where coin values are `f(s)` for `s=1, 2, ...` does work.\n`dp[i]` = minimum number of nodes to get `i` pairs.\n`dp[i] = min_{s: f(s) \\le i} (s + dp[i - f(s)])`.\nThis correctly finds `n_min`.\n\nNow, to find the maximum unidirectional pairs, we need `n_min(n_min-1) - 2p`.\nThis formula is correct IF we can always construct the graph such that all pairs of nodes from different SCCs are unidirectional. This is achieved by forming a \"line\" of SCCs.\nThe DP approach for `n_min` naturally finds a decomposition of `p` into `\\sum f(s_i)`.\nThe set of `s_i` values `S = \\{s_1, \\ldots, s_k\\}` for which `\\sum s_i = n_{min}` and `\\sum f(s_i) = p` is unique in terms of the counts of each `s` value.\nFor example, if `p=3`, `f(3)=3`. `n_min=3`. `s_1=3`. `\\sum s_i^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\nIf `p=4`, `f(3)=3`, `p_rem=1`. `f(2)=1`. `s_1=3, s_2=2`. `n_min=3+2=5`. `\\sum s_i^2 = 3^2+2^2 = 9+4=13`.\nThe DP formulation for `scc_sizes` is correct: if multiple combinations of SCCs yield the same minimum `n`, we choose the one that minimizes `\\sum s_i^2`.\n\nThe time complexity `O(p \\cdot \\sqrt{p})` is indeed too slow. `2e5 * 633` is `1.2e8`.\nLet's consider the structure of `s(s-1)/2`.\n`s=0: 0`\n`s=1: 0`\n`s=2: 1`\n`s=3: 3`\n`s=4: 6`\n`s=5: 10`\n`s=6: 15`\n...\nThe values `f(s)` are the triangular numbers `T_{s-1}`.\nThis specific form of values allows for a faster DP.\nThe standard coin problem `dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin])` can be optimized with a deque if coins are `1, 2, ..., C`. Here coins are `f(s)`.\n\nThe observation that `n_min(n_min-1) - 2p` is the answer for unidirectional pairs suggests that the specific `s_i` values (and thus `\\sum s_i^2`) don't matter, as long as `n_min` is achieved.\nLet's verify this. `n(n-1) - 2p` is the total number of ordered pairs `(u,v)` such that `u` and `v` are in different SCCs. If we arrange the SCCs in a line, every such pair becomes unidirectional. So this is the maximum possible. This means we don't need to minimize `\\sum s_i^2`. We just need `n_min`.\n\nSo the problem simplifies to:\n1. Find `n_min = dp[p]`.\n2. Calculate `unidirectional_pairs = n_min * (n_min - 1) - 2 * p`.\n\nThe DP `dp[i] = min_{s: f(s) \\le i} (s + dp[i - f(s)])` is correct for `n_min`.\nThe time complexity is the main concern.\nFor `p=0`, `n_min=0`, `unidirectional=0`.\nFor `p=1`, `f(2)=1`. `n_min=2`. `unidirectional = 2*(1)-2*1 = 0`.\nFor `p=3`, `f(3)=3`. `n_min=3`. `unidirectional = 3*(2)-2*3 = 0`.\nFor `p=4`, `f(3)=3`, `p_rem=1`. `f(2)=1`. `n_min=3+2=5`. `unidirectional = 5*(4)-2*4 = 20-8=12`.\nThe examples match these calculations.\n\nLet's check the constraints again: `p \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5`.\n`s` up to 633.\nThe DP can be optimized by noticing that `f(s)` is `s(s-1)/2`.\nThis is a variation of the unbounded knapsack problem.\n`dp[i]` is the minimum `n` to get `i` pairs.\nFor each `s` from `2` to 633 (since `f(0)=f(1)=0`, we only care about `s>=2` for positive `f(s)`):\n  `val = s * (s - 1) // 2`\n  For `i` from `val` to `p`:\n    `dp[i] = min(dp[i], s + dp[i - val])`\nThis order of loops is for unbounded knapsack.\nThe outer loop iterates `s` (the \"item type\"), inner loop iterates `i` (the \"capacity\").\nThe number of \"item types\" is `~633`. The \"capacity\" is `p`.\nThis gives `O(p \\cdot \\sqrt{p})` complexity.\nThis is the standard DP for unbounded knapsack. My initial complexity estimate was correct.\n`1.2 * 10^8` operations is indeed too high for Python. It might pass in C++, but not Python.\n\nIs there a mathematical property that allows us to calculate `dp[p]` faster?\nThe `s` values are `1, 2, ..., 633`.\nThe `val` values are `0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, ..., 200000`.\nThe `dp` recurrence is `dp[i] = min(s + dp[i - s(s-1)/2])`.\nThis is a standard minimum sum partition problem.\n\nLet's confirm the time limit. Usually 1-2 seconds.\nPython operations are slower than C++. `1.2e8` is definitely too much for Python.\nMaybe there's a different approach for `n_min`.\n\nConsider the function `g(n) = n(n-1)/2`. This is the maximum `p` for `n` nodes (when all nodes are in one SCC).\nWe are looking for `n_min` such that `p \\le n_min(n_min-1)/2`.\nThis gives a lower bound for `n_min`.\nLet `N` be the smallest integer such that `N(N-1)/2 \\ge p`.\nThen `n_min` must be at least `N`.\nWe can find `N` by solving `x(x-1)/2 = p` for `x`. `x^2 - x - 2p = 0`. `x = (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`.\nSo `N = ceil((1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2)`.\nFor `p=2 \\cdot 10^5`, `N \\approx 633`.\n\nWhat if `p` is large? Say `p = 2 \\cdot 10^5`. `N=633`.\n`f(633) = 633 * 632 / 2 = 200016`.\n`f(632) = 632 * 631 / 2 = 199396`.\nIf `p = 199396`, then `n_min = 632`. `unidirectional = 632*631 - 2*199396 = 0`.\nIf `p = 199397`, then we need `n_min > 632`.\nThe greedy approach would pick `s_1 = 632`, `p_rem = 199397 - 199396 = 1`.\nThen `s_2 = 2` (since `f(2)=1`).\nSo `n_min = 632 + 2 = 634`.\n`unidirectional = 634 * 633 - 2 * 199397 = 401622 - 398794 = 2828`.\n\nThe DP approach for `n_min` is correct. The only problem is performance.\nThe number of distinct `f(s)` values is only 633.\nThe constraint `p \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5` is small enough that sometimes `O(p \\sqrt{p})` can pass in Python if the constant factor is small.\nLet's estimate the constant factor.\n`dp[i] = min(dp[i], s + dp[i-val])`\nThe inner loop `i` from `val` to `p` means `p - val` iterations.\nThe outer loop `s` from `2` to `633`.\nSum of `(p - f(s))` over `s=2..633`.\nThis is roughly `633 * p - sum(f(s))`.\n`sum(f(s))` is `sum(s(s-1)/2)`. `sum(s^2/2 - s/2)`. `~ s^3/6`.\nFor `s=633`, `s^3/6 ~ 633^3 / 6 ~ 2.5 * 10^8 / 6 ~ 4 * 10^7`.\nSo `633 * 2 \\cdot 10^5 - 4 \\cdot 10^7 \\approx 1.2 \\cdot 10^8 - 4 \\cdot 10^7 \\approx 8 \\cdot 10^7`.\nThis is still a lot.\n\nA common optimization for this type of DP (where `dp[i]` depends on `dp[i-val]` for many `val`) is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) like approach if `val` values are small integers starting from 1. But here `val` values are not consecutive.\n\nMaybe the `dp` values quickly converge to a simple pattern?\nFor `p=0`, `n_min=0`, `uni=0`.\nFor `p=1`, `n_min=2`, `uni=0`.\nFor `p=2`, `f(2)=1, f(2)=1`. `n_min = 2+2=4`. `uni = 4*3-2*2 = 12-4=8`.\n  `p=2`: `dp[2] = min(2+dp[1], 3+dp[2-3(2)/2]...)`\n  `dp[0] = 0`\n  `dp[1] = 2+dp[0] = 2` (using s=2, val=1)\n  `dp[2] = min(2+dp[1], 3+dp[-1]...) = 2+2 = 4` (using s=2, val=1)\nExample `p=2`:\nGraph with 4 nodes. Two SCCs of size 2. Nodes {1,2} and {3,4}.\n`1<2` in SCC1, `3<4` in SCC2. `p = 1+1=2`.\n`n_min = 2+2=4`.\nUnidirectional pairs: `n(n-1)-2p = 4*3-2*2 = 12-4=8`.\nThese 8 pairs are:\n(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)\n(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)\nIf SCC1 -> SCC2, then (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4) are unidirectional.\nIf SCC2 -> SCC1, then (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2) are unidirectional.\nWe can't have both. We need to maximize.\nIf we set SCC1 before SCC2, we get `s_1 * s_2 = 2*2 = 4` unidirectional pairs.\nIf we set SCC2 before SCC1, we get `s_2 * s_1 = 2*2 = 4` unidirectional pairs.\nThe formula `n(n-1)-2p` counts all pairs `(u,v)` where `u,v` are in different SCCs.\nIf we align SCCs `C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k`, then for any `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`:\n- If `i < j`, then `(u,v)` is unidirectional. There are `s_i s_j` such pairs.\n- If `i > j`, then `(v,u)` is unidirectional. There are `s_j s_i` such pairs.\nThe total sum `\\sum_{i \\ne j} s_i s_j = n^2 - \\sum s_i^2 = n(n-1) - (\\sum s_i^2 - \\sum s_i) = n(n-1) - \\sum s_i(s_i-1) = n(n-1) - 2p`.\nThis formula counts for each pair of distinct SCCs `C_i, C_j`, all `s_i s_j` pairs of nodes `(u,v)` where `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`.\nWhen we arrange SCCs in a line, say `C_1 \\to C_2 \\to \\ldots \\to C_k`, then for `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`:\n- If `i < j`, then `u \\to v` but not `v \\to u`. So `(u,v)` is unidirectional.\n- If `i > j`, then `v \\to u` but not `u \\to v`. So `(v,u)` is unidirectional.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `\\sum_{i<j} s_i s_j`. This is *not* `n(n-1) - 2p`.\nIt's `n(n-1) - 2p` if we count `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` as separate unidirectional pairs.\nThe problem states \"ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)`\". So `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` are distinct.\nSo if `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j` with `i < j`, then `(u,v)` is unidirectional. The count is `s_i s_j`.\nIf `u \\in C_j, v \\in C_i` with `i < j`, then `(u,v)` is NOT unidirectional, because `v \\to u` is not true. Instead, `(v,u)` is unidirectional.\nThis means for any pair of nodes `u,v` from different SCCs, exactly one of `(u,v)` or `(v,u)` will be unidirectional.\nSo the total number of unidirectional pairs is indeed `n(n-1) - 2p`. My reasoning was correct.\nSo the `scc_sizes` part of the DP is not needed. We just need `n_min`.\n\nThe `O(p \\sqrt{p})` solution might pass in Python if the constant factor is small enough, or if test cases don't hit the worst case. Given it's a competitive programming problem, `2e5` for `O(N^1.5)` in Python is usually a fail.\n\nLet's check the example `p=4`:\n`n_min=5`. `s_1=3, s_2=2`.\n`unidirectional = 5*(4) - 2*4 = 20 - 8 = 12`.\nThis is consistent with `s_1 s_2 + s_2 s_1 = 3*2 + 2*3 = 6+6 = 12`.\nYes, this is correct.\n\nFinal check on `p=0` case:\n`dp[0]=0`.\n`n_min=0`.\n`unidirectional = 0*(0-1) - 2*0 = 0`. Correct.\n\nCould there be a greedy solution for `n_min`?\nTo get `p` pairs, we want to maximize the `s` values.\n`n_min = 0`.\nWhile `p > 0`:\n  Find largest `s` such that `s(s-1)/2 <= p`.\n  `n_min += s`.\n  `p -= s(s-1)/2`.\nThis greedy approach is correct for finding `n_min`.\nWhy? It's a known result for change-making problems with \"super-increasing\" coin values, or more generally when the values `f(s)` are convex and `f(s+1) - f(s)` is increasing. Here `f(s) = s(s-1)/2`, `f(s+1)-f(s) = s`. This is indeed increasing.\nSo the greedy approach works!\n\nAlgorithm using greedy approach:\n1. Initialize `n_min = 0`.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `s` such that `s * (s - 1) // 2 <= p`.\n      This can be done by solving `s^2 - s - 2p <= 0`.\n      `s \\approx (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`.\n      So, `s = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n      We need to be careful with floating point precision. It's better to check `s_candidate * (s_candidate - 1) // 2 <= p` and `(s_candidate+1) * s_candidate // 2 > p`.\n      A simple way is to start `s_candidate` from `floor(sqrt(2*p))` and increment until condition is met or decrement.\n      Or, start `s_candidate` from `2` and increment `s` until `s(s-1)/2 > p`. Then the correct `s` is `s-1`.\n      Since `p` can be `0`, `s` should start from `2`. If `p=0`, loop doesn't run, `n_min=0`.\n      If `p=1`, `s=2` gives `1`. `n_min=2`, `p=0`.\n      If `p=3`, `s=3` gives `3`. `n_min=3`, `p=0`.\n      If `p=4`, `s=3` gives `3`. `n_min=3`, `p=1`. Then `s=2` gives `1`. `n_min=3+2=5`, `p=0`.\n   b. `n_min += s`.\n   c. `p -= s * (s - 1) // 2`.\n3. The result is `n_min` and `n_min * (n_min - 1) - 2 * original_p`.\n\nThis greedy algorithm is much faster.\nIn each step, `p` decreases significantly (by `s(s-1)/2`).\nThe number of steps will be logarithmic with respect to `p`.\nSince `s \\approx \\sqrt{2p}`, `p` decreases by `O(p)`. So roughly `O(log p)` steps.\nEach step involves a `sqrt` calculation.\nThis will be very fast. `O(\\log p)` or `O(\\sqrt{p})` if `s` is found iteratively.\n`s_candidate = int((1 + (1 + 8*p)**0.5) / 2)` should be good enough for `s`.\nThen check `s_candidate` and `s_candidate-1`.\n\nLet's test `s = int((1 + (1 + 8*p)**0.5) / 2)`:\n`p=4`: `s = int((1 + (1+32)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 5.74) / 2) = int(3.37) = 3`.\n`3*(3-1)//2 = 3 <= 4`. Correct.\n`p=1`: `s = int((1 + (1+8)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 3) / 2) = 2`.\n`2*(2-1)//2 = 1 <= 1`. Correct.\n`p=200000`: `s = int((1 + (1+1600000)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 1264.91) / 2) = int(632.95) = 632`.\n`632*631//2 = 199396`.\nThis `s` is correct.\n\nSo the greedy approach is:\n1. Store original `p` as `original_p`.\n2. Initialize `n_min = 0`.\n3. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Calculate `s = int((1 + (1 + 8*p)**0.5) / 2)`.\n   b. If `s * (s - 1) // 2 > p`: `s -= 1`. (This might be needed due to float precision or if `p` is exactly `f(s-1)` but `s` rounds up).\n   c. `n_min += s`.\n   d. `p -= s * (s - 1) // 2`.\n4. Calculate `unidirectional_pairs = n_min * (n_min - 1) - 2 * original_p`.\n5. Print `n_min` and `unidirectional_pairs`.\n\nThis approach is `O(\\log p)` due to the `while` loop, and each iteration is `O(1)` with `sqrt`. This is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    original_p = p\n    n_min = 0\n\n    while p > 0:\n        # Find the largest s such that s * (s - 1) // 2 <= p\n        # s^2 - s - 2p <= 0\n        # Roots of s^2 - s - 2p = 0 are (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2\n        # We need the positive root, s_approx = (1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2\n        # s must be an integer, so we take floor of s_approx.\n        s_candidate = int((1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * p)) / 2)\n\n        # Due to floating point precision, s_candidate might be slightly off.\n        # Ensure s_candidate * (s_candidate - 1) // 2 is indeed <= p\n        # And (s_candidate+1) * s_candidate // 2 is > p (if s_candidate is maximal)\n        # We need the largest s.\n        # If s_candidate is too large (e.g. sqrt result rounded up too much), decrement.\n        while s_candidate * (s_candidate - 1) // 2 > p:\n            s_candidate -= 1\n        # If s_candidate is too small (e.g. sqrt result rounded down too much), increment.\n        # This check is technically not needed if s_candidate is derived from floor,\n        # but it makes it robust.\n        while (s_candidate + 1) * s_candidate // 2 <= p:\n            s_candidate += 1\n        \n        # The correct s is s_candidate.\n        # If s_candidate is 0 or 1, s*(s-1)//2 is 0.
