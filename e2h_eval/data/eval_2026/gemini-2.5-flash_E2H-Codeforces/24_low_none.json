She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Strategic Thinking**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face, and I need to come up with an efficient Python script to calculate the minimum time to close some tabs. It's all about minimizing the number of seconds, which translates to the fewest operations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have `n` total tabs, and we start at some cursor position `pos`. The goal is to keep only the tabs within the range `[l, r]` open. This means I need to close everything outside of that range, which could be tabs to the left (`[1, l-1]`) and/or tabs to the right (`[r+1, n]`).\n\nThe available operations are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each operation takes one second. The key is to see that the boundaries of where we can close is determined by a and b; the first and last remaining tab.\n\nA crucial observation is that we're always closing continuous segments of tabs. The operation `[a, i-1]` or `[i+1, b]` means that the 'a' and 'b' refer to the current minimum and maximum *available* tab. So, after closing `[1, i-1]`, the new `a` becomes `i` not `i-1`. This is important for avoiding off-by-one errors.\n\nTo minimize time, I'm thinking about strategies based on the cursor's current position (`pos`) and the target range `[l, r]`. If `pos` is already within `[l, r]`, I have a head start; I only need to consider which tabs to close. The general strategy seems to involve getting the cursor to a suitable position for closing tabs.\n\nSo, I need to figure out the best position (cursor location) and the optimal order to close tabs. Is it better to move the cursor to `l` and close left, move to `r` and close right, or a combination? Should I prioritize closing tabs to the left or right first? Also, I want to minimize cursor movements.\n\nEssentially, I need to figure out if it's more efficient to move the cursor towards `l` and then close to the left, or to move it towards `r` and close to the right. I am thinking, that for the problem to have multiple tests, the order doesn't matter, as long as it is done optimally.\n\nI need to analyze different scenarios and edge cases carefully to make sure my logic is sound. Let's start by considering the position of the cursor and how we close the tabs to the left and right.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each operation (moving cursor, closing tabs) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:** This happens if `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this case, all tabs are within the desired range, so 0 seconds are needed.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r = n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab `i > l`, but `l` is the most efficient target). From `pos`, Luba moves the cursor to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds. Once at `l`, she performs the \"close all tabs to the left\" operation, which takes 1 second.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab `i < r`, but `r` is the most efficient target). From `pos`, Luba moves the cursor to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds. Once at `r`, she performs the \"close all tabs to the right\" operation, which takes 1 second.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Both tabs to the left of `l` and tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    This is the most general case. Luba needs to perform two closing operations: one from `l` (to close `[1, l-1]`) and one from `r` (to close `[r+1, n]`). The order of these operations matters for efficiency.\n\n    *   **Option A: Close left first, then close right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (cursor at `l`): `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (cursor at `r`): `1` second.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n\n    *   **Option B: Close right first, then close left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (cursor at `r`): `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (cursor at `l`): `1` second.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\n    The minimum time for this case is `min(abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r), abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l)) + 2`.\n    Since `abs(l - r)` is the same as `abs(r - l)`, this simplifies to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + abs(l - r) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations into a concise logic:\n\n*   If `l == 1` and `r == n`: `0` seconds.\n*   If `l == 1` (only close right side): `abs(pos - r) + 1` seconds.\n*   If `r == n` (only close left side): `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n*   If `l > 1` and `r < n` (close both sides):\n    Calculate time to close left: `abs(pos - l) + 1` (move to `l`, close left).\n    Then move to `r` and close right: `abs(l - r) + 1`.\n    Total: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n    Calculate time to close right: `abs(pos - r) + 1` (move to `r`, close right).\n    Then move to `l` and close left: `abs(r - l) + 1`.\n    Total: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n    The minimum of these two paths is the answer.\n\nLet's implement this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed (r is already n)\n    if l > 1 and r == n:\n        # Move to l, then close left\n        time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed (l is already 1)\n    if l == 1 and r < n:\n        # Move to r, then close right\n        time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 4: Both left and right sides need to be closed (l > 1 and r < n)\n    # Option A: Close left first, then close right\n    # Move pos -> l (abs(pos - l)), close left (1), move l -> r (abs(l - r)), close right (1)\n    time_option_A = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    # Option B: Close right first, then close left\n    # Move pos -> r (abs(pos - r)), close right (1), move r -> l (abs(r - l)), close left (1)\n    time_option_B = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n    \n    print(min(time_option_A, time_option_B))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
