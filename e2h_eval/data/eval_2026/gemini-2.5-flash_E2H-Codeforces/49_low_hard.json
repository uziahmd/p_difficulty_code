They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Mushroom Strife Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Mushroom Strife\" problem.  The goal is to figure out the number of mushrooms on each lawn, given the relationships between them along the roads. We know the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts for each connected pair of lawns.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the fundamentals. We're dealing with `n` lawns and `m` roads. Each lawn has a certain number of mushrooms.  For each road connecting lawns `u` and `v`, the problem gives me the `GCD` and `LCM` of `mushrooms[u]` and `mushrooms[v]`.  Crucially, all the mushroom counts are between 1 and 10^6.\n\nAlright, the core math here is that the product of two numbers (`a` and `b`) is equal to the product of their GCD and LCM: `a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)`. I can use this to my advantage.\n\nLet's say the GCD of `mushrooms[u]` and `mushrooms[v]` is `g_uv`, and the LCM is `l_uv`.  Then:\n\n1.  `mushrooms[u] * mushrooms[v] = g_uv * l_uv`.\n2.  Both `mushrooms[u]` and `mushrooms[v]` must be multiples of `g_uv`.\n3.  The LCM, `l_uv`, must also be a multiple of `g_uv`. If this isn't true, there's no possible solution, and I can just output \"NO\".\n4.  I can express the mushroom counts as multiples of the GCD: `mushrooms[u] = g_uv * x` and `mushrooms[v] = g_uv * y`.\n5.  This means that `x * y = l_uv / g_uv`.\n6.  Critically, the GCD of `x` and `y` must be 1.  This is a very important condition.\n\nNow, I need to consider the constraints. The mushroom counts are limited to a maximum of 10^6. The GCD and LCM values are also bounded by 10^6.  If `g_uv * l_uv` exceeds (10^6)^2, that's not necessarily a problem, as long as the mushroom values don't individually become too large. A key observation is that if I have something like `g=1` and `l=10^6`, I can have one value be 1, and the other be 10^6, which is a valid solution.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll check is the divisibility of the LCM by the GCD. Then, it's about systematically finding suitable values for `x` and `y` that satisfy the GCD condition. Then, I need to check these values against the global constraints. From here, I will see how to apply this logic globally across all connected lawns, likely employing graph traversal methods, to determine a consistent solution or determine it is impossible.\n",
