The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Navigating a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, here's the deal. I'm tackling a problem: picking a subset of districts from a tree-like structure to maximize fan support, where the support for district *i* is a hefty `2^i`. The catch? We've got to ensure the chosen districts remain connected after removing some others.\n\nMy initial thought is that since `2^i` grows so fast, keeping districts with higher indices is the key.  Like, `2^100` dwarfs the sum of all lower powers of 2.  So, I should prioritize districts `n`, `n-1`, and so on.\n\nThe challenge? They've gotta stick together.  I'm envisioning removing districts and the remaining `n-k` ones must form one coherent group. The real complexity lies in this connectivity condition.\n\nI tried a greedy approach: removing districts with smaller indices. But I realized that this approach falls short when a small-index district is crucial for connecting large-index ones.\n\nMy mind is now focused on finding `m=n-k` districts that maximizes their sum of the power of 2. I need to remove `k` nodes, so that the remaining graph is connected. I should keep `n`, `n-1`, etc. However, if this set is disconnected, what should I do?\n\nI've been trying to find a balance between removing the smallest districts and keeping the largest ones connected. It's like a tug-of-war, with connectivity being the rope. It seems as if I need to find the `m` node subgraph that is connected and the sum of its node is the maximum.\n\nI have come to a conclusion. This is equivalent to finding a cut set. The solution has to remove nodes such that the remining ones form a connected component. This translates to the minimum removal set for the desired connectivity.\n\nThe algorithm needs to start considering all of the nodes in reverse order and keep adding it if it will not disconnect the current `n-k` node.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `m = n - k` districts to participate in The Number Games such that:\n1. The selected `m` districts form a connected component in the original graph.\n2. The total number of fans, `sum(2^i)` for selected districts `i`, is maximized.\n\nThe graph is a tree. The fan count `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`. This means that to maximize the sum, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, `2^X > sum(2^j for j < X)`. This implies that the optimal strategy is to keep the largest possible indices, and only compromise by removing a large-indexed district if it's absolutely necessary to maintain connectivity with other large-indexed districts, and replacing it with a smaller-indexed district that enables this connectivity.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `m` with maximum total weight. For trees, and with weights like `2^i`, a greedy approach often works. We want to remove `k` districts such that the sum of `2^i` for removed districts is minimized. This means we should try to remove districts with the smallest possible indices.\n\nLet's try a greedy strategy based on removing the smallest indexed nodes:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. We iterate through nodes `i = 1, 2, ..., n`. For each `i`, we decide whether to remove it or keep it. We prefer to remove `i` because it has a small index, which minimizes the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes. However, we must ensure that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\n\nConsider the nodes in increasing order `1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe maintain a set of nodes `kept_nodes` that are currently considered part of the final connected component. Initially, all nodes are candidates.\nWhen we consider node `i`:\n1. If we have already removed `k` nodes, then `i` *must* be kept.\n2. If we still need to remove nodes (`removed_count < k`):\n   Can we remove `i`? We can remove `i` if doing so doesn't prevent the remaining `n - removed_count - 1` nodes from forming a single connected component of size `n-k`. This is the tricky part.\n\nA more robust greedy approach for \"maximum weight connected subgraph of fixed size `m` in a tree\" often involves a priority queue and a specific way of handling connectivity.\nLet `m = n - k` be the number of districts we want to keep.\nWe want to keep the `m` districts with the largest possible indices such that they form a connected component.\n\nLet's maintain the set of nodes that are currently `kept`.\nInitialize `kept_nodes = set()`.\nInitialize `removed_nodes = []`.\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  If `len(kept_nodes) == m`:\n    `i` must be removed. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n  Else (`len(kept_nodes) < m`):\n    We want to keep `i`. Add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n    Now, we need to ensure that `kept_nodes` (which now includes `i`) can still form a connected component of size `m`.\n    This means that if adding `i` causes `kept_nodes` to become \"too disconnected\" from the rest of the potential component, we might have to revert this decision, or choose `i` as the root of a new component.\n\nThis problem has a standard solution pattern for trees involving removing nodes with minimum \"cost\" while maintaining connectivity.\nThe strategy is to find the set of `k` nodes to remove that minimizes `sum(2^i)`. This means we want to remove nodes with small indices.\nWe can use a \"peeling\" process. Start with all `n` nodes. Iterate through nodes `i = 1, 2, ..., n`. For each `i`, if `i` is a \"leaf\" in the current graph of kept nodes (i.e., it has only one neighbor in the current graph), and we still need to remove nodes, we can remove `i`. When `i` is removed, its neighbor's degree decreases. This might make the neighbor a leaf, and so on.\n\nLet's refine this:\n1. Initialize `removed_count = 0` and `removed_list = []`.\n2. Initialize `current_degree[u]` for all `u` as its degree in the original tree.\n3. Initialize `active_nodes = n`. This is the number of nodes currently considered 'kept'.\n4. Create a min-priority queue `pq` to store nodes that are candidates for removal. A node `u` is a candidate if it can be removed without disconnecting the current graph *too much*. Specifically, if `u` has `current_degree[u] == 1` (it's a leaf in the current graph of active nodes), then removing it only reduces the size of the component, it doesn't split it.\n5. Add all leaf nodes (nodes with `current_degree[u] == 1`) to `pq`. The priority should be their index `u`.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Read `n, k` and build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Compute initial degrees `degree[u]` for all `u`.\n3. Initialize `is_removed[u] = False` for all `u`.\n4. Initialize `pq = []` (using `heapq` in Python for min-heap).\n5. For `u = 1` to `n`:\n   If `degree[u] == 1`:\n     `heapq.heappush(pq, u)`\n6. `removed_count = 0`.\n7. `removed_nodes_output = []`.\n\n8. While `removed_count < k` and `pq` is not empty:\n   `u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n   If `is_removed[u]` is already `True`, continue (this can happen if a neighbor was removed and then `u` was added to `pq` again).\n   \n   If `n - removed_count > n - k`: (i.e., `active_nodes > m`)\n     // We can remove `u` because we still have more than `m` active nodes.\n     // Removing `u` (a leaf) will not disconnect the graph of active nodes.\n     `is_removed[u] = True`\n     `removed_count += 1`\n     `removed_nodes_output.append(u)`\n\n     // Update degrees of neighbors\n     For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n       If `not is_removed[v]`:\n         `degree[v] -= 1`\n         If `degree[v] == 1`:\n           `heapq.heappush(pq, v)`\n   Else:\n     // If `n - removed_count == n - k`, we have exactly `m` active nodes.\n     // We cannot remove `u` because that would make the component size `m-1`, which is too small.\n     // Since `u` is the smallest available leaf, we must keep it.\n     // All remaining nodes in `pq` (which are larger than `u`) also cannot be removed.\n     // So we break. The current `removed_nodes_output` is the answer.\n     break\n\n9. Sort `removed_nodes_output` and print.\n\nLet's trace the sample: `n=6, k=3`. `m = 3`.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`.\nAdjacency list and initial degrees:\n`adj[1] = [2]`, `deg[1] = 1`\n`adj[2] = [1,4,3,6]`, `deg[2] = 4`\n`adj[3] = [2]`, `deg[3] = 1`\n`adj[4] = [2]`, `deg[4] = 1`\n`adj[5] = [6]`, `deg[5] = 1`\n`adj[6] = [2,5]`, `deg[6] = 2`\n\n1. Initialize `is_removed = [F,F,F,F,F,F]`. `removed_count = 0`. `removed_nodes_output = []`.\n2. `pq = []`. Add leaves: `1, 3, 4, 5`.\n   `pq = [1, 3, 4, 5]` (min-heap order).\n\nLoop: `removed_count < 3` and `pq` not empty.\n- `u = heapq.heappop(pq)` -> `u = 1`.\n  `active_nodes = 6`. `m = 3`. `6 - 0 > 3`. Yes.\n  `is_removed[1] = T`. `removed_count = 1`. `removed_nodes_output = [1]`.\n  Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n  `deg[2] -= 1` -> `deg[2] = 3`. Not a leaf.\n\n- `u = heapq.heappop(pq)` -> `u = 3`.\n  `active_nodes = 5`. `m = 3`. `6 - 1 > 3`. Yes.\n  `is_removed[3] = T`. `removed_count = 2`. `removed_nodes_output = [1, 3]`.\n  Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n  `deg[2] -= 1` -> `deg[2] = 2`. Not a leaf.\n\n- `u = heapq.heappop(pq)` -> `u = 4`.\n  `active_nodes = 4`. `m = 3`. `6 - 2 > 3`. Yes.\n  `is_removed[4] = T`. `removed_count = 3`. `removed_nodes_output = [1, 3, 4]`.\n  Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n  `deg[2] -= 1` -> `deg[2] = 1`. **Now `2` is a leaf!**\n  `heapq.heappush(pq, 2)`. `pq = [2, 5]` (assuming `5` was next).\n\nLoop condition: `removed_count = 3`. So `removed_count < k` is `False`. Loop terminates.\n\nFinal `removed_nodes_output = [1, 3, 4]`. Sorted: `1 3 4`. This matches the sample output.\n\nThis greedy algorithm works because removing a leaf node `u` from a tree (or a connected subgraph) always results in a connected graph. By always choosing the leaf with the smallest index, we ensure that we minimize the sum `sum(2^i)` for removed nodes. We continue this process until `k` nodes are removed OR until all remaining nodes have degree greater than 1, and we have exactly `m` nodes left. If we have exactly `m` nodes left and they are not all leaves, then they must form a path or a structure where internal nodes have degree > 1. In this case, we cannot remove any more nodes without disconnecting the graph or making its size less than `m`.\n\nComplexity:\n- Building adjacency list and initial degrees: `O(N + M)` where `M = N-1` is number of edges. So `O(N)`.\n- Initializing priority queue: `O(N log N)` in worst case (if many leaves).\n- Main loop: Each node is pushed to `pq` at most once, and popped at most once. Each edge is visited at most twice (when its endpoints are processed).\n  `heapq.heappop` is `O(log N)`. `heapq.heappush` is `O(log N)`.\n  Total time complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible.\n\nFinal check on `n - removed_count > n - k`:\nThis condition is equivalent to `removed_count < k`.\nIf `removed_count < k`, we need to remove more nodes. `u` is a leaf. Removing `u` keeps the remaining graph connected, and reduces the number of active nodes by 1. Since we still need to remove more nodes, `u` is a good candidate.\nIf `removed_count == k`, we have reached the target number of removed nodes. We must stop.\nThe `while` condition `removed_count < k` already covers this.\nThe loop terminates when `removed_count == k` or `pq` is empty.\nIf `pq` becomes empty before `removed_count == k`, it means all remaining nodes have degree `> 1`. This implies the remaining subgraph is a single connected component (a cycle or more complex structure, but in a tree, it must be a single path or a single node, or a star graph if the center has degree > 1). If all remaining nodes have degree `> 1`, and it's a connected component, then we can't remove any more nodes without disconnecting it or reducing its size. But this can only happen if `n - removed_count <= n-k`, which means `removed_count >= k`.\nSo, the loop will always run until `removed_count == k`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degree[u] += 1\n        degree[v] += 1\n\n    # Special case for n=1 (though k < n guarantees n >= 2)\n    # If n-k = 1, we need to keep only one node.
