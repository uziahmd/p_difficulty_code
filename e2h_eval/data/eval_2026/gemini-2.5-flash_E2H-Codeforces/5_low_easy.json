Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem, and the goal is clear: maximize compatible left-right boot pairs and output them. The compatibility rules seem straightforward enough: identical colors match, and '?' is a wildcard. The challenge is in finding the *maximum* number of pairs efficiently.\n\nInitially, I considered a maximum bipartite matching approach, but with `n` potentially up to 150,000, that's going to be too slow.  I need a greedy algorithm. I think I can make a good algorithm here.\n\nThe key is realizing that not all matches are created equal. Matching identical specific colors is the most constrained option. 'a' left only wants 'a' right, or a '?'. My strategy needs to prioritize those specific, restrictive pairings. I need to get those done first, as it could prevent a more optimal final result.\n\nThe core idea is to categorize the boots based on their color. I can use lists or queues, or maybe a dictionary, to store the indices of boots for each color. Something like `left_boots['a']` will hold all the indices of left boots that are color 'a'.  I'll also need separate lists for the '?' boots, `left_q_boots` and `right_q_boots`.\n\nSo, the first step is populating these data structures, taking care to handle the '?' characters. Then I can iterate through the colors, matching the specific colors.\nAfter that, I have to figure out how to match the remaining '?' boots.\nThis approach will ensure I get the maximum number of matches.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs and list them. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with colors represented by characters in strings `l` and `r`. A lowercase letter denotes a specific color, while '?' denotes an indefinite color.\n\nCompatibility rules:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite) (e.g., '?', 'z'; 'a', '?'; '?', '?').\n3. Two different specific colors are not compatible (e.g., 'f', 'g').\n\nWe need to output the count of pairs and the 1-based indices of the boots in each pair.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe key idea is to use a greedy approach. We should prioritize matches that are most restrictive, as these boots have fewer options. '?' boots are the most flexible, as they can match anything. Specific-colored boots are less flexible. A specific-colored boot matching another specific-colored boot of the same color is the most restrictive type of match.\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** First, we'll store the indices of boots categorized by their color. Since there are 26 lowercase letters, we can use lists (or deques for efficient popping) for each color. We'll also have separate lists for '?' boots.\n    *   `left_boots[char]` will store 1-based indices of left boots with color `char`.\n    *   `right_boots[char]` will store 1-based indices of right boots with color `char`.\n    *   `left_q` will store 1-based indices of left boots with color '?'.\n    *   `right_q` will store 1-based indices of right boots with color '?'.\n\n    Example: `left_boots = { 'a': [idx1, idx2], 'b': [idx3], ... }`\n\n2.  **Prioritize Exact Specific Matches:** Iterate through all possible specific colors ('a' through 'z'). For each color `c`:\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        *   Take one left boot `L_idx` from `left_boots[c]` and one right boot `R_idx` from `right_boots[c]`.\n        *   Form a pair `(L_idx, R_idx)` and add it to our results.\n    This step maximizes the use of specific-to-specific matches, which are the most constrained.\n\n3.  **Match Remaining Specific Left Boots with '?' Right Boots:** After step 2, any remaining specific left boots (`left_boots[c]`) could not find an exact match. These can now be matched with '?' right boots.\n    *   Iterate through all specific colors `c` again.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available '?' right boots (`right_q`):\n        *   Take one left boot `L_idx` from `left_boots[c]` and one right boot `R_idx` from `right_q`.\n        *   Form a pair `(L_idx, R_idx)` and add it to our results.\n\n4.  **Match Remaining Specific Right Boots with '?' Left Boots:** Similarly, any remaining specific right boots (`right_boots[c]`) could not find an exact match. These can now be matched with '?' left boots.\n    *   Iterate through all specific colors `c` again.\n    *   While there are available right boots of color `c` AND available '?' left boots (`left_q`):\n        *   Take one right boot `R_idx` from `right_boots[c]` and one left boot `L_idx` from `left_q`.\n        *   Form a pair `(L_idx, R_idx)` and add it to our results.\n\n5.  **Match Remaining '?' Boots:** Finally, any remaining '?' left boots (`left_q`) can be matched with any remaining '?' right boots (`right_q`).\n    *   While there are available '?' left boots (`left_q`) AND available '?' right boots (`right_q`):\n        *   Take one left boot `L_idx` from `left_q` and one right boot `R_idx` from `right_q`.\n        *   Form a pair `(L_idx, R_idx)` and add it to our results.\n\n**Correctness of Greedy Strategy:**\nThe greedy strategy works because:\n*   Exact matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a') are the most restrictive. If we don't make these matches, the specific-colored boots might not find any other suitable partner (unless it's a '?'). A '?' boot, however, can always find another '?' boot or any specific color. By matching exact specific colors first, we don't \"waste\" a '?' boot on a specific color when that specific color could have found its exact match.\n*   Matching specific colors with '?' boots (steps 3 and 4) is the next best option for the specific-colored boots that couldn't find an exact match. Again, we use the '?' boots for these more constrained boots first.\n*   Finally, matching '?' with '?' is the least restrictive and is done last, using up any remaining flexible boots.\n\nThis order ensures that boots with fewer matching options are prioritized, maximizing the total number of pairs.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nUsing `collections.defaultdict(list)` for `left_boots` and `right_boots` and `list` for `left_q` and `right_q` is suitable. We can use `pop()` to take boots from the end of the lists, which is an O(1) operation.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 10`\n`l = \"codeforces\"`\n`r = \"dodivthree\"`\n\n1.  **Populate lists:**\n    `left_boots = {'c': [1], 'o': [2], 'd': [3], 'e': [4, 7], 'f': [5], 'r': [6], 's': [8]}` (indices 1-based)\n    `right_boots = {'d': [1, 4], 'o': [2], 'i': [3], 'v': [5], 't': [6], 'h': [7], 'r': [8], 'e': [9]}`\n    `left_q = []`, `right_q = []`\n\n2.  **Exact Specific Matches:**\n    *   'c': `left_boots['c']` has [1], `right_boots['c']` is empty. No match.\n    *   'd': `left_boots['d']` has [3], `right_boots['d']` has [1, 4].\n        *   Pair (3, 1). `left_boots['d']` becomes [], `right_boots['d']` becomes [4].\n    *   'e': `left_boots['e']` has [4, 7], `right_boots['e']` has [9].\n        *   Pair (4, 9). `left_boots['e']` becomes [7], `right_boots['e']` becomes [].\n    *   'o': `left_boots['o']` has [2], `right_boots['o']` has [2].\n        *   Pair (2, 2). `left_boots['o']` becomes [], `right_boots['o']` becomes [].\n    *   'r': `left_boots['r']` has [6], `right_boots['r']` has [8].\n        *   Pair (6, 8). `left_boots['r']` becomes [], `right_boots['r']` becomes [].\n    *   's': `left_boots['s']` has [8], `right_boots['s']` is empty. No match.\n    *   ... (other letters have no boots or only one side)\n\n    Current pairs: `[(3, 1), (4, 9), (2, 2), (6, 8)]`\n\n3.  **Specific Left with '?' Right:** `right_q` is empty. No new pairs.\n\n4.  **Specific Right with '?' Left:** `left_q` is empty. No new pairs.\n\n5.  **'?' with '?':** `left_q` and `right_q` are empty. No new pairs.\n\nTotal pairs: 4. The example output is 5. What did I miss?\n\nAh, the example output is `5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1`.\nMy strategy:\n`(3, 1)` (d, d)\n`(4, 9)` (e, e)\n`(2, 2)` (o, o)\n`(6, 8)` (r, r)\n\nExample output pairs:\n`(7, 8)`: `l[6]` is 'e', `r[7]` is 'h'. Not compatible.\nThis means the example output is for a different input, or I misunderstood the example's output.\nLet's re-check the example input for the first case:\n`10`\n`codeforces`\n`dodivthree`\n\n`l = \"codeforces\"`\n`r = \"dodivthree\"`\n\n`l_idx`: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n`l_char`: c o d e f o r c e s\n\n`r_idx`: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n`r_char`: d o d i v t h r e e\n\nMy parsing of `l` and `r` was off for the example. Let's re-parse for the example.\n`l_idx`: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n`l_char`: c o d e f o r c e s\n`l`: `c` (1), `o` (2), `d` (3), `e` (4), `f` (5), `o` (6), `r` (7), `c` (8), `e` (9), `s` (10)\n\n`r_idx`: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n`r_char`: d o d i v t h r e e\n`r`: `d` (1), `o` (2), `d` (3), `i` (4), `v` (5), `t` (6), `h` (7), `r` (8), `e` (9), `e` (10)\n\nCorrected populated lists:\n`left_boots = {'c': [1, 8], 'o': [2, 6], 'd': [3], 'e': [4, 9], 'f': [5], 'r': [7], 's': [10]}`\n`right_boots = {'d': [1, 3], 'o': [2], 'i': [4], 'v': [5], 't': [6], 'h': [7], 'r': [8], 'e': [9, 10]}`\n`left_q = []`, `right_q = []`\n\nNow, apply the greedy strategy again:\n2.  **Exact Specific Matches:**\n    *   'c': `left_boots['c']` has [1, 8], `right_boots['c']` is empty. No match.\n    *   'd': `left_boots['d']` has [3], `right_boots['d']` has [1, 3].\n        *   Pair (3, 1). `left_boots['d']` becomes [], `right_boots['d']` becomes [3].\n    *   'e': `left_boots['e']` has [4, 9], `right_boots['e']` has [9, 10].\n        *   Pair (4, 9). `left_boots['e']` becomes [9], `right_boots['e']` becomes [10].\n        *   Pair (9, 10). `left_boots['e']` becomes [], `right_boots['e']` becomes [].\n    *   'o': `left_boots['o']` has [2, 6], `right_boots['o']` has [2].\n        *   Pair (2, 2). `left_boots['o']` becomes [6], `right_boots['o']` becomes [].\n    *   'r': `left_boots['r']` has [7], `right_boots['r']` has [8].\n        *   Pair (7, 8). `left_boots['r']` becomes [], `right_boots['r']` becomes [].\n\n    Current pairs: `[(3, 1), (4, 9), (9, 10), (2, 2), (7, 8)]` (Total 5 pairs)\n    This matches the example output's pairs! The order might differ, but the set of pairs is the same.\n\nThis confirms the greedy strategy is correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices of boots\n    # Use defaultdict(list) for specific colors, and lists for '?'\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        \n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
