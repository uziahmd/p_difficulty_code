    "thought": "**The Golden Plate Problem: A Deep Dive into Optimized Solution**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Golden Plate\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script that efficiently calculates the total gilded cells. The input consists of plate dimensions (`w`, `h`) and the number of rings (`k`). My expert intuition tells me to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a ring. It's essentially a border of width 1 around an inner rectangle. The key is that the rings are concentric; the `i`-th ring sits on a rectangle of `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This is great because it means there's no overlap between the rings, allowing for a sum-of-parts approach. I'll need a way to find the dimensions for these inner rectangles.\n\nThe critical observation here is to create a function to find the number of cells for each ring. The dimensions of the inner rectangle are `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. A formula like `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` would work. It's the standard perimeter formula, adjusted for the fact that we're dealing with a rectangle border. However, there's a constraint to check. I need to make sure this formula is valid, especially for small dimensions. \n\nIt seems the problem statement suggests that the minimum dimensions of each inner rectangle will be greater than or equal to 3. I spent some time checking all the formulas and derivations and found the formula for number of cells, `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` can be used.\n\nThe constraint `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)` guarantees that `W_i` and `H_i` are always going to be at least 3. This means it is valid to use the perimeter formula, even for a \"border.\"\n\nNow, to the algorithm:\n1.  Initialize `total_gilded_cells` to 0.\n2.  Iterate `i` from 1 to `k`.\n3.  In each iteration:\n    *   Calculate `W_i` and `H_i`.\n    *   Calculate `cells_in_ring_i = 2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`.\n    *   Add `cells_in_ring_i` to the running total.\n4.  Finally, print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\nWith this in mind, the implementation details are straightforward. I'll read `w`, `h`, and `k` from input, run a loop, perform the calculations, and print the results. I need to use the `sys` import to quickly read the input.\n\nTo test the logic, I tried a few examples. The results were accurate, which gave me confidence in my solution. The code has also been double-checked to work for all edge cases. The final script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n\n        cells_in_this_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_this_ring\n    \n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis should be a clean, efficient, and correct solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nEach ring `i` (1-indexed) is defined on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. The ring itself consists of all bordering cells of this inner rectangle and has a width of 1 cell. Since each ring is defined on a progressively smaller inner rectangle, they do not overlap. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cells for each ring individually and sum them up.\n\nLet `W_i` and `H_i` be the effective width and height for the `i`-th ring.\n`W_i = w - 4 * (i - 1)`\n`H_i = h - 4 * (i - 1)`\n\nThe number of cells in the border of a rectangle with dimensions `W_i x H_i` (where the border has a width of 1 cell) can be calculated using the formula: `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corner cells being counted twice (once for width, once for height) and subtracting them once.\n\nLet's verify the validity of this formula given the problem constraints:\nThe constraints state `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.\nLet `m = min(w, h)`. So, `k <= (m + 1) / 4`, which implies `4k <= m + 1`.\nWe are interested in the smallest dimensions, which occur for the `k`-th ring: `W_k = w - 4(k-1)` and `H_k = h - 4(k-1)`.\nThe minimum of these dimensions is `m - 4(k-1)`.\nFrom `4k <= m + 1`, we can write `4k - 4 <= m + 1 - 4`, so `4(k-1) <= m - 3`.\nThis implies `m - 4(k-1) >= m - (m - 3) = 3`.\nTherefore, for any ring `i` from 1 to `k`, both `W_i` and `H_i` will always be at least 3. This guarantees that the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` is always valid for calculating the border cells.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize a variable `total_gilded_cells` to 0.\n2. Loop `i` from 1 to `k` (inclusive).\n3. In each iteration:\n    a. Calculate `offset = 4 * (i - 1)`.\n    b. Calculate `current_w = w - offset`.\n    c. Calculate `current_h = h - offset`.\n    d. Calculate `cells_in_this_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n    e. Add `cells_in_this_ring` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n4. After the loop finishes, print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (7, 9, 2):**\n`w = 7`, `h = 9`, `k = 2`\n\n*   **For i = 1 (first ring):**\n    *   `offset = 4 * (1 - 1) = 0`\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 0 = 9`\n    *   `cells_in_this_ring = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28`\n\n*   **For i = 2 (second ring):**\n    *   `offset = 4 * (2 - 1) = 4`\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 = 5`\n    *   `cells_in_this_ring = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n\nThe loop finishes. The final `total_gilded_cells` is 40.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and split it into three parts\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert the string parts to integers\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    # Initialize a variable to accumulate the total number of gilded cells\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Loop through each ring from 1 to k\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        # Calculate the offset for the current ring.\n        # The i-th ring's rectangle dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n        # For i=1, offset is 0.
