    "thought": "**The Approach to Minimizing Array Instability**\n\nI started with the goal of tackling a competitive programming problem where the objective is to reduce the instability of an array after removing a single element. Instability, in this context, is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\nMy initial approach involved considering a sorted version of the array to simplify the analysis. Let's denote the sorted array as `a_sorted`, where elements are ordered from smallest to largest. I knew I needed to eliminate one element to obtain a new array, `a'`, and then calculate the instability of `a'`. To minimize the instability, I needed to keep the maximum of `a'` as small as possible and the minimum as large as possible.\n\nI realized that if I remove an element, the minimum value in `a'` can either be the original smallest, except when I remove the smallest element, and the maximum will be the original maximum unless I remove the largest element. I therefore identified three possible scenarios. Removing any element other than the smallest or largest in the sorted array will always yield an instability greater than, or at worst equal to, the cases where either the smallest or largest element is removed.\n\nAfter careful examination of these different cases, it became clear that I only needed to consider two scenarios: (1) removing the smallest element, which makes the new minimum the second smallest element; and (2) removing the largest element, making the new maximum the second largest element. I mathematically proved that removing any other element would never provide a better result.\n\nTherefore, the key insight here is that minimizing the instability boils down to finding the minimum value between the instability obtained by removing the smallest element and the instability resulting from removing the largest element. The math showed that removing any other element gives a larger, or at most, equal instability.\n\nI meticulously tested my logic with the given examples, including the edge cases. I confirmed that removing the smallest or largest number in the array produces the minimum possible instability, as removing elements in the middle would result in worse instability. I then structured my thinking into an algorithm that reads the input array, sorts it, and calculates the two possible instabilities as calculated above. The function takes the minimum of these two values as the solution.\n\nFinally, I checked my approach against potential edge cases and constraints to ensure it handles all situations correctly and would be efficient given time and space limitations of competitive programming. I also paid attention to the standard methods for reading input in a competitive programming setup, using techniques like `sys.stdin.readline()` and `list(map(int, ...))` for efficient processing of potentially large input data. This ensures that the algorithm will be practical to use and will perform quickly, as the problem set will demand.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from a given array `a` of `n` integers such that the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements is minimized. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nLet the given array be `a`. To minimize `max(a') - min(a')` for the resulting array `a'`, we should try to make `max(a')` as small as possible and `min(a')` as large as possible.\n\nConsider sorting the array `a` in non-decreasing order. Let the sorted array be `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n`, where `s_1 \\le s_2 \\le \\dots \\le s_n`.\nThe original instability of the array `a` is `s_n - s_1`.\n\nWhen we remove an element, there are three general cases for which element is removed:\n\n1.  **Remove the smallest element (`s_1`):**\n    The remaining elements are `s_2, s_3, \\dots, s_n`.\n    The minimum of this new array is `s_2`.\n    The maximum of this new array is `s_n`.\n    The instability in this case is `s_n - s_2`.\n\n2.  **Remove the largest element (`s_n`):**\n    The remaining elements are `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{n-1}$.\n    The minimum of this new array is `s_1`.\n    The maximum of this new array is `s_{n-1}$.\n    The instability in this case is `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n\n3.  **Remove any element `s_k` where `1 < k < n` (an element from the middle):**\n    The remaining elements will still include `s_1` (the original smallest) and `s_n` (the original largest), because neither of them was removed.\n    The minimum of this new array is `s_1`.\n    The maximum of this new array is `s_n`.\n    The instability in this case is `s_n - s_1`.\n\nComparing these three cases:\nSince `s_1 \\le s_2` and `s_{n-1} \\le s_n`, it follows that:\n- `s_n - s_2 \\le s_n - s_1`\n- `s_{n-1} - s_1 \\le s_n - s_1`\n\nThis means that removing an element from the middle (Case 3) will always result in an instability value that is greater than or equal to the instability values from Case 1 and Case 2. Therefore, to minimize the instability, we only need to consider removing either the smallest element or the largest element.\n\nThe minimum possible instability will be `min(s_n - s_2, s_{n-1} - s_1)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`.\n2.  Read the `n` integers into an array `a`.\n3.  Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order.\n4.  Calculate the instability if the smallest element is removed: `a[n-1] - a[1]` (using 0-based indexing, `a[0]` is `s_1`, `a[1]` is `s_2`, `a[n-1]` is `s_n`).\n5.  Calculate the instability if the largest element is removed: `a[n-2] - a[0]` (using 0-based indexing, `a[n-2]` is `s_{n-1}`).\n6.  The minimum of these two values is the answer.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`**\n1.  `n = 4`\n2.  `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n3.  Sorted `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n4.  Remove smallest (`a[0]=1`): Remaining array `[3, 3, 7]`. Instability `7 - 3 = 4`. (Formula: `a[3] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4`)\n5.  Remove largest (`a[3]=7`): Remaining array `[1, 3, 3]`. Instability `3 - 1 = 2`. (Formula: `a[2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`)\n6.  Minimum of `(4, 2)` is `2`.\n\n**Example 2: `a = [1, 100000]`**\n1.  `n = 2`\n2.  `a = [1, 100000]`\n3.  Sorted `a = [1, 100000]`\n4.  Remove smallest (`a[0]=1`): Remaining array `[100000]`. Instability `100000 - 100000 = 0`. (Formula: `a[1] - a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0`)\n5.  Remove largest (`a[1]=100000`): Remaining array `[1]`. Instability `1 - 1 = 0`. (Formula: `a[0] - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`)\n6.  Minimum of `(0, 0)` is `0`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(N log N)` due to sorting, which is efficient enough for `N` up to `10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the number of elements\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Read the array elements and convert them to integers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array to easily find the smallest, second smallest,\n    # second largest, and largest elements.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Calculate instability if the smallest element (a[0]) is removed.\n    # The remaining array's minimum will be a[1] and maximum will be a[n-1].\n    instability_remove_smallest = a[n - 1] - a[1]\n\n    # Calculate instability if the largest element (a[n-1]) is removed.\n    # The remaining array's minimum will be a[0] and maximum will be a[n-2].\n    instability_remove_largest = a[n - 2] - a[0]\n\n    # The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two values.\n    print(min(instability_remove_smallest, instability_remove_largest))\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
