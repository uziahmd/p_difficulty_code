He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this \"A Trivial Problem\" challenge.  The goal is to find how many positive integers, *n*, result in *n!* having exactly *m* trailing zeroes.  It's a classic problem and I need to output the count of such *n* values and the values themselves, in ascending order.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out the trailing zeroes.  It's all about finding the factors of 10 in *n!*. Since 10 is 2*5, I need to count the pairs of 2 and 5. The number of 2's will always outnumber the 5's, so the limiting factor is the number of 5's.  Legendre's Formula will get me there: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`, going on as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to *n*.\n\nNow, the interesting part.  `Z(n)` is *non-decreasing*. As *n* goes up, `Z(n)` either stays the same or goes up. It only jumps when *n* is a multiple of 5.  I need to pay close attention to how it increases.  For example, if *n* is 24, I could have, say, 4 zeroes; then if *n* is 25, I will then have, say, 6 zeroes.  There is no *n* for which I have exactly 5 zeroes.\n\n`Z(n)` doesn't necessarily take on all integer values, it can 'skip'.  If `Z(n)` equals *X*, `Z(n+1)` through `Z(n+4)` will equal *X* as well, unless we hit a multiple of 5.  When we hit a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. If *n* is a multiple of 5 but not 25, the increase is by 1. If it's a multiple of 25 but not 125, the increase is by 2, and so on. Generalizing, when *n* is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, `Z(n)` increases by *k* compared to its previous value. This means I can get jumps larger than 1!  I'll need to account for those 'gaps' when searching.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum counts the total number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`.\n\nThe function `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\nFor example:\n`Z(1) = ... = Z(4) = 0`\n`Z(5) = ... = Z(9) = 1`\n`Z(10) = ... = Z(14) = 2`\n`Z(15) = ... = Z(19) = 3`\n`Z(20) = ... = Z(24) = 4`\n`Z(25) = ... = Z(29) = 6` (Note the jump from 4 to 6, skipping 5)\n\nThis observation is key: `Z(n)` does not necessarily take on all integer values. If `Z(n)` happens to be equal to `m`, then `Z(n+1)`, `Z(n+2)`, `Z(n+3)`, `Z(n+4)` will also be `m`, provided that `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5. If `n` is the smallest integer such that `Z(n)=m`, then the next integers `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` will also have `Z(k)=m`. The value of `Z(k)` will change only when `k` becomes a multiple of 5. So, if `Z(n)=m`, then `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are the *only* possible values of `k` such that `Z(k)=m`.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n1. Find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\n2. If no such `n` exists (i.e., `m` is a value that `Z(n)` skips), then there are 0 solutions.\n3. If such an `n` exists, then the solutions are `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. We print these 5 values.\n\nHow to find the smallest `n` for a given `m`?\nSince `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\nThe maximum value for `m` is 100,000.\nIf `m = 100,000`, `Z(n) approx n/4`. So `n` would be roughly `4 * 100,000 = 400,000`.\nA safe upper bound for binary search would be `5 * m` or `500,000`. Let's use `500,000`.\n\nThe binary search will find the smallest `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) >= m`.\nAfter finding `n_0`:\n- Calculate `Z(n_0)`. If `Z(n_0) == m`, then `n_0` is the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. The solutions are `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`.\n- If `Z(n_0) > m`, it means `m` is a value that `Z(n)` skips (e.g., `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`, so `m=5` is skipped). In this case, there are 0 solutions.\n\nLet's implement the `count_trailing_zeroes` function and the binary search.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n >= i:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    high = 5 * m + 5  # A safe upper bound for n for m=100_000 is around 400_000. 5*m+5 is generous.\n    ans_n = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    # Check if a solution was found and if Z(ans_n) is exactly m\n    if ans_n == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) != m:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n    else:\n        # If Z(ans_n) == m, then ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4 are the solutions.\n        # This is because Z(k) only changes when k is a multiple of 5.\n        # Since ans_n is the smallest integer such that Z(ans_n) = m,\n        # and Z(ans_n - 1) must be < m (or ans_n would be smaller),\n        # the values Z(ans_n), Z(ans_n+1), Z(ans_n+2), Z(ans_n+3), Z(ans_n+4) will all be m,\n        # unless one of them is a multiple of 5, which would increase the zero count.\n        # However, if ans_n is the smallest for m, then ans_n-1, ans_n-2, ans_n-3, ans_n-4\n        # must have less than m zeroes.
