Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Cracking the Golorp Code: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it. My initial thought process is to really nail down the problem definition before jumping into code.\n\nFirst, the Golorp's name is key; it *is* the diet. This name has a structure, it defines the math and the constraints. We're dealing with variables 0-9, and the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of values that *works*, or return \"false\" if it doesn't.\n\nThe \"jaws\" and \"stomach\" analogy hints at a fixed number of variables. The problem text says the jaws *define* the number of variables. The examples show names like `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` and I’m seeing a clear structure emerging:\n\n`?(`Expression`) : -` Constraints `.`\n\nI think the part inside the question mark and parentheses is the expression related to the \"jaws\", and the part after the colon and before the period is the constraint related to the \"stomach\". The number of variables is linked to the expression.\n\nI need to understand what `_-_/___*__` means and how it links to variables. Let's analyze the first example, `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with output `0010`.  This has four variables: v0, v1, v2, v3. The number of underscores must relate to the variables. I was initially thinking the number of underscores *within each group* was the variable count, but this does not match the sample output. \n\nI was mistaken. It’s not about counting groups of underscores, it's about the *position* of the underscore. So the first `_` is `v0`, the second `_` is `v1`, etc.  This also now makes the constraints part make more sense, because `___` translates to `v0,v1,v2`, etc.\n\nNow that I have a clearer picture of how the Golorp's name defines its diet, I can think about how to approach building this Python script.  Lexicographical order is critical, meaning I need to start trying values of 0, then 1, and so on. Now I need to figure out the best way to parse these names and how to model the \"expression\" and \"constraint\" parts.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies a set of arithmetic constraints defined by a \"golorp name\". If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe golorp name has a specific structure: `?(<expression>):-<constraint1>,<constraint2>,...,<constraintN>.`\n\n1.  **Parsing the Name:**\n    *   The name is split into two main parts: the \"expression\" part and the \"constraints\" part.\n    *   The expression part is `?( ... ):`. We extract the content inside `(` and `)`.\n    *   The constraints part is `:- ... .`. We extract the content between `:-` and `.`, then split it by `,` to get individual constraints.\n\n2.  **Identifying Variables:**\n    *   Variables are represented by underscores (`_`).\n    *   The *number of underscores* in a sequence (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) determines which variable it refers to.\n    *   `_` refers to `x0`.\n    *   `__` refers to `x1`.\n    *   `___` refers to `x2`.\n    *   And so on.\n    *   We need to find the maximum number of underscores appearing consecutively to determine the total number of variables (`N`). If `k` underscores is the maximum, then we need `k` variables (`x0` to `x_{k-1}`).\n\n3.  **Constructing the Expression:**\n    *   The expression part can contain `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and variable references (`_`, `__`, ...).\n    *   We replace each variable reference `k` underscores with `x_{k-1}`.\n    *   The expression is evaluated using standard operator precedence. Python's `eval()` function can handle this directly if we construct a valid Python expression string.\n\n4.  **Constructing Constraints:**\n    *   Each constraint is of the form `VAR_REF <op> VAR_REF`. For example, `___>__`.\n    *   The operators can be `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`.\n    *   We replace variable references in constraints similarly: `k` underscores becomes `x_{k-1}`.\n    *   These constraints are also evaluated using `eval()`.\n\n5.  **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence:**\n    *   Since we need the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) for `x0, x1, ..., x_{N-1}`, this suggests a brute-force approach, but optimized.\n    *   We can use `itertools.product` to generate all possible combinations of digits for `N` variables.\n    *   `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)` will generate sequences like `(0,0,...,0)`, `(0,0,...,1)`, ..., `(9,9,...,9)`.\n    *   This order is naturally lexicographical.\n    *   For each generated sequence `(v0, v1, ..., v_{N-1})`:\n        *   We substitute `x0=v0, x1=v1, ...` into the expression and all constraints.\n        *   We check if all constraints are `True`.\n        *   If all constraints are satisfied, this is the first (and thus lexicographically smallest) valid sequence. We convert it to a string and print it, then terminate.\n\n6.  **Handling \"false\":**\n    *   If `itertools.product` finishes iterating through all possible sequences (which is `10^N` combinations) and no valid sequence is found, then it's impossible to feed the golorp. In this case, we print \"false\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   Expression part: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Constraints part: `___>__`\n\n2.  **Identify Variables:**\n    *   `_`: `x0`\n    *   `__`: `x1`\n    *   `___`: `x2`\n    *   Max underscores is 3, so we need 3 variables: `x0, x1, x2`. (Wait, the example output is `0010`, which implies 4 variables. Let's re-read carefully: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" The example `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` implies 4 variables in the output `0010`. This means the variables are determined by *all unique lengths of underscore sequences* in the entire golorp name, sorted by length.\n        *   `_` -> `x0`\n        *   `__` -> `x1`\n        *   `___` -> `x2`\n        *   `____` -> `x3`\n        *   ...\n        This is a crucial detail. The problem states \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This implies `x0` is the value for `_`, `x1` for `__`, etc. The output `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` means `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`.\n        Let's check the unique underscore lengths in `_-_/___*__` and `___>__`:\n        *   `_` (length 1)\n        *   `__` (length 2)\n        *   `___` (length 3)\n        The maximum length is 3. So we need `x0, x1, x2`. This still doesn't match the output `0010` (4 variables).\n\n    **Correction based on example output:** The problem says \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This strongly implies that the *total number of variables* is the count of *all individual underscores* in the expression part.\n    `_-_/___*__` has `1+1+3+2 = 7` underscores. This would mean 7 variables. Still not 4.\n\n    Let's re-examine the example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` Output: `0010`.\n    This implies 4 variables, `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n    The only way to get 4 variables from `_-_/___*__` is if each `_` represents a *new* variable in sequence.\n    `_` -> `v0`\n    `-`\n    `_` -> `v1`\n    `/`\n    `_` -> `v2`\n    `_` -> `v3`\n    `_` -> `v4`\n    `*`\n    `_` -> `v5`\n    `_` -> `v6`\n    This would mean 7 variables, `v0` to `v6`. Still doesn't match `0010`.\n\n    The most common interpretation in competitive programming for problems like this is that `_` refers to `x0`, `__` refers to `x1`, `___` refers to `x2`, etc. And *all* instances of `_` refer to `x0`, *all* instances of `__` refer to `x1`, etc. The number of variables `N` is the count of unique underscore lengths.\n\n    Let's re-try `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with this interpretation:\n    *   Unique underscore lengths present: `_` (len 1), `__` (len 2), `___` (len 3).\n    *   This means we need 3 variables: `x0` (for `_`), `x1` (for `__`), `x2` (for `___`).\n    *   The output `0010` has 4 digits. This is the biggest discrepancy.\n\n    What if the problem statement \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws\" means the *first appearance* of `_` is `x0`, the *first appearance* of `__` is `x1`, etc., and then subsequent appearances use the same variable? This is standard.\n    But why 4 variables for `_-_/___*__`? The output `0010` is `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`.\n    This means the variable mapping is not `_` -> `x0`, `__` -> `x1`, etc.\n\n    Let's consider the structure `?(<expression>):-<constraints>.`.\n    The \"jaws\" define the number of variables. The most plausible interpretation that fits the example output `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` is:\n    *   The `_` sequences are placeholders for variables `x0, x1, ... x_{N-1}`.\n    *   The number of variables `N` is the total count of *all individual underscores* in the *expression part only*.\n    *   Each `_` in the expression part is a new variable in sequence.\n    *   So, for `_-_/___*__`:\n        *   `_` -> `x0`\n        *   `-`\n        *   `_` -> `x1`\n        *   `/`\n        *   `_` -> `x2`\n        *   `_` -> `x3`\n        *   `_` -> `x4`\n        *   `*`\n        *   `_` -> `x5`\n        *   `_` -> `x6`\n        This gives `N=7` variables. Still not 4.\n\n    This is very tricky. Let's look at the example outputs again:\n    1.  `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> `0010` (4 variables)\n    2.  `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` -> `false`\n    3.  `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` -> `0250341` (7 variables)\n    4.  `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` -> `0101` (4 variables)\n\n    In example 1, `_-_/___*__` has lengths 1, 1, 3, 2. The output is 4 variables.\n    In example 3, `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___`\n    Lengths: 22, 4, 7, 2, 5, 6, 3. Output is 7 variables.\n    This strongly suggests that the number of variables `N` is the number of *distinct underscore-sequences* (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`, `____`, etc.) found in the *entire name*, sorted by length.\n\n    Let's test this hypothesis:\n    **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    Underscore sequences: `_`, `__`, `___`.\n    Distinct lengths: 1, 2, 3.\n    This means `x0` is for `_`, `x1` for `__`, `x2` for `___`.\n    Total `N = 3` variables. Still not 4.\n\n    This implies my understanding of \"variables\" and \"jaws\" is incorrect.\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\"\n    \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n\n    What if the \"jaws\" part is `?(<expression>)` and the number of variables is determined by the *number of distinct underscore-sequence groups* in the expression part?\n    `_-_/___*__`\n    Groups: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`.\n    Number of groups = 4. This matches the output `0010` which has 4 digits!\n    This would mean:\n    *   The first `_` in the expression becomes `x0`.\n    *   The second `_` in the expression becomes `x1`.\n    *   The `___` in the expression becomes `x2`.\n    *   The `__` in the expression becomes `x3`.\n    This is consistent with \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    So, the variables `x0, x1, ..., x_{N-1}` are assigned to the underscore sequences *in the order they appear* in the expression part.\n    And then in the constraints part, if `_` appears, it refers to `x0`. If `__` appears, it refers to `x1`, etc., based on the *first assignment*.\n\n    Let's re-test this hypothesis.\n\n    **Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Parse the expression part (inside `?(` and `):`).\n    2.  Identify all underscore sequences (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) in the expression part, *in order of appearance*. Let these be `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{N-1}`.\n    3.  These `N` sequences define `N` variables `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}`. `x_i` is the value assigned to `s_i`.\n    4.  When evaluating the expression and constraints, replace `s_i` with `x_i`.\n\n    **Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n    *   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Sequences in order: `s0=_`, `s1=_`, `s2=___`, `s3=__`.\n    *   So we need `N=4` variables: `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n    *   Original expression: `x0 - x1 / x2 * x3` (after substitution)\n    *   Constraint: `___ > __`\n        *   Here, `___` refers to `s2` which is `x2`.\n        *   `__` refers to `s3` which is `x3`.\n        *   So the constraint is `x2 > x3`.\n\n    Let's check with output `0010`: `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`.\n    *   Constraint `x2 > x3`: `1 > 0` which is `True`.\n    *   This hypothesis works for Example 1!\n\n    **Example 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`**\n    *   Expression: `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___`\n    *   Sequences in order:\n        `s0=______________________` (22 underscores)\n        `s1=____` (4 underscores)\n        `s2=_______` (7 underscores)\n        `s3=__` (2 underscores)\n        `s4=_____` (5 underscores)\n        `s5=______` (6 underscores)\n        `s6=___` (3 underscores)\n    *   So we need `N=7` variables: `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6`.\n    *   Output `0250341` means `x0=0, x1=2, x2=5, x3=0, x4=3, x5=4, x6=1`.\n    *   Constraints:\n        `s3 < s6` -> `x3 < x6` (`0 < 1` -> True)\n        `s6 < s1` -> `x6 < x1` (`1 < 2` -> True)\n        `s1 < s4` -> `x1 < x4` (`2 < 3` -> True)\n        `s4 < s5` -> `x4 < x5` (`3 < 4` -> True)\n        `s5 < s0` -> `x5 < x0` (`4 < 0` -> False)\n        This constraint fails! `4 < 0` is false. My hypothesis is still wrong for Example 3.\n\n    The example output `0250341` for `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` is `0250341`.\n    The constraints are: `__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n    Let's identify the variables based on the *unique lengths of underscore sequences* in the *entire name*, sorted by length.\n    Unique lengths in `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___` and `__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______`:\n    Lengths: 22, 4, 7, 2, 5, 6, 3.\n    Sorted unique lengths: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 22.\n    So, `x0` is for `__` (length 2)\n    `x1` is for `___` (length 3)\n    `x2` is for `____` (length 4)\n    `x3` is for `_____` (length 5)\n    `x4` is for `______` (length 6)\n    `x5` is for `_______` (length 7)\n    `x6` is for `______________________` (length 22)\n    This gives `N=7` variables, which matches the length of `0250341`.\n\n    Now let's map the output `0250341` to these variables:\n    `x0=0` (for `__`)\n    `x1=2` (for `___`)\n    `x2=5` (for `____`)\n    `x3=0` (for `_____`)\n    `x4=3` (for `______`)\n    `x5=4` (for `_______`)\n    `x6=1` (for `______________________`)\n\n    Let's re-evaluate constraints with this mapping:\n    `__<___` -> `x0 < x1` (`0 < 2` -> True)\n    `___<____` -> `x1 < x2` (`2 < 5` -> True)\n    `____<_____` -> `x2 < x3` (`5 < 0` -> False)\n    This constraint fails! `5 < 0` is false.\n\n    This is extremely frustrating. The problem description and examples are contradictory or very subtle.\n    \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n\n    Let's consider the *input format* carefully.\n    `['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']`\n    This is a list of strings, but the problem states \"The input is a single string\". This is likely a copy-paste error from an example test suite, and we should process one string at a time. I'll assume standard input provides one name string per line.\n\n    The only remaining interpretation that could explain the number of variables is that the number of variables `N` is determined by the *total count of underscore sequences* (not unique lengths) in the *entire name string*. And `x0` is the value for the first underscore sequence, `x1` for the second, etc.\n    Let's test this for Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    Sequences in order: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`, `___`, `__`.\n    This gives `N=6` variables. Still not 4.\n\n    This is a classic \"read the fine print\" or \"figure out the secret rule\" problem.\n    \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\"\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n    \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n\n    The \"jaws\" are the `?( ... )` part.\n    What if the *number of variables* `N` is the number of *distinct underscore lengths* in the *expression part*?\n    Ex1: `_-_/___*__` -> lengths 1, 2, 3. `N=3`. Still wrong.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement implies a simpler approach, and the examples are confusing.\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n    This means the number of variables is derived from `?(<expression>)`.\n    \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    This suggests `x0` corresponds to the first placeholder, `x1` to the second, etc.\n\n    What if the *length* of the underscore sequence determines its index?\n    `_` refers to `x0`.\n    `__` refers to `x1`.\n    `___` refers to `x2`.\n    This is the most common interpretation.\n    And the number of variables `N` is `max_underscore_length`.\n\n    Let's re-test Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    Max underscore length in the whole string: `___` (length 3).\n    So `N=3`. Variables `x0, x1, x2`.\n    Output `0010` is 4 variables. This cannot be the rule.\n\n    What if the number of variables is simply the length of the output string in the example? This is circular.\n\n    Let's reconsider the \"jaws\" `_-_/___*__` and output `0010`.\n    This means `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n    If `_` refers to `x0`, `_` refers to `x1`, `___` refers to `x2`, `__` refers to `x3`.\n    This is my earlier hypothesis that failed example 3.\n    Let's re-verify example 3 with this hypothesis:\n    `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n    Expression part underscore sequences:\n    `s0=______________________` (22 underscores)\n    `s1=____` (4 underscores)\n    `s2=_______` (7 underscores)\n    `s3=__` (2 underscores)\n    `s4=_____` (5 underscores)\n    `s5=______` (6 underscores)\n    `s6=___` (3 underscores)\n    Total `N=7` variables. This matches the output length `0250341`.\n    So, `x0` is for `s0`, `x1` for `s1`, ..., `x6` for `s6`.\n    Output `0250341` means:\n    `x0=0` (for `s0=______________________`)\n    `x1=2` (for `s1=____`)\n    `x2=5` (for `s2=_______`)\n    `x3=0` (for `s3=__`)\n    `x4=3` (for `s4=_____`)\n    `x5=4` (for `s5=______`)\n    `x6=1` (for `s6=___`)\n\n    Now let's check the constraints using *these assigned variables*:\n    `__<___`\n    `__` matches `s3`. So this is `x3`.\n    `___` matches `s6`. So this is `x6`.\n    Constraint: `x3 < x6` (`0 < 1` -> True). This one works!\n\n    `___<____`\n    `___` matches `s6`. So this is `x6`.\n    `____` matches `s1`. So this is `x1`.\n    Constraint: `x6 < x1` (`1 < 2` -> True). This one works!\n\n    `____<_____`\n    `____` matches `s1`. So this is `x1`.\n    `_____` matches `s4`. So this is `x4`.\n    Constraint: `x1 < x4` (`2 < 3` -> True). This one works!\n\n    `_____<______`\n    `_____` matches `s4`. So this is `x4`.\n    `______` matches `s5`. So this is `x5`.\n    Constraint: `x4 < x5` (`3 < 4` -> True). This one works!\n\n    `______<_______`\n    `______` matches `s5`. So this is `x5`.\n    `_______` matches `s2`. So this is `x2`.\n    Constraint: `x5 < x2` (`4 < 5` -> True). This one works!\n\n    This hypothesis *works for both Example 1 and Example 3*! This must be the correct interpretation.\n\n    **Final Hypothesis:**\n    1.  Extract the expression string (the part inside `?(` and `):`).\n    2.  Find all maximal consecutive underscore sequences in this expression string. Store them in a list `jaw_vars` in the order they appear.\n        Example: `_-_/___*__` -> `['_', '_', '___', '__']`\n    3.  The number of variables `N` is `len(jaw_vars)`.\n    4.  `x_i` is the value for the `i`-th sequence in `jaw_vars`.\n    5.  To evaluate the expression and constraints:\n        *   Replace each `jaw_vars[i]` string with `f\"x[{i}]\"` in the expression and constraints.\n        *   Then use `eval()` with a dictionary mapping `x` to the current tuple of variable values.\n\n    Let's test Example 2: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n    1.  Expression: `__-_+_/_____`\n    2.  `jaw_vars`: `['__', '_', '_', '_____']`\n    3.  `N=4`. Variables `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n        `x0` for `__`\n        `x1` for `_`\n        `x2` for `_`\n        `x3` for `_____`\n    4.  Original expression: `x0 - x1 + x2 / x3`\n    5.  Constraints:\n        `__ > __` -> `x0 > x0` (Always false)\n        `_____ < __` -> `x3 < x0`\n\n    Since `x0 > x0` is always false, no combination of variables can satisfy this. So the output should be \"false\". This matches the example!\n\n    Let's test Example 4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n    1.  Expression: `__+___+__-___`\n    2.  `jaw_vars`: `['__', '___', '__', '___']`\n    3.  `N=4`. Variables `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n        `x0` for `__` (1st instance)\n        `x1` for `___` (1st instance)\n        `x2` for `__` (2nd instance)\n        `x3` for `___` (2nd instance)\n    4.  Original expression: `x0 + x1 + x2 - x3`\n    5.  Constraints: `___ > __`\n        `___` refers to `x1` (first `___` in `jaw_vars`).\n        `__` refers to `x0` (first `__` in `jaw_vars`).\n        Constraint: `x1 > x0`.\n\n    Now we need to find `x0, x1, x2, x3` (from `0000` to `9999`) such that `x1 > x0`.\n    The first one will be `0100` (`x0=0, x1=1, x2=0, x3=0`).\n    Check `x1 > x0`: `1 > 0` (True).\n    The output is `0101`. This means my `jaw_vars` to `x_i` mapping is correct, but my constraint substitution is incorrect.\n\n    **Correction for constraint substitution:**\n    The problem statement \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws\" implies that the `x_i` are the values. The *representation* `_`, `__`, `___` in the constraints refers to the *same variable* as its first appearance in the `jaw_vars` list.\n    No, this is not right. If it was, `__` would always be `x0` in Ex4. But `__` appears twice in `jaw_vars`.\n    The only way `0101` makes sense for `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` with constraint `___>__` is if the constraint refers to variables based on their *length*.\n    `_` -> `v0`\n    `__` -> `v1`\n    `___` -> `v2`\n    `____` -> `v3`\n    etc.\n    And the `jaw_vars` define the number of variables and their *order*.\n\n    Let `v_L` be the value for an underscore sequence of length `L`.\n    For `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`:\n    `jaw_vars = ['__', '___', '__', '___']`.\n    This means the output variables are `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n    `x0` is the value for the first `__`.\n    `x1` is the value for the first `___`.\n    `x2` is the value for the second `__`.\n    `x3` is the value for the second `___`.\n\n    The constraint `___>__` must refer to `v_3 > v_2` (value for length 3 > value for length 2).\n    But then we have `x0, x1, x2, x3` as the actual variables.\n    This means there must be a mapping from `v_L` to `x_i`.\n    This is getting overly complicated.\n\n    Let's simplify.\n    The most straightforward interpretation of \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws\" is that `x0` is the value for the first underscore sequence, `x1` for the second, etc.\n    And in the constraints, `_` refers to `x0`, `__` refers to `x1`, `___` refers to `x2`, etc.\n    This is what I tried first and it failed.\n\n    What if the problem implies that the variables are *implicitly* named `_`, `__`, `___`, etc. based on their length, and the `jaw_vars` just provide the *order* for the output?\n    Example 4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n    Output `0101`.\n    Let `v_L` be the value for an underscore sequence of length `L`.\n    `v_2 = 0` (for `__`)\n    `v_3 = 1` (for `___`)\n    The constraint `___ > __` becomes `v_3 > v_2`, which is `1 > 0` (True).\n    The expression `__+___+__-___` becomes `v_2 + v_3 + v_2 - v_3`.\n    The variables involved are `v_2` and `v_3`.\n    The output `0101` has length 4. This means there are 4 variables.\n    If the variables are `v_2, v_3`, where do the other two come from?\n\n    This problem is an absolute nightmare of unclear variable definition.\n    Let's stick to the hypothesis that worked for Ex1, Ex2, Ex3 constraints.\n    **Hypothesis (Revised):**\n    1.  Parse the expression string (the part inside `?(` and `):`).\n    2.  Find all maximal consecutive underscore sequences in this expression string. Store them in a list `jaw_tokens` in the order they appear.\n        Example: `_-_/___*__` -> `['_', '_', '___', '__']`\n    3.  The number of variables `N` is `len(jaw_tokens)`.\n    4.  These `N` variables are `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}`.\n    5.  When constructing the expression and constraints, *each underscore sequence is replaced by its corresponding variable from `jaw_tokens`*.\n        *   For the expression: Iterate through `jaw_tokens` and replace `jaw_tokens[i]` with `f\"x[{i}]\"`.\n        *   For constraints: This is the tricky part. A constraint like `___>__` needs to map `___` and `__` to variables.\n            The simplest way to make this work for `0101` in Ex4 is if `___` in constraint refers to `x1` (first `___` in `jaw_tokens`), and `__` refers to `x0` (first `__` in `jaw_tokens`).\n            If `jaw_tokens = ['__', '___', '__', '___']`\n            Constraint `___ > __` becomes `x1 > x0`.\n            For `0101`: `x0=0, x1=1, x2=0, x3=1`.\n            `x1 > x0` means `1 > 0`, which is True. This works!\n\n    This hypothesis works for all four examples!\n\n    **Detailed Plan:**\n\n    1.  **Parse Input String:**\n        *   Find `?(` and `):` to extract the `expression_str`.\n        *   Find `:-` and `.` to extract the `constraints_str`.\n        *   Split `constraints_str` by `,` to get a list of individual constraint strings.\n\n    2.  **Identify Variables (jaw_tokens):**\n        *   Use `re.findall(r'_+', expression_str)` to get all underscore sequences from `expression_str` in order. This will be `jaw_tokens`.\n        *   `N = len(jaw_tokens)`.\n\n    3.  **Prepare Expression and Constraint Strings for `eval()`:**\n        *   Create a dictionary `token_to_var_name` to map each `jaw_tokens[i]` to `f\"x[{i}]\"`.\n        *   `eval_expression_str`: Start with `expression_str`. Iterate through `jaw_tokens` from `i=0` to `N-1`. Replace *all occurrences* of `jaw_tokens[i]` in `eval_expression_str` with `f\"x[{i}]\"`. This requires careful replacement to avoid issues if one token is a substring of another (e.g., `_` and `__`). Replace longer tokens first.\n        *   `eval_constraints_list`: For each `constraint_str` in `constraints_list`:\n            *   Do the same replacement: replace `jaw_tokens[i]` with `f\"x[{i}]\"`.\n            *   Again, replace longer tokens first.\n\n    4.  **Iterate and Test:**\n        *   Import `itertools.product`.\n        *   Loop through `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)` to get `values_tuple` (e.g., `(0,0,0,0)`).\n        *   Inside the loop:\n            *   Create a local variable `x = values_tuple`. This makes `eval(f\"x[{i}]\")` work.\n            *   Evaluate `eval_expression_str`. If it involves division by zero, it's invalid. `try-except ZeroDivisionError`.\n            *   Evaluate each `eval_constraint_str` in `eval_constraints_list`. If any evaluates to `False`, the sequence is invalid.\n            *   If all constraints are `True` and no division by zero, then `values_tuple` is the lexicographically smallest valid sequence.\n                *   Convert `values_tuple` to a string (e.g., `(0,0,1,0)` -> `\"0010\"`).\n                *   Print the string and exit.\n\n    5.  **No Solution:**\n        *   If the loop finishes without finding a solution, print \"false\".\n\n    **Refinement for Step 3 (Replacement):**\n    Replacing `_` with `x[0]` and then `__` with `x[1]` would be problematic because `_` is part of `__`.\n    The correct approach is to replace distinct underscore-sequence strings.\n    Example: `_-_/___*__`\n    `jaw_tokens = ['_', '_', '___', '__']`\n    We need to replace the *first* `_` with `x[0]`, the *second* `_` with `x[1]`, the `___` with `x[2]`, the `__` with `x[3]`.\n    This means we need to do replacements on the *original string*, not on a string where some replacements have already happened.\n\n    A better way for Step 3:\n    *   Create `eval_expression_str` by iterating through `expression_str`.\n    *   When we encounter an underscore, find the full underscore sequence.\n    *   If it's the `k`-th underscore sequence encountered, replace it with `f\"x[{k}]\"`.\n    *   This is tricky with `re.sub`.\n\n    Let's use `re.finditer` to get the spans of underscore sequences.\n    `expression_str = \"_-_/___*__\"`\n    `matches = list(re.finditer(r'_+', expression_str))`\n    `matches` would give:\n    `Match 0: span=(0,1), match='_'`\n    `Match 1: span=(2,3), match='_'`\n    `Match 2: span=(5,8), match='___'`\n    `Match 3: span=(9,11), match='__'`\n\n    Now, build the `eval_expression_str` by iterating through the original string and inserting the variable names.\n    `eval_expression_parts = []`\n    `last_idx = 0`\n    `for i, match in enumerate(matches):`\n        `start, end = match.span()`\n        `eval_expression_parts.append(expression_str[last_idx:start])`\n        `eval_expression_parts.append(f\"x[{i}]\")`\n        `last_idx = end`\n    `eval_expression_parts.append(expression_str[last_idx:])`\n    `eval_expression_str = \"\".join(eval_expression_parts)`\n\n    Do the same for constraints. This is cleaner and avoids substring replacement issues.\n    The `jaw_tokens` list will be `[m.group(0) for m in matches]`. This gives us the mapping for `x_i`.\n\n    ```python\n    import re\n    import itertools\n\n    def solve():\n        golorp_name = input()\n\n        # 1.

All constraints met.\n        Print `\"0100\"`.\n        But the example output is `\"0101\"`.\n\n    This means my \"token_to_first_idx\" mapping for constraints is still off.\n    The example `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` output `0101` means `x0=0, x1=1, x2=0, x3=1`.\n    Constraint `___>__` is `x1 > x0`. This is `1 > 0` which is True.\n    This constraint is satisfied by `0100`. Why `0101`?\n    The only way `0101` is the smallest is if `0100` is invalid.\n    But `0100` satisfies `x1 > x0`.\n\n    The problem states: \"Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.\"\n    This means `0100` should be the answer if my logic is correct.\n    Could the expression itself impose some implicit constraint? \"Golorps are mysterious creatures who feed on variables.\" \"For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name.\"\n    The `eval(eval_expression_str)` line I commented out. What if the expression has to be valid (no division by zero)?\n    For `__+___+__-___`, there is no division. So `0100` would be valid.\n\n    There is only one remaining interpretation that could explain `0101` for Ex4:\n    The variables in the constraints (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) are *not* mapped to `x[i]` based on their first appearance in `jaw_tokens`. Instead, they are mapped to `x[i]` based on their *length* and *their position in the `jaw_tokens`*.\n    This is extremely convoluted.\n\n    Let's re-read: \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    This is the output order. `x0, x1, ..., x_{N-1}`.\n    `N` is the count of `_` sequences in the expression.\n    `x_i` is the value for `jaw_tokens[i]`.\n\n    What if the variables in the constraints are mapped to `x[i]` based on the *first appearance of that specific underscore sequence length* in `jaw_tokens`?\n    Example 4: `jaw_tokens = ['__', '___', '__', '___']`\n    `x0` is for the first `__`.\n    `x1` is for the first `___`.\n    `x2` is for the second `__`.\n    `x3` is for the second `___`.\n\n    In the constraint `___>__`:\n    `___` (length 3). First `___` in `jaw_tokens` is at index 1. So `___` maps to `x1`.\n    `__` (length 2). First `__` in `jaw_tokens` is at index 0. So `__` maps to `x0`.\n    Constraint becomes `x1 > x0`.\n    This is the same as my previous derivation.\n\n    The only way `0101` is preferred over `0100` is if `0100` is invalid.\n    If `0100` is `x0=0, x1=1, x2=0, x3=0`.\n    Constraint `x1 > x0` is `1 > 0`, True.\n    Expression `x0+x1+x2-x3` is `0+1+0-0 = 1`. This is a valid calculation.\n    There is no way `0100` is invalid under this interpretation.\n\n    Could it be that the problem implies `x0` is for `_`, `x1` for `__`, `x2` for `___`, etc. (based on length), and the `jaw_tokens` list simply tells us *which of these length-based variables are actually used*, and in what order for the output?\n    Example 4: `jaw_tokens = ['__', '___', '__', '___']`\n    Unique lengths in `jaw_tokens` are 2 and 3.\n    So, we need `v_2` (for `__`) and `v_3` (for `___`).\n    The output order is `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n    This means `x0=v_2`, `x1=v_3`, `x2=v_2`, `x3=v_3`.\n    So `x0=x2` and `x1=x3`.\n    Constraint `___ > __` becomes `v_3 > v_2`.\n    If `x0=v_2`, `x1=v_3`, then `x1 > x0`.\n    We need to find `x0, x1, x2, x3` such that `x0=x2`, `x1=x3`, and `x1 > x0`.\n    Lexicographically smallest:\n    Try `x0=0`. Then `x2=0`.\n    Try `x1=0`. But `x1 > x0` (`0 > 0`) is False.\n    Try `x1=1`. Then `x3=1`. `x1 > x0` (`1 > 0`) is True.\n    So `x0=0, x1=1, x2=0, x3=1`. This is `0101`.\n    This matches the example output!\n\n    This is the correct interpretation.\n\n    **Final, Final Hypothesis:**\n    1.  **Identify Unique Underscore Lengths and their Variables:**\n        *   Extract all maximal consecutive underscore sequences from the *entire golorp name string* (expression and constraints).\n        *   Find all *unique lengths* of these sequences.\n        *   Sort these unique lengths: `L_0 < L_1 < ... < L_{M-1}`.\n        *   These define `M` fundamental variables: `v_0` for length `L_0`, `v_1` for length `L_1`, ..., `v_{M-1}` for length `L_{M-1}`.\n        *   These `v_j` are the actual values we are searching for.\n\n    2.  **Determine Output Variables and their Mapping:**\n        *   Extract all maximal consecutive underscore sequences from the *expression part only*. Call this list `jaw_tokens`.\n        *   The number of output variables `N` is `len(jaw_tokens)`.\n        *   The output sequence is `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}`.\n        *   `x_i` is the value of the `v_j` that corresponds to the length of `jaw_tokens[i]`.\n        *   Example: If `jaw_tokens[i]` is `___` (length 3) and `L_k=3`, then `x_i = v_k`.\n\n    3.  **Prepare Expression and Constraint Strings for `eval()`:**\n        *   Create `eval_expression_str` and `eval_constraints_list`.\n        *   When replacing an underscore sequence of length `L` in either the expression or constraints, replace it with `f\"v[{j}]\"` where `j` is the index such that `L_j = L`.\n        *   Use the `re.finditer` and string reconstruction method to handle replacements correctly.\n\n    4.  **Iterate and Test:**\n        *   Loop through `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=M)` to get `v_values_tuple` (e.g., `(v_0, v_1, ..., v_{M-1})`).\n        *   Inside the loop:\n            *   Create `v = list(v_values_tuple)`.\n            *   Evaluate `eval_expression_str` and all `eval_constraint_str` using `v`. Handle `ZeroDivisionError`.\n            *   If all are `True`:\n                *   Construct the output string `x_0x_1...x_{N-1}` by mapping `jaw_tokens[i]` to `v_j` based on length.\n                *   Print and exit.\n\n    This seems to be the most robust interpretation that explains all examples.\n    The number of variables to iterate over is `M` (unique lengths), not `N` (count of jaw tokens).\n    `M` will be much smaller than `N` in some cases (e.g., `N=22` in Ex3, but `M=7` unique lengths). This is good for performance.\n\n    ```python\n    import re\n    import itertools\n\n    def solve():\n        golorp_name = input()\n\n        # 1.
