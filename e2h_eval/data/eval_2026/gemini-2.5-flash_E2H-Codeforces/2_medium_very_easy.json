Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**X Pattern Grid Checker - My Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms a specific \"X\" pattern. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules.  Essentially, the diagonals must have the same character, and everything else in the grid must share a *different* character.  `n` is always an odd number between 3 and 299, making things easier (more on that later).\n\nMy plan is to represent the grid as a list of lists (or a list of strings - I'll decide which is more convenient). Then, I'll iterate through each cell.  To identify diagonal elements, I'll use the indices: `i == j` for the main diagonal and `i + j == n - 1` for the anti-diagonal.\n\nI'll initialize two variables: `diagonal_char` and `other_char`. As I go through the grid, if a cell is on a diagonal, I'll check if its character matches `diagonal_char`. If `diagonal_char` hasn't been set yet (the first diagonal element encountered), I'll set it. If it *doesn't* match, I know it's not an X, so I can immediately output \"NO\" and stop.  I'll do the same for the non-diagonal cells and `other_char`.\n\nIf I reach the end of the grid without finding any violations, I'll do a final check: the characters on the diagonals must be different from the other ones. If they're the same, I output \"NO\"; otherwise, \"YES\".\n\n**Optimization:**  Since any violation means it's not an X, I can include `break` statements within my loops to exit early. This should improve the runtime slightly, especially for larger values of `n`.\n\n**Edge Cases**: The odd `n` is important because it guarantees there's always a unique center element, and that diagonal definitions are unambiguous.  I need to remember to address this constraint explicitly within the code. Also, since `n >= 3`, I'm guaranteed to have at least one character on and off the diagonal.\n\nI'll trace the algorithm with a few examples (including ones where the answer is \"YES\" and \"NO\") to make sure the logic is bulletproof, handling the different cases and conditions. I will test cases like the grid filled with all same characters which should return \"NO\".\n\nThe implementation will read `n` and the grid input, do the comparisons. It looks like it could be done quite cleanly, but I need to make sure to follow the conditions precisely and I'll keep the variable names concise but meaningful (like `diagonal_char` and `other_char`). I think this approach should be quite efficient, `O(n^2)`. It looks good to go.\n",
