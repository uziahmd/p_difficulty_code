    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The core is finding a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. If there are ties, I should choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet's rename things to make it easier to think about. I'll let `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`. My objective is to minimize `lcm(x, y)`. I recall that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  Also, the difference between `x` and `y` is just `b - a`, since the `k` cancels out.\n\nA crucial observation here: if a number `d` divides both `x` and `y`, it *must* also divide their difference, which is `b - a`. So, `gcd(x, y)` has to be a divisor of `b - a`.\n\nLet's consider a base case. If `a` and `b` are equal, the problem becomes trivial.  `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize this, `k` must be zero, giving an LCM of `a`. Simple.\n\nNow, let's assume `a` is not equal to `b`.  Without loss of generality, let's assume `a < b`. The difference is `diff = b - a`. Therefore the gcd of `a+k` and `b+k` is a divisor of `b-a`.\n\nI can iterate through the divisors of `diff = b-a`.  For each divisor, `g`, I need to find a `k >= 0` such that `gcd(a+k, b+k) = g`.  This means `a+k` and `b+k` are multiples of `g`.  If `a+k` is divisible by `g`, then `k` must be congruent to `-a` modulo `g`. This essentially means `k = jg - a` for some integer `j`.\n\nSince `k` must be non-negative, I need to find the smallest non-negative solution for `j`.  This can be done with `j = ceil(a/g)`. So, the smallest non-negative value for `k` is then `g * ceil(a/g) - a`.\n\nLet's streamline that. If `a` is already a multiple of `g` (i.e., `a % g == 0`), then `k = 0`.  Otherwise, `k = g - (a % g)`.  That will always give the smallest, non-negative `k` value.\n\nSo, for each divisor `g` of `b-a`, compute the corresponding `k` using this formula. Then, calculate the corresponding LCM and select the pair (g,k) that generates the least LCM. Finally, from this g,k pair, take k as my final answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nAlso, `gcd(x, y)` must divide `y - x`.\n`y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. If `a = b`, then `diff = 0`.\n\n**Case 1: `a = b`**\nIf `a = b`, then `x = y = a+k`.\n`lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\nTo minimize `a+k`, we should choose the smallest possible non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`.\nThe minimum LCM is `a`.\n\n**Case 2: `a != b`**\nLet `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. We know that `g` must be a divisor of `diff = b - a`.\nThis is a crucial observation: `gcd(a+k, b+k)` can only be one of the divisors of `diff`.\nLet `x = g \\cdot m` and `y = g \\cdot n`, where `gcd(m, n) = 1`.\nThen `lcm(x, y) = g \\cdot m \\cdot n`.\nWe want to minimize `g \\cdot m \\cdot n`.\n\nSince `g` must be a divisor of `diff`, we can iterate through all divisors `g` of `diff`.\nFor each divisor `g`, we need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` are both multiples of `g`.\nThis means `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` and `b+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\nThe first condition `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` implies `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`.\nThe smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this is `k_g = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g`.\n(If `a \\% g == 0`, `k_g = 0`. Otherwise, `k_g = g - (a \\% g)`.)\nWith this `k_g`, we have `a+k_g` as the smallest multiple of `g` that is greater than or equal to `a`.\nLet `current_x = a+k_g` and `current_y = b+k_g`.\nSince `b-a` is a multiple of `g`, and `a+k_g` is a multiple of `g`, it follows that `(a+k_g) + (b-a)` is also a multiple of `g`.\nSo `b+k_g` will automatically be a multiple of `g`.\nTherefore, for each divisor `g` of `diff`, we calculate `k_g = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g`.\nThen we calculate `x = a+k_g` and `y = b+k_g`.\nThe `lcm` for this `k_g` and `g` is `(x * y) // g`.\nWe keep track of the minimum `lcm` found so far and the corresponding smallest `k`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `min_lcm` to infinity and `best_k` to 0.\n2. If `a == b`: The answer is `k=0`. Print `0` and exit.\n3. Calculate `diff = abs(b - a)`.\n4. Find all divisors of `diff`. A common way is to iterate from `1` up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then `i` is a divisor, and `diff // i` is also a divisor.\n5. For each divisor `g` in the set of divisors of `diff`:\n    a. Calculate `k_g = (g - (a % g)) % g`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\n    b. Calculate `current_x = a + k_g`.\n    c. Calculate `current_y = b + k_g`.\n    d. Calculate `current_lcm = (current_x // g) * current_y`. (This is `(x/g) * y` which is `m * y` or `m * n * g`. This is `lcm(x,y)` since `g` is `gcd(x,y)`).\n    e. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n        Update `min_lcm = current_lcm`.\n        Update `best_k = k_g`.\n    f. If `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n        Update `best_k = min(best_k, k_g)`. (We need the smallest `k` for ties).\n6. Print `best_k`.\n\n**Example walkthrough (6, 10):**\n`a = 6`, `b = 10`. `a != b`.\n`diff = abs(10 - 6) = 4`.\nDivisors of 4: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n*   **For `g = 1`:**\n    *   `k_1 = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = (1 - 0) % 1 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6 + 0 = 6`, `y = 10 + 0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm = (6 * 10) // 1 = 60`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 60`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n*   **For `g = 2`:**\n    *   `k_2 = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = (2 - 0) % 2 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6 + 0 = 6`, `y = 10 + 0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`. (Note: `gcd(6,10)=2`, so `lcm(6,10)=(6*10)/2=30`).\n\n*   **For `g = 4`:**\n    *   `k_4 = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`.\n    *   `x = 6 + 2 = 8`, `y = 10 + 2 = 12`.\n    *   `gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n    *   `lcm = (8 * 12) // 4 = 24`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\nFinal answer: `best_k = 2`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`1 <= a, b <= 10^9`.\n`diff` can be up to `10^9`. The number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is relatively small. The maximum number of divisors for a number less than or equal to `10^9` is 1344 (for `735134400`). So iterating through divisors is efficient enough.\nThe LCM can be very large (`(10^9+k)^2 / g`). We need to use 64-bit integers (Python handles large integers automatically).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    diff = abs(b - a)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n\n    # Find all divisors of diff\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(diff // i)\n\n    for g in sorted(list(divisors)): # Sort to ensure smallest k is picked first for ties in LCM, though the logic handles it.\n                                     # Actually, sorting is not strictly necessary for correctness because we explicitly check for min(best_k, k_g)\n                                     # but it might slightly improve performance if smaller k_g values tend to yield smaller LCMs.\n        # Calculate the smallest non-negative k such that a+k is a multiple of g\n        # k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        # If a % g == 0, k = 0.
