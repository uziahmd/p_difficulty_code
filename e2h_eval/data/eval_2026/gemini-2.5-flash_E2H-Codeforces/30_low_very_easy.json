Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the TV Game Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm facing this \"TV Game\" problem, and I need a Python script to crack it. Let's break down my thought process.  The core of the problem is about two players, Homer and Marge, trying to maximize the sum of their numbers. We're given a number `A` with an even number of digits, `2n` to be precise, and each player gets `n` moves, taking the leftmost digit each turn. The end goal is to output a sequence of 'H' and 'M' representing their moves to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\nI've already run through the problem details and now have a firm understanding of the rules. The real challenge, I suspect, is finding an optimal strategy, or an efficient algorithm to navigate the decision tree. I've taken a quick look at an example to get a feel for how it works. With the example of `A = \"1234\"` and `n = 2`, I've manually explored a few scenarios like HHMM, HMHM etc. Now I need to see if I can detect any pattern.\n\nThinking about it, the order in which digits are taken significantly impacts the resulting numbers. Taking an earlier digit essentially gives that digit a higher place value in the final number. For example, if Homer takes '1' then '3', it creates the number '13', which is different from taking '3' then '1', generating '31'.\n\nThe issue is this implies some form of optimization.  The problem structure points towards dynamic programming or a greedy approach. Given the comparatively small size of `2n` (I'm anticipating it to be manageable), I'm leaning toward a greedy algorithm, coupled with some recursion, or backtracking if necessary. I'll need to define a good heuristic to evaluate the \"goodness\" of each move and then design the main script. The Python implementation needs to efficiently track the digits, calculate the partial sums, and, most importantly, explore the decision space. I'll start by outlining the basic structure of the algorithm and then write the code to check it.\n",
