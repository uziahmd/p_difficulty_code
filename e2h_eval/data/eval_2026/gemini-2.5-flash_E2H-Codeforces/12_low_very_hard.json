The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's see... the problem involves a ring road with 'n' houses and 'm' tasks. I start at house 1 and need to complete tasks in a given order, `a_1` to `a_m`.  The key constraint is that I can only move clockwise, and each move to a neighboring house takes one unit of time.\n\nI have to find the minimum time to complete all the tasks.  I'm going to track my current house (`current_house`) and the total time elapsed (`total_time`).  Initially, `current_house` is 1, and `total_time` is 0.\n\nFor each task, I'll calculate the distance I need to travel. It's straightforward if the target house is greater than or equal to my current house.  The distance is simply `target_house - current_house`. But, if the target house is *less* than my current house, I'll need to go through house 'n'.  In that case, the distance is the distance to 'n' (`n - current_house`) plus the distance from 'n' to the target house (which is just the target house number itself).\n\nI'll iterate through each task, calculate the distance, update my `total_time`, and update my `current_house` for the next task. I'll need to remember to correctly calculate the distance based on whether the target house is before or after my current position on the ring.  Thinking through the example they gave with n=4 and a=[3,2,3] is helpful, I can follow the logic there to double check my calculations.  I think I have a good plan now!  Let's code it!\n",
