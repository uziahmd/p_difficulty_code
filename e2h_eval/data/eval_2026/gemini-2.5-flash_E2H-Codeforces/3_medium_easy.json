Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thought Process on Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle. The goal is to figure out the minimum light radius needed for lanterns to illuminate a street. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input: the street's length (`l`), the number of lanterns (`n`), and their positions (`a_i`). The positions need to be sorted, because the distances between them are key. Then, I realized that the distance to the beginning of the street (0) and the distance to the end of the street (`l`) both need special consideration. The `d` value, or the lantern radius, needs to be at least as large as the distance from the first lantern to 0 and the distance from the last lantern to the end.\n\nNext, I have to account for the gaps between the lanterns. Each gap has a \"critical point\" in the middle, which is the farthest distance a lantern needs to reach in order to cover that segment. To cover the gap, `d` needs to be greater or equal to half the distance between two adjacent lanterns. I need to calculate this value for all adjacent lanterns and determine the maximum among all gaps.\n\nFinally, I take the maximum of these three values I have calculated. The first is the distance from the first lantern to the start, the second is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street, and the third is the maximum distance calculated from the gaps. That maximum radius is my answer.\n\nTo ensure proper precision, I'll use float division and format the output to 10 decimal places. I also double-checked some edge cases, like the street with a single lantern and the case when all lanterns are in the same position, and confirmed the solution logic. Looks like this approach is going to work.\n",
