After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Marks\" problem.  It seems pretty straightforward. The core idea is to identify the \"successful\" students, meaning those who are the best at at least one subject.  I'm thinking, this is a perfect candidate for a clean Python script.\n\nLet's break down the problem details. We have `n` students and `m` subjects.  Marks range from 1 to 9. A student is \"best\" in a subject if they achieved the maximum mark for that subject.  A \"successful\" student is the best in at least one subject. The input is simple: `n` and `m` followed by the marks for each student in each subject.  The output is the count of successful students. The constraints, `1 <= n, m <= 100`, are good to know; they suggest a brute-force approach will be acceptable.\n\nI quickly did a mental walkthrough of the example.  It confirms my understanding: find the maximum mark for each subject, then see which students match that maximum mark for any subject. If a student is the best at any single subject, they're successful.\n\nThe algorithm that pops into my head is pretty simple. I'll read the input and store the marks in a suitable data structure. A list of lists or a 2D array is ideal here: `gradebook[i][j]` will represent the mark of student `i` in subject `j`.  It's efficient and easy to visualize.\n\nThen, for each subject, I need to iterate through the students and find the maximum mark. Once I have the maximum, I can iterate again, checking which students achieved that maximum mark for that specific subject.  I'll probably use a boolean list or set to track which students are considered \"best\" at *some* subject. And finally, I can count the number of true values in this success tracker to arrive at my solution.  Looks like a concise and efficient solution.\n",
