Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for \"Colored Boots\"**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The objective is to find the maximum number of compatible boot pairs, and I'm leaning towards a greedy solution.  It's pretty clear that maximizing pairs requires satisfying the most restrictive color compatibility rules first. I'll need to handle specific colors (like 'a' matching 'a') and the more flexible indefinite color, '?'.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\n1.  **Categorization:** I'll start by grouping the boots. I'll create lists (or dictionaries) to store the indices of left and right boots based on their colors.  I'm using a 0-indexed list approach, with indices 0-25 for lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') and index 26 for '?'. So, `left_boots[0]` will hold indices of left 'a' boots, `left_boots[26]` for '?'.\n\n2.  **Greedy Pairing:** I'll tackle this in phases:\n    *   **Exact Matches:** First, I'll pair up the specific color boots with themselves (e.g., 'a' with 'a'). These are the most restrictive.\n    *   **Specific with '?':** Next, I'll pair any remaining specific color boots with the '?' boots. It doesn't matter much whether I pair remaining left-specific with '?' right or vice-versa, since the key thing is that each '?' gets to be used with a specific type of boot, and then any left- and right- '?' can be paired together.\n    *   **'?' with '?':** Finally, any remaining '?' boots can pair with each other.\n\n3.  **Detailed Implementation:**\n    *   I'll initialize lists to store boot indices.\n    *   I'll populate these lists by iterating through the input strings.\n    *   During the pairing process, I will iteratively take boots using `pop()` from the lists.\n    *   The `pop()` will make sure each boot is used at most once.\n\n4.  **Optimality and Complexity:**\n    *   This greedy approach is optimal because it prioritizes the most restrictive matches first, and then it is efficient because the total number of operations grows linearly with the number of boots, making the time complexity O(n).\n\nLet's get this code written!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. A boot can be part of at most one pair. We need to output the count of pairs and the 1-based indices of the boots in each pair.\n\nCompatibility rules:\n1.  Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2.  An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any specific color or another '?' (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\n3.  Two different specific colors are not compatible (e.g., 'f' and 'g').\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, a greedy strategy is often effective. The idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, thus leaving more flexible options ('?' boots) for later.\n\nHere's the detailed greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Categorize Boots:** First, we'll store the indices of all left and right boots, grouped by their colors. We can use lists of lists (or dictionaries mapping colors to lists of indices). For specific colors 'a' through 'z', we'll use indices 0-25. For the '?' color, we'll use index 26.\n    `left_boots[color_idx]` will store a list of 1-based indices of left boots with that color.\n    `right_boots[color_idx]` will store a list of 1-based indices of right boots with that color.\n\n2.  **Phase 1: Exact Specific Color Matches (`c` with `c`)**\n    These are the most restrictive matches. For each specific color `c` (from 'a' to 'z'), we pair as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible. We take one boot from each list until one of the lists is empty. These pairs are added to our result, and the used boots are removed from their respective lists.\n\n3.  **Phase 2: Specific Left Boots with Indefinite Right Boots (`c` with `?`)**\n    After Phase 1, any remaining specific-colored left boots can only be paired with '?' right boots (since all same-colored right boots are exhausted). For each specific color `c`, we pair any remaining `left_boots[c_idx]` with `right_boots['?']` until either list is empty.\n\n4.  **Phase 3: Indefinite Left Boots with Specific Right Boots (`?` with `c`)**\n    Similarly, any remaining specific-colored right boots can only be paired with '?' left boots. For each specific color `c`, we pair any remaining `right_boots[c_idx]` with `left_boots['?']` until either list is empty.\n\n5.  **Phase 4: Indefinite with Indefinite (`?` with `?`)**\n    Finally, any remaining '?' left boots can be paired with any remaining '?' right boots. We pair them until one of the lists is empty.\n\n**Why this greedy approach is optimal:**\n\n*   **Phase 1 (c-c):** These pairs satisfy the most specific requirement. Using a 'c' left boot with a 'c' right boot prevents either of them from being potentially unmatched if no other 'c' boot is available. If we used a 'c' left boot with a '?' right boot instead, we would lose the opportunity to pair the 'c' right boot with its ideal partner, and the '?' right boot could have been used for any other specific color or another '?'.\n*   **Phases 2 & 3 (c-? or ?-c):** After all exact matches, specific-colored boots that remain are \"picky\" and can only be paired with a '?' boot. A '?' boot is \"flexible\" and can be paired with any boot. By using a '?' boot to satisfy a specific-colored boot, we ensure that the specific-colored boot gets a match, which is better than leaving it unmatched. The '?' boot is used, but it's used to fulfill a more constrained demand.\n*   **Phase 4 (?-?):** At this point, all specific-colored boots are either paired or cannot be paired with any available boot. The only remaining options are '?' boots pairing with other '?' boots. This uses up any remaining flexible boots optimally.\n\nThis strategy ensures that boots with fewer matching options are prioritized, leading to the maximum possible number of pairs. Each boot index is used at most once because we `pop()` elements from the lists as they are paired.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 7`\n`l = abaca?b`\n`r = zabbbcc`\n\n1.  **Categorize Boots:**\n    `left_boots`: `a:[1,3,5]`, `b:[2,7]`, `c:[4]`, `?`:[6]\n    `right_boots`: `z:[1]`, `a:[2]`, `b:[3,4,5]`, `c:[6,7]`\n\n2.  **Phase 1 (c-c):**\n    *   'a': `left_boots['a'] = [1,3,5]`, `right_boots['a'] = [2]`. Pair (5,2).\n        `left_boots['a'] = [1,3]`, `right_boots['a'] = []`.\n    *   'b': `left_boots['b'] = [2,7]`, `right_boots['b'] = [3,4,5]`. Pair (7,5), (2,4).\n        `left_boots['b'] = []`, `right_boots['b'] = [3]`.\n    *   'c': `left_boots['c'] = [4]`, `right_boots['c'] = [6,7]`. Pair (4,7).\n        `left_boots['c'] = []`, `right_boots['c'] = [6]`.\n    `pairs = [(5,2), (7,5), (2,4), (4,7)]`\n\n3.  **Phase 2 (c-?):**\n    `right_boots['?']` is empty. No pairs formed.\n\n4.  **Phase 3 (?-c):**\n    *   'b': `left_boots['?'] = [6]`, `right_boots['b'] = [3]`. Pair (6,3).\n        `left_boots['?'] = []`, `right_boots['b'] = []`.\n    *   'c': `left_boots['?']` is empty. No pairs formed.\n    *   'z': `left_boots['?']` is empty. No pairs formed.\n    `pairs = [(5,2), (7,5), (2,4), (4,7), (6,3)]`\n\n5.  **Phase 4 (?-?):**\n    `left_boots['?']` is empty. No pairs formed.\n\nTotal pairs: 5. This matches the example output's count. The specific pairs might differ, but the total count is maximal.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) because we iterate through the input strings once to populate lists, and then each boot index is processed (popped from a list and added to `pairs`) at most once across all phases. There are a constant number of color categories (26 letters + 1 for '?').\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the boot indices in the `left_boots`, `right_boots`, and `pairs` lists.\n\nThis solution is efficient enough for `N` up to 150,000.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # left_boots[0-25] for 'a'-'z', left_boots[26] for '?'\n    left_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n    right_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    # Populate lists with 1-based indices\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_boots[26].append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            left_boots[ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i + 1)\n\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_boots[26].append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            right_boots[ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Phase 1: Exact specific color matches (c with c)\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[c_idx] and right_boots[c_idx]:\n            l_idx = left_boots[c_idx].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots[c_idx].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Specific left boots with '?' right boots (c with ?)\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[c_idx] and right_boots[26]:\n            l_idx = left_boots[c_idx].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots[26].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: '?' left boots with specific right boots (? with c)\n    for c_idx in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[26] and right_boots[c_idx]:\n            l_idx = left_boots[26].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots[c_idx].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 4: '?' with '?'\n    while left_boots[26] and right_boots[26]:\n        l_idx = left_boots[26].pop()\n        r_idx = right_boots[26].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
