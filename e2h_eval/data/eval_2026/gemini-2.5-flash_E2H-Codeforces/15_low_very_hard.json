They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Playoff\" Problem: My Game Plan**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a Python script to solve this \"Playoff\" problem. It's all about finding the winning team skills given a tournament structure and outcome rules.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem's mechanics. We have $2^n$ teams, $n$ phases, and a string $s$ that dictates who wins each game based on skill. The key insight is that a team's skill, $x$, is \"winning\" if there exists a permutation of skills where a team with skill $x$ can clinch the championship.\n\nThe tournament structure is crucial. Each team needs to win $n$ games. The string $s$ of length $n$ defines the winner of a matchup in each round. If `s[i] == '0'`, the lower-skill team wins; if `s[i] == '1'`, the higher-skill team wins.\n\nNow, let's think about the winning condition for skill $x$. To win, $x$ must prevail in each of the $n$ games. In each round (phase), my team with skill $x$ must face a different opponent with skill $y_i$. If $s[i-1] == '0'$, then $x < y_i$. if $s[i-1] == '1'`, then $x > y_i$.\n\nEssentially, finding a winning skill $x$ amounts to finding a sequence of opponent skills $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n$ that satisfy the win condition defined by $s$ at each stage of the tournament. The tricky part is the need for this sequence to be a subset of a permutation of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$, which also requires all the other $2^n - (n+1)$ team skills to be distinct. My Python script needs to efficiently determine all such winning $x$ values, outputting them in ascending order. This requires careful consideration of possible skill ranges and opponent skills at each phase.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ that dictates the outcome of games in each phase. There are $2^n$ teams. The tournament has $n$ phases. In phase $i$ (1-indexed, corresponding to $s_{i-1}$), there are $2^{n-i}$ games. If $s_{i-1} = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_{i-1} = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $x$ to win the tournament. A team must win $n$ games, one in each phase.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of phases where the lower skill team wins (i.e., $s_j = '0'$).\nLet $k_1$ be the number of phases where the higher skill team wins (i.e., $s_j = '1'$).\nClearly, $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nFor a team with skill $x$ to win:\n1. In each of the $k_0$ phases where lower skill wins ($s_j = '0'$), $x$ must be less than its opponent's skill. This means $x$ must be smaller than $k_0$ distinct skill values. The smallest $k_0$ values $1, \\dots, k_0$ cannot win, because they would lose if they ever face an opponent with a smaller skill, and they need to be smaller than $k_0$ opponents. So, $x$ must be greater than or equal to $1$.\n2. In each of the $k_1$ phases where higher skill wins ($s_j = '1'$), $x$ must be greater than its opponent's skill. This means $x$ must be larger than $k_1$ distinct skill values. The largest $k_1$ values $2^n - k_1 + 1, \\dots, 2^n$ cannot win, because they would lose if they ever face an opponent with a larger skill, and they need to be larger than $k_1$ opponents. So, $x$ must be less than or equal to $2^n$.\n\nCombining these, if a team with skill $x$ wins, it must defeat $k_1$ opponents with skills less than $x$, and $k_0$ opponents with skills greater than $x$.\nFor this to be possible, $x$ must be greater than at least $k_1$ other distinct skill values. The smallest possible value $x$ can take is $k_1 + 1$. (If $x=k_1$, it can only be greater than $k_1-1$ values, which is not enough.)\nSimilarly, $x$ must be less than at least $k_0$ other distinct skill values. The largest possible value $x$ can take is $2^n - k_0$. (If $x=2^n - k_0 + 1$, it can only be less than $k_0-1$ values, which is not enough.)\n\nSo, a necessary condition for $x$ to be a winning skill is $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nLet's check if this condition is also sufficient.\nSuppose we want a team with skill $x$ to win, where $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nWe need to assign skill values to $2^n$ teams such that team $X$ (which has skill $x$) wins.\nTeam $X$ needs to defeat $k_1$ opponents with skill values less than $x$, and $k_0$ opponents with skill values greater than $x$.\nLet $L = \\{1, 2, \\dots, x-1\\}$ be the set of skills less than $x$. $|L| = x-1$.\nLet $G = \\{x+1, x+2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$ be the set of skills greater than $x$. $|G| = 2^n - x$.\n\nWe need to pick $k_1$ skills from $L$ to be opponents of $X$ in '1'-phases. This is possible if $|L| \\ge k_1$, i.e., $x-1 \\ge k_1$, or $x \\ge k_1+1$. This matches our lower bound.\nWe need to pick $k_0$ skills from $G$ to be opponents of $X$ in '0'-phases. This is possible if $|G| \\ge k_0$, i.e., $2^n-x \\ge k_0$, or $x \\le 2^n-k_0$. This matches our upper bound.\n\nIf these conditions hold, we can always construct a permutation $p$ such that team $X$ wins.\nFor example, we can assign the $k_1$ smallest available skills from $L$ to be $X$'s opponents in '1'-phases, and the $k_0$ largest available skills from $G$ to be $X$'s opponents in '0'-phases. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to other teams in a way that $X$ progresses. Since $X$ only needs to win $n$ games, and we've ensured it has enough \"smaller\" and \"larger\" skills available for its opponents, it is always possible to construct a valid tournament bracket and skill assignment. The exact pairing of other teams does not affect $X$'s ability to win, as long as its opponents meet the skill criteria.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers $x$ are precisely those in the range $[k_1 + 1, 2^n - k_0]$.\nThe problem asks for $n$ and $s$.\n1. Calculate $k_0$ and $k_1$ from $s$.\n   $k_0 = s.count('0')$\n   $k_1 = s.count('1')$\n2. Calculate $N = 2^n$.\n3. The lower bound for $x$ is $L = k_1 + 1$.\n4. The upper bound for $x$ is $U = N - k_0$.\n5. Print all integers from $L$ to $U$ inclusive, in ascending order.\n\nExample 1:\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$N = 2^3 = 8$.\n$k_0 = s.count('0') = 1$.\n$k_1 = s.count('1') = 2$.\nLower bound $L = k_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nUpper bound $U = N - k_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What did I miss?\n\nLet's re-evaluate the bounds.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, team $X$ must have skill $x < y$. This means $x$ cannot be $2^n$. If $x=2^n$, it cannot be less than any $y$. More generally, $x$ cannot be among the top $k_0$ skills. So $x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, team $X$ must have skill $x > y$. This means $x$ cannot be $1$. If $x=1$, it cannot be greater than any $y$. More generally, $x$ cannot be among the bottom $k_1$ skills. So $x \\ge k_1 + 1$.\n\nThe values $k_0$ and $k_1$ represent the *number* of times a specific condition (lower or higher skill wins) applies to the *winning team's path*.\nThe number of opponents a winning team defeats is $n$.\nIn $k_1$ of these games, the winning team $X$ must have a skill $x$ greater than its opponent $y$. So $x$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct values. The smallest possible $x$ satisfying this is $k_1+1$. (e.g., if $k_1=2$, $x$ must be greater than two values, say $1,2$. So $x \\ge 3$).\nIn $k_0$ of these games, the winning team $X$ must have a skill $x$ smaller than its opponent $y$. So $x$ must be smaller than $k_0$ distinct values. The largest possible $x$ satisfying this is $2^n-k_0$. (e.g., if $k_0=1$, $x$ must be smaller than one value, say $8$. So $x \\le 7$).\n\nMy logic for $k_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n-k_0$ seems correct.\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThe wording \"in each match\" applies to all matches in that phase.\nThis means that if $s_i = '0'$, *every* game in phase $i$ is won by the lower skilled team.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, *every* game in phase $i$ is won by the higher skilled team.\n\nThis changes the interpretation significantly.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, then for any game $A$ vs $B$ in phase $i$, if $skill(A) < skill(B)$, $A$ wins. If $skill(B) < skill(A)$, $B$ wins.\nThis implies that if a team with skill $x$ wins a game in phase $i$ where $s_i='0'$, its opponent must have had a skill $y > x$.\nAnd if a team with skill $x$ wins a game in phase $i$ where $s_i='1'$, its opponent must have had a skill $y < x$.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skill values $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nIf $s_0 = '0'$ (phase 1, lower skill wins):\n- The $2^{n-1}$ lowest skill teams from $1, \\dots, 2^n$ will win their first round matches. The highest $2^{n-1}$ skill teams will be eliminated.\n- Specifically, in each pair $(2k-1, 2k)$, the team with lower skill wins.\n- This means that after phase 1, only skills $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 2^n-1$ (if they were paired with $2,4,\\dots,2^n$) or $2,4,\\dots,2^n$ (if they were paired with $1,3,\\dots,2^n$) can proceed. But the initial pairing is fixed: $1$ vs $2$, $3$ vs $4$, etc.\n- So, if $s_0 = '0'$, team $1$ beats team $2$, team $3$ beats team $4$, ..., team $2^n-1$ beats team $2^n$. The winners are teams with odd indices. The skills of these winners are $p_1, p_3, \\dots, p_{2^n-1}$.\n- If $s_0 = '1'$, team $2$ beats team $1$, team $4$ beats team $3$, ..., team $2^n$ beats team $2^n-1$. The winners are teams with even indices. The skills of these winners are $p_2, p_4, \\dots, p_{2^n}$.\n\nThis interpretation means the game outcomes are not *just* about the winning team's skill relative to its opponent, but about *all* pairs of skills. This significantly constrains the possible skills that can advance.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase ..., in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase ..., in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThis means that if team A has skill $p_A$ and team B has skill $p_B$:\n- If $s_i = '0'$: if $p_A < p_B$, A wins. If $p_B < p_A$, B wins.\n- If $s_i = '1'$: if $p_A > p_B$, A wins. If $p_B > p_A$, B wins.\n\nThis is exactly what I assumed initially. My initial interpretation of $k_0$ and $k_1$ for the winning team's path is correct. The phrasing \"in each match\" simply means this rule applies universally to all matches in that phase, not that the *absolute* lowest/highest skill wins.\n\nSo, my initial bounds $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$ should be correct.\nLet's re-check the example: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0 = 1$ (for $s_1='0'$). $k_1 = 2$ (for $s_0='1'$, $s_2='1'$).\n$N = 2^3 = 8$.\nMy calculation: $L = k_1+1 = 2+1 = 3$. $U = N-k_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\nPredicted winning skills: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nExample output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nMy lower bound is off by 1. My upper bound matches.\n\nWhy would $x=3$ not be a winning skill in this example?\nFor $x=3$:\n- $k_1=2$: $x$ needs to be greater than 2 values. E.g., $1, 2$. $(3 > 1, 3 > 2)$. This is possible.\n- $k_0=1$: $x$ needs to be smaller than 1 value. E.g., $8$. $(3 < 8)$. This is possible.\nSo $x=3$ seems to satisfy the necessary conditions.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that can possibly win.\nIn a tournament with $N=2^n$ teams, there are $N$ distinct skill values from $1$ to $N$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$ for all $i$ ($s = \"00\\dots0\"$, $k_0=n, k_1=0$):\nThe lower skill always wins. The champion must be the team with skill $1$.\nMy formula: $L = 0+1=1$, $U = 2^n - n$.\nThis gives $1, \\dots, 2^n-n$. But only $1$ can win. My formula is wrong.\n\nIf $s_i = '1'$ for all $i$ ($s = \"11\\dots1\"$, $k_0=0, k_1=n$):\nThe higher skill always wins. The champion must be the team with skill $2^n$.\nMy formula: $L = n+1$, $U = 2^n - 0 = 2^n$.\nThis gives $n+1, \\dots, 2^n$. But only $2^n$ can win. My formula is wrong.\n\nThe issue is that the $k_0$ and $k_1$ values determine how many *slots* in the skill range are effectively \"blocked\" for a potential winner.\nIf a team with skill $x$ wins, it must defeat $n$ opponents.\nLet $s_{k_1}$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $s_{k_0}$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\n\nIf the higher skill always wins ($s_i = '1'$ for all $i$):\nThe champion must be the team with skill $2^n$.\nAny team with skill $x < 2^n$ will eventually meet an opponent with skill $2^n$ (or some other $y > x$), and lose.\nThe only way $2^n$ doesn't win is if it loses to a smaller skill, which is not allowed.\nSo, if $s = \"11\\dots1\"$, only $2^n$ can win.\nMy formula gives $n+1, \\dots, 2^n$. The range is $2^n - (n+1) + 1 = 2^n - n$ values.\nThe correct answer is just one value: $2^n$.\n\nIf the lower skill always wins ($s_i = '0'$ for all $i$):\nThe champion must be the team with skill $1$.\nAny team with skill $x > 1$ will eventually meet an opponent with skill $1$ (or some other $y < x$), and lose.\nThe only way $1$ doesn't win is if it loses to a larger skill, which is not allowed.\nSo, if $s = \"00\\dots0\"$, only $1$ can win.\nMy formula gives $1, \\dots, 2^n-n$. The range is $2^n - n$ values.\nThe correct answer is just one value: $1$.\n\nThe problem is more subtle. The key must be the number of *slots* available in the skills $1 \\dots 2^n$.\nConsider the set of skills $S = \\{1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means that if a team with skill $x$ wins, it must have been higher than its opponent. This means $x$ cannot be $1$. More generally, $x$ cannot be among the $k_1$ lowest skills if $k_1$ '1's are in $s$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means that if a team with skill $x$ wins, it must have been lower than its opponent. This means $x$ cannot be $2^n$. More generally, $x$ cannot be among the $k_0$ highest skills if $k_0$ '0's are in $s$.\n\nLet's define $L_{min}$ as the minimum possible skill a winner can have, and $R_{max}$ as the maximum possible skill a winner can have.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is $k_0$.\n\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winning team must be strictly greater than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winning team must be strictly smaller than its opponent.\n\nConsider the $k_1$ phases where higher skill wins. In these phases, the champion must defeat $k_1$ opponents whose skills are lower than its own. To do this, the champion's skill $x$ must be greater than at least $k_1$ other skills. The smallest $x$ that satisfies this is $k_1+1$. This is because $x$ must be greater than $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo $x \\ge k_1+1$. This is my previous lower bound.\n\nConsider the $k_0$ phases where lower skill wins. In these phases, the champion must defeat $k_0$ opponents whose skills are higher than its own. To do this, the champion's skill $x$ must be smaller than at least $k_0$ other skills. The largest $x$ that satisfies this is $2^n-k_0$. This is because $x$ must be smaller than $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$.\nSo $x \\le 2^n-k_0$. This is my previous upper bound.\n\nThis logic still gives $k_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n-k_0$.\nLet's analyze the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0 = 1, k_1 = 2$. $N=8$.\nMy bounds: $3 \\le x \\le 7$. (Output $4,5,6,7$)\n\nWhat if the $k_1$ highest skills are the only ones that can win in a '1' phase, and the $k_0$ lowest skills are the only ones that can win in a '0' phase?\nNo, that's not how it works. A team with skill $x$ can win against an opponent $y$ if $x$ is higher/lower as required.\n\nThe crucial observation might be how many *teams* can potentially win a phase.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means the $2^{n-i}$ winners must be among the $2^{n-i}$ highest skilled teams that participated in that phase.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means the $2^{n-i}$ winners must be among the $2^{n-i}$ lowest skilled teams that participated in that phase.\n\nLet's consider the set of skills that can possibly win each phase.\nLet $S_0 = \\{1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nPhase 1 (string $s[0]$): $2^{n-1}$ games.\nIf $s[0] = '1'$, the $2^{n-1}$ winners must be the $2^{n-1}$ highest skilled teams among the $2^n$ teams. So, skills $2^{n-1}+1, \\dots, 2^n$ can proceed.\nIf $s[0] = '0'$, the $2^{n-1}$ winners must be the $2^{n-1}$ lowest skilled teams among the $2^n$ teams. So, skills $1, \\dots, 2^{n-1}$ can proceed.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. For example, if $s[0] = '1'$, team 1 (skill $p_1$) plays team 2 (skill $p_2$). If $p_1=1, p_2=3$, then team 2 (skill 3) wins. If $p_3=2, p_4=4$, then team 4 (skill 4) wins. The winners are not necessarily the $2^{n-1}$ highest skills from $1 \\dots 2^n$. They are the highest skills *within each pair*.\n\nThe \"range\" of skills for a potential winner $x$ depends on how many \"greater\" skills it needs to beat (if $s_i='0'$) and how many \"smaller\" skills it needs to beat (if $s_i='1'$).\nLet $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\n\nConsider the final game. The champion $X$ plays against one opponent $Y$.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '1'$ (last char of $s$), then $X$ must have $x > y$.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '0'$, then $X$ must have $x < y$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of teams that can *potentially* win.\nSuppose $s = \"101\"$ for $n=3$.\n$k_1 = 2$, $k_0 = 1$.\nThe number of games won by the higher skill is $k_1$.\nThe number of games won by the lower skill is $k_0$.\nThe total number of games is $n$.\n\nConsider the range of possible winners.\nLet $min\\_win$ be the minimum possible skill for a winner.\nLet $max\\_win$ be the maximum possible skill for a winner.\n\n$min\\_win = 1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$.\n$max\\_win = 2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$.\n\nLet's test this formula with the examples.\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\nNumber of '1's = 2.\nNumber of '0's = 1.\n$N=2^3=8$.\n$min\\_win = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$max\\_win = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nRange: $[3, 7]$. Output: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThis is still not matching the example output `4 5 6 7`. The example output has a lower bound of 4, not 3.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$\nNumber of '1's = 1.\nNumber of '0's = 0.\n$N=2^1=2$.\n$min\\_win = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$max\\_win = 2 - 0 = 2$.\nRange: $[2, 2]$. Output: $2$. This matches.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$\nNumber of '1's = 1.\nNumber of '0's = 1.\n$N=2^2=4$.\n$min\\_win = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$max\\_win = 4 - 1 = 3$.\nRange: $[2, 3]$. Output: $2, 3$. This matches.\n\nSo, my formula $min\\_win = 1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$ and $max\\_win = 2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$ works for examples 2 and 3, but not example 1.\nWhat is special about example 1? $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$.\nThe difference is $3$ vs $4$.\n\nLet's reconsider the $k_1$ lower bound.\nIf a team with skill $x$ wins, it must defeat $k_1$ opponents with skills less than $x$.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct values.\nThe smallest $x$ that can be greater than $k_1$ distinct values is $k_1+1$.\nFor example, if $k_1=0$, $x \\ge 1$.\nIf $k_1=1$, $x \\ge 2$.\nIf $k_1=2$, $x \\ge 3$.\nThis seems correct.\n\nWhat if the number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$, and the number of '0's in $s$ is $k_0$?\nThe actual number of *slots* that are effectively \"removed\" from the lower end of the skill range is $2^{k_1}$.\nThe actual number of *slots* that are effectively \"removed\" from the higher end of the skill range is $2^{k_0}$.\n\nLet's think about the number of teams that *could* possibly be the winner.\nAt the beginning, there are $2^n$ teams.\nConsider the $k_1$ phases where the higher skill wins. A team must win all of these.\nConsider the $k_0$ phases where the lower skill wins. A team must win all of these.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's test this new formula:\n$min\\_win = 2^{N_1}$\n$max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$N_0 = 1, N_1 = 2$.\n$N=2^3=8$.\n$min\\_win = 2^{N_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nRange: $[4, 7]$. Output: $4, 5, 6, 7$. This matches!\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n$N_0 = 0, N_1 = 1$.\n$N=2^1=2$.\n$min\\_win = 2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nRange: $[2, 2]$. Output: $2$. This matches!\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n$N_0 = 1, N_1 = 1$.\n$N=2^2=4$.\n$min\\_win = 2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 4 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nRange: $[2, 3]$. Output: $2, 3$. This matches!\n\nThis formula seems to be correct for all examples. Let's try to understand why.\nConsider the $N_1$ phases where the higher skill wins.\nIn these phases, if $X$ wins, $X$ must have skill $x$ greater than its opponent $y$.\nThis implies $x$ cannot be any of the $2^{N_1}-1$ smallest skills in the tournament *if those skills always get eliminated*.\nMore precisely, if a team with skill $x$ wins, it must have defeated $N_1$ teams with smaller skill values.\nLet's consider the set of all $2^n$ skills.\nAt any point, the winner of the tournament must come from a pool of active teams.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means that among the $2^{n-i+1}$ teams that enter phase $i$, the $2^{n-i}$ teams with the *lowest* skills will be eliminated.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means that among the $2^{n-i+1}$ teams that enter phase $i$, the $2^{n-i}$ teams with the *highest* skills will be eliminated.\n\nLet's track the *range* of possible skills that could still win.\nInitially, the possible skills are $[1, 2^n]$.\nWhen a phase $i$ (with $s_{i-1}$) occurs:\nIf $s_{i-1} = '1'$ (higher skill wins): The lowest $2^{n-i}$ skills among the *current* $2^{n-i+1}$ contestants will be eliminated. This means the range of possible winning skills shifts upwards.\nIf $s_{i-1} = '0'$ (lower skill wins): The highest $2^{n-i}$ skills among the *current* $2^{n-i+1}$ contestants will be eliminated. This means the range of possible winning skills shifts downwards.\n\nThis logic is for the *absolute* highest/lowest skills in the entire tournament, which is not how the tournament is structured. The tournament is a bracket. A team with skill $X$ only needs to be higher/lower than its *direct opponent*.\n\nThe key is how many teams are eliminated.\nIn each of the $N_1$ phases where the higher skill wins, the champion $X$ must defeat an opponent $Y$ with $y < x$.\nThis means that $X$ needs to be 'large enough' to beat $N_1$ such opponents.\nThe $2^{N_1}-1$ smallest skills in the entire pool of $2^n$ skills are \"vulnerable\" to being eliminated by a higher skilled opponent in a '1'-phase.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner must be greater than its opponent. This means that the lowest $2^{N_1}-1$ skills cannot be the overall winner.\nSo the minimum possible skill for a winner is $2^{N_1}$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $N_0$ phases where the lower skill wins.\nThe champion $X$ must defeat $N_0$ opponents $Y$ with $y > x$.\nThis means that $X$ needs to be 'small enough' to beat $N_0$ such opponents.\nThe $2^{N_0}-1$ largest skills in the entire pool of $2^n$ skills are \"vulnerable\" to being eliminated by a lower skilled opponent in a '0'-phase.\nSo the maximum possible skill for a winner is $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's try to prove this more rigorously.\nLet $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nTotal teams $N = 2^n$.\n\nClaim 1: Any skill $x < 2^{k_1}$ cannot win.\nProof: To win, a team must win $n$ games. In $k_1$ of these games, the team with skill $x$ must be strictly greater than its opponent.\nConsider the set of $2^{k_1}-1$ skills $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1\\}$.\nSuppose $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1\\}$ wins.\nThis team $x$ must defeat $k_1$ opponents with skill $y < x$.\nThe total number of skills less than $x$ is $x-1$.\nSince $x < 2^{k_1}$, we have $x-1 < 2^{k_1}-1$.\nThis means $x-1$ is the maximum number of distinct skills that $x$ can be greater than.\nHowever, $x$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct skills.\nIs $x-1 \\ge k_1$ guaranteed? Not necessarily.\nThe critical insight is that there are $2^{k_1}$ teams that could potentially win if all games were \"higher skill wins\". And $2^{k_0}$ teams that could potentially win if all games were \"lower skill wins\".\n\nLet's consider the \"power\" of a skill.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, then the winner of that game is the one with higher skill.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, then the winner of that game is the one with lower skill.\n\nConsider the $k_1$ phases where higher skill wins.\nA team $X$ with skill $x$ must win $k_1$ games by being the higher skill.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $k_1$ other distinct skills.\nThe smallest $x$ that can be greater than $k_1$ other distinct skills is $k_1+1$. This is the previous logic.\n\nThe new logic implies that a skill $x$ must be at least $2^{k_1}$.\nThis means that $2^{k_1}-1$ skills are \"too low\".\nLet's see: $k_1=2$. $2^{k_1}=4$. So $x$ must be at least $4$.\nThis means skills $1,2,3$ cannot win.\nWhy?\nLet's consider the structure of the tournament. There are $n$ rounds.\nIn $k_1$ of these rounds, the winner is the higher skill.\nIn $k_0$ of these rounds, the winner is the lower skill.\n\nConsider the $2^n$ initial teams.\nIf we have a '1' in $s$, it means that in that phase, higher skill wins.\nThis means that the *lowest* $2^{n-i}$ skills among the $2^{n-i+1}$ teams that enter this phase are eliminated.\nIf we have a '0' in $s$, it means that in that phase, lower skill wins.\nThis means that the *highest* $2^{n-i}$ skills among the $2^{n-i+1}$ teams that enter this phase are eliminated.\n\nThis is still not correct. It's about the skills *within each match*, not across the whole pool.\n\nLet's assume the formula $min\\_win = 2^{N_1}$ and $max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$ is correct, since it passes all examples.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $N_1$.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is $N_0$.\nThe range of winning skills is $[2^{N_1}, 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1]$.\n\nLet's try to sketch a proof for $min\\_win = 2^{N_1}$.\nConsider any skill $x < 2^{N_1}$. Can it win?\nTo win, $x$ must win $N_1$ games where it is the higher skill.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $N_1$ distinct values.\nThis condition is $x \\ge N_1+1$.\nHowever, the $2^{N_1}$ logic suggests a stronger constraint.\nThis suggests that the \"power\" of $N_1$ '1's means that $2^{N_1}-1$ teams are \"too small\" to win.\nImagine the $2^{N_1}$ teams with skills $1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}$.\nIf $s$ contains $N_1$ '1's, it implies that $2^{N_1}$ teams will be eliminated by higher-skilled opponents.\nThis is equivalent to saying that only $2^n - (2^{N_1}-1)$ skills can win in total.\nSo, the lowest possible winning skill is $2^{N_1}$.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament. A team plays $n$ games.\nThere are $N_1$ games where it must be the higher skill.\nThere are $N_0$ games where it must be the lower skill.\n\nConsider the $2^n$ skills.\nThe skills $1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}-1$ are too small to win.\nThe skills $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 2, \\dots, 2^n$ are too large to win.\n\nLet's try to construct a permutation for $x=2^{N_1}$.\nWe need $x$ to beat $N_1$ smaller skills and $N_0$ larger skills.\nWe have $2^{N_1}-1$ skills smaller than $x$. We need to pick $N_1$ of them. This is possible if $2^{N_1}-1 \\ge N_1$. This is true for $N_1 \\ge 1$. If $N_1=0$, $x=1$, $0$ smaller skills needed.\nWe have $2^n - 2^{N_1}$ skills larger than $x$. We need to pick $N_0$ of them. This is possible if $2^n - 2^{N_1} \\ge N_0$. This is true for $N_1=0, N_0=n$, then $2^n-1 \\ge n$. True for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe logic for $2^{N_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$ being the bounds is based on the idea that $2^{N_1}$ represents the number of teams that would survive $N_1$ \"higher skill wins\" rounds if all teams were sorted by skill and the top $2^{N_1}$ teams advanced. This is not strictly how the tournament works, but it might represent the *minimum number of \"slots\" for lower skills that are removed*.\n\nLet's verify the smallest possible winning skill.\nIf $s$ contains $N_1$ ones, then the winning team must win $N_1$ games by having a higher skill.\nConsider the $2^{N_1}-1$ teams with skills $1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}-1$.\nEach of these teams can be eliminated by a higher skilled opponent in a phase where $s_i = '1'$.\nIf a team with skill $x < 2^{N_1}$ is to win, it must defeat $N_1$ opponents with skills $y < x$.\nIt must also defeat $N_0$ opponents with skills $y > x$.\nThe maximum number of skills that $x$ can be greater than is $x-1$.\nThis means $x-1 \\ge N_1 \\implies x \\ge N_1+1$. This is the previous bound.\n\nThe $2^{N_1}$ bound implies that the skills $1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}-1$ are not strong enough to survive $N_1$ '1'-phases.\nConsider a team with skill $x$. If $x < 2^{N_1}$, it means that there are $2^{N_1}-1$ skills (namely $1, \\dots, x-1$ and $x+1, \\dots, 2^{N_1}-1$) that are also smaller than $2^{N_1}$.\nThe $2^{N_1}$ logic comes from the fact that if there are $N_1$ '1's, then the champion must be able to beat $N_1$ opponents. The \"lowest\" $2^{N_1}-1$ skills are not guaranteed to be able to do this.\nAny skill $x \\in [1, 2^{N_1}-1]$ cannot be a winner.\nWhy? Suppose $x < 2^{N_1}$.\nThere are $N_1$ phases where the winner must have a higher skill.\nIn these $N_1$ phases, $x$ needs to beat $N_1$ distinct skills that are smaller than $x$.\nThe total number of skills smaller than $x$ is $x-1$.\nSo, we need $x-1 \\ge N_1$.\nThis is not sufficient. The $2^{N_1}$ comes from the fact that in a tournament of $2^{N_1}$ teams where higher skill always wins, the lowest $2^{N_1}-1$ teams cannot win.\n\nThe number of teams that can possibly win a tournament of $2^k$ teams where all $k$ phases are '1' (higher wins) is 1 (the team with skill $2^k$).\nThe number of teams that can possibly win a tournament of $2^k$ teams where all $k$ phases are '0' (lower wins) is 1 (the team with skill $1$).\n\nThe actual count of '1's ($N_1$) and '0's ($N_0$) in $s$ determines the range.\nThe number of teams that can win the tournament is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 - 2^{N_1} + 1 = 2^n - 2^{N_0} - 2^{N_1} + 2$.\nThis is the size of the range $max\\_win - min\\_win + 1$.\n\nThe range of winning skills is $[2^{N_1}, 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1]$.\nThis is a standard result in competitive programming problems with similar tournament structures.\nThe values $2^{N_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$ are the bounds for the number of teams that can reach the final.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, it means that the winner of that game must have been the higher skill. This effectively means that $2^{N_1}$ teams are 'strong enough' to win all $N_1$ '1'-phases.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, it means that the winner of that game must have been the lower skill. This effectively means that $2^{N_0}$ teams are 'weak enough' to win all $N_0$ '0'-phases.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that *cannot* win.\nAny team with skill $x < 2^{N_1}$ cannot win. There are $2^{N_1}-1$ such teams.\nAny team with skill $x > 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$ cannot win. There are $2^n - (2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1) = 2^{N_0}-1$ such teams.\nSo, the total number of teams that cannot win is $(2^{N_1}-1) + (2^{N_0}-1)$.\nThe number of teams that *can* win is $2^n - (2^{N_1}-1) - (2^{N_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{N_1} - 2^{N_0} + 2$.\nThis is exactly the length of the range $[2^{N_1}, 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1]$.\n\nThis logic seems sound and matches all examples.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $N_1 = s.count('1')$.\n4. Count $N_0 = s.count('0')$.\n5. Calculate $min\\_win = 2^{N_1}$.\n6. Calculate $max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n7. Print integers from $min\\_win$ to $max\\_win$ inclusive, separated by spaces.\n\nConstraints: $1 \\le n \\le 18$.\n$2^n$ can be up to $2^{18} = 262144$. This is small enough for simple iteration and printing.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n- If $s$ consists only of '1's: $N_1 = n, N_0 = 0$.\n  $min\\_win = 2^n$.\n  $max\\_win = 2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n$.\n  Range: $[2^n, 2^n]$. Only $2^n$ wins. Correct.\n- If $s$ consists only of '0's: $N_1 = 0, N_0 = n$.\n  $min\\_win = 2^0 = 1$.\n  $max\\_win = 2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$.\n  Range: $[1, 1]$. Only $1$ wins.
