Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the plan for solving the New Year Candles problem.** I need a Python script to figure out the maximum hours Vasily can light up his room, given some initial candles and a crafting ratio.\n\n**Understanding the Core Idea:** The key is to simulate the process. Vasily starts with some candles, burns them, gets burnt-out candles, and then crafts new candles based on a crafting ratio. This cycle repeats until he can't make any more. This seems like a textbook greedy approach – at each step, we want to maximize the time by using all available candles.\n\n**Input and Output:** The input will be the initial candles (`a`) and the crafting ratio (`b`). The output should be the maximum total hours the room can be lit.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Initialize:** Start with `total_hours = a`, because those initial candles all burn. Also, `burnt_out_candles = a`.\n2.  **Iterative Process:** We'll use a `while` loop that continues as long as `burnt_out_candles` is enough to make *at least* one new candle (i.e., `burnt_out_candles >= b`). Inside the loop:\n    *   Calculate `new_candles = burnt_out_candles // b` (integer division).\n    *   Add the `new_candles` to `total_hours` (because each new candle contributes an hour).\n    *   Update `burnt_out_candles`: `burnt_out_candles = (burnt_out_candles % b) + new_candles`\n        - The new value will be the remainder from the previous crafting (those that weren't enough for new candles) plus the new candles that are just burnt out.\n3.  **Return `total_hours`:** Once we can't make any more candles, the loop stops, and the total is returned.\n\n**Let's Trace an Example:** If `a=4, b=2`,\n1.  Start with 4 hours, and 4 burnt-out candles\n2.  Can make 2 new candles (4 // 2 = 2)\n3.  Add 2 hours, total is now 6. Then we get 0 burnt out plus the 2 new candles we just burnt out, which makes 2.\n4.  Can make 1 new candle (2 // 2 = 1)\n5.  Add 1 hour, total is now 7. Then we get 0 burnt out plus the 1 new candle we just burnt out, which makes 1.\n6. Can't make a new candle because 1 < 2, the process stops.\n7. Total is 7.\n\nThis process feels correct and efficiently captures the repeated crafting of new candles. The `while` loop ensures we're maximizing the time at each step.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  Read the input (a and b) from standard input.\n2.  Run the iterative loop to calculate the total hours.\n3.  Print the total hours.\n\n**Edge Cases and Optimizations:**\nThe constraints say that a and b are less than or equal to 1000.  The loop will terminate fairly quickly because we are using integer division and always *using* candles. There's no risk of overflow because the numbers stay relatively small. I'll test the cases: `1 2`, `1000 1000` and `1000 2` as test cases. I'll also read the test cases from `stdin` as they are described. It looks like it.\n",
