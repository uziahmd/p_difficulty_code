Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it's pretty straightforward once you analyze it. The goal is to figure out the total number of hours Vasily can light up the room, given an initial number of candles and how many burnt-out ones it takes to make a new one. This screams *simulation* to me.\n\nI need to keep track of three key things: the `total_hours` the room is lit, the `current_new_candles` Vasily has, and the `burnt_out_candles` he's accumulating. The core of the solution will be an iterative process.\n\nHere's how I see it:\n\n1.  **Burn Phase:** I start by burning all the `current_new_candles`, adding that number directly to the `total_hours`. As they burn, they become `burnt_out_candles`.\n2.  **Conversion Phase:** Then, I figure out how many new candles I can make from the `burnt_out_candles`. It's a simple integer division (`//`) to find `new_candles_made`. The remainder (`%`) tells me how many burnt-out candles are left over.\n3.  **Repeat:** I keep repeating this burn-and-make cycle as long as I have new candles (`current_new_candles > 0`). If I run out of new candles and can't make any more, that's it - the process stops.\n\nThe walkthrough helps solidify this. Let's say I start with 4 candles and need 2 burnt-out ones to make a new one. First, I burn those 4 candles, adding 4 hours to the total. Then, those 4 candles become burnt-out, which lets me make 2 new candles. Then I burn those 2 new candles (add 2 more hours), and from those 2 burnt-out candles, I make 1 more. Now I burn that last candle, adding one more hour to the total. I end up with 1 left-over, burnt-out candle, but since I can't make a new one, the process stops. It seems logical.\n\nI should be able to translate this thinking directly into Python, so I can test my understanding. This is going to be pretty easy to implement.\n",
