Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the X-Shape Grid**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to determine if a given character grid forms a specific \"X\" pattern.  I've got the rules clear in my head. Essentially, I need to check for a diagonal element consistency and a non-diagonal element consistency, with the crucial constraint that these two element sets must be different.  I'm dealing with an `n x n` grid, and `n` will always be odd, which simplifies a few things.\n\nMy strategy is to read the grid into a 2D structure, like a list of lists or a list of strings, say `paper`. I'll initialize two variables, `diag_char` and `other_char`, to track the expected characters on the diagonals and off-diagonals respectively.  Initially, these will be `None` to indicate they haven't been set yet.\n\nNow, the core of the algorithm will be a nested loop to iterate through the grid. For each cell `paper[row][col]`, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it *is* on a diagonal (`row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`), I'll compare it to `diag_char`.  If `diag_char` hasn't been set yet, I'll set it to the current cell's character. If it *has* been set, I'll check for equality with the current character; if they don't match, the pattern isn't valid, and I'll immediately exit with \"NO\".\n\nThe same logic applies to non-diagonal elements, comparing them to `other_char`.  After iterating through the entire grid, if no inconsistencies are found, I'll simply check that `diag_char` is *different* from `other_char`. If they are the same, the pattern isn't valid; output \"NO\". If different, it is a valid \"X\"; output \"YES\".\n\nI've already thought through some edge cases and test scenarios. An important consideration is that `n` is odd which means a single element at the center of the grid lies on both diagonals. Also, I need to check for the cases when all elements are the same. My approach seems to handle these edge cases naturally. Let me give this a shot in code!\n",
