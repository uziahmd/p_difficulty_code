She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Challenge of Tab Management: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of this programming puzzle: We're handed a scenario where we need to minimize the time (seconds) taken to selectively close tabs on a device. The device has 'n' tabs, the current cursor position is 'pos', and our target is to keep only tabs within the range [l, r] open. The core actions are: moving the cursor one tab left or right (1 second each), closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (1 second each).\n\nInitially, I identified four key cases:\n\n1.  **Ideal State:** If the range [l, r] already encompasses all the tabs (l=1, r=n), then we just start with an answer of 0.\n\n2.  **Right Cleanup:** If we need to close tabs only to the right (l=1), the time is the absolute difference between 'pos' and 'r' plus 1 (the final closure).\n\n3.  **Left Cleanup:** Similar to the right cleanup, if only tabs to the left need to be closed (r=n), the time is the absolute difference between 'pos' and 'l' plus 1.\n\n4.  **The General Case:** This is where things get interesting. We need to close tabs on both sides. I determined that the most efficient strategy requires a minimum of two seconds to close both sides. The additional time would be dictated by the initial movement of the cursor from the starting position to either side ('l' or 'r'). Then we account for the movement of the cursor to reach the last target. In this case, the total time is represented by: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nI broke down this complex problem into simple steps. It boils down to comparing the cost of closing each side first and picking the shorter route. I carefully analyzed how the dynamic `a` and `b` variables, representing the open tabs' ranges, change with each closure and movement. The total movement must always fall within the boundaries of the currently open tabs. Finally, I confirmed the correctness through thorough example testing. This led me to my final solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each move of the cursor or closing operation takes 1 second. The cursor can only move within the currently unclosed tabs.\n\nLet's break down the problem into different cases:\n\n**Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if the desired segment `[l, r]` already covers all `n` tabs, i.e., `l = 1` and `r = n`.\nIn this case, no operations are needed.\nTime: `0` seconds.\n\n**Case 2: Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l = 1` but `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be moved to tab `r`, and then the \"close right\" operation is performed.\n- The time to move the cursor from its initial position `pos` to `r` is `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- The time to perform the \"close right\" operation (closing `[r+1, n]`) is `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - r) + 1` seconds.\n\n**Case 3: Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `r = n` but `l > 1`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be moved to tab `l`, and then the \"close left\" operation is performed.\n- The time to move the cursor from its initial position `pos` to `l` is `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- The time to perform the \"close left\" operation (closing `[1, l-1]`) is `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n**Case 4: Both tabs to the left of `l` and tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\nThis requires two closing operations, which will cost `2` seconds. Additionally, the cursor must traverse the segment `[l, r]` at least once to be able to perform both closing operations. Traversing `[l, r]` costs `r - l` seconds.\nThere are two main strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now tabs `[l, n]` are open, cursor is at `l`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `r - l` seconds. (Now tabs `[l, n]` are open, cursor is at `r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now tabs `[l, r]` are open).\n    Total time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now tabs `[1, r]` are open, cursor is at `r`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `r - l` seconds. (Now tabs `[1, r]` are open, cursor is at `l`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. (Now tabs `[l, r]` are open).\n    Total time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\nThe minimum time for Case 4 is `min(Strategy A, Strategy B)`.\nNotice that `(r - l) + 2` is common to both strategies. The difference is whether `abs(pos - l)` or `abs(pos - r)` is added. So, we choose the minimum of these two initial movements.\nTotal time: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2` seconds.\n\nThe `a` and `b` parameters in the problem description (minimum/maximum index of unclosed tab) correctly allow these movements. For example, when moving from `l` to `r` after closing the left side, the current `a` is `l` and `b` is `n`. Moving `i -> i+1` is `min(i+1, b)`, which is `min(i+1, n)`. This is valid as long as `i < n`. Since `r <= n`, this movement is always possible. Similar logic applies to other movements.\n\nThe final algorithm is:\n1. Read `n, pos, l, r`.\n2. If `l == 1` and `r == n`, print `0`.\n3. Else if `l == 1`, print `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n4. Else if `r == n`, print `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n5. Else (both `l > 1` and `r < n`), print `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are already within the desired range [l, r].\n    # This means l is 1 and r is n.
