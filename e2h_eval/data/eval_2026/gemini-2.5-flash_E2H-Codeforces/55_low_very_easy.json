Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string, and the only moves I'm allowed are swapping adjacent '0' and '1's or adjacent '1' and '2's.  I can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly.  This means that the *relative order* of '0's and '2's is crucial – they are essentially \"fixed\" in relation to each other.\n\nIf I have \"0...2\", the '0' will always be before the '2'. Conversely, if I have \"2...0\", the '2' will always be before the '0'.  This is the key constraint to keep in mind.\n\nNow, '0's and '1's can freely swap with each other. Similarly, '1's and '2's can also swap with each other. This is like a cascade effect: a '0' can effectively push a '1', and that '1' can then push a '2'.  A '0' can pull a '1' in, which can pull a '2' in.\n\nMy goal is to minimize the string lexicographically, which means I want as many '0's at the beginning as possible, followed by '1's, and finally '2's.  I can easily do this by counting the occurrences of each character: `count_0`, `count_1`, and `count_2`. I know that because '0' and '2' can't move past each other, the '0's will always come before the '2's in the final string.\n\nSo, how do I go about actually constructing this optimal string? I need to think about how to correctly position the 1s and 2s...\n",
    "response": "The key observation for this problem lies in understanding the allowed swaps and their implications on the relative order of characters.\n\nThe allowed swaps are:\n1. '0' and '1' (e.g., \"01\" <-> \"10\")\n2. '1' and '2' (e.g., \"12\" <-> \"21\")\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' *cannot* swap (e.g., \"02\" <-> \"20\" is not allowed).\n\nLet's analyze what this means:\n*   **'0's and '1's**: Since \"01\" <-> \"10\" is allowed, any '0' can move past any '1', and vice versa. This means that if there are no '2's between a '0' and a '1', they can effectively be reordered arbitrarily. More broadly, all '0's and '1's can be rearranged among themselves, as long as they don't cross any '2's.\n*   **'1's and '2's**: Similarly, since \"12\" <-> \"21\" is allowed, any '1' can move past any '2', and vice versa. All '1's and '2's can be rearranged among themselves, as long as they don't cross any '0's.\n*   **'0's and '2's**: Since \"02\" <-> \"20\" is *not* allowed, the relative order of any '0' and any '2' is fixed. If an original '0' appears before an original '2', it will always appear before that '2'. If an original '2' appears before an original '0', it will always appear before that '0'. This is the most important constraint.\n\nThe fixed relative order of '0's and '2's means that we can think of all '0's and '2's as forming a \"backbone\" whose relative positions are immutable. For example, in \"012012\", the '0's and '2's form \"0202\". The first '0' will always be before the first '2', which will always be before the second '0', and so on.\n\nAll '1's, however, are \"mobile\". A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This means a '1' can move anywhere in the string.\nConsider a '1'. It can swap with an adjacent '0' or an adjacent '2'. Through a series of such swaps, a '1' can effectively move to any position in the string, as long as it doesn't try to make a '0' cross a '2' or vice versa. But since '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, they don't impose any restrictions on '0'-'2' relative order.\n\nTherefore, all '1's can be gathered together and placed anywhere in the string.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nSince the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, we cannot move any '0' past a '2' that was originally to its left, nor move any '2' past a '0' that was originally to its right.\n\nThe optimal strategy is:\n1.  Collect all '0's. These will form the prefix of the resulting string, as much as possible.\n2.  Collect all '2's. These will form the suffix of the resulting string, as much as possible.\n3.  All '1's can be moved freely. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place them after all '0's and before all '2's.\n\nHowever, the \"0\" and \"2\" restriction means we can't just put all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's if the original string was \"20\". The output for \"20\" is \"20\", not \"02\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\nThe characters '0' and '2' cannot swap. This means if we filter out all '1's from the original string, the remaining subsequence of '0's and '2's (`s'`) must maintain its relative order. For example, if `s = \"010210\"`, `s'` would be \"0020\". The final string, after placing '1's, must preserve this \"0020\" structure.\n\nAll '1's can be moved past any '0' or any '2'. This means all '1's can be effectively \"pulled\" to the left as much as possible, until they are blocked by the beginning of the string or by a sequence of '0's and '2's that cannot be further shifted to the right.\nSince we want the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put all '0's first. Then, after all '0's that can be moved to the front, we want to put all '1's. Then, finally, '2's.\n\nConsider the string without '1's. Let's call this `s_no_1`. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `s_no_1 = \"0020\"`.\nThe '1's can be inserted anywhere in `s_no_1`. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to insert the '1's as far to the left as possible, but *after* any '0's that are already there.\nSpecifically, all '0's should come first. Then all '1's. Then all '2's.\nThe only constraint is that a '0' cannot move past a '2'.\n\nThis means that any '0' that appears *before* any '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\nAny '2' that appears *after* any '0' in the original string can be moved to the very end.\nThe '1's can be moved past both '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, the optimal structure is:\n1.  All '0's.\n2.  All '1's.\n3.  All '2's.\n\nIs this always possible? No. For \"20\", the output is \"20\", not \"02\".\nThis implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*.\nSo, if the string is \"20\", the '2' must remain before the '0'.\nIf the string is \"02\", the '0' must remain before the '2'.\n\nThe '1's are completely flexible. They can move anywhere.\nTo minimize lexicographically, we want to place '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nSince '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, they can be collected and placed at any single point in the string.\nWhere should they be placed? After all '0's that are not \"trapped\" by a preceding '2', and before all '2's that are not \"trapped\" by a succeeding '0'.\n\nLet's count the '1's. Let this be `num_ones`.\nNow, consider the string `s_prime` which is `s` with all '1's removed.\nFor `s = \"100210\"`, `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\nFor `s = \"11222121\"`, `s_prime = \"2222\"`.\nFor `s = \"20\"`, `s_prime = \"20\"`.\n\nThe characters in `s_prime` must maintain their relative order.\nWe want to insert `num_ones` '1's into `s_prime` to make the resulting string lexicographically smallest.\nTo achieve this, we should insert all '1's at the *first position where a '2' appears* in `s_prime`. If there are no '2's, we append them to the end.\nWhy? Because any '0' should come before any '1', and any '1' should come before any '2'.\nSo, all '0's in `s_prime` should come first. Then all `num_ones` '1's. Then all '2's in `s_prime`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 2`.\n2. Remove '1's: `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 2 (0-indexed).\n4. Construct the result: Take the part of `s_prime` before the first '2' (`\"00\"`), append all '1's (`\"11\"`), then append the rest of `s_prime` from the first '2' onwards (`\"20\"`).\n   Result: `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 4`.\n2. Remove '1's: `s_prime = \"2222\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0.\n4. Construct the result: Take the part of `s_prime` before the first '2' (`\"\"`), append all '1's (`\"1111\"`), then append the rest of `s_prime` from the first '2' onwards (`\"2222\"`).\n   Result: `\"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"20\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 0`.\n2. Remove '1's: `s_prime = \"20\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0.\n4. Construct the result: Take the part of `s_prime` before the first '2' (`\"\"`), append all '1's (`\"\"`), then append the rest of `s_prime` from the first '2' onwards (`\"20\"`).\n   Result: `\"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\"`.\n\nThis logic seems to cover all examples and respects the '0'-'2' immutability while leveraging the '1's flexibility for lexicographical minimization.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars`.\n2. Initialize `num_ones = 0`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`:\n    a. If `char == '1'`, increment `num_ones`.\n    b. If `char == '0'` or `char == '2'`, append `char` to `result_chars`.\n4. Find the index of the first '2' in `result_chars`. Let this be `insert_idx`.\n    a. If no '2' is found, `insert_idx` should be `len(result_chars)` (i.e., append at the end).\n5. Insert `num_ones` '1's into `result_chars` at `insert_idx`.\n6. Join `result_chars` to form the final string.\n\nLet's trace `s = \"010210\"`:\n1. `result_chars = []`, `num_ones = 0`.\n2. Iterate:\n   - '0': `result_chars = ['0']`\n   - '1': `num_ones = 1`\n   - '0': `result_chars = ['0', '0']`\n   - '2': `result_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n   - '1': `num_ones = 2`\n   - '0': `result_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3. `result_chars` is `['0', '0', '2', '0']`. `num_ones = 2`.\n4. Find first '2' in `result_chars`: `result_chars.index('2')` is `2`. So `insert_idx = 2`.\n5. Insert '1's: `result_chars.insert(2, '1')` twice.\n   - `['0', '0', '1', '2', '0']`\n   - `['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`\n6. Join: `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    # Collect all '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n    # and count all '1's\n    non_ones_chars = []\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            non_ones_chars.append(char_s)\n\n    # Find the position where '1's should be inserted\n    # This is the first occurrence of '2' in the non_ones_chars string.\n    # If no '2' is present, '1's should be appended at the end.\n    insert_idx = len(non_ones_chars) # Default to append at end if no '2'\n    for i in range(len(non_ones_chars)):\n        if non_ones_chars[i] == '2':\n            insert_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    # Construct the final string\n    # Take the part before the insertion point, add all '1's, then add the rest\n    result = []\n    for i in range(insert_idx):\n        result.append(non_ones_chars[i])\n    \n    for _ in range(num_ones):\n        result.append('1')\n        \n    for i in range(insert_idx, len(non_ones_chars)):\n        result.append(non_ones_chars[i])\n        \n    print(\"\".join(result))\n\n# The problem statement implies multiple test cases for the example,\n# but competitive programming problems usually mean one input string per run\n# unless specified.
