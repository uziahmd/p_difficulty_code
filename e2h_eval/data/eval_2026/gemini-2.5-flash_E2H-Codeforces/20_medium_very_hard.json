For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's tackle this competitive programming problem!**  I'm dealing with a combinatorial challenge, aiming to find the count of ways to choose integer values (`c_s`) for binary strings (`s`) such that the maximum size of a specific multiset (a collection of binary strings) is exactly a target value (`f`). The binary strings have a maximum length `n`, and each `c_s` is bounded by `k`.  This sets the stage for a potentially complex dynamic programming or recursive solution.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the constraints. The beautiful multiset condition is pivotal. It states that, for any prefix string, the number of strings in the multiset with that prefix must be less than or equal to the corresponding `c_s` value.  This directly translates to a prefix tree-like structure, where nodes represent prefixes and the multiset's members are the leaves. The values `c_s` essentially act as capacity constraints on each node of the tree.\n\nI realized that a dynamic programming approach on this prefix tree is likely the key.  I'm defining `dp[d][s]` to represent the maximum number of strings in the beautiful multiset that are descendants of string `s` (or itself if it's of length `n`), given constraints from `s` downwards in the tree. The base case is when the string `s` is of length `n`, in which case `dp[n][s]` is simply `c_s`. For strings of length less than `n`, `dp[d][s]` is the minimum of `c_s` and the sum of its child node's `dp` values.\n\nThe actual problem wants the number of *ways* to choose the `c_s` values such that this maximum multiset size (computed as the `dp` value at the root of the prefix tree) is equal to `f`. So, I'll need to adapt my dynamic programming scheme. It now looks like `dp[d][x]` is the count of valid ways to set the constraints for a particular string, such that the maximum count rooted at `s` evaluates to `x`. This new state also requires convolution to obtain the total ways.\n\nI've got the recursion: `dp[d][x]` is a function of the count from its children and the current `c_s`.  For each node, the `dp[d+1]` values of the children get convolved to determine all the ways of satisfying the constraint. I can use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to speed up these convolutions. To get the `f` from the children, I sum up the coefficient, so it will be a 1D DP from `dp[1]`.\n\nThe computational complexity seems manageable.  The most computationally intensive part is the NTT for convolution. Each dynamic programming step involves an NTT multiplication with `O(k log k)` time complexity, and the depth of the tree is `n`.\nWith that in mind, after applying the logic, I need to do a convolution with `dp[1]` to satisfy the condition `f`.\nI've checked the constraints.  With `n` as high as 15 and `k` up to 200,000, it seems like a reasonably sized problem that fits into the computation time limit. I will have to implement it and test it to get to the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n` (where `0 \\le c_s \\le k`), such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output the count modulo `998244353`.\n\nLet's define `X_s` as the maximum number of strings of length `n` that can have `s` as a prefix, subject to the constraints `c_t` for `t` being `s` or a descendant of `s`. This value can be computed using dynamic programming on the prefix tree:\n1. If `len(s) = n`: `X_s = c_s`. This is because `s` itself is a string of length `n`, and we can include it `c_s` times.\n2. If `len(s) < n`: `X_s = min(c_s, X_{s0} + X_{s1})`. This means the total count of strings starting with `s` cannot exceed `c_s`, but also cannot exceed the sum of counts from its children `s0` and `s1`.\n\nThe overall maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `X_0 + X_1` (where '0' and '1' are the two strings of length 1). We need this sum to be exactly `f`.\n\nLet `dp[d][x]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` for all strings `t` that are descendants of a *single* fixed node `s` at depth `d` (i.e., `len(s) = d`), such that `X_s` evaluates to `x`. The maximum value `x` can take is `k`.\n\nWe compute `dp[d][x]` for `d` from `n` down to `1`.\n\n**Base Case: `d = n`**\nFor any string `s` of length `n`, `X_s = c_s`.\nIf we want `X_s = x`, we must choose `c_s = x`.\nSince `c_s` must be between `0` and `k`, `x` must also be between `0` and `k`.\nSo, `dp[n][x] = 1` for `0 \\le x \\le k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `d < n`**\nTo compute `dp[d][x]` for a string `s` of length `d`:\n`X_s = min(c_s, X_{s0} + X_{s1})`.\nLet `X_{s0} = x_0` and `X_{s1} = x_1`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `X_{s0} = x_0` is `dp[d+1][x_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `X_{s1} = x_1` is `dp[d+1][x_1]`.\nThese choices are independent, so for a fixed `x_0, x_1`, there are `dp[d+1][x_0] * dp[d+1][x_1]` ways.\nLet `S = x_0 + x_1`. `S` can range from `0` to `2k`.\nWe need `min(c_s, S) = x`. We also know `0 \\le c_s \\le k`.\n\nWe can analyze the number of choices for `c_s` based on `S` and `x`:\n1. If `S < x`: `min(c_s, S)` can never be `x`. So, `0` ways.\n2. If `S = x`: We need `min(c_s, x) = x`. This implies `c_s \\ge x`. The possible values for `c_s` are `x, x+1, \\dots, k`. There are `k - x + 1` choices.\n3. If `S > x`: We need `min(c_s, S) = x`. This implies `c_s = x`. There is `1` choice.\n\nLet `P_{d+1}(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^k dp[d+1][j] z^j` be the polynomial representing `dp[d+1]`.\nThe sum `\\sum_{x_0+x_1=S} dp[d+1][x_0] * dp[d+1][x_1]` corresponds to the `S`-th coefficient of `P_{d+1}(z)^2`. We can compute this using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\nLet `ways_sum_children[S] = [P_{d+1}(z)^2]_S`. This array will have length `2k+1`.\n\nNow we can compute `dp[d][x]`:\n`dp[d][x] = (ways_sum_children[x] * (k - x + 1) + \\sum_{S=x+1}^{2k} ways_sum_children[S] * 1) \\pmod{MOD}`.\nThe sum `\\sum_{S=x+1}^{2k} ways_sum_children[S]` can be computed efficiently using suffix sums.\nLet `suffix_sum_ways[j] = \\sum_{S=j}^{2k} ways_sum_children[S]`.\nThen `dp[d][x] = (ways_sum_children[x] * (k - x + 1) + suffix_sum_ways[x+1]) \\pmod{MOD}`.\n`suffix_sum_ways` can be computed in `O(k)` time after `ways_sum_children` is available.\n\n**Final Step**\nAfter computing `dp[1][x]` for all `0 \\le x \\le k`, we need to find the number of ways such that `X_0 + X_1 = f`.\nSince the subtrees rooted at '0' and '1' are symmetric, `X_0` and `X_1` will have the same distribution, i.e., `P_1(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^k dp[1][j] z^j` applies to both.\nWe need to find `\\sum_{x_0=0}^k \\sum_{x_1=0}^k (dp[1][x_0] * dp[1][x_1])` such that `x_0 + x_1 = f`.\nThis is precisely the `f`-th coefficient of `P_1(z)^2`. Let `final_convolution = P_1(z)^2`.\nThe answer is `final_convolution[f]`. If `f` is greater than the degree of `final_convolution` (which is `2k`), the answer is `0`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- There are `n-1` iterations for `d` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n- In each iteration, we perform one polynomial multiplication (NTT) of two polynomials of degree `k`. This takes `O(k \\log k)` time.\n- Computing suffix sums and `dp[d][x]` takes `O(k)` time.\n- The final polynomial multiplication also takes `O(k \\log k)` time.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n \\cdot k \\log k)`.\nGiven `n \\le 15`, `k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5`, `\\log k \\approx 18`. This is `15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(k)` for storing `dp` arrays and intermediate convolution results.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n- Modulo: `998244353` (a prime number suitable for NTT).\n- Primitive root: `3`.\n- The size for NTT must be a power of 2, greater than or equal to the sum of degrees of polynomials plus one. For polynomials of degree `k`, the result has degree `2k`. So NTT size `N_NTT` must be `\\ge 2k+1`. For `k=2 \\cdot 10^5`, `2k+1 = 400001`. The smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to this is `2^{19} = 524288`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to compute modular exponentiation (a^b % m)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function for Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\n# a: list of coefficients (polynomial)\n# inverse: boolean, True for inverse NTT\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative Cooley-Tukey\n    # length_half is m in the common description, length is 2m\n    for length_half in range(1, n // 2 + 1, length_half * 2):\n        length = length_half * 2\n        \n        # Calculate the root of unity for this length\n        w_len = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if inverse:\n            w_len = power(w_len, MOD - 2) # modular inverse for inverse NTT\n\n        for i in range(0, n, length): # i is the start of a group\n            w = 1 # current root of unity\n            for j in range(length_half): # j is index within the group\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + length_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + length_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n\n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = power(n, MOD - 2) # modular inverse of n\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n    return a\n\n# Function to multiply two polynomials using NTT\ndef multiply_poly(p1, p2):\n    len_p1 = len(p1)\n    len_p2 = len(p2)\n    \n    # The degree of the result polynomial is (len_p1-1) + (len_p2-1).\n    # The number of coefficients is sum_degrees + 1.\n    result_poly_len = len_p1 + len_p2 - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 >= result_poly_len for NTT size\n    n_ntt = 1\n    while n_ntt < result_poly_len:\n        n_ntt <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros to n_ntt length\n    a = list(p1) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_p1)\n    b = list(p2) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_p2)\n\n    # Apply forward NTT\n    a_fft = ntt(a, False)\n    b_fft = ntt(b, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication in frequency domain\n    c_fft = [(a_fft[i] * b_fft[i]) % MOD for i in range(n_ntt)]\n    \n    # Apply inverse NTT\n    c = ntt(c_fft, True)\n    \n    # Return coefficients up to the actual length of the result polynomial\n    return c[:result_poly_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[d] stores the array of counts dp[d][x] for x from 0 to k.\n    # We only need dp[d+1] to compute dp[d], so we'll use dp_prev and dp_curr.\n    \n    # Base case: d = n\n    # dp_prev represents dp[n]. dp[n][x] = 1 for 0 <= x <= k.\n    dp_prev = [1] * (k + 1) # Size k+1\n\n    # Iterate from d = n-1 down to 1\n    for d in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # 1.
