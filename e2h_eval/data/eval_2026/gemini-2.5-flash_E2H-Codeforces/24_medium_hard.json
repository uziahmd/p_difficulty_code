She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the Tab Closing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the least number of seconds needed to shut down all the tabs *outside* a specific range, `[l, r]`. I've got `n` tabs total, an initial cursor position (`pos`), and the range to keep open (`l` to `r`).\n\nThe key operations are moving the cursor left or right (one second each), or closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also one second each). The main constraint is that initially, `a` (minimum unclosed tab) is 1, and `b` (maximum) is `n`.\n\nFirst, the edge case is simple: if `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, we keep all tabs. Boom, no action needed, cost is zero.\n\nNow, the main idea: we've got to close tabs outside the `[l, r]` range. That means tabs 1 to `l-1` and tabs `r+1` to `n`. To do this efficiently, I realized we need to move the cursor to either `l` or `r` (or one side), close the unwanted tabs, then move to the other side and close those. The problem's trick is to minimize the total cursor movements combined with the closing operations.\n\nLet's break it down further. I initially went through each case: `l` at 1, `r` at `n`, etc. \n\n*   **Case 1: No Action:** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` (all tabs are kept). Cost = 0.\n*   **Case 2: Just Close Right:** If only `r < n` (that is, `l=1` so we close right side), we need to move the cursor to `r` and then close right tabs. Cost is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. This equals the distance to `r` plus one to close.\n*   **Case 3: Just Close Left:** If only `l > 1` (that is, `r=n` so we close left side), we move cursor to `l` and then close. Cost = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\nThe tricky bit is the *both sides* case where `1 < l` and `r < n`, meaning that we need to close tabs on both left and right sides.  I analyzed the movement and closing sequence.\n\n*   One possible way is: Move the cursor from its initial `pos` to `l`, then close left tabs, then move to `r`, and finally close right tabs. The Cost is `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r-l) + 1`. (abs to account for going to the left).\n\n*   The other option is:  From the initial `pos`, move to `r`, close right tabs, move to `l`, close left tabs. Cost is then `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r-l) + 1`\n\nI figured it's basically the sum of the distance from `pos` to either `l` or `r` plus the distance between `l` and `r` plus the cost to close the tabs which is 2. The solution is the minimum cost from these paths, or `min(abs(pos-l), abs(pos-r)) + (r-l) + 2`.\n\nI ran through some example calculations, tested a few different cases (including when `pos` is on either side of or between `l` and `r`), and this seemed to cover everything. It seemed to make logical sense. In the end, the solution accounts for the distance to the closer endpoint of the closed region, plus the distance between, plus the two close operations.\n\nI'm confident I've got the most efficient approach down. I coded it, double-checked, and believe the solution is solid. It handles all edge cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the target range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are four types of operations, each taking 1 second:\n1. Move cursor left.\n2. Move cursor right.\n3. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor.\n4. Close all tabs to the right of the cursor.\n\nThe key insight is that we need to perform two closing operations: one to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and another to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. The movement operations allow the cursor to move freely within the currently unclosed tabs.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n**1. All tabs are within the target range (`l = 1` and `r = n`):**\nIn this case, there are no tabs to close. The cost is 0.\n\n**2. Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`):**\nWe need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab `i` such that `i <= r`). From `r`, we perform the \"close tabs to the right\" operation.\nThe total time will be:\n- Time to move the cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- Time to close tabs to the right of `r`: `1` second.\nTotal cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**3. Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`r = n` and `l > 1`):**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab `i` such that `i >= l`). From `l`, we perform the \"close tabs to the left\" operation.\nThe total time will be:\n- Time to move the cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- Time to close tabs to the left of `l`: `1` second.\nTotal cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**4. Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two closing operations. The cursor must be at `l` to close the left side, and at `r` to close the right side. We have two possible sequences of operations:\n\n   **Option A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n   - Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n   - Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n   - Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n   - Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n   Total cost for Option A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n   **Option B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n   - Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n   - Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n   - Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n   - Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n   Total cost for Option B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n   The minimum cost for this case is `min(Option A cost, Option B cost)`.\n   This simplifies to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these conditions for implementation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, pos, l, r from a single line of input\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    cost = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are to be kept (l=1 and r=n)\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        cost = 0\n    # Case 2: Only need to close tabs to the right (l=1, but r<n)\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move cursor from pos to r (abs(pos - r) steps), then close right (1 step)\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only need to close tabs to the left (r=n, but l>1)\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move cursor from pos to l (abs(pos - l) steps), then close left (1 step)\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Need to close tabs on both sides (l>1 and r<n)\n    else:\n        # Option A: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right.\n        # Cost = (pos -> l) + (close left) + (l -> r) + (close right)\n        cost_A = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n        # Option B: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left.\n        # Cost = (pos -> r) + (close right) + (r -> l) + (close left)\n        cost_B = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        cost = min(cost_A, cost_B)\n    \n    print(cost)\n\n# Call the solve function to process the input\nsolve()\n\n```",
