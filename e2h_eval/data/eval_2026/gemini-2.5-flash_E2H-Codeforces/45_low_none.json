There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Tennis Tournament Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and the tennis tournament setup is interesting.  The core challenge is figuring out the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play, given this specific \"fairness\" rule. The rule is that two players can only face off if the difference in the number of games they've played is at most one.\n\nMy thought process starts by denoting the number of games played by a player as `k`.  I'm trying to figure out how to maximize the winner's games, so I'm thinking about tracing the winner's path.  If the winner plays `x` games, they've beaten `x` opponents, and knowing that knockout tournaments work by elimination, it's clear we have `n-1` total games played to get down to a single winner.\n\nThe key is this `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` rule. I'm visualizing the game progression here: if a player has played `k` games, their next opponent *must* have played either `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` games. But hold on, the `k+1` case doesn't seem right. That player would have already won their previous `k` games, and the game progression doesn't allow for a player to jump ahead like that in a round-by-round knockout style. So, it really has to be `k-1` or `k`.\n\nLet's break this down further. If the winner is at `k`, the opponent has `k'` games with `abs(k - k') <= 1`. Now I have a framework: a player who has won `k` games must be able to find an opponent.  Let's call the player who has won `k` games, `W_k`. For the first game, if `k=0`, `W_0` plays against `W_0`, and then we get `W_1`. If `k=1`, then `W_1` plays against either `W_0` or `W_1` (which must be a player). And so on... I need to figure out how to map this game structure, and how many players are needed to support a player with `k` games.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet's denote `P(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games, following the given rule. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `P(k) <= n`.\n\nConsider a player who has won `k` games and is about to play their `(k+1)`-th game. They must have an opponent who has won `k'` games, such that `abs(k - k') <= 1`.\nTo maximize the number of games played by the winner, we should try to make the winner play as many games as possible against opponents who have played fewer games, effectively \"saving\" stronger opponents for later, or making it easier for the winner to advance. However, the rule `abs(k - k') <= 1` limits this.\n\nLet's trace the number of players needed:\n- To play 0 games: This is an initial player. `P(0) = 1`.\n- To play 1 game: A player `A` (0 games) plays against another player `B` (0 games). `abs(0-0) = 0 <= 1`. Winner `A'` has played 1 game. This requires 2 players. `P(1) = 2`.\n- To play 2 games: A player `A'` (1 game) needs an opponent.\n    - Option 1: Opponent `B'` has played 0 games. `abs(1-0) = 1 <= 1`. This is valid.\n        To get `A'` (1 game): 2 players.\n        To get `B'` (0 games): 1 player.\n        Total: `P(1) + P(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` players.\n    - Option 2: Opponent `B''` has played 1 game. `abs(1-1) = 0 <= 1`. This is valid.\n        To get `A'` (1 game): 2 players.\n        To get `B''` (1 game): 2 players.\n        Total: `P(1) + P(1) = 2 + 2 = 4` players.\n    To minimize players for the winner to play 2 games, we choose Option 1. So, `P(2) = 3`.\n\nThis pattern suggests that to minimize the number of players for a winner to play `k` games, the winner (who has played `k-1` games) should play against an opponent who has played `k-2` games. This is because `abs((k-1) - (k-2)) = 1`, which is allowed. This strategy uses the minimum number of players for the opponent.\nSo, `P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet's list the first few terms:\n`F_0 = 0` (standard definition, not directly used here)\n`F_1 = 1`\n`F_2 = 1`\n`F_3 = 2`\n`F_4 = 3`\n`F_5 = 5`\n`F_6 = 8`\n`F_7 = 13`\n...\n\nOur `P(k)` sequence corresponds to:\n`P(0) = 1` (This is `F_2`)\n`P(1) = 2` (This is `F_3`)\n`P(2) = 3` (This is `F_4`)\n`P(3) = 5` (This is `F_5`)\n`P(k) = F_{k+2}`\n\nSo, the minimum number of players required for a winner to play `k` games is `F_{k+2}`.\nWe are looking for the maximum `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nThe problem input `n` can be up to `10^18`. We need to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\n- If `n = 2`:\n  `P(0) = 1 <= 2`\n  `P(1) = 2 <= 2`\n  `P(2) = 3 > 2`\n  Max `k` is 1. Output: 1.\n- If `n = 3`:\n  `P(0) = 1 <= 3`\n  `P(1) = 2 <= 3`\n  `P(2) = 3 <= 3`\n  `P(3) = 5 > 3`\n  Max `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n- If `n = 4`:\n  `P(0) = 1 <= 4`\n  `P(1) = 2 <= 4`\n  `P(2) = 3 <= 4`\n  `P(3) = 5 > 4`\n  Max `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n- If `n = 10`:\n  `P(0) = 1 <= 10`\n  `P(1) = 2 <= 10`\n  `P(2) = 3 <= 10`\n  `P(3) = 5 <= 10`\n  `P(4) = 8 <= 10`\n  `P(5) = 13 > 10`\n  Max `k` is 4. Output: 4.\n\nThe logic matches the examples.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1`, `b = 2` (representing `P(0)` and `P(1)` respectively, or `F_2` and `F_3`).\n2. Initialize `k = 0` (representing the number of games played by the winner).\n3. Loop while `a <= n`:\n   a. Update `k` to `k + 1`.\n   b. Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence: `temp = a + b`.\n   c. Update `a = b`.\n   d. Update `b = temp`.\n4. The loop terminates when `a > n`. At this point, `k` has been incremented one too many times. So, the result is `k - 1`.\n\nLet's trace with `n=2`:\n- `a=1`, `b=2`, `k=0`\n- Loop 1: `a=1 <= 2`.\n  - `k = 1`\n  - `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  - `a = 2`\n  - `b = 3`\n- Loop 2: `a=2 <= 2`.\n  - `k = 2`\n  - `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  - `a = 3`\n  - `b = 5`\n- Loop 3: `a=3 > 2`. Loop terminates.\n- Result: `k - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\nLet's trace with `n=3`:\n- `a=1`, `b=2`, `k=0`\n- Loop 1: `a=1 <= 3`.\n  - `k = 1`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`\n- Loop 2: `a=2 <= 3`.\n  - `k = 2`, `a = 3`, `b = 5`\n- Loop 3: `a=3 <= 3`.\n  - `k = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`\n- Loop 4: `a=5 > 3`. Loop terminates.\n- Result: `k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n\nThis approach correctly finds the largest `k` such that `P(k) <= n`. Since `n` can be `10^18`, the Fibonacci numbers will grow quite large, but Python handles large integers automatically. The number of Fibonacci terms to reach `10^18` is small (around 90), so the loop will be very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # P(k) represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n    # P(0) = 1 (A single player is needed to be considered a winner who has played 0 games initially)\n    # P(1) = 2 (Two players play, winner plays 1 game)\n    # P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2) for k >= 2\n    # This sequence corresponds to Fibonacci numbers F_m where P(k) = F_{k+2}\n    # F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, F_5 = 5, ...\n    # P(0) = 1 = F_2\n    # P(1) = 2 = F_3\n    # P(2) = 3 = F_4\n    # P(3) = 5 = F_5\n    \n    # We want to find the maximum k such that P(k) <= n.\n\n    # Initialize a and b to F_2 and F_3 respectively, which are P(0) and P(1).\n    a = 1  # Represents P(current_k)\n    b = 2  # Represents P(current_k + 1)\n    \n    # k represents the number of games played by the winner.\n    # Initially, a=1 corresponds to k=0 games.\n    k = 0\n\n    # Loop until P(k) exceeds n\n    while a <= n:\n        # If P(k) <= n, then a winner can play k games.\n        # We try to see if they can play more games.\n        k += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number (P(k+1))\n        next_fib = a + b\n        \n        # Shift a and b to the next pair in the sequence\n        a = b\n        b = next_fib\n        \n    # The loop terminates when 'a' (which is P(k_final)) becomes greater than 'n'.\n    # This means the previous value of k (k_final - 1) was the maximum possible.\n    # Since k was incremented one last time before 'a' exceeded 'n',\n    # we need to subtract 1 from k.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(k - 1) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
