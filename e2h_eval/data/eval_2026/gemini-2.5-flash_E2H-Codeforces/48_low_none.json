He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Base Conversion in Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to handle base conversion, which is pretty straightforward conceptually, but the devil's always in the details, especially with potential large numbers.  Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to take in three inputs: the original base (`a`), the target base (`b`), and the number itself as a string (`c`). I see a nice little twist here—`b` can either be a standard integer base or the character 'R' if we're dealing with Roman numerals. That's a good touch, gives me some flexibility.  I've got to ensure the input bases are within the bounds (2 to 25) which is sensible. And the constraints are crucial:  the decimal value of `c` will be capped at 10^15 if it's not being converted to Roman numerals. If we are converting to Roman numerals, the input number will be <= 3000. No zeros, which is also helpful to clarify.\n\nMy approach will be a two-step process:  First, convert from base `a` to base 10 (decimal), and then, from base 10 to base `b` (or to Roman numerals if that's the target).\n\nFor that base to decimal conversion (Step 1), I'll need a helper function to translate the digits correctly.  Since bases greater than 10 use letters (A-Z) to represent digits, I'll write a function, `digit_to_int(char)`, that handles the conversion: '0'-'9' are easy, and for letters, I can use `ord()` and then adjust accordingly, where 'A' corresponds to 10, 'B' to 11, and so on.\n\nTo perform the actual base-a-to-decimal conversion, I'll create another helper function, `base_a_to_decimal(num_str, base_a)`. I can initialize a `decimal_value` to 0. Then, I need to iterate through the input string (`num_str`) from left to right. For each digit (`char`), I convert it to its integer equivalent using `digit_to_int()` and then multiply the current `decimal_value` by `base_a` and add the new digit.  This effectively does the standard polynomial expansion for base conversion. I'm thinking about edge cases - string inputs, base bounds.\n\nI need to make sure I consider the max length of the input number which is 1000 digits.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I can move on to Step 2, which involves converting to base `b` or to Roman numerals. That's the next challenge. I'll need to figure out an efficient method for both, particularly the Roman numeral conversion, to avoid a lot of special cases and to ensure efficiency. It shouldn't be too hard though.\n\nThis overall seems quite manageable.\n",
