For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about how to build this Python script to classify these triads. The goal is to take a set of three notes and determine if it's major, minor, or something \"strange.\" I'm an expert in this, so this seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm systematic.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes numerically.  I'll map each note (C, C#, D, etc.) to an integer from 0 to 11. I'll need a dictionary or a list for this mapping. Wait, there is a \"H\" here. H is B! But let's follow what the problem gives. I can easily index the notes based on the prompt - 0, 1, 2...11. The core idea is modular arithmetic because the notes are cyclic, with 12 semitones in a cycle. This means the distance calculation will need to use `(Y - X + 12) % 12`.\n\nTriads are just sets of three notes, unordered. I need to figure out how to handle that unordered nature.  I realize I can just sort the notes. Sorting is the key because then I can easily calculate the intervals between them.  The major triad has intervals of (4, 3) and the minor has (3, 4). Once I've sorted the notes, it will be easy to calculate the distances, right? The key is that the *order* of the intervals matters.\n\nI see that there are three possible intervals: between the first and second note, the second and third, and then the wrap-around from the third back to the first. Let's call them `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`. I can compute all three distances and check if I get the right combination of 4 and 3.\n\nThe input is simple: three note names separated by spaces. I'll read those, convert them to their numerical representations, and then I'll use those numbers to calculate the distances and classify the triad. That should be sufficient for a nice, concise solution.\n",
