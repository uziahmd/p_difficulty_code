The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process.** I'm given a tree representing districts and need to choose `n-k` districts that form a connected component, maximizing the sum of their fan counts (`2^i`). The goal is to output the `k` districts removed, in increasing order.\n\nMy initial thought is that the tree structure and the fan counts (which increase exponentially with the district index `i`) suggest a greedy approach. Keeping higher-indexed districts is always preferable to a combination of lower-indexed ones. I want to maximize the sum of `2^i` for kept nodes, implying I need to minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes.\n\nI immediately try to reframe it: instead of selecting the kept districts, I'll focus on removing `k` districts, with the constraint that the remaining ones form a connected component. This is where it gets interesting, I need to figure out which nodes can be removed without breaking the network.\n\nA naive approach would be to remove the `k` smallest-indexed nodes, but that won't always work because it might disconnect the tree. I need a more sophisticated method. I start considering the role of leaves and internal nodes in preserving connectivity. If I remove a leaf, it doesn't hurt connectivity, however removing internal nodes will separate the graph. It means the `k` removed nodes act like pruned \"leaves\" of the connected component.\n\nMy mind then explores the use of dynamic programming on trees, perhaps to calculate the maximum sum of fans for a connected component of a certain size rooted at a given node.  The standard DP approaches may be useful here, but because the numbers are so large, there are probably more efficient solutions.\n\nThinking about the exponentially increasing fan counts, I quickly conclude that the node with the highest index should almost always be part of the final, connected component, if at all possible. This guides me to explore removing the smaller nodes, but this requires preserving connectivity. I continue to refine my understanding of this.\n\nUltimately, I'm leaning toward a greedy strategy centered around the nodes that must be \"kept\" to create that connected component, and how those nodes are arranged in the tree. The removed nodes are the ones that are \"peeled away\" from that component. I'm focusing on trying to identify which nodes can be safely removed and how the tree structure guides this process. This seems like it should lead to a solution, but the coding will be tricky.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in a given tree, such that the sum of fans `2^i` for the selected districts is maximized. We need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\n**Key Observation:**\nThe fan count `2^i` grows exponentially. Specifically, `2^i > \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j` for any `i > 1`. This property is crucial: it means that keeping a higher-indexed district is always better than keeping any combination of lower-indexed districts, if we have to choose. For example, `2^5` is greater than `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4`.\nTherefore, to maximize the total number of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with higher indices. This is equivalent to minimizing the total number of fans of the *removed* contestants, which means we should prioritize removing districts with lower indices.\n\n**Greedy Strategy:**\nWe want to remove `k` districts with the smallest possible indices, subject to the constraint that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component.\n\nLet's maintain a set `kept_nodes` (initially empty) and a set `removed_nodes` (initially empty). We need `|kept_nodes| = n-k`.\nThe strategy is to iterate through districts from `n` down to `1`. For each district `i`:\n1.  Try to add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n2.  If `kept_nodes` already has `n-k` elements, then we must remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n3.  If `kept_nodes` has fewer than `n-k` elements, we want to add `i` if possible.\n    The \"possible\" part is tricky. We can't just add `i` arbitrarily, because it might make it impossible to form a connected component of size `n-k` with the remaining high-indexed nodes.\n\nA more robust greedy strategy, leveraging the `2^i` property, is to identify the `n-k` nodes we want to keep. Since we want to keep nodes with high indices, let's fix the highest-indexed node that we *must* keep. This node will be `n`. Then we need to pick `n-k-1` more nodes.\n\nConsider the problem from the perspective of *removing* nodes. We need to remove `k` nodes. To minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes, we should try to remove nodes `1, 2, 3, ...` in increasing order.\nA node `u` can be removed if its removal does not disconnect the graph such that we can no longer form a connected component of `n-k` nodes from the remaining graph. This is hard to check directly.\n\nA simpler condition for removing nodes in a tree to keep a connected component:\nWe want to find a connected subgraph of size `N_kept = n-k`.\nThe nodes *not* in this subgraph (`k` nodes) are the ones we remove.\nThe \"boundary\" nodes of the kept component `S` are those `u \\in S` that have a neighbor `v \\notin S`.\nThe nodes `v \\notin S` that are neighbors of `u \\in S` are effectively \"leaves\" of the component `S` if we consider them as part of the \"outside\".\n\nThis problem can be solved by a greedy approach that simulates \"pruning\" the tree.\n1.  Initialize `kept_count = n`.\n2.  Initialize `removed_districts = []`.\n3.  Maintain the degree of each node.\n4.  Use a min-priority queue (or a `deque` for nodes `1, 2, ...` which is implicitly ordered) to store candidate districts for removal. A district `u` is a candidate for removal if its current degree is 1 (it's a leaf in the current graph) and it's not the last remaining node.\n    More precisely, when we remove a node `u`, it effectively reduces the degree of its neighbors. We can only remove `k` nodes.\n    To maximize the sum of fans for kept nodes, we should remove nodes with the smallest indices.\n\nLet's use a queue (or `deque` for efficiency) to process nodes in increasing order of their index.\nWe will try to remove nodes `1, 2, 3, ...` in this order.\nA node `u` can be removed if:\n    a. We still need to remove more than 0 nodes (`k > 0`).\n    b. Removing `u` does not disconnect the remaining `n-k` nodes.\n    This second condition is the tricky part. If `u` is a leaf of the current graph, removing it doesn't disconnect the rest. If `u` is an internal node, removing it splits the graph.\n\nThe correct greedy approach for this problem is based on the observation that the `n-k` nodes that are kept must form a connected component. This means that if we \"prune\" nodes (remove them), the remaining `n-k` nodes must still be connected.\nThe nodes that can be \"pruned\" are effectively leaves of the current graph.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Build the adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n3.  Calculate the initial degree `deg[u]` for all nodes `u`.\n4.  Initialize a `deque` called `q`. For each node `u` from `1` to `n`, if `deg[u] == 1`, add `u` to `q`. These are the initial leaves.\n5.  Initialize `removed_nodes = []` and `nodes_to_keep_count = n - k`.\n6.  While `q` is not empty and `n > nodes_to_keep_count`:\n    a.  Pop the smallest node `u` from the front of `q`.\n    b.  Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n    c.  Decrement `n` (representing the current number of nodes in the graph).\n    d.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.   Decrement `deg[v]`.\n        ii.  If `deg[v] == 1` and `v` is not already removed (i.e., `v` is still in the graph and becomes a leaf), add `v` to `q`.\n    (Note: `q` should be ordered. A `deque` is good for `popleft`, but `append` for `v` might add it out of order. A `min-priority queue` would be better if nodes can be added out of order, but since we are iterating `1..n` and adding leaves, a `deque` can work if we are careful, or simply use a boolean array `is_removed` and process nodes by index.)\n\nLet's refine step 6. We want to remove `k` nodes. We prefer removing smallest indices.\nWe can use a boolean array `is_removed[u]` to mark removed nodes.\nWe need to keep track of current degrees.\nThe process is:\n1.  Build `adj` list and `deg` array.\n2.  Initialize `is_removed` array to all `False`.\n3.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n4.  Initialize `q = collections.deque()`.\n5.  For `u` from `1` to `n`: if `deg[u] == 1`, add `u` to `q`.\n    (This ensures `q` initially contains leaves in increasing order of index).\n\n6.  While `removed_count < k` and `q` is not empty:\n    a.  Let `u = q.popleft()`.\n    b.  If `is_removed[u]` is already `True` (meaning it was processed earlier, maybe due to a neighbor becoming a leaf and adding it again, or its degree changed again from 1 to something else and back to 1), continue to the next element in `q`. This check is important if `q` is not a strict priority queue.\n    c.  Mark `u` as removed: `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    d.  Increment `removed_count`.\n    e.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.   If `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n            1.  Decrement `deg[v]`.\n            2.  If `deg[v] == 1`: Add `v` to `q`. (This is where `q` needs to maintain order, or we need to sort `q` or use a `min-heap`).\n\nThe `deque` approach requires `q` to be sorted. A `min-heap` (e.g., `heapq` in Python) is more appropriate here.\n\nRevised Algorithm using `heapq`:\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Build adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n3.  Calculate `deg[u]` for all `u`.\n4.  Initialize `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n5.  Initialize `min_heap = []` (Python's `heapq` is a min-heap).\n6.  For `u` from `1` to `n`: if `deg[u] == 1`, `heapq.heappush(min_heap, u)`.\n7.  Initialize `removed_districts = []`.\n8.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n9.  While `removed_count < k` and `min_heap` is not empty:\n    a.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)`.\n    b.  If `is_removed[u]` is `True` (it might have been added to heap multiple times if its degree went 1->2->1, or its neighbor was removed first), or if `deg[u] == 0` (it's isolated, only happens if `n=1` or all its neighbors were removed), continue.\n    c.  If `deg[u] > 1`: (This means `u` is no longer a leaf. This can happen if a neighbor `v` was also added to the heap and popped before `u`, `v`'s removal caused `deg[u]` to decrease, but not to 1, then another neighbor of `u` was removed causing `deg[u]` to become 1, and `u` was added again. Or `u` was added as a leaf, but then a neighbor was removed, making `u` an internal node temporarily, and then another neighbor was removed making it a leaf again. The `deg[u]` check is crucial to ensure we only process actual leaves.)\n        `continue`\n    d.  Add `u` to `removed_districts`.\n    e.  Set `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    f.  Increment `removed_count`.\n    g.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.   If `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n            1.  Decrement `deg[v]`.\n            2.  If `deg[v] == 1`: `heapq.heappush(min_heap, v)`.\n\n10. Sort `removed_districts` in increasing order.\n11. Print the elements of `removed_districts`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n*   `n=1`: `k` must be less than `n`, so `k` cannot be 1. This case is not possible given `1 <= k < n`.\n*   The `deg[u] == 0` check in step 9b is important. If a node becomes isolated (all its neighbors are removed), its degree becomes 0. It's not a leaf anymore (degree 1), so it shouldn't be added to the heap. If it was already in the heap, we should skip it.\n*   The condition `deg[u] > 1` in step 9c is crucial. A node `u` is added to the heap when its degree becomes 1. However, by the time `u` is popped from the heap, its degree might have changed (e.g., if a neighbor was removed, reducing `deg[u]` to 0 or some other value). We only remove actual leaves.\n*   The `is_removed[u]` check in 9b handles cases where a node is pushed to the heap multiple times (if its degree changes from 1, then back to 1) or if it's already removed.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list and calculating initial degrees: `O(N)`.\n*   Initializing heap: `O(N)` for pushing `N` elements, `O(N log N)` if all nodes are leaves (e.g., a star graph with center removed).\n*   The `while` loop runs `k` times. In each iteration:\n    *   `heapq.heappop`: `O(log N)`.\n    *   Iterating neighbors: sum of degrees is `2*(N-1)`. Each edge `(u,v)` causes `deg[u]` and `deg[v]` to be decremented once when `u` is removed, and once when `v` is removed. Each `heapq.heappush` is `O(log N)`.\n    *   Total time for the loop: `O(k log N + N log N)` because each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint being removed or becoming a leaf), and each push/pop is `log N`.\n*   Sorting `removed_districts`: `O(k log k)`.\n*   Overall time complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, degrees, `is_removed` array, and the heap.\n\nLet's test with Example 1: `n=6, k=3`.\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nInitial degrees:\ndeg[1]=1\ndeg[2]=4\ndeg[3]=1\ndeg[4]=1\ndeg[5]=1\ndeg[6]=2\n\nInitial `min_heap`: [1, 3, 4, 5] (sorted by value)\n`removed_count = 0`, `removed_districts = []`\n\n1.  Pop 1. `removed_count=0 < k=3`. `deg[1]=1`.\n    `removed_districts = [1]`. `is_removed[1]=True`. `removed_count=1`.\n    Neighbor of 1 is 2. `is_removed[2]=False`.\n    `deg[2]` becomes 3. Not 1.\n    `min_heap`: [3, 4, 5]\n\n2.  Pop 3. `removed_count=1 < k=3`. `deg[3]=1`.\n    `removed_districts = [1, 3]`. `is_removed[3]=True`. `removed_count=2`.\n    Neighbor of 3 is 2. `is_removed[2]=False`.\n    `deg[2]` becomes 2. Not 1.\n    `min_heap`: [4, 5]\n\n3.
