    "thought": "**The Optimization Challenge: Directed Graphs and Unidirectional Pairs**\n\nI'm tackling a tricky competitive programming problem where I need to find two things: the minimum number of nodes (let's call it *n*) required to build a directed graph that has a specific property (called *p*-reachability), and then, amongst all the graphs that have this minimum number of nodes, I want to maximize the number of special pairs of nodes, which I'm calling \"unidirectional pairs.\"\n\nLet's break down the definitions: A unidirectional pair is (u, v) where u is not equal to v, there's a path from *u* to *v* but no path from *v* to *u*. And a graph is *p*-reachable if it has exactly *p* pairs (u, v) with u less than v where u and v can reach each other. Here, reachability means there's a path from *u* to *v*, and also from *v* to *u*. These are the same nodes in a Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n\nThe condition u < v is crucial. If u and v are in the same SCC, we count one pair (u, v) if u < v. So, an SCC with *k* nodes contributes k*(k-1)/2 to the *p*-reachability count. My goal is to find the smallest number of nodes (*n*) such that I can form a directed graph satisfying *p*-reachability. The problem becomes an integer partition problem, where I need to partition *n* into SCC sizes (k1, k2, ..., km) such that  k1*(k1-1)/2 + k2*(k2-1)/2 + ... + km*(km-1)/2 = p while minimizing n = k1 + k2 + ... + km.\n\nUsing a greedy strategy by always picking the largest possible SCC size that fits into the remaining *p* isn't necessarily optimal for minimizing *n*. Instead, a dynamic programming approach seems more reliable to find the minimum *n*. I'll build a DP table where dp[i] holds the minimum number of nodes needed to achieve *i* reachable pairs. My loop will consider all possible SCC sizes (k >= 2) and their corresponding contributions to reachability. The dynamic programming equation would look like, dp[i] = min(dp[i - f(k)] + k) for all valid k's and where f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2. This is a classic unbounded knapsack problem. By precalculating  f(k) up to a reasonable max_k value, I will have it ready for the DP updates.  After finding the minimum number of nodes for p reachability (n_min), I have to build the graph and maximize the unidirectional pairs.  The key is the order of the SCC's.\n\nOnce I have the partition (k1, k2, ..., km) that minimizes *n*, I need to figure out how to arrange the SCCs to maximize unidirectional pairs.  This becomes an optimization problem as well. To maximize unidirectional pairs, I should connect these SCCs in a way that minimizes cycles. The condensation graph of SCCs should be a single path, S1 -> S2 -> ... -> Sm. All nodes in Si can reach all nodes in Sj for i < j. This produces the maximum unidirectional pairs. To get the actual count of unidirectional pairs, I'll essentially calculate the number of edges I can create between the SCCs.\nFor this step, I need to tweak my dynamic programming. It's not enough to store just the minimum number of nodes dp[p]. I need to store both the minimum number of nodes and the resulting \"cost\" of the arrangement. I need to keep track of a cost for each possible partition which leads to the minimal number of nodes.\n\nSo, for each p-reachable graph with n_min nodes, my objective is to maximize the sum k1*k2 + k1*k3 + ... + km-1*km. This is a bit tricky, but it turns out I can rewrite the formula to simplify things. In the same way, while updating the DP, for each reachable value I keep track of the n_min and a second value which represents the squared sum of the partition's values. Now the second goal is to use this value and the following formula to get the maximum number of unidirectional pairs: (n^2 - (k1^2 + k2^2 + ...+ km^2)) / 2\nSo to maximize unidirectional pairs I should minimize sum of square k_i by using this formula. This translates to modifying the dynamic programming states and updating these values during the process to arrive at the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n_min` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `n_min` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n- A directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes (`n_min`)**\n\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of unordered pairs `{u, v}` (with `u != v`) is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. For each such unordered pair, exactly one of `(u, v)` or `(v, u)` satisfies `u < v`. Thus, an SCC of size `k` contributes `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` to the `p`-reachable count. Note that `f(0) = 0` and `f(1) = 0`. We are interested in SCCs of size `k >= 2` to contribute to `p`.\n\nLet `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` be the sizes of the SCCs in a graph. The total number of nodes is `n = sum(k_i)`. The total `p`-reachable count is `sum(f(k_i))`.\nWe want to find the minimum `n` such that `sum(f(k_i)) = p` for some partition `k_1, ..., k_m` of `n`. This is a variation of the unbounded knapsack problem. We can use dynamic programming.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum number of nodes required to achieve `i` `p`-reachable pairs.\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = infinity` for `i > 0`.\nWe iterate through possible SCC sizes `k` (from `2` up to `max_k` where `f(max_k) <= P_MAX`).\nFor each `k`, let `val_k = f(k)`. We update the `dp` table:\n`dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - val_k] + k)` for `i` from `val_k` to `P_MAX`.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 * 10^5`.\n`k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5` implies `k^2 - k - 4 * 10^5 <= 0`.\nSolving `k^2 - k - 4 * 10^5 = 0` gives `k approx 632.95`. So `max_k = 632`.\nThe time complexity for this DP is `P_MAX * max_k`, which is `2 * 10^5 * 632 approx 1.26 * 10^8`. This might be too slow in Python. However, given the problem context, it's a standard approach for this kind of problem and might pass.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nWe need to find a graph `G` with `n_min` nodes that achieves `p` `p`-reachable pairs, and maximizes unidirectional pairs.\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u -> v` but not `v -> u`. This means `u` and `v` must be in different SCCs.\nIf `u` is in SCC `S_A` and `v` is in SCC `S_B` (`S_A != S_B`), and there's a path from `S_A` to `S_B` in the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs), then all nodes in `S_A` can reach all nodes in `S_B`. For any such `u` in `S_A` and `v` in `S_B`, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair. The number of such pairs is `|S_A| * |S_B|`.\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange the SCCs in a linear chain (a single path) in the condensation graph. Let the SCCs have sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. If we arrange them as `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`, then for any `i < j`, all nodes in `S_i` can reach all nodes in `S_j`. The total number of unidirectional pairs will be `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nWe know that `(sum k_i)^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nSince `sum k_i = n_min` is fixed, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = (n_min^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nTo maximize this value, we need to minimize `sum(k_i^2)`.\n\nSo, the DP state needs to store two values: `(min_n, min_sum_k_sq)`.\n`dp[i] = (min_n_for_i, min_sum_k_sq_for_i)`.\nInitialize `dp[0] = (0, 0)` and `dp[i] = (infinity, infinity)` for `i > 0`.\nWhen updating `dp[i]` using `dp[i - val_k]` and `k_val`:\nLet `(prev_n, prev_sum_k_sq) = dp[i - val_k]`.\nThe candidate values are `n_cand = prev_n + k_val` and `sum_k_sq_cand = prev_sum_k_sq + k_val^2`.\nLet `(curr_n, curr_sum_k_sq) = dp[i]`.\nIf `n_cand < curr_n`: `dp[i] = (n_cand, sum_k_sq_cand)`.\nIf `n_cand == curr_n`: `dp[i] = (curr_n, min(curr_sum_k_sq, sum_k_sq_cand))`.\nIf `n_cand > curr_n`: `dp[i]` remains unchanged.\n\nAfter filling the DP table, `(n_min, min_sum_k_sq)` will be `dp[p]`.\nThe maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(n_min^2 - min_sum_k_sq) // 2`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- `p = 0`: `f(k)` is always non-negative. To get `p=0`, we need `sum(f(k_i))=0`. This means all `k_i` must be `0` or `1`. If all `k_i=1`, then `n=m` (number of nodes equals number of SCCs, each size 1).\n  `dp[0] = (0, 0)`.\n  The DP loop starts `k=2`, so `val_k >= 1`. No `dp[0]` updates will be made. So `dp[0]` remains `(0,0)`.\n  This implies `n_min=0` for `p=0`, which is incorrect. A graph needs at least 1 node to exist.\n  If `p=0`, we need `n_min` to be at least 1. If `n_min=1`, we have one node, no pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v`. No `p`-reachable pairs. So `p=0` is achievable with `n=1`.\n  If `n=1`, `k_1=1`. `f(1)=0`. `sum(f(k_i))=0`. `sum(k_i)=1`. `sum(k_i^2)=1^2=1`.\n  So for `p=0`, `n_min=1`, `min_sum_k_sq=1`. Unidirectional pairs `(1^2 - 1) // 2 = 0`.\n  The problem statement implies `u < v`, so we need at least 2 nodes to have any `p`-reachable pairs.\n  If `p=0`, we can have a graph with 1 node, or any number of nodes, as long as each node is its own SCC.\n  To minimize `n`, we can pick `n=1`. Then `k_1=1`. `f(1)=0`. `p=0`. `n_min=1`. `sum(k_i^2)=1`. Unidirectional pairs = `(1^2-1)//2 = 0`.\n  The example output for `p=0` is `0 0`. This means `n_min=0`. This is unusual for graph problems. A graph with 0 nodes has 0 pairs of nodes. So `p=0` is achieved with `n=0`.\n  If `n_min=0`, then `min_sum_k_sq=0`. Unidirectional pairs `(0^2-0)//2 = 0`.\n  So, for `p=0`, the output should be `0 0`.
