For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this Python script for classifying triads.**\n\nMy goal here is to write a script that takes three musical notes as input and correctly identifies them as either \"major,\" \"minor,\" or \"strange.\" I'm approaching this systematically, leveraging my understanding of music theory. First, I need to represent the notes numerically, which is easily done with a dictionary mapping note names (like \"C\" or \"C#\") to integers (0-11). This numerical representation allows for straightforward distance calculations using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclical nature of the musical scale.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in defining what constitutes a major or minor triad. I know that a major triad can be formed by ordering the notes so that the distances between the first and second note is 4 semitones and between the second and third is 3 semitones. Conversely, a minor triad has a distance of 3 followed by a distance of 4. Crucially, the problem states that the answer will always be clear-cut - there won't be a triad that is both major and minor.\n\nMy strategy involves generating all possible permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, I calculate the distances between the notes. If any permutation satisfies the major triad condition, I know it's a major chord. If a permutation satisfies the minor condition, then it's a minor chord. If none of the permutations fit the bill, it is a strange chord. Efficiency isn't a huge concern here because there are only six possible permutations for three notes.\n\nSo, I start by mapping the input notes to their numerical equivalents. Then, I use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible orderings of these numbers. For each permutation, I calculate the distances between adjacent notes, remembering to handle the cyclical wrap-around (using the modulo operator). If a match is found for the major or minor patterns, I break the loop to avoid unnecessary calculations. The \"unambiguous\" nature of the problem allows me to just check for one condition at a time, avoiding a more complex logic to check if a chord could be both and handle that condition.\n\nFinally, the code simply prints \"major,\" \"minor,\" or \"strange\" based on what it found. I also put together a set of example test cases using specific notes to double-check my logic. These include both examples provided in the problem definition, as well as an additional \"strange\" triad. After going through them manually, the code successfully reproduces each classification. The core logic is sound, and I've considered all important music theory implications.\n",
