Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving \"Substitutes in Number\": A Modular Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and my initial thought is, \"How do I avoid the brutal string replacements?\" My intuition tells me that actually performing the substitutions is a terrible idea. If I have a string like \"111...\" and a query that expands \"1\" into \"11\", the length of my string is going to explode! The constraints on the *input* lengths, not the *output* length, are what matter. I need to get clever.\n\nI need the final numerical value modulo a prime, which screams \"modular arithmetic!\" at me. I know I can calculate the value of a string iteratively, like `val = (val * 10 + digit) % M`.\n\nThe key here, like many similar problems, is that I need to either process the queries backward, or use DP/memoization. Let me think about what a query `di -> ti` actually *does*. When I have a `di` in the string, its value is its position multiplied by its numerical value, which itself can be substituted.\n\nSo, let's define two things: `value[d]` which is the *numerical value* of the digit `d` *after* all *future* substitutions, and `length[d]` which is the *length* of `d`'s *final* string representation, modulo `M-1`. That `M-1` thing is important, because I'm thinking I'll need to do some exponentiation of `10`, so I'll probably be using Fermat's Little Theorem.\nI need to compute the modular exponentiation of `10^length[d]`, since the final value of a digit depends on its position.\n\nThe length `L` could be very large, and `10^L mod M` would need to be computed. So, my core algorithm will calculate `value[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d`, iteratively, considering substitutions in reverse order. Then, I can iterate through the original string, replacing each digit with its final `value`, taking its final position into account.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to compute the numerical value of a string `s` after a series of digit replacements, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct string manipulation infeasible. We need to use modular arithmetic and process the queries in a specific order.\n\nLet `M = 10^9 + 7`.\nThe value of a number represented by a string `d_k d_{k-1} ... d_1 d_0` is `d_k * 10^k + d_{k-1} * 10^{k-1} + ... + d_1 * 10^1 + d_0 * 10^0`.\nThis can be computed as `( ( (d_k * 10 + d_{k-1}) * 10 + ... ) * 10 + d_0 )`.\n\nSince queries are applied sequentially, and a replacement `di -> ti` affects all occurrences of `di` *at that moment*, it's often easier to think about what each *original* digit `d` in `s` eventually transforms into. However, this is complicated because `ti` can contain digits that are themselves subject to later replacements.\n\nThe key insight is to process the queries in *reverse order*.\nLet's define `val[d]` as the numerical value of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `M`.\nLet `len[d]` be the length of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `M-1` (because `10^L mod M` requires `L` to be modulo `M-1` by Fermat's Little Theorem if `M` is prime).\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` (0-9) transforms into itself.\nSo, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n`val[d] = d`\n`len[d] = 1`\n\nNow, consider the queries `Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_n`. We process them in reverse: `Q_n, Q_{n-1}, ..., Q_1`.\nWhen we process query `Q_i: di -> ti`:\nThis query tells us that any `di` that existed *before* `Q_i` was applied will be replaced by `ti`.\nWhen we process `Q_i` in reverse, we are updating `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on its *immediate* transformation `ti`. The digits within `ti` have already been \"processed\" by subsequent queries (which we've already handled in our reverse pass).\n\nSo, for `Q_i: di -> ti`:\nWe need to calculate the value and length of `ti` using the current `val` and `len` arrays (which reflect transformations by `Q_{i+1}, ..., Q_n`).\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\nIterate through `char_digit` in `ti` from left to right:\n`d = int(char_digit)`\n`new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, len[d], M) + val[d]) % M`\n`new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[d]) % (M - 1)`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`:\n`val[di] = new_val_di`\n`len[di] = new_len_di`\n\nSpecial case: If `ti` is an empty string, then `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`. This correctly handles \"replace with empty string\".\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, the `val` and `len` arrays will contain the final value and length for each original digit `0-9` after *all* transformations.\n\nFinally, we apply these transformations to the initial string `s`.\nLet `final_ans_val = 0` and `final_ans_len = 0`.\nIterate through `char_digit` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n`d = int(char_digit)`\n`final_ans_val = (final_ans_val * pow(10, len[d], M) + val[d]) % M`\n`final_ans_len = (final_ans_len + len[d]) % (M - 1)`\n\nThe result is `final_ans_val`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**: `s = 222`, `n = 2`, `2->0`, `0->7`\n\n`M = 10^9 + 7`\n\n1.  **Initial state (before any queries):**\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (all modulo `M-1`)\n\n2.  **Queries (stored):**\n    `Q_1: 2 -> 0`\n    `Q_2: 0 -> 7`\n\n3.  **Process queries in reverse:**\n\n    *   **Process `Q_2: 0 -> 7`:**\n        `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n        `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`\n        For `char_digit = '7'`: `d = 7`\n        `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, len[7], M) + val[7]) % M`\n        `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = 7`\n        `new_len_0 = (0 + len[7]) % (M-1) = (0 + 1) % (M-1) = 1`\n        Update `val[0] = 7`, `len[0] = 1`.\n        `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n        `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n    *   **Process `Q_1: 2 -> 0`:**\n        `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n        `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`\n        For `char_digit = '0'`: `d = 0`\n        `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, len[0], M) + val[0]) % M`\n        `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7, `len[0]` is 1, from previous step)\n        `new_len_2 = (0 + len[0]) % (M-1) = (0 + 1) % (M-1) = 1`\n        Update `val[2] = 7`, `len[2] = 1`.\n        `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n        `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n4.  **Process initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n    `final_ans_val = 0`\n    For `char_digit = '2'`: `d = 2`\n    `final_ans_val = (0 * pow(10, len[2], M) + val[2]) % M = (0 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = 7`\n    For `char_digit = '2'`: `d = 2`\n    `final_ans_val = (7 * pow(10, len[2], M) + val[2]) % M = (7 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = (70 + 7) % M = 77`\n    For `char_digit = '2'`: `d = 2`\n    `final_ans_val = (77 * pow(10, len[2], M) + val[2]) % M = (77 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = (770 + 7) % M = 777`\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity**:\n*   Initial setup: O(1)\n*   Storing queries: `N` queries, sum of `|ti|` is `L_total`. This takes O(N + L_total) space.\n*   Processing queries in reverse: `N` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`.
