On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process.** I'm given a sequence of 1s and 2s, and I need to find the maximum non-decreasing subsequence length after reversing a subsegment. The key is that the subsequence must be in the form of all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\nFirst, I realize that I need to efficiently precompute prefix and suffix sums for the number of 1s and 2s in the original sequence. This helps me quickly calculate the counts of 1s and 2s within any subsegment.  I'm thinking about how the reversal affects the optimal LNDS. Reversing a subsegment means I'll have to consider all the ways to 'split' the sequence to get the all-ones then all-twos structure and maximize the split point. The ideal split position may fall inside the reversed segment.\n\nMy initial approach is to iterate through all possible subsegments and then iterate through all possible split points within the *new* sequence, post-reversal. This leads to an O(n^3) solution. That will be too slow for an input size of 2000 so that will not work.\n\nI then try to optimize the computation of the LNDS after the reversal. I observe that the optimal LNDS will always be composed of a prefix of 1s and a suffix of 2s. This means I'm looking for the maximum sum of the number of 1s up to some index and the number of 2s from that index onwards. I consider how this changes when a subsegment is reversed, and that my split can be outside the reversed segment or inside it.\n\nI break the problem into cases depending on the split point's location: before the reversed segment, within the reversed segment, or after the reversed segment.  I consider that LNDS of the original sequence can play a key role in finding the new LNDS.\n\nThe core challenge is figuring out a quick way to compute the LNDS within the reversed segment. I define a new function `f(k)` which represents the LNDS of the original sequence. Then the reversal case can be written in terms of this function, where I compute the counts of one and twos while the index of my sequence index k is in range of the reversal. I think if I can optimize the inner loop, my time complexity is lowered. I introduce variable `j` which goes from r to l which will go through all the necessary computations in constant time, but that's not fully right.\n\nTo find the LNDS within the reversed segment, I express the LNDS in terms of prefix and suffix sums, and try to find a pattern. I finally realize that I can precompute the maximum LNDS for all splits outside the reversed interval, and the LNDS of the array with no reversals is a good base for comparison. The inner calculations now have to maximize the count of twos while using ones that are inside the reversed region, and can be optimized to have a max value for some range.\n\nI define `val[j] = P2[j] - P1[j-1]` so I need to find `max_{l <= j <= r} val[j]`. This simplifies things but might be still be too slow.\n\nIt is time for more thinking.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a chosen subsegment `[l, r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s, and its length `n` is up to 2000.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s will always be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. To maximize its length, we should pick all 1s that appear before some split point and all 2s that appear after that split point.\nLet `a'` be the sequence after reversing `a[l...r]`. The length of the LNDS in `a'` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in a'[1...k] + count of 2s in a'[k+1...n])`.\n\nLet's define prefix sums for counts of 1s and 2s in the original sequence `a`:\n- `P1[i]`: number of 1s in `a[1...i]`. `P1[0] = 0`.\n- `P2[i]`: number of 2s in `a[1...i]`. `P2[0] = 0`.\n\nWe can precompute these arrays in `O(n)` time.\n`P1[i] = P1[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)`\n`P2[i] = P2[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n\nThe total number of 1s in the sequence is `P1[n]`, and total 2s is `P2[n]`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, the sequence `a'` is:\n`a_1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\n\nLet's analyze the contribution to the LNDS based on where the split point `k` falls:\n\n1.  **Split point `k` is before `l` (i.e., `0 <= k < l`)**:\n    The 1s come from `a[1...k]` and 2s come from `a[k+1...n]`.

Initialize `max_overall` with the LNDS of the original sequence (i.e., `max_{0 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + P2[n] - P2[k])`).\n\nWe iterate through all possible `l` from `1` to `n` and `r` from `l` to `n`. There are `O(N^2)` such pairs.\nFor each `(l, r)` pair, we need to find the maximum LNDS.\nThe maximum LNDS for a fixed `(l, r)` is:\n`current_max_lnds = max(`\n  `max_{0 <= k < l} (P1[k] + P2[n] - P2[k]),`\n  `max_{r < k <= n} (P1[k] + P2[n] - P2[k]),`\n  `max_{l <= k <= r} (P1[l-1] + P1[r] - P1[l+r-k-1] + P2[l+r-k] - P2[l-1] + P2[n] - P2[r])`\n`)`\n\nThe first two `max` terms can be precomputed using prefix/suffix max arrays for `f(k) = P1[k] + P2[n] - P2[k]`.\n`pre_max_f[i] = max_{0 <= j <= i} f(j)`\n`suf_max_f[i] = max_{i <= j <= n} f(j)`\nThen `max_{0 <= k < l} f(k)` is `pre_max_f[l-1]` (handle `l=1` case: 0).\nAnd `max_{r < k <= n} f(k)` is `suf_max_f[r+1]` (handle `r=n` case: 0).\nThese precomputations take `O(N)`.\n\nThe crucial part is `max_{l <= k <= r} (P1[l-1] + P1[r] - P1[l+r-k-1] + P2[l+r-k] - P2[l-1] + P2[n] - P2[r])`.\nLet `j = l+r-k`. As `k` goes from `l` to `r`, `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\nThe expression becomes: `P1[l-1] + P1[r] - P1[j-1] + P2[j] - P2[l-1] + P2[n] - P2[r]`.\nRearranging terms:\n`(P1[l-1] - P2[l-1]) + (P1[r] - P2[r] + P2[n]) + (P2[j] - P1[j-1])`\nFor fixed `l, r`, the terms `(P1[l-1] - P2[l-1]) + (P1[r] - P2[r] + P2[n])` are constant.\nWe need to maximize `(P2[j] - P1[j-1])` for `j` from `l` to `r`.\nLet `val[j] = P2[j] - P1[j-1]`.\nWe need to find `max_{l <= j <= r} val[j]`. This can be done in `O(r-l+1)` time, leading to `O(N^3)` overall.\n\nTo optimize the inner loop `max_{l <= j <= r} val[j]` to `O(1)` or `O(log N)` for each `(l, r)`:\nWe can use a Segment Tree or Sparse Table for Range Maximum Query (RMQ) on `val[j]`.\nA Segment Tree takes `O(N)` to build and `O(log N)` per query. Total `O(N^2 log N)`.\nA Sparse Table takes `O(N log N)` to build and `O(1)` per query. Total `O(N^2)`.\nSince `N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6` is acceptable.\n\nLet's use a Sparse Table for RMQ on `val[j]`.\n`val[j]` is defined for `j` from `1` to `n`.\n`ST[i][p]` stores the maximum value in `val[i...i + 2^p - 1]`.\n`ST[i][0] = val[i]`\n`ST[i][p] = max(ST[i][p-1], ST[i + 2^(p-1)][p-1])`\nBuild time: `O(N log N)`.\nQuery `max(val[L...R])`: `O(1)` using precomputed `log_table`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.

Calculate `f[k] = P1[k] + P2[n] - P2[k]` for `k` from `0` to `n`.\n4.  Precompute `pre_max_f` and `suf_max_f` arrays for `f`:\n    `pre_max_f[0] = f[0]`\n    For `i` from `1` to `n`: `pre_max_f[i] = max(pre_max_f[i-1], f[i])`\n    `suf_max_f[n] = f[n]`\n    For `i` from `n-1` down to `0`: `suf_max_f[i] = max(suf_max_f[i+1], f[i])`\n5.

This is correctly handled if `pre_max_f` is defined for index 0 and `l-1` becomes 0.\n- `suf_max_f[r+1]` when `r=n`: `P1[n] + P2[n] - P2[n] = P1[n]`. This is correctly handled if `suf_max_f` is defined for index `n+1` and `r+1` becomes `n+1`. For practical implementation, `suf_max_f[n+1]` could be considered 0 (or negative infinity). A simpler approach is to initialize `current_max_lnds` with `P2[n]` if `l=1` and `P1[n]` if `r=n`, and `max_overall` with `pre_max_f[n]`.\n\nLet's adjust index handling:\n`a` is 0-indexed, `a[0...n-1]`.\n`P1, P2` are 0-indexed, `P1[i]` is count in `a[0...i-1]`. `P1[0]=0, P1[1]` is count in `a[0]`. `P1[n]` is count in `a[0...n-1]`.\n`f[k] = P1[k] + (P2[n] - P2[k])` for `k` from `0` to `n`.\n`l, r` are 1-indexed from problem. Convert to 0-indexed for `a`: `a[l-1...r-1]`.\nSplit point `k` (0 to `n`) means 1s up to `a'[k-1]` and 2s from `a'[k]`.\n\nFor `l, r` (1-indexed):\n`current_max_lnds = 0`\nIf `l > 1`: `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, pre_max_f[l-1])`\nIf `r < n`: `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, suf_max_f[r])` (This is `suf_max_f[r+1]` in 1-indexed `k`, so `f[r+1]` onwards)\n\nFor `l <= k_orig <= r` (1-indexed `k_orig` for split point in original sequence indices):\n`j = l+r-k_orig`. As `k_orig` goes `l...r`, `j` goes `r...l`.\nThe indices for `P1, P2` should be `0...n`.\n`P1[l-1]` (1s before `a[l-1]`)\n`P1[r] - P1[j-1]` (1s in `a[j-1...r-1]`)\n`P2[j] - P2[l-1]` (2s in `a[l-1...j-1]`)\n`P2[n] - P2[r]` (2s after `a[r-1]`)\n\n`constant_term = P1[l-1] - P2[l-1] + P1[r] - P2[r] + P2[n]`\n`val[j] = P2[j] - P1[j-1]` for `j` from `1` to `n`.\nQuery `max_val_in_range` for `j` from `l` to `r`.\n\nFinal `max_overall` must be initialized with `f[0]` (all 2s) and `f[n]` (all 1s) from the original sequence.
