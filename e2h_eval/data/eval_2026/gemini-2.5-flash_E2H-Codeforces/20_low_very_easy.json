    "thought": "**Solving a Competitive Programming Problem: A Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's all about counting the ways to construct these integers, `c_s`, for binary strings of length 1 to `n`. The key is that the *maximum* size of a \"beautiful multiset\" has to be precisely `f`.  And the `c_s` values have to be within a certain range, 0 to `k`.\n\nFirst, I need to wrap my head around this \"beautiful multiset\" concept. Turns out, it's about making sure that for any string, the number of strings in the multiset that start with that string as a prefix doesn't exceed the corresponding `c_s` value.\n\nThe whole prefix structure screams \"tree\" to me. Specifically, a binary trie. Each node represents a binary string, and the children represent extending the string with '0' or '1'.  The leaves are the strings of length `n`.  Each string of length `n` in our multiset has a count `x_s`.\n\nThe constraint boils down to this: for any string `s` (of length less than `n`), the sum of counts for all strings that have `s` as a prefix has to be less than or equal to `c_s`.  And we're trying to *maximize* the total size of the multiset, which is the sum of all the `x_s` values for strings of length `n`.\n\nNow, this is starting to look familiar.  I can solve this with dynamic programming on the tree. Let's define `dp[s]` as the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\n\n*   If `s` is a string of length `n`, `dp[s]` is simply `c_s`.\n*   If `s` has length less than `n`, any string prefixed by `s` is either prefixed by `s0` or `s1`. So, `dp[s]` is the minimum of `c_s` and the sum of `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]`.  The `c_s` acts as the capacity constraint.\n\nWe build this up from the leaves.  The base cases are strings of length `n`, with `dp[s] = c_s`. The overall goal is to find the maximum possible multiset size. This means working all the way up to the root, calculating the `dp` value at each node.\n\nHowever, there's a slight twist. The problem *wants* us to calculate the maximum size by summing up the strings of length `n` but it's defined on strings of length 1 to n (as opposed to 0 to n).\n\nThe total count of strings is the sum of leaves of the trie.  The strings of length 1 are nodes '0' and '1'. The overall goal is the sum of strings of length n. So, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp['0'] + dp['1']`.  This should give us the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output the count modulo $998244353$.\n\nLet's first understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset $M$ of binary strings of length exactly $n$ is beautiful if for every binary string $s$ (length $1$ to $n$), the number of strings in $M$ that have $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $x_t$ be the count of string $t$ (of length $n$) in the multiset $M$. We want to maximize $\\sum_{t \\text{ len } n} x_t$.\n\nThis problem can be modeled using a tree structure. Consider a full binary tree of depth $n$, where nodes represent binary strings. The root is the empty string, its children are '0' and '1', and so on. The leaves are strings of length $n$.\nFor any node $s$ in this tree (representing a string $s$), let $V(s)$ be the maximum possible sum of counts $x_t$ for all leaf nodes $t$ that are descendants of $s$, subject to the constraints $c_{s'}$ for all $s'$ that are descendants of $s$ (including $s$ itself).\nIf $s$ is a leaf node (length $n$), then $V(s) = x_s$. The constraint for $s$ is $x_s \\le c_s$. So, the maximum $x_s$ is $c_s$. Thus, $V(s) = c_s$.\nIf $s$ is an internal node (length $L < n$), its children are $s0$ and $s1$. Any string $t$ prefixed by $s$ is either prefixed by $s0$ or by $s1$. So, $V(s) = V(s0) + V(s1)$. However, there's also the constraint $c_s$: the total count of strings prefixed by $s$ must not exceed $c_s$. Therefore, $V(s) = \\min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $s$ must have length from $1$ to $n$. This means we don't have a $c_{\\text{empty string}}$. The total size of the multiset is the sum of counts for all strings of length $n$. This sum is $V('0') + V('1')$.\nSo, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is $V('0') + V('1')$. We want this sum to be exactly $f$.\n\nLet's define $dp[L][val]$ as the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of some fixed string of length $L-1$, such that $V(s)$ (for this fixed string of length $L-1$) evaluates to $val$.\nHowever, $V(s)$ depends on $c_s$ and $V(s0), V(s1)$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L$, $V(s) = \\min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))$.\nNotice that the structure of the problem is symmetric. For any two strings $s_1, s_2$ of the same length $L$, the subproblem of choosing $c_{s'}$ for descendants of $s_1$ and $s_2$ will yield the same distribution of $V(s_1)$ and $V(s_2)$ values.\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a *single* string $s$ of length $L$, such that $V(s)$ evaluates to $v$.\n\nBase case: $L=n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $V(s) = c_s$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, for each $v \\in [0, k]$, there is exactly $1$ way to choose $c_s$ such that $V(s)=v$ (namely, $c_s=v$).\n$dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$. All other $dp[n][v]=0$.\n\nRecursive step: For $L < n$.\nTo compute $dp[L][v]$, we consider a string $s$ of length $L$. Its children are $s0$ and $s1$.\n$V(s) = \\min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))$.\n$V(s0)$ can take any value $v_0$, and $V(s1)$ can take any value $v_1$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $V(s0)=v_0$ is $dp[L+1][v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $V(s1)=v_1$ is $dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $V(s)=v$ depends on $v_0+v_1$.\nLet $S = V(s0) + V(s1)$.\nIf $S < v$: This is impossible, as $V(s) = \\min(c_s, S) \\le S$. So $V(s)$ cannot be $v$.\nIf $S = v$: We need $c_s \\ge v$. The number of choices for $c_s$ is $k-v+1$.\nIf $S > v$: We need $c_s = v$. The number of choices for $c_s$ is $1$.\n\nSo, $dp[L][v]$ is calculated as follows:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1] \\cdot (\\text{count of valid } c_s \\text{ for } V(s)=v)$.\nLet $P_L[S] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$. This is the coefficient for $S$.\nThis sum is a convolution. $P_L[S]$ is the $S$-th coefficient of $(DP_{L+1}(x))^2$, where $DP_{L+1}(x) = \\sum_{v=0}^k dp[L+1][v] x^v$.\nThe maximum possible value for $S$ is $2k$. So $P_L[S]$ can be computed for $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\n\nThen, for each $v \\in [0, k]$:\n$dp[L][v] = \\left( \\sum_{S=0}^{v-1} P_L[S] \\cdot 0 \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{S=v}^{v} P_L[S] \\cdot (k-v+1) \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{S=v+1}^{2k} P_L[S] \\cdot 1 \\right)$.\nMore simply:\n$dp[L][v] = P_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1) + \\sum_{S=v+1}^{2k} P_L[S]$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{S=v+1}^{2k} P_L[S]$ can be computed efficiently using suffix sums. Let $SuffP_L[v'] = \\sum_{S=v'}^{2k} P_L[S]$.\nThen $dp[L][v] = P_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1) + SuffP_L[v+1]$.\nAll calculations are modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe maximum value $v$ can take is $k$. So $dp[L][v]$ is defined for $v \\in [0, k]$.\nThe maximum value $S = v_0+v_1$ can take is $2k$. So $P_L[S]$ is defined for $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\nThe $k$ value can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe convolution $P_L[S]$ takes $O(k^2)$ time naively, or $O(k \\log k)$ using FFT/NTT.\nSince $n$ is up to $15$, we have $n$ layers of DP.\n$n \\cdot k^2$ would be too slow ($15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\approx 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$).\n$n \\cdot k \\log k$ would be $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nFinal step: After computing $dp[1][v]$ for $v \\in [0, k]$.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $V('0') + V('1')$.\nThis is $\\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$ such that $v_0+v_1 = f$.\nThis is again a convolution sum, similar to $P_L[S]$.\nLet $Ans[F] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=F} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nThe answer to the problem is $Ans[f]$.\nThis final convolution also takes $O(k \\log k)$ time.\n\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot k \\log k)$.\nTotal space complexity: $O(k)$ for storing $dp[L][\\cdot]$, $P_L[\\cdot]$, $SuffP_L[\\cdot]$.\n\nLet's use NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) for convolution. The modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number of the form $c \\cdot 2^m + 1$, suitable for NTT.\nThe maximum degree of polynomial is $2k$. So we need an NTT size $N_{NTT}$ which is a power of 2, greater than $2k$. For $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. The smallest power of 2 greater than $4 \\cdot 10^5$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.\n\nImplementation details for NTT:\n- `MOD = 998244353`\n- `ROOT = 3` (primitive root modulo MOD)\n- `inv_ROOT = pow(ROOT, MOD - 2, MOD)`\n- `ntt(a, invert)` function to perform NTT/inverse NTT.\n- Convolution function `convolve(a, b)` using NTT.\n\nLet's trace the values:\n`dp_curr` stores $dp[L][\\cdot]$. `dp_next` stores $dp[L+1][\\cdot]$.\nInitially, `dp_curr` represents $dp[n][\\cdot]$. Set `dp_curr[v] = 1` for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nLoop $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n  `dp_next = dp_curr` (rename for clarity in loop)\n  Compute $P_L[S]$: $P_L = \\text{convolve}(dp\\_next, dp\\_next)$. Truncate $P_L$ to length $2k+1$.\n  Compute $SuffP_L$: $SuffP_L[2k] = P_L[2k]$, $SuffP_L[j] = (P_L[j] + SuffP_L[j+1]) \\pmod{MOD}$ for $j=2k-1$ down to $0$.\n  Initialize `dp_curr` (for $L$) to all zeros.\n  For $v$ from $0$ to $k$:\n    $term1 = P_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$\n    $term2 = SuffP_L[v+1]$ if $v+1 \\le 2k$, else $0$.\n    $dp\\_curr[v] = (term1 + term2) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nAfter the loop, `dp_curr` contains $dp[1][\\cdot]$.\nFinally, compute the answer:\n  $Ans = \\text{convolve}(dp\\_curr, dp\\_curr)$. Truncate $Ans$ to length $2k+1$.\n  The result is $Ans[f]$.\n\nExample 1: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$L=1$.\nBase case: $dp[1][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le 42$. (This is the $dp[n][v]$ in the general logic, but here $n=1$, so it's $dp[1][v]$).\nThe maximum size is $V('0') + V('1')$.\nLet $v_0 = V('0')$ and $v_1 = V('1')$.\n$dp[1][v_0]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_0$ such that $V('0')=v_0$. Since $n=1$, $V('0')=c_0$. So $dp[1][v_0]=1$ for $0 \\le v_0 \\le k$.\nSimilarly, $dp[1][v_1]=1$ for $0 \\le v_1 \\le k$.\nWe need $v_0+v_1=f$.\nThe number of ways is $\\sum_{v_0+v_1=f} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nFor $f=2$:\n$v_0=0, v_1=2$: $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ way ($c_0=0, c_1=2$).\n$v_0=1, v_1=1$: $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ way ($c_0=1, c_1=1$).\n$v_0=2, v_1=0$: $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ way ($c_0=2, c_1=0$).\nTotal ways = $1+1+1=3$. This matches the example.\n\nConsider constraints: $1 \\le n \\le 15$, $1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$f$ can be up to $2k$. So $Ans$ needs to be computed up to index $2k$.\nThe maximum length of `dp_curr` is $k+1$. The maximum length of `P_L` or `Ans` is $2k+1$.\nThe NTT array size needs to be a power of 2, at least $2k+1$. $2^{19} = 524288$ is sufficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3  # Primitive root modulo MOD\n\n# Function for modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Inverse of a modulo MOD\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT function\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):\n        wlen = power(ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = inv(wlen)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for k_idx in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + k_idx]\n                v = (a[i + k_idx + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k_idx] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k_idx + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n# Convolution function using NTT\ndef convolve(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Determine NTT size N (power of 2 >= len_a + len_b - 1)\n    N = 1\n    while N < len_a + len_b - 1:\n        N <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad arrays with zeros to size N\n    fa = list(a) + [0] * (N - len_a)\n    fb = list(b) + [0] * (N - len_b)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    ntt(fa, False)\n    ntt(fb, False)\n\n    # Multiply point-wise\n    for i in range(N):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n\n    # Perform inverse NTT\n    ntt(fa, True)\n    \n    # The result has length len_a + len_b - 1\n    return fa[:len_a + len_b - 1]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_curr[v] stores dp[L][v] for current L\n    # Max value for v is k.
