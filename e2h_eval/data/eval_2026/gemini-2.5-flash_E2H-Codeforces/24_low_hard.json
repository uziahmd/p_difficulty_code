She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition for \"Browser\" Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Browser\" problem, and my initial thought is to break it down. We're given the total number of tabs, our starting cursor position, and the boundaries of tabs we *need* to keep open. The goal is to figure out the fastest way to close the tabs *outside* this range. It seems pretty straightforward—we're talking about tabs 1 to *l-1* and *r+1* to *n* that need to go.\n\nThe critical operations are moving the cursor left or right, and then the ability to \"close\" all tabs to the left or right of where the cursor is.  I immediately recognize that we need to be really conscious of *a* and *b*, which represent the current minimum and maximum index of unclosed tabs, because those indices determine our movement and what we can close.  In this problem, that means we're really focusing on tabs from 1 to *l-1* and from *r+1* to *n*.\n\nMy first instinct is that this calls for either dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the *minimum* time. Let's think about the state variables: current cursor position, if the left segment is closed, and if the right segment is closed.  If *l* is 1, there's nothing to close on the left; if *r* is *n*, nothing to close on the right. Simple, right?\n\nThinking more, there are basically a few cases to consider: If *l* = 1 and *r* = *n*, we're done; zero time. If only left needs closing (*l* > 1, *r* = *n*), then the cost is the distance from current position to *l*, plus one operation to close everything left of *l*.  For the case where only the right needs closing, the strategy is symmetrical. So, if we know where the cursor is, we can calculate the distance to *l* or *r*, and then we just need one operation to clear out the appropriate tabs. It seems like the solution is simpler than I initially anticipated. I'm going to formulate a clean Python script based on these observations.\n",
