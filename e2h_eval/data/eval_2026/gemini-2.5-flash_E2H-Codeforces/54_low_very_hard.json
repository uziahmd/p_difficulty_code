Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Regular N-gon Angle Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The core of it is finding three distinct vertices in a regular *n*-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle *a*.  The solution needs to output these three vertex indices.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to leverage the geometry of regular polygons and their circumcircles.  Every vertex sits on the circle.  I know that inscribed angles are half the measure of their corresponding central angles, which is a key relationship here.\n\nLet's assume the vertices are labeled 1 to *n* clockwise. Fixing *v2* as the \"vertex\" of the angle feels like a good starting point.  Without losing generality, I can set *v2* to 2. This is permissible because of symmetry. Now I need to figure out how *v1* and *v3* relate to this. Let's fix *v1* as 1.\n\nThe critical observation is that the arc *v1v3* (not going through *v2*) determines the angle *v1-v2-v3*. The number of \"steps\" along the polygon from *v1* to *v3* (clockwise) corresponds to the central angle that subtends this arc.  If *v3* is the *k*-th vertex, where *k* is greater than 2, then the number of steps is *k* - 1.  It follows that the central angle would be (*k* - 1) * (360/*n*). And the inscribed angle is half of this.\n\nThis sets up a framework for systematically exploring possible angles.  I'll iterate through the possible values of *k* (from 3 to *n*) and calculate the angle formed.  I'll keep track of the angle closest to the target angle *a* and the corresponding vertices, which I'll output. I'm confident I can build a solution from here.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output the vertex indices `v1, v2, v3`.\n\nLet the vertices of the regular `n`-gon be numbered `1, 2, ..., n` in clockwise order. All vertices lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1-v2-v3` is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle.\n\nThe measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\nLet `v2` be the vertex of the angle. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1v3` (the arc that does not contain `v2`).\n\nThe central angle between two adjacent vertices in a regular `n`-gon is `360/n` degrees.\nIf two vertices `v_x` and `v_y` are `k` edges apart along the perimeter (meaning there are `k-1` vertices between them), the central angle `angle(v_x O v_y)` (where `O` is the center of the polygon) is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\n\nLet's fix `v2`. Without loss of generality, we can choose `v2 = 2`.\nNow we need to choose `v1` and `v3` such that `v1, v2, v3` are distinct.\nLet `v1 = 1`. This is an arbitrary choice for one side of the angle.\nThen `v3` must be some vertex `k` where `k` is not `1` or `2`. So `k` can range from `3` to `n`.\n\nWith `v1=1` and `v2=2`, the angle `1-2-k` subtends the arc `1k`.\nThe number of edges along the arc `1k` (clockwise, not passing through `2`) is `k - 1`.\nThus, the central angle `angle(1 O k)` is `(k - 1) * (360/n)`.\nThe inscribed angle `angle(1-2-k)` is half of this central angle:\n`angle(1-2-k) = 0.5 * (k - 1) * (360/n) = (k - 1) * (180/n)`.\n\nThis formula gives us all possible angles that can be formed by choosing `v1=1, v2=2` and `v3=k` for `k` from `3` to `n`.\nThe smallest possible angle occurs when `k=3`, giving `(3-1)*(180/n) = 2*(180/n)`.\nThe largest possible angle occurs when `k=n`, giving `(n-1)*(180/n)`.\nNote that `(n-1)*(180/n)` is the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon, which is the largest possible angle formed by three vertices.\n\nSo, for a fixed `v1=1` and `v2=2`, the possible angles are `m * (180/n)` for `m` from `2` to `n-1`.\nWe are looking for an `m` in this range such that `|m * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `base_angle = 180/n`. The possible angles are `m * base_angle`.\nWe want to find `m` (where `2 <= m <= n-1`) that minimizes `|m * base_angle - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `|m - a / base_angle|`.\n\nLet `target_m_float = a / base_angle`.\nWe need to find an integer `m` in the range `[2, n-1]` that is closest to `target_m_float`.\nThere are two candidates for `m`: `floor(target_m_float)` and `ceil(target_m_float)`.\nLet `m1 = floor(target_m_float)` and `m2 = ceil(target_m_float)`.\n\nWe need to check these candidates:\n1. `m1`: If `m1` is within the valid range `[2, n-1]`, calculate `diff1 = |m1 * base_angle - a|`.\n2. `m2`: If `m2` is within the valid range `[2, n-1]`, calculate `diff2 = |m2 * base_angle - a|`.\n\nIt's possible that `m1` or `m2` falls outside the range `[2, n-1]`.\n- If `target_m_float` is less than `2`, then the smallest possible `m` is `2`. So we must choose `m=2`.\n- If `target_m_float` is greater than `n-1`, then the largest possible `m` is `n-1`. So we must choose `m=n-1`.\n- If `target_m_float` is within `[2, n-1]`:\n    - If `m1` is less than `2`, we consider `m=2`.\n    - If `m2` is greater than `n-1`, we consider `m=n-1`.\n    - Otherwise, we compare `m1` and `m2` and pick the one that gives the minimum absolute difference.\n\nLet's define `best_m = 2` initially, and `min_diff = abs(2 * base_angle - a)`.\nThen, iterate `i` from `3` to `n-1`. For each `i`, calculate `current_diff = abs(i * base_angle - a)`.\nIf `current_diff < min_diff`, update `min_diff = current_diff` and `best_m = i`.\n\nHowever, we can optimize this search. Since `m * base_angle` is an increasing function of `m`, we can use a ternary search or simply compare `floor(target_m_float)` and `ceil(target_m_float)`.\n\nLet `target_m_float = a * n / 180.0`.\nWe are looking for an integer `m` in `[2, n-1]` closest to `target_m_float`.\n\nCandidate `m` values:\n1. `m_floor = int(target_m_float)`\n2. `m_ceil = m_floor + 1`\n\nWe need to consider these candidates only if they are within the valid range `[2, n-1]`.\nLet `current_best_m = -1` and `min_abs_diff = float('inf')`.\n\nCheck `m_floor`:\nIf `2 <= m_floor <= n-1`:\n    `diff = abs(m_floor * base_angle - a)`\n    If `diff < min_abs_diff`:\n        `min_abs_diff = diff`\n        `current_best_m = m_floor`\n\nCheck `m_ceil`:\nIf `2 <= m_ceil <= n-1`:\n    `diff = abs(m_ceil * base_angle - a)`\n    If `diff < min_abs_diff`:\n        `min_abs_diff = diff`\n        `current_best_m = m_ceil`\n    # If diff == min_abs_diff, any is fine. The problem states \"any of them\".\n    # So we don't need to update if diff == min_abs_diff.\n\nEdge cases for `m` values:\n- If `target_m_float` is less than `2` (e.g., `a` is very small), the closest valid `m` is `2`.\n- If `target_m_float` is greater than `n-1` (e.g., `a` is very large), the closest valid `m` is `n-1`.\n\nA simpler approach to handle range:\nConsider `m_candidates = []`\nIf `int(target_m_float) >= 2`: `m_candidates.append(int(target_m_float))`\nIf `int(target_m_float) + 1 <= n - 1`: `m_candidates.append(int(target_m_float) + 1)`\nAlso, always consider `m=2` and `m=n-1` as boundaries:\n`m_candidates.append(2)`\n`m_candidates.append(n-1)`\n\nThen filter `m_candidates` to be unique and within `[2, n-1]`.\nFor each valid `m` in `m_candidates`, calculate `abs(m * base_angle - a)` and find the `m` that minimizes this.\n\nExample: `n=3, a=15`\n`base_angle = 180/3 = 60`.\nPossible `m` values are `2` to `n-1 = 2`. So only `m=2` is possible.\nAngle is `2 * 60 = 120`? No, `m` is the number of edges.\nThe angle is `(k-1) * (180/n)`.\nHere `v1=1, v2=2`. `v3` must be `3`.\nThe arc `1-3` has `3-1=2` edges.\nSo `m = 2`.\nThe angle is `2 * (180/3) = 120`. Wait, this is not right.\nA regular triangle angle is 60 degrees.\nMy formula `(k - 1) * (180/n)` gives 120 for `n=3, k=3`.\nThe problem states: \"angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\nFor a triangle `1-2-3`, the angle `1-2-3` is 60 degrees.\nHere `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3`.\nThe arc `1-3` (not containing `2`) is the arc from `1` to `3` clockwise. This arc spans `2` edges.\nThe central angle for `1-3` is `2 * (360/3) = 2 * 120 = 240`.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-3` would be `240/2 = 120`. This is the *reflex* angle.\n\nThe inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1v3`. The measure of the arc is `k * (360/n)` where `k` is the number of sides on the arc `v1v3` (not passing through `v2`).\nThe number of sides on the arc `v1v3` can be `1, 2, ..., n-2`.\nIf `v1=1, v2=2, v3=k`, then the arc `1k` (not passing through `2`) has `k-1` sides.\nThis is what I used.\nThe angle `(k-1) * (180/n)` is the angle formed by `v1`, `v2`, `v3` when `v2` is the vertex, and `v1` and `v3` are chosen such that the arc `v1v3` contains `k-1` segments.\nFor `n=3`, `v1=1, v2=2`. `v3` must be `3`.\n`k=3`. `m = k-1 = 2`.\nAngle `(3-1) * (180/3) = 2 * 60 = 120`.\nThis is the angle `1-2-3` *if* the arc `1-3` is the major arc.\nHowever, in geometry, the angle `v1-v2-v3` usually refers to the *minor* arc, which means the angle is `0 <= angle <= 180`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the angle formula for a regular `n`-gon.\nThe vertices are `V_0, V_1, ..., V_{n-1}`.\nLet `v2` be `V_j`.\nLet `v1` be `V_i` and `v3` be `V_k`.\nThe number of edges on the arc `V_i V_k` (not passing through `V_j`) is `min(|i-k|, n-|i-k|)`.\nNo, this is not correct for inscribed angles.\nThe number of edges on the arc `V_i V_k` (that does not contain `V_j`) is what matters.\nLet's fix `v2` to be vertex `1`. (This is simpler than `2`).\nThen `v1` and `v3` must be `2, ..., n`.\nLet `v1 = 2`.\nThen `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\nThe arc `v1v3` is the arc `2v3`.\nThe number of edges in this arc is `v3 - v1 = v3 - 2`.\nThe central angle subtending arc `2v3` is `(v3 - 2) * (360/n)`.\nThe inscribed angle `2-1-v3` is `0.5 * (v3 - 2) * (360/n) = (v3 - 2) * (180/n)`.\nLet `m = v3 - 2`.\nThe possible values for `m` are:\n`v3 = 3 => m = 1`. Angle: `1 * (180/n)`.\n`v3 = 4 => m = 2`. Angle: `2 * (180/n)`.\n...\n`v3 = n => m = n-2`. Angle: `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\nSo the possible angles are `m * (180/n)` for `m` from `1` to `n-2`.\nLet's check `n=3, a=15`.\n`base_angle = 180/3 = 60`.\nPossible `m` values are `1` to `n-2 = 1`. So only `m=1` is possible.\nAngle is `1 * 60 = 60` degrees.\nThis is correct for a triangle! `|60 - 15| = 45`.\nThe output for `3 15` is `1 2 3`. My choice `v1=2, v2=1, v3=3` gives `2-1-3`.\nThe arc `2-3` has `1` edge. So `m=1`. Angle is `1 * (180/3) = 60`.\nThis is consistent.\n\nSo the general formula for possible angles is `m * (180/n)` where `m` is an integer from `1` to `n-2`.\nWe need to find `m` in `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|m * (180/n) - a|`.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\nLet `target_m_float = a / base_angle = a * n / 180.0`.\n\nWe are looking for an integer `m` in `[1, n-2]` closest to `target_m_float`.\nThe strategy is:\n1. Calculate `target_m_float = a * n / 180.0`.\n2. Consider two candidate integers for `m`: `m_lower = floor(target_m_float)` and `m_upper = ceil(target_m_float)`.\n3. We need to ensure these candidates are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n   - If `m_lower < 1`, the smallest valid `m` is `1`.\n   - If `m_upper > n-2`, the largest valid `m` is `n-2`.\n   - In general, the candidate `m` values we actually check are `max(1, m_lower)` and `min(n-2, m_upper)`.\n\nLet `m_cand1 = max(1, int(target_m_float))`.\nLet `m_cand2 = min(n-2, int(target_m_float) + 1)`.\n\nWe compare `m_cand1` and `m_cand2`.\nIf `m_cand1 == m_cand2`, then there's only one effective candidate (or `target_m_float` is exactly an integer).\nThe actual `m` values to check are `m_floor = int(target_m_float)` and `m_ceil = int(target_m_float) + 1`.\nWe need to check these `m_floor` and `m_ceil` if they fall within `[1, n-2]`.\n\nLet `best_m = -1` and `min_diff = float('inf')`.\n\nIterate `m_test` over `{m_floor, m_ceil}`:\n  If `1 <= m_test <= n-2`:\n    `current_angle = m_test * base_angle`\n    `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`\n    If `diff < min_diff`:\n      `min_diff = diff`\n      `best_m = m_test`\n    # If `diff == min_diff`, we can keep the current `best_m` or update to `m_test`.\n    # The problem says \"any of them\", so no specific tie-breaking rule is needed.\n    # The first one found with minimum difference is fine.\n\nAfter finding `best_m`:\nWe chose `v2=1` and `v1=2`.\nThe third vertex `v3` is `v1 + best_m = 2 + best_m`.\nSo the vertices are `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_m`.\nThese are `2, 1, (2+best_m)`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n`n=3, a=15`\n`base_angle = 180.0 / 3 = 60.0`\n`target_m_float = 15.0 / 60.0 = 0.25`\n`m_floor = 0`, `m_ceil = 1`.\nValid range for `m`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 1]`.\nCheck `m_test = 0`: Not in range `[1,1]`.\nCheck `m_test = 1`: In range `[1,1]`.\n  `current_angle = 1 * 60.0 = 60.0`.\n  `diff = abs(60.0 - 15) = 45.0`.\n  `min_diff = 45.0`, `best_m = 1`.\nFinal `best_m = 1`.\nOutput `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+1 = 3`. So `2 1 3`.\nExample output is `1 2 3`. This is equivalent by re-labeling. My `2 1 3` is the angle `2-1-3`, which is 60 degrees. Their `1 2 3` is angle `1-2-3`, which is also 60 degrees. Any set of three distinct vertices in a triangle forms a 60 degree angle. So `2 1 3` is a valid answer.\n\n`n=4, a=67`\n`base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n`target_m_float = 67.0 / 45.0 = 1.488...`\n`m_floor = 1`, `m_ceil = 2`.\nValid range for `m`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`.\nCheck `m_test = 1`: In range `[1,2]`.\n  `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n  `diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`.\n  `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_m = 1`.\nCheck `m_test = 2`: In range `[1,2]`.\n  `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n  `diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`.\n  `23.0` is not less than `22.0`. So `best_m` remains `1`.\nFinal `best_m = 1`.\nOutput `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+1 = 3`. So `2 1 3`.\nExample output is `2 1 3`. This matches!\n\n`n=4, a=68`\n`base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n`target_m_float = 68.0 / 45.0 = 1.511...`\n`m_floor = 1`, `m_ceil = 2`.\nValid range for `m`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`.\nCheck `m_test = 1`: In range `[1,2]`.\n  `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n  `diff = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`.\n  `min_diff = 23.0`, `best_m = 1`.\nCheck `m_test = 2`: In range `[1,2]`.\n  `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n  `diff = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`.\n  `22.0` is less than `23.0`. So `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_m = 2`.\nFinal `best_m = 2`.\nOutput `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+2 = 4`. So `2 1 4`.\nExample output is `4 1 2`. This is equivalent. My `2 1 4` is angle `2-1-4` (90 degrees). Their `4 1 2` is angle `4-1-2` (also 90 degrees). This is correct.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\nOne small detail for floating point comparisons:\n`abs(m * base_angle - a)` vs `abs((m+1) * base_angle - a)`\nIt's better to compare `m * base_angle - a` directly:\nLet `val1 = m_floor * base_angle - a`\nLet `val2 = m_ceil * base_angle - a`\nWe want `m` such that `abs(m * base_angle - a)` is minimized.\nIf `abs(val1) <= abs(val2)`, then `m_floor` is better or equal.\nOtherwise, `m_ceil` is better.\nThis avoids potential issues with `m_floor` being too small or `m_ceil` being too large.\n\nLet's refine the `best_m` selection logic:\n1. `base_angle = 180.0 / n`\n2. `target_m_float = a / base_angle`\n3. Initialize `best_m = 1` (the smallest possible `m`).\n4. Calculate `min_diff = abs(best_m * base_angle - a)`.\n\n5. `m_cand_floor = int(target_m_float)`\n6. `m_cand_ceil = m_cand_floor + 1`\n\n7. If `1 <= m_cand_floor <= n-2`:\n     `diff_floor = abs(m_cand_floor * base_angle - a)`\n     If `diff_floor < min_diff`:\n       `min_diff = diff_floor`\n       `best_m = m_cand_floor`\n     # Tie-breaking: if diff_floor == min_diff, we can stick with the current best_m\n     # or update to m_cand_floor. The problem allows any optimal solution.\n     # Let's say we prefer smaller m in case of tie:\n     # If `diff_floor == min_diff` and `m_cand_floor < best_m`:\n     #   `best_m = m_cand_floor`\n     # For this problem, it's simpler to just not update if diff is equal.\n\n8. If `1 <= m_cand_ceil <= n-2`:\n     `diff_ceil = abs(m_cand_ceil * base_angle - a)`\n     If `diff_ceil < min_diff`:\n       `min_diff = diff_ceil`\n       `best_m = m_cand_ceil`\n     # Tie-breaking: if diff_ceil == min_diff, we can stick with current best_m\n     # or update to m_cand_ceil.\n\nThis covers the cases where `target_m_float` is far from `1` or `n-2`.\nFor example, if `target_m_float = 0.25` (as in `n=3, a=15`):\n`m_floor = 0`, `m_ceil = 1`.\n`best_m` initializes to `1`. `min_diff = abs(1*60 - 15) = 45`.\n`m_cand_floor = 0`. Not in `[1, 1]`. Skipped.\n`m_cand_ceil = 1`. In `[1, 1]`.\n  `diff_ceil = abs(1*60 - 15) = 45`.\n  `diff_ceil` is not `< min_diff`. `best_m` remains `1`.\nResult `best_m = 1`. Correct.\n\nFor example, if `target_m_float = n-1.5` (large `a`):\n`n=10, a=170`\n`base_angle = 180.0 / 10 = 18.0`\n`target_m_float = 170.0 / 18.0 = 9.44...`\nValid range for `m`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 8]`.\n`m_floor = 9`, `m_ceil = 10`.\n`best_m` initializes to `1`. `min_diff = abs(1*18 - 170) = 152`.\n`m_cand_floor = 9`. Not in `[1, 8]`. Skipped.\n`m_cand_ceil = 10`. Not in `[1, 8]`. Skipped.\nThis logic would incorrectly return `best_m = 1`.\n\nThe initial `best_m` should be `1` if `1` is a valid `m`, or `n-2` if `1` is not valid (i.e. `n-2 < 1` which implies `n<3`, but `n>=3`). So `best_m = 1` is always a valid starting point.\n\nThe candidates to check should be `1`, `n-2`, `floor(target_m_float)`, `ceil(target_m_float)`.\nCollect all valid `m` values from `[1, n-2]` among these four.\n`candidates = set()`\n`candidates.add(1)`\n`candidates.add(n-2)`\n`candidates.add(int(target_m_float))`\n`candidates.add(int(target_m_float) + 1)`\n\n`best_m = -1`\n`min_diff = float('inf')`\n\nFor `m_val` in `candidates`:\n  If `1 <= m_val <= n-2`:\n    `current_angle = m_val * base_angle`\n    `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`\n    If `diff < min_diff`:\n      `min_diff = diff`\n      `best_m = m_val`\n\nThis is more robust.\nLet's re-test `n=10, a=170`:\n`base_angle = 18.0`\n`target_m_float = 9.44...`\nValid range `[1, 8]`.\n`candidates = set()`\n`candidates.add(1)`\n`candidates.add(8)`\n`candidates.add(9)` (`int(target_m_float)`)\n`candidates.add(10)` (`int(target_m_float) + 1`)\n\n`best_m = -1`, `min_diff = inf`.\n\n`m_val = 1`: In range `[1, 8]`.\n  `angle = 1 * 18 = 18`. `diff = abs(18 - 170) = 152`.\n  `min_diff = 152`, `best_m = 1`.\n\n`m_val = 8`: In range `[1, 8]`.\n  `angle = 8 * 18 = 144`. `diff = abs(144 - 170) = 26`.\n  `26 < 152`. `min_diff = 26`, `best_m = 8`.\n\n`m_val = 9`: Not in range `[1, 8]`. Skipped.\n\n`m_val = 10`: Not in range `[1, 8]`. Skipped.\n\nFinal `best_m = 8`.\nOutput `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+8 = 10`. So `2 1 10`.\nThe angle `2-1-10` is `8 * (180/10) = 8 * 18 = 144` degrees.\n`abs(144 - 170) = 26`.\n\nIs this correct? The largest possible angle is `(n-2)*(180/n)`.\nFor `n=10`, this is `(10-2)*(180/10) = 8 * 18 = 144` degrees.\nSince `a=170` is greater than the maximum possible angle `144`, the closest angle must be `144`.\nSo `best_m=8` is correct.\n\nThe approach of checking `1`, `n-2`, `floor(target_m_float)`, `ceil(target_m_float)` and filtering for range `[1, n-2]` is correct and covers all cases.\n\nThe output format is `v1 v2 v3`.\nMy chosen vertices are `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_m`.\nThese are `2 1 (2+best_m)`.\n\nFinal check on constraints: `3 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= a <= 180`.\nCalculations involve floating point numbers. `180.0 / n` can be small, `a * n / 180.0` can be large.\n`n=10^5`, `base_angle = 180 / 10^5 = 0.0018`.\n`a=1`, `target_m_float = 1 / 0.0018 = 555.55...`\n`m_floor = 555`, `m_ceil = 556`.\n`n-2 = 10^5 - 2 = 99998`.\nAll candidates `1, 99998, 555, 556` are well within `[1, n-2]`.\nThe calculations use standard floats/doubles, which should be sufficient precision for angles. The problem doesn't mention precision requirements, but `abs(angle - a)` implies standard float comparisons.\n\nPython's `float` type is usually a double-precision floating-point number. This should be sufficient.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The possible angles are m * (180/n), where m is the number of edges\n    # on the arc subtended by the angle's sides (not passing through the vertex).\n    # For a regular n-gon, m can range from 1 to n-2.\n    # We fix v2 = 1, v1 = 2.
