    "thought": "**The Lexicographically Smallest String Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a string of 0s, 1s, and 2s, and I need to find the smallest possible string I can get by swapping adjacent characters according to these rules: 0s and 1s can swap, and 1s and 2s can swap.  But 0s and 2s cannot swap directly. That's the core constraint.\n\nMy immediate thought is, how do these swaps affect the *relative order* of the characters?  0s can pass through 1s, and 2s can also pass through 1s.  Essentially, 1s are \"mobile\" - they can slide past any 0 or 2. However, the order of 0s and 2s is *fixed*. If a 0 appears before a 2 in the original string, it *must* stay before that 2 in the final string. This is the key.\n\nSo, I need to think about blocks. I can imagine the string as a sequence of fixed blocks of 0s and 2s, with the 1s flowing freely in between.  To make the smallest string, I want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, followed by 1s, and then 2s. But, the fixed order of 0s and 2s within the \"blocks\" complicates this.\n\nHere's my strategy: first, extract the subsequence of 0s and 2s, preserving their original order.  Then count the number of 1s in the original string. This subsequence of 0s and 2s sets the layout of our \"blocks\" – the 0s and 2s are nailed down in that relative position. The remaining 1s, I can place anywhere among these blocks to minimise the lexicographic order.\n\nNow, how do I position the 1s within the blocks? I've concluded that the optimal placement is immediately before the *first* 2 in the extracted 0-2 subsequence. By positioning the group of 1s *before* the first 2, it will result in the smallest lexicographic order.\n\nIn other words, I'll process the original string, adding 0s and 2s to a new list, while counting the 1s. Then I'll insert those 1s into the correct position in my new list to form the resulting lexicographically smallest string. This should handle all possible input strings efficiently. All in all, this should be the right path to the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly applying two types of adjacent swaps: '0' with '1' (e.g., \"01\" <-> \"10\") and '1' with '2' (e.g., \"12\" <-> \"21\"). Swapping '0' and '2' directly (e.g., \"02\" <-> \"20\") is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1.  '0' and '1' can swap.\n2.  '1' and '2' can swap.\n\nThis means that a '1' character can move past any '0' or any '2' character. For example, in \"012\":\n*   '1' can swap with '0' to become \"102\".\n*   '1' can swap with '2' to become \"021\".\nThis shows that a '1' can effectively \"bubble\" through '0's and '2's. Since a '1' can move past any '0' to its left/right and any '2' to its left/right, all '1's can be grouped together into a contiguous block. They are completely mobile relative to '0's and '2's, and also relative to each other.\n\nNow let's consider '0's and '2's. The crucial constraint is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This implies that their relative order is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must remain before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must remain before that '0'.\nTo demonstrate this: for '0' and '2' to swap their relative positions, they must either directly swap (forbidden) or one must \"jump\" over the other. The only way to jump over another character is by swapping with an intermediate '1'.\nConsider `...X Y...` where `X` is '0' and `Y` is '2'. For `X` to move after `Y`, it would need to pass `Y`. If `X` and `Y` are adjacent (`02`), they cannot swap. If they are separated by '1' (`012`), '0' can swap with '1' to get `102`, or '1' can swap with '2' to get `021`. In both `102` and `021`, the '0' is still before the '2'. No sequence of allowed swaps can change the relative order of a '0' and a '2'.\n\nTherefore, the relative order of all '0's and '2's in the string is invariant.\nThis means we can extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their order, to form a subsequence. Let's call this `S_02`. All '1's are then a separate pool that can be inserted anywhere into `S_02`.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string:\n1.  We want to place '0's as early as possible.\n2.  Then '1's.\n3.  Then '2's.\n\nThe `S_02` subsequence dictates the fixed arrangement of '0's and '2's. We have a block of `N_1` ones (where `N_1` is the total count of '1's in the original string) to insert into `S_02`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we should place the block of '1's:\n*   After all '0's that appear *before* any '2' in `S_02`.\n*   Before all '2's.\n\nThis means the optimal position for the block of '1's is immediately before the *first* '2' character in the `S_02` subsequence. If `S_02` contains no '2's (i.e., the original string only has '0's and '1's), then all '1's should be placed after all '0's. If `S_02` contains no '0's (i.e., the original string only has '1's and '2's), then all '1's should be placed before all '2's.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize an empty list, `res_chars`, to store the '0's and '2's in their relative order.\n2.  Initialize a counter, `count_1`, to zero.\n3.  Iterate through the input string `s`:\n    *   If the character is '0', append '0' to `res_chars`.\n    *   If the character is '1', increment `count_1`.\n    *   If the character is '2', append '2' to `res_chars`.\n4.  Find the index of the first '2' in `res_chars`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n    *   If no '2' is found in `res_chars`, set `first_two_idx` to `len(res_chars)` (meaning all '1's will be appended at the end of `res_chars`).\n5.  Construct the final string:\n    *   Take the part of `res_chars` before `first_two_idx`.\n    *   Append `count_1` '1's.\n    *   Append the part of `res_chars` from `first_two_idx` onwards.\n    *   Join these three parts to form the final string.\n\n**Example: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1.  `res_chars = []`, `count_1 = 0`.\n2.  Iterate `s`:\n    *   '1': `count_1 = 1`\n    *   '0': `res_chars = ['0']`\n    *   '0': `res_chars = ['0', '0']`\n    *   '2': `res_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n    *   '1': `count_1 = 2`\n    *   '0': `res_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n    After iteration: `res_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`, `count_1 = 2`.\n3.  Find first '2' in `res_chars`: `res_chars[2]` is '2'. So `first_two_idx = 2`.\n4.  Construct result:\n    *   `\"\".join(res_chars[0:2])` = `\"00\"`\n    *   `\"1\" * count_1` = `\"11\"`\n    *   `\"\".join(res_chars[2:])` = `\"20\"`\n    Result: `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through the string once to build `res_chars` and count '1's. Finding the first '2' in `res_chars` takes at most O(N) time. String concatenation/joining also takes O(N) time.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store `res_chars` and the final result string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    res_chars = []\n    count_1 = 0\n\n    # Step 1: Separate '0's and '2's into res_chars, count '1's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            res_chars.append('0')\n        elif char == '1':\n            count_1 += 1\n        elif char == '2':\n            res_chars.append('2')\n\n    # Step 2: Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # The '1's should be placed before the first '2' in res_chars\n    # to make the string lexicographically smallest.\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(res_chars):\n        if char == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n\n    # If no '2' is found, place all '1's at the end of the '0's and '2's sequence\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        first_two_idx = len(res_chars)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the final string\n    # Join the prefix of '0's and '2's, then the block of '1's, then the suffix of '0's and '2's\n    result = \"\".join(res_chars[0:first_two_idx]) + \"1\" * count_1 + \"\".join(res_chars[first_two_idx:])\n\n    sys.stdout.write(result + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
