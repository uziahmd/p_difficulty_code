The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the probability of a successful radio tower assignment, modulo 998244353. It’s all about these towns, towers, and signal powers. We've got towns numbered 0 to n+1 in a line, with the radio towers built in the middle, towns 1 to n. Each tower is built with a 50/50 chance, and if built, we pick a power level from 1 to n. The power dictates how far a tower's signal reaches—it's a range from `i-p+1` to `i+p-1`, where `i` is the tower's location and `p` its power. \n\nKey constraints: towns 0 and n+1 get no signal. And, importantly, each of towns 1 to n must be reached by exactly one tower's signal. Let's define S as the set of towns where towers are *actually* built.\n\nThe math boils down to finding a set S and power assignments for each tower in S, such that those ranges partition the towns 1 to n, without overlapping, and that covers all the towns. This gives us constraints. Any tower at position 'i' can only use power levels up to `min(i, n+1-i)`, to prevent it from reaching town 0 or n+1. That is critical.\n\nThis looks like it might have a dynamic programming flavor, but we're dealing with *probabilities* which is going to make it trickier. The total number of configurations is 2^n. Counting valid S arrangements looks tough.\n\nWhen n is 1, a single tower at position 1 with power level 1 is the only valid case. For n=2, we found a single successful case where two towers exist, each with power level 1.\nFor n=3 there are 2 successful assignments.\nIt becomes clear that to make a partition of towns, you can build a set of non-overlapping towers which together cover the range 1 to n.\n\nThe problem seems to boil down to counting the ways to partition towns 1 to n into contiguous ranges where each range's *center* has a tower. These ranges have odd length, so towns are perfectly covered.\n\nLet's use `f(n)` to be the number of successful tower arrangements. The probability will be f(n)/2^n.  We need some clever way to count the possibilities, with the constraints in mind. It feels like we are on the right track, and it looks like some recursion might apply here. Let's keep exploring!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, after building radio towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, there exists a way to set signal powers such that:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one radio tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each town $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in [1, n]$. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the range $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n*   **Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal:**\n    For any tower at $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$, it must not cover $0$ or $n+1$.\n    $|0 - i| < p_i \\implies i < p_i$. So we must have $p_i \\le i$.\n    $|(n+1) - i| < p_i \\implies n+1 - i < p_i$. So we must have $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n    Combining these, for each tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n    This also implies that the range $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ is entirely contained within $[1, n]$. Specifically, $i-p_i+1 \\ge i-\\min(i,n+1-i)+1 \\ge 1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le i+\\min(i,n+1-i)-1 \\le n$.\n\n*   **Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one radio tower:**\n    This means the ranges $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of the interval $[1, n]$. That is, they must be disjoint, and their union must be exactly $[1, n]$.\n    Let a segment be $[L, R]$. Its length is $R-L+1$.\n    If this segment is covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p$, then $L = i-p+1$ and $R = i+p-1$.\n    From this, we can derive:\n    *   $R-L+1 = (i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1$. The length of any covered segment must be odd.\n    *   $L+R = (i-p+1) + (i+p-1) = 2i$. The center of the segment is $i = (L+R)/2$. Since $L+R$ must be even, $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity. This is consistent with the length $2p-1$ being odd.\n    *   The town $i = (L+R)/2$ must be in $S$.\n    *   Any town $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ cannot be the center of any segment.\n\nSo, a configuration of towers $S$ is valid if and only if there exists a partition of $[1, n]$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that for each segment:\n1.  $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd.\n2.  The center $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is an integer.\n3.  The set of all centers $\\{i_j\\}$ is exactly $S$.\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of valid tower configurations for a given $n$.\nLet's analyze the structure of such partitions.\nConsider the towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nIf town $k$ is covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, then $k \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe boundary points are critical.\nIf $k$ is covered by a tower at $i$, and $k+1$ is covered by a tower at $j$, and $i \\ne j$, then $k$ must be the rightmost point covered by $i$, and $k+1$ must be the leftmost point covered by $j$.\nSo $k = i+p_i-1$ and $k+1 = j-p_j+1$.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as finding specific paths in a graph, or using dynamic programming.\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to partition the prefix $[1, k]$ satisfying the conditions.\nFor $dp[k]$, the segment covering $k$ must be $[L, k]$ for some $L$.\nThe center of this segment is $i = (L+k)/2$. This $i$ must be in $S$.\nAll other towns $j \\in [L, k]$ where $j \\ne i$ must not be in $S$.\nThe remaining towns $[1, L-1]$ must be covered by a valid partition, which contributes $dp[L-1]$ ways.\n\nThis definition of $dp[k]$ is problematic because $S$ is chosen globally.\nInstead, let $dp[k]$ be the number of valid tower configurations for the segment $[1, k]$.\nThis is still not quite right, as the choice of a tower at $i$ might depend on whether $i$ is covered from the left or right.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of valid ways to set towers for towns $1, \\dots, k$ such that town $k$ is covered by a tower whose range ends at $k$.\nThis is a standard approach for problems involving partitioning an interval.\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of valid tower configurations for the towns $1, \\dots, k$.\nBase cases:\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty prefix has one valid configuration: no towers).\n$dp[k] = 0$ for $k < 0$.\n\nTo calculate $dp[k]$:\nConsider the town $k$. It must be covered by some tower $i \\in S$.\nLet this tower at $i$ have power $p_i$. Its range is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nSince $k$ is covered, $i-p_i+1 \\le k \\le i+p_i-1$.\nSince this tower is the *only* one covering $k$, its range must end at $k$. So $i+p_i-1=k$.\nThe length of this segment is $2p_i-1$. The segment starts at $L = k - (2p_i-1) + 1 = k-2p_i+2$.\nThe center of this segment is $i = (L+k)/2 = (k-2p_i+2+k)/2 = k-p_i+1$.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  A tower must be placed at $i=k-p_i+1$. So $A_{k-p_i+1}=1$.\n2.  No towers must be placed at $j \\in [k-2p_i+2, k]$ except for $j=k-p_i+1$. So $A_j=0$ for $j \\in [k-2p_i+2, k]$ and $j \\ne k-p_i+1$.\n3.  The prefix $[1, k-2p_i+1]$ must be covered by a valid configuration.\n\nThis structure suggests a Fibonacci-like recurrence.\nLet $f[k]$ be the number of ways to choose towers for towns $1, \\dots, k$ such that all towns $1, \\dots, k$ are covered by exactly one tower each, and no tower covers town $0$ or $k+1$.\n$f[0] = 1$ (empty configuration).\n$f[1]$: Tower at $1$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Valid. $f[1]=1$.\n$f[2]$:\n    1. Tower at $1$, $p_1=1$. Tower at $2$, $p_2=1$. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. Valid.\n    2. Other options are not valid (as shown in thought process).\n    So $f[2]=1$.\n$f[3]$:\n    1. Tower at $1$, $p_1=1$. Tower at $2$, $p_2=1$. Tower at $3$, $p_3=1$. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. Valid.\n    2. Tower at $2$, $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. $S=\\{2\\}$. Valid.\n    So $f[3]=2$.\n$f[4]$:\n    1. $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $p_i=1$. Valid.\n    2. $S=\\{1,3\\}$, $p_1=1, p_3=2$. (Tower at $1$ covers $[1,1]$, tower at $3$ covers $[2,4]$). Valid.\n    3. $S=\\{2,4\\}$, $p_2=2, p_4=1$. (Tower at $2$ covers $[1,3]$, tower at $4$ covers $[4,4]$). Valid.\n    So $f[4]=3$.\n$f[5]$:\n    1. $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, $p_i=1$. Valid.\n    2. $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$, $p_1=1, p_3=2, p_5=1$. Valid.\n    3. $S=\\{3\\}$, $p_3=3$. Valid.\n    So $f[5]=3$. (Note: My manual calculation for $f[5]$ in the thought process was wrong, I missed $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$ case, which is $f[1] \\times f[3] \\times f[1]$ if we consider $n=1$ as $f[1]$ and $n=3$ as $f[3]$).\n\nThe sequence $f[k]$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, \\dots$\nThis is not directly Fibonacci. Let's re-evaluate.\nThe recurrence for $f[k]$ can be constructed as follows:\nA valid configuration for $[1, k]$ can end in two ways:\n1.  Town $k$ is covered by a tower at $k$ with power $p_k=1$. This tower covers $[k, k]$.\n    For this to be valid, town $k$ must have a tower ($A_k=1$).\n    The remaining towns $[1, k-1]$ must form a valid configuration.\n    This contributes $f[k-1]$ ways.\n2.  Town $k$ is covered by a tower at $i < k$ with power $p_i > 1$.\n    Let this tower be at $i$ with power $p_i$. Its range is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n    Since it covers $k$ and its range ends at $k$, we have $i+p_i-1 = k$.\n    The starting point of this range is $L = i-p_i+1$.\n    The center $i$ must have $A_i=1$.\n    Crucially, for all $j \\in (L, k)$ where $j \\ne i$, we must have $A_j=0$.\n    The remaining towns $[1, L-1]$ must form a valid configuration.\n    Consider the case where the rightmost segment $[L, k]$ has center $i=(L+k)/2$.\n    The towns $L, \\dots, k$ are covered by this single tower at $i$.\n    All towns $j \\in [L, k]$ except $i$ must *not* have towers.\n    This means $A_j=0$ for $j \\in [L,k] \\setminus \\{i\\}$.\n    The number of such segments $[L,k]$ is $k-L+1$.\n    The length $k-L+1$ must be odd.\n    The total count $f[k]$ for $n=k$ is given by $f[k-1]$ (if $A_k=1, p_k=1$) plus $f[k-2]$ (if $A_{k-1}=0, A_k=0$, and $A_i=1$ for $i$ covering $[k-2, k]$) etc.\n\nThis is a known recurrence related to Fibonacci numbers.\nLet $F_m$ be the $m$-th Fibonacci number with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nThe sequence $f[n]$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nLet's check:\n$f[0]=1 = F_1$\n$f[1]=1 = F_2$\n$f[2]=1 = F_3$\n$f[3]=2 = F_4$\n$f[4]=3 = F_5$\n$f[5]=5 = F_6$\nThis matches the Fibonacci sequence shifted.\nSo, $f[n] = F_{n+1}$.\nThe total number of ways to build towers is $2^n$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nThe recurrence for $F_k$ is $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$.\nTo see why $f[n] = F_{n+1}$:\nConsider the rightmost town $n$.\n1.  If town $n$ is covered by a tower at $n$ with $p_n=1$. This means $A_n=1$. The range is $[n,n]$.\n    The remaining towns $[1, n-1]$ must form a valid configuration. There are $f[n-1]$ ways for this.\n    For this to be valid, $A_n=1$.\n2.  If town $n$ is covered by a tower at $i < n$. Since the range must end at $n$, $i+p_i-1=n$.\n    The length of this segment is $2p_i-1$.\n    The smallest such length is $3$ (for $p_i=2$). This means $L=n-2$.\n    So the segment is $[n-2, n]$. The center is $i=(n-2+n)/2 = n-1$.\n    This implies $A_{n-1}=1$. And $A_n=0, A_{n-2}=0$.\n    The remaining towns $[1, n-3]$ must form a valid configuration. There are $f[n-3]$ ways for this.\n    This is not correct. The recurrence for Fibonacci is usually for partitions where segments are of length 1 or 2. Here segments are of odd length.\n\nLet's re-derive $f[n]$ carefully.\n$f[n]$ is the number of valid tower configurations for $n$ towns.\nConsider the town $n$. It must be covered by exactly one tower.\nCase 1: Town $n$ has a tower, $A_n=1$.\n    Then $p_n$ must be $1$ (since $p_n \\le \\min(n, n+1-n)=1$).\n    This tower covers only town $n$.\n    The remaining towns $1, \\dots, n-1$ must form a valid configuration, and $A_n=1$.\n    This contributes $f[n-1]$ ways.\nCase 2: Town $n$ does not have a tower, $A_n=0$.\n    Then $n$ must be covered by some tower $i < n$.\n    Let this tower be at $i$ with power $p_i$. Its range is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n    Since $A_n=0$, this range must end at $n-1$ or earlier, and $n$ is covered by a tower $i$ with $i+p_i-1 = n$.\n    This means $p_i = n-i+1$.\n    The range is $[i-(n-i+1)+1, n] = [2i-n, n]$.\n    The conditions are:\n    *   $A_i=1$.\n    *   $A_j=0$ for all $j \\in [2i-n, n]$ where $j \\ne i$.\n    *   The prefix $[1, 2i-n-1]$ must be valid.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of valid tower configurations for towns $1, \\dots, k$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty set of towers).\nFor $dp[k]$:\n1.  If $A_k=1$: Then $p_k=1$. The tower at $k$ covers $[k,k]$.\n    The remaining $[1, k-1]$ must be valid. This contributes $dp[k-1]$.\n2.  If $A_k=0$: Then $k$ must be covered by a tower at $i < k$.\n    This implies $i+p_i-1=k$. The segment is $[2i-k, k]$.\n    The center is $i$.\n    $A_i=1$. All $A_j=0$ for $j \\in [2i-k, k]$ and $j \\ne i$.\n    The remaining towns $[1, 2i-k-1]$ must be valid. This contributes $dp[2i-k-1]$.\n    What are the possible values for $i$?\n    $i$ must be the center of a segment ending at $k$.\n    The length of segment $[2i-k, k]$ is $k-(2i-k)+1 = 2k-2i+1$. This must be odd.\n    $p_i = k-i+1$.\n    Condition $p_i \\le i \\implies k-i+1 \\le i \\implies k+1 \\le 2i \\implies i \\ge (k+1)/2$.\n    Condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ (using $n$ for current $k$) $\\implies k-i+1 \\le k+1-i \\implies k-i+1 \\le k+1-i$. This is always true.\n    So $i$ can be any integer from $\\lceil (k+1)/2 \\rceil$ to $k-1$.\n    For each such $i$, we have $A_i=1$, and $A_j=0$ for $j \\in [2i-k, k] \\setminus \\{i\\}$.\n    The number of towns in $[2i-k, k]$ is $2k-2i+1$.\n    The number of towns in $[2i-k, k] \\setminus \\{i\\}$ is $2k-2i$.\n    This means $2k-2i$ towns must have $A_j=0$.\n    This specific tower configuration for $A_j$ for $j \\in [2i-k, k]$ is unique.\n    The number of ways for $dp[k]$ is $dp[k-1]$ (for $A_k=1$) plus sum over $i$ for $A_k=0$.\n    For $A_k=0$, the segment covering $k$ must be $[L, k]$ where $L < k$.\n    The center $i=(L+k)/2$ must have $A_i=1$. All other $j \\in [L, k]$ must have $A_j=0$.\n    The prefix $[1, L-1]$ must be valid.\n    So $dp[k] = dp[k-1] + \\sum_{L \\text{ odd length}, L<k} dp[L-1]$ where $L$ is the start of a segment ending at $k$.\n    The length $k-L+1$ must be odd. This means $L$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n    $L=k-1$ (length 2, invalid)\n    $L=k-2$ (length 3). Center is $k-1$. $A_{k-1}=1$, $A_k=0, A_{k-2}=0$. Contribution $dp[k-3]$.\n    $L=k-4$ (length 5). Center is $k-2$. $A_{k-2}=1$, $A_k=0, A_{k-1}=0, A_{k-3}=0, A_{k-4}=0$. Contribution $dp[k-5]$.\n    So $dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-3] + dp[k-5] + \\dots + dp[k-(2m-1)]$ until $k-(2m-1) \\le 0$.\n\n    Let's test this recurrence:\n    $dp[0]=1$\n    $dp[1]=dp[0]=1$\n    $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$\n    $dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[0]=1+1=2$\n    $dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[1]=2+1=3$\n    $dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[2]+dp[0]=3+1+1=5$\n    $dp[6]=dp[5]+dp[3]+dp[1]=5+2+1=8$\n    This is indeed $F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n    $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, \\dots$\n    So $f[n] = F_{n+1}$.\n\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1}$ efficiently. Since $n$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, we can use matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci numbers.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe top-left element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n$ will be $F_{n+1}$.\nThe matrix exponentiation takes $O(\\log n)$ matrix multiplications. Each matrix multiplication is $2 \\times 2$, so constant time. Total $O(\\log n)$.\n\nThe modulo is $998244353$.\nWe also need to calculate $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ and its modular inverse.\n$2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ can be calculated using binary exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe modular inverse $(2^n)^{-1}$ can be calculated using Fermat's Little Theorem: $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$. This also takes $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\nTotal time complexity: $O(\\log n)$.\nSpace complexity: $O(1)$.\n\nLet's implement matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci numbers.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, n):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = mat_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0:\n        # For n=0, there are no towns 1..n, so no towers are built.\n        # Towns 0 and 1 (n+1) don't get signal.\n        # Towns 1..n (empty set) get signal from exactly one tower (vacuously true).\n        # So it's 1 valid configuration out of 2^0 = 1 total.
