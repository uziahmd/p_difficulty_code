There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Maximizing House Profit**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem to tackle. The goal is to maximize profit from building houses, where the profit of a house is the square of its height. I need to figure out how to optimize this, given some restrictions.\n\nThe parameters `n`, `h`, and `m` are small, indicating that a brute-force or dynamic programming solution within a polynomial bound should be achievable. This means I can probably explore all possible combinations of heights, even if it's exponential in the number of houses or height.\n\nFirst, I define `heights[j]` as the height of the house at spot `j`. My objective is to maximize the sum of squares of these heights: `sum(heights[j]^2)`.\n\nThe restrictions are the interesting part. Each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` limits the maximum height within a range. This means the highest house `j` with the range from `l_i` to `r_i` cannot exceed `x_i`. It's essential that for any spot `j`, its height `heights[j]` should be less than or equal to `x_i` for any `i` where `l_i <= j <= r_i`. Furthermore, each height has to be within `[0,h]`.\n\nMy intuition is to precompute the maximum possible height for each spot. I'll call it `max_h[j]`. Initially, `max_h[j]` is set to `h`, the global maximum height. Then, I'll go through each restriction and update `max_h[j]` for the corresponding spots within the range. The height for that spot must be lower or equal to the restriction, so I will take the minimum of `max_h[j]` and the corresponding `x_i` values.\n\nAt the end of processing, `max_h[j]` will hold the effective maximum height for spot `j`, considering all constraints.\n\nBecause the profit is the square of the height, and the square function increases with increasing height, it's pretty clear that I should pick the maximum possible height for each house to maximize the total profit. So, I will set `heights[j]` to `max_h[j]`.\n\nFinally, I need to verify that this approach satisfies all constraints. Given my strategy, I'm setting each `heights[j]` to `max_h[j]`. Because `max_h[j]` is by construction less than or equal to `h`, and also considers all the other restriction bounds on the `x_i` values, it's clear that it also satisfies all the restrictions. Therefore, using the precomputed `max_h[j]` values provides the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building `n` houses, where each house `i` can have an integer height `a_i` between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum allowed height `x_i` for any house within that range. That is, for any restriction `i`, `max(a_j for j in [l_i, ..., r_i]) <= x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and the objective function.\nThe constraints `n, h, m <= 50` are very small, suggesting that a simple or even somewhat inefficient approach might pass.\nThe objective is to maximize `sum(a_j^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`. Since `a_j^2` is always non-negative and increases with `a_j` (for `a_j >= 0`), to maximize the sum, we should try to make each `a_j` as large as possible.\n\nConsider a single house at spot `j`. What is the maximum height it can have?\n1. It must be at most `h` (the global maximum height).\n2. For every restriction `k` such that spot `j` is within the range `[l_k, r_k]` (i.e., `l_k <= j <= r_k`), the height `a_j` must be at most `x_k`.\n\nCombining these conditions, the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j`, let's call it `max_allowed_height[j]`, is the minimum of `h` and all `x_k` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\nMathematically: `max_allowed_height[j] = min(h, min(x_k for all k such that l_k <= j <= r_k))`.\nIf no restrictions cover spot `j`, then `max_allowed_height[j] = h`.\n\nOnce we determine `max_allowed_height[j]` for each spot `j`, we can simply choose `a_j = max_allowed_height[j]`. This choice maximizes `a_j` individually, and since the profit `a_j^2` is independent for each house and `a_j^2` is an increasing function of `a_j`, this strategy maximizes the total profit.\n\nLet's verify that this choice satisfies all restrictions:\nFor any restriction `i` with range `[l_i, r_i]` and maximum height `x_i`:\nWe need to ensure `max(a_j for j in [l_i, ..., r_i]) <= x_i`.\nBy our construction, for any `j` in `[l_i, ..., r_i]`, `a_j = max_allowed_height[j]`.\nAnd by definition of `max_allowed_height[j]`, it must be `<= x_i` because `x_i` is one of the values considered in the `min` operation for `max_allowed_height[j]`.\nTherefore, `a_j <= x_i` for all `j` in `[l_i, ..., r_i]`, which implies `max(a_j for j in [l_i, ..., r_i]) <= x_i`.\nAll restrictions are satisfied.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize an array `max_allowed_height` of size `n`. For each spot `j` from `0` to `n-1` (using 0-based indexing for convenience), set `max_allowed_height[j] = h`.\n2. For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n   Iterate `j` from `l_i-1` to `r_i-1` (converting 1-based to 0-based indexing).\n   Update `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`.\n3. Calculate the total profit: `sum(max_allowed_height[j]^2 for j from 0 to n-1)`.\n\nExample 1:\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\nInitialize `max_allowed_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n\nProcess restrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`: Spot 1 must be `<= 1`.\n   `max_allowed_height[0] = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n   `max_allowed_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`: Spot 2 must be `<= 3`.\n   `max_allowed_height[1] = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n   `max_allowed_height` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`: Spot 3 must be `<= 2`.\n   `max_allowed_height[2] = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n   `max_allowed_height` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nFinal heights: `[1, 3, 2]`.\nTotal profit: `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nComplexity:\n- Initialization: `O(n)`\n- Processing restrictions: `m` restrictions. Each restriction iterates `r_i - l_i + 1` spots. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, `O(m * n)`.\n- Calculating profit: `O(n)`\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\nGiven `n, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50*50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(n)` for `max_allowed_height` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, each spot can have a height up to h.\n    # Using 0-based indexing for spots, so spots are 0 to n-1.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-based indices\n        # l_i corresponds to index l-1, r_i corresponds to index r-1\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            # For each spot in the restricted range, its height must be at most x.\n            # We take the minimum of its current max_allowed_height and x.\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
