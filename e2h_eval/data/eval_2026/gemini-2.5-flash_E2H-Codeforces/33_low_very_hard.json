You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to take a number, represented as a string `a`, and a sequence of digits, also as a string `s`, and maximize the value of `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from `s`.  The catch is that each digit from `s` can only be used once.\n\nMy gut feeling is that since we're aiming to maximize the number, the most significant digits are the most important. That means I need to iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I want to find the *largest* digit in `s` that is greater than the current digit in `a` and use it for the replacement.  If I find a bigger digit, I swap them; otherwise, I just move on.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nFirst, I'll need to read the input, `a` and `s`. Then, to make things easier, I'll convert `a` into a mutable structure like a list of characters because I'm going to be changing its digits. I'll also sort `s` in descending order so that I can easily find the largest available digit.\n\nI'll use a pointer `s_idx` to keep track of where I am in the `s` list. Then, I'll iterate through `a`. In each iteration, I'll compare the current digit in `a` with the largest available digit in `s`. If the digit from `s` is bigger, I'll replace the digit in `a` and increment `s_idx`. If I run out of digits in `s`, or the digit from `s` is not larger, I'll just move on to the next digit in `a`.\n\nOnce I've gone through all the digits of `a`, I'll join the modified list of characters back into a string and print it. That will be the maximized number.\n",
