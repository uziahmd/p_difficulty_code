Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My primary focus here is to solve a competitive programming problem related to Morse code sequences.**  I need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be derived from substrings of a growing Morse code string `S`.  `S` starts empty and characters (0s and 1s) are appended sequentially. After each append operation, I need to output the count modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nFirst, I established the basic rules of Morse code within this problem.  Valid Morse code sequences are strings of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4, excluding four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"), for a total of 26 valid codes (corresponding to the English alphabet).\n\nThe core of the problem involves identifying and counting all possible ways to \"parse\" substrings of `S` into valid Morse code sequences. I realized that a dynamic programming approach would be the most efficient strategy. I need to iterate through substrings of `S` and calculate the number of valid parses for each.\n\nMy initial attempt used a `dp` table to store the number of ways to parse prefixes of a given substring. But I quickly realized this led to an inefficient O(m^3) algorithm, where `m` is the length of `S`. I focused on optimizing it.\n\nMy critical insight was to use a *suffix*-based dynamic programming approach. I want to build a `dp_suffix` array for each state of `S`, focusing on building from the end of a substring. `dp_suffix[i]` will store the number of non-empty sequences that can be generated starting from `S[i...k-1]`, where k is the current length of the string.  I need to carefully define the base case for `dp_suffix[k]` and the transition rules for calculating `dp_suffix[i]` from `i = k-1` down to 0, considering Morse code rules for lengths 1 to 4 and avoiding the excluded strings. I have realized the need to use `(1 + dp_suffix[i+x])` so as to correctly account for length considerations while including a single letter mapping.\n\nMy goal is now to optimize the `dp` computation to achieve an O(m^2) solution which should be efficient enough to meet the problem's time constraints.  I will have to handle edge cases properly and carefully retrace the example given. I need to make sure I am accurately counting *non-empty* sequences by starting a count at `1` within the `dp_suffix` calculation. I am now confident that this approach will produce the correct results.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by *any* substring of a growing string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. When a new character is appended, `S` becomes `S'` of length `k+1`. We need to calculate the sum of non-empty sequences for all substrings of `S'`. The total count for `S'` is the count for `S` plus the count for all new substrings ending at index `k`. These new substrings are `S'[0...k]`, `S'[1...k]`, ..., `S'[k...k]`.\n\nLet `count_sequences(substring)` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that `substring` can represent.\nThe total answer after `k` appends will be `TotalAns_k = \\sum_{0 \\le i \\le j < k} \\text{count_sequences}(S[i...j])`.\nWhen `S` grows to `S'` (length `k+1`), `TotalAns_{k+1} = TotalAns_k + \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\text{count_sequences}(S'[i...k])`.\n\nWe can compute `\\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\text{count_sequences}(S'[i...k])` efficiently using dynamic programming.\nLet `dp[p]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by the suffix `S'[p...k]`.\nThe base case is `dp[k+1] = 0` (an empty string represents no non-empty sequences).\nWe compute `dp[p]` for `p` from `k` down to `0`:\n`dp[p] = 0`.\nFor each possible Morse code length `len` from 1 to 4:\n  If `S'[p...p+len-1]` is a valid Morse code (and `p+len <= k+1`):\n    `dp[p] = (dp[p] + 1 + dp[p+len]) % MOD`.\n    Here, `1` accounts for `S'[p...p+len-1]` itself forming a single-letter sequence.\n    `dp[p+len]` accounts for sequences formed by `S'[p...p+len-1]` followed by any sequence from `S'[p+len...k]`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[p]` for all `p` from `0` to `k`, the sum we need to add to `TotalAns_k` is `\\sum_{p=0}^{k} dp[p]`.\nThis approach calculates `dp[p]` for `k+1` values, each taking `O(1)` time (checking up to 4 fixed-length substrings). So, each append operation takes `O(k)` time.\nSince `k` goes up to `m`, the total time complexity will be `O(m^2)`.\nGiven `m \\le 3000`, `m^2 = 9 \\times 10^6`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: Create a set of all valid Morse code strings of length 1 to 4.\n    The invalid codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All other `26` strings of length 1-4 are valid.\n    `valid_codes = set()`\n    `for length in range(1, 5):`\n        `for i in range(2**length):`\n            `code = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)`\n            `if code not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}:`\n                `valid_codes.add(code)`\n\n2.  **Initialization**:\n    `S = []` (to store characters of the growing string)\n    `total_ans = 0`\n    `MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n\n3.  **Process Each Append Operation**: For each new character `char` (either '0' or '1'):\n    a.  Append `char` to `S`. Let the new length be `k`.\n    b.  Initialize `dp` array of size `k+1`. `dp[k]` will be `0` (for the empty suffix `S[k...k-1]`).\n    c.  Iterate `p` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n        `dp[p] = 0`\n        For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `p + len <= k`: (i.e., substring `S[p...p+len-1]` is within bounds)\n                `substring = \"\".join(S[p : p+len])`\n                If `substring` is in `valid_codes`:\n                    `dp[p] = (dp[p] + 1 + dp[p+len]) % MOD`\n    d.  Calculate `new_contribution = \\sum_{p=0}^{k-1} dp[p] % MOD`.\n    e.  Update `total_ans = (total_ans + new_contribution) % MOD`.\n    f.  Print `total_ans`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\")**\n\n`valid_codes` contains \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", ..., \"111\" (since \"111\" is not in the invalid set).\n\n**1.

The time complexity is `O(m)` because at each step `k`, we compute only one `dp` value `dp[k]`, which takes `O(1)` (fixed 4 checks). The string `S` itself can grow up to length `m`, so storing it as `S` (list of characters) and joining substrings `S[len-code_len : len]` would take `O(code_len)` time.
