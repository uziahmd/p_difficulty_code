And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Sleep Time Calculations**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the average sleep time across all possible 'k'-day weeks, given a set of daily sleep data. Let's break this down. I've got `n` days of data, a 'week' length `k`, and a list of sleep times `a1` to `an`. The constraints are reasonable, with `k` not exceeding `n`, which are both up to 200,000.\n\nFirst, the basic idea is clear: I have `n - k + 1` weeks. For each week, I sum up the sleep times for those `k` consecutive days.  Then I average those sums. A simple, brute-force approach would be to iterate through all the starting positions of the weeks and sum the sleep times within each week, storing those sums and then averaging them.  That would be `O((n-k+1) * k)`, which seems okay if `k` is close to 1 or close to `n`. However, if `k` is roughly `n/2`, that approach becomes `O(n^2)`, and I suspect that'll be too slow and lead to a Time Limit Exceeded error.\n\nI know I can improve this. I've worked with this pattern many times. I'm thinking I can definitely optimize the sum calculation. This screams \"sliding window\" or \"prefix sum\" technique to me. Instead of recalculating the entire sum for each week, I can use a prefix sum array. I'll create a `P` array where `P[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`. So, the sum of a week starting at day `i` and going to day `j` will just be `P[j+1] - P[i]`. That's a huge speedup - going from O(k) each time to a constant time difference. This will give me a time complexity that's more like `O(n)`, since constructing the prefix sum array will be O(n) and then iterating to find the week sums should be O(n-k+1) - essentially O(n). That's much more efficient than the naive approach, especially when `k` is large relative to `n`. It feels much more elegant and efficient, and is probably the right way to approach this problem. Now, let's code this up!\n",
