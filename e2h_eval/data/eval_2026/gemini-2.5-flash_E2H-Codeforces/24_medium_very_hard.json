She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Browser\" problem and formulate a Python script to solve it.** The goal is to minimize the time (number of moves) to leave only a specified segment of tabs open, while all others are closed. The core logic involves understanding the allowed operations, analyzing the cost of each, and strategizing to achieve the minimum cost.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input: the total number of tabs (`n`), the initial cursor position (`pos`), and the left and right bounds (`l` and `r`) of the segment that should remain open. The fundamental moves are to move the cursor left or right and to close tabs (either to the left or the right of the current cursor position). Each of these moves takes one second.\n\nThe most important insight is to recognize the dynamic nature of `a` (minimum open tab) and `b` (maximum open tab), which are affected by closing operations. Closing a set of tabs changes these bounds. Effectively, closing tabs is the primary goal, and moving the cursor is merely the tool to facilitate this.\n\nI've broken down the problem into several cases. If all tabs are already in the target range (`l == 1` and `r == n`), the answer is trivially zero. If there's only a single edge to close (left side if `l > 1` and `r == n`, or right side if `l == 1` and `r < n`), it's a straightforward calculation – move the cursor to the required edge and close the tabs in one step.\n\nThe most challenging scenario is when both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`). Here, I need to determine the optimal order of closing the left and right sides. There are two viable strategies: close left first, then right, or vice-versa.  For both approaches, the cursor must visit both l and r at some point. By analyzing both scenarios, I've derived a concise formula to represent the minimum time required. The final formula I came up with is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`. This accurately captures the optimal path for all possible cursor starting positions and `l`, `r` configurations. It elegantly accounts for the two close operations, the movement to the closer of `l` or `r`, and the movement from one end to the other.\n\nI'm confident this logic is sound and covers all edge cases.\n\nIn the final step, I'm writing the Python code to implement this logic. I'm focusing on clarity and efficiency, handling each case explicitly. The script should read the input parameters, apply the appropriate formula based on the identified cases, and output the minimum time. I've also verified this with a few test cases and seems to be working correctly. I'll test it thoroughly with the sample inputs and other cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We are given the total number of tabs `n`, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the desired range `[l, r]`. Each operation (moving the cursor one step or closing a segment of tabs) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs to close:**\n    If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means all tabs are already within the desired range `[1, n]`. No operations are needed.\n    *   Time: `0`\n\n2.  **Only the left side needs to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r == n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must move to tab `l` and then perform the \"close tabs to the left\" operation.\n    *   Time: `abs(pos - l)` (to move cursor from `pos` to `l`) + `1` (to close tabs `[1, l-1]`).\n\n3.  **Only the right side needs to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l == 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must move to tab `r` and then perform the \"close tabs to the right\" operation.\n    *   Time: `abs(pos - r)` (to move cursor from `pos` to `r`) + `1` (to close tabs `[r+1, n]`).\n\n4.  **Both sides need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    This requires two closing operations: one at `l` (to close left) and one at `r` (to close right). The cursor must visit both `l` and `r`.\n    There are two main strategies:\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        Total time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second.\n        Total time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n    The minimum time for this case will be the minimum of Strategy A and Strategy B.\n    *   Time: `min(abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1, abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1)`.\n\nThe `a` and `b` in the movement operations `max(i-1, a)` and `min(i+1, b)` refer to the current minimum and maximum indices of *unclosed* tabs. However, for calculating the total distance between `pos`, `l`, and `r`, these bounds do not affect the `abs(x - y)` calculation as long as the path is within the current `[a, b]` range, which it always will be for `l` and `r` as they are within the desired final open tabs. The movement costs are simply the absolute differences in tab indices.\n\nThe solution applies these rules in order to find the minimum time.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, pos, l, r from standard input\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are already within the desired range [l, r].\n    # This means l is 1 and r is n.
