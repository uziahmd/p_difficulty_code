And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the average sleep time, but it's not a straightforward average. It's an average *across* weeks, where each week is a consecutive block of `k` days.  The inputs are the total number of days (`n`), the week size (`k`), and the sleep times for each day (`a1` to `an`).\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle this step-by-step. First, I need to define what constitutes a \"week\" - that's easy, it's just `k` consecutive days.  Then, I need to figure out *how many* of these weeks are possible. With `n` days and a week of `k` days, there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks, which makes sense intuitively.\n\nNext, I have to define the average sleep time for a *single* week. This is simply the sum of the sleep times for that week, divided by `k`.  Finally, the *overall* average is the average of *all* those weekly averages.  This means I need to sum the average sleep times for each of the `n - k + 1` weeks and then divide by `n - k + 1`.\n\nNow, let's get into the math.  If I let `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (starting from day `i`), the average for that week, `Avg_i`, is just `S_i / k`. The overall average, then, becomes the sum of all `Avg_i` divided by `n - k + 1`.  A little bit of manipulation reveals that this simplifies to the sum of all `S_i` divided by `k * (n - k + 1)`.\n\nSo, the real challenge is efficiently calculating the sum of all those `S_i` values. A naive approach of summing `k` elements for each week would be `O(n*k)`. Given the potential size of n and k, which can both be very large, this would be too slow.\n\nThat's when the sliding window approach clicks. I can calculate the sum for the first week (`S_1`) directly. Then, to get the sum for the next week (`S_2`), I can subtract the first day of the previous window and add the next day.  This takes constant time, `O(1)`, for each subsequent week! By using this sliding window technique, the complexity becomes `O(n)`, since I only need to iterate over all days once. I just need to calculate `S_1` and iterate the remaining `n-k` times. I'll need to keep track of the total sum of all weekly sums: `total_sum_of_week_sums`. Then the final result will be `total_sum_of_week_sums` divided by `k * (n - k + 1)`. That's the core of the algorithm.\n",
