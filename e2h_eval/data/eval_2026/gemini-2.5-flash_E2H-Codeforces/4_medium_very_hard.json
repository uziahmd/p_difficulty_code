The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan:** This problem asks me to write a Python script that figures out how many losses each player, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, gets in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  I need to use a cyclic strategy because the input sequences for their moves can be quite large.\n\n**Breaking it Down:** First, I'll need to define how the game works (Rock beats Scissors, etc.). Then, since the rounds can be massive, I can't just simulate every round. I need to spot a repeating pattern, which I can do because the players use a repeating sequence of moves. The *least common multiple* (LCM) of the lengths of these sequences gives me the length of a single repeating cycle of the game, in terms of winning and losing. I'll use this LCM to handle really huge values of `n`. I'll also figure out a helper function to determine the outcome of a single round.\n\n**Algorithm:** My code will:\n1.  **Figure out the winner:**  I will create a function `who_wins()` to easily tell who wins in a single round, given the choices of Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2.  **Calculate cycle losses:** I will then calculate the number of times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose within a single cycle. This is the core optimization step!\n3.  **Handle the Big Rounds:**  Use the cycle data to figure out most of the answer and only compute the few rounds left over.\n4.  **Count the Remaining Rounds:** For any rounds left over after the cycles, I'll simulate them directly, since it's a small number.\n\n**Helper Functions:** I know I'll need to use the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) to handle the cycle.  Python's `math` module has the GCD function, and I'll use that to calculate the LCM.\n\n**Edge Cases and Data Structures:** The sequences `A` and `B` are strings, so I can use string indexing. The number of losses are integers. The inputs are given to me, so I can read those. There is a `n` that is a very big number, but because of the cyclic nature, there will not be an issue.\n\n**In Code:**  I'll set up `who_wins()` with a concise dictionary to look up winning pairs. Then, I'll calculate the cycle length using `gcd` and `lcm`.  I'll then run a simulation for a single cycle and then extrapolate the losses across the total number of rounds. Finally, I will compute the remaining losses for the left over rounds.  I think this will be an efficient and elegant solution.\n",
