There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Quest for Maximum Games**\n\nAlright, let's break down this problem. We're trying to find the maximum number of games a tournament winner can play, given a specific rule: players can only compete if their game counts differ by at most one.  My initial thought is to trace the winner's path, game by game, to see how the number of players involved grows. We define `k` as the number of games played and `W` as the winner.\n\nStarting with the first game, `W` plays against a player who has zero games played. Easy, valid.  After this first game, `W` has one game played.  The rule then dictates who `W` can play next: anyone who has played zero, one, or two games.  This leads to the notion of `f(k)`, representing the *minimum* number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games.\n\nThe core observation is that a player with `k` wins means that the player has played `k` games. It seems we're looking for a Fibonacci-like pattern. We need to determine how the number of players increases as the winner progresses.\n\nAnalyzing the game structure, let's explore scenarios for the winner's games:  After `W` wins one game, `W` could potentially face multiple opponent types based on how many wins they have achieved. Let's call a player who's won `k` games a \"k-win player\".\n\nIn other words, the number of players for k games is found by adding the number of players needed for k-1 and the number of players needed for k-2, making it a recursive relationship, just like the fibonacci sequence. This defines the logic in this problem.\n\nUltimately, by calculating the minimum required players for `k` games, we can determine the maximum `k` that remains under the provided `n` players. This approach involves calculating player counts for various game counts, with a goal of achieving the highest possible value without exceeding `n`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. All players start with 0 games played.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`, where `n` is the total number of players.\n\nLet's analyze the `F(k)` sequence:\n\n*   **`F(0)`**: A player who hasn't played any games yet. This just means 1 player is present. So, `F(0) = 1`.\n*   **`F(1)`**: To win 1 game, a player `W` (who has played 0 games) must play against another player `P1` (who has also played 0 games). `|0 - 0| = 0 <= 1`, so this match is valid. After `W` wins, `W` has played 1 game.\n    Players needed: `F(0)` for `W`'s path + `F(0)` for `P1`'s path = `1 + 1 = 2`.\n    So, `F(1) = 2`.\n*   **`F(2)`**: To win 2 games, the winner `W` must have already won 1 game. So `W` is a 1-game winner. `W` needs an opponent `P2`. According to the rule, if `W` has played `k_W = 1` game, `P2` must have played `k_P2` games such that `|1 - k_P2| <= 1`. This means `k_P2` can be 0 or 1.\n    1.  **`W(1)` vs `P2(0)`**: `W` (1 game played) plays against `P2` (0 games played). `|1 - 0| = 1 <= 1`, valid. `W` wins, now `W` has played 2 games.\n        Players needed: `F(1)` for `W`'s path + `F(0)` for `P2`'s path = `2 + 1 = 3`.\n    2.  **`W(1)` vs `P2(1)`**: `W` (1 game played) plays against `P2` (1 game played). `|1 - 1| = 0 <= 1`, valid. `W` wins, now `W` has played 2 games.\n        Players needed: `F(1)` for `W`'s path + `F(1)` for `P2`'s path = `2 + 2 = 4`.\n    To minimize the total players required for `W` to play 2 games, we choose the first option.\n    So, `F(2) = 3`.\n*   **`F(k)`**: To win `k` games, the winner `W` must have already won `k-1` games. So `W` is a `(k-1)`-game winner. `W` needs an opponent `P2`. `P2` must have played `j` games such that `|(k-1) - j| <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2` or `k-1`. (Note: `j` cannot be `k` because `P2` cannot have already won `k` games if `W` is only playing its `k`-th game to become a `k`-game winner).\n    1.  **`W(k-1)` vs `P2(k-2)`**: `W` wins.\n        Players needed: `F(k-1)` for `W`'s path + `F(k-2)` for `P2`'s path. Total: `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n    2.  **`W(k-1)` vs `P2(k-1)`**: `W` wins.\n        Players needed: `F(k-1)` for `W`'s path + `F(k-1)` for `P2`'s path. Total: `F(k-1) + F(k-1)`.\n    To minimize players, we always choose the option that requires fewer players. Since `F(k-2)` is always less than or equal to `F(k-1)` (for `k >= 2`), `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` will always be less than or equal to `F(k-1) + F(k-1)`.\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation is `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis sequence `F(k)` (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically `F(k) = fib(k+2)` where `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, ...`.\n\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`. We can compute the Fibonacci numbers iteratively until `F(k)` exceeds `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Handle the base case `n=2`: The winner plays 1 game. Output 1.\n2.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F(1)`).\n3.  Initialize `games_played = 1` (corresponding to `F(1)`).\n4.  Loop:\n    a.  Calculate `next_fib = a + b`. This `next_fib` represents `F(games_played + 1)`.\n    b.  If `next_fib > n`, it means we don't have enough players for the winner to play `games_played + 1` games. Break the loop.\n    c.  Otherwise, update `a = b`, `b = next_fib`, and increment `games_played` by 1.\n5.  Print `games_played`.\n\n**Example Trace (`n=10`):**\n*   Initial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `games_played=1`.\n*   Iteration 1: `next_fib = 1 + 2 = 3`. `3 <= 10`.\n    `a=2`, `b=3`, `games_played=2`. (Winner can play 2 games, needs 3 players)\n*   Iteration 2: `next_fib = 2 + 3 = 5`. `5 <= 10`.\n    `a=3`, `b=5`, `games_played=3`. (Winner can play 3 games, needs 5 players)\n*   Iteration 3: `next_fib = 3 + 5 = 8`. `8 <= 10`.\n    `a=5`, `b=8`, `games_played=4`. (Winner can play 4 games, needs 8 players)\n*   Iteration 4: `next_fib = 5 + 8 = 13`. `13 > 10`. Break.\n*   Output `games_played = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output. Since `n` can be up to `10^18`, the Fibonacci numbers will grow quite large, but Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically. The number of iterations will be small (around 90 for `n=10^18`), making the solution very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base case: If there are only 2 players, they play one game.
