Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about the \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core of it is optimizing how long Vasily can keep his room lit with a limited number of candles and the ability to recycle \"burned out\" candles into new ones.  It's a classic optimization scenario, really.\n\nMy approach is going to be to simulate the entire process. I'll need to keep track of a few key things: the total hours the room is lit (`total_hours`), the number of new candles Vasily has (`new_candles`), and the number of used, \"burned out\" candles he has (`burned_out_candles`).  Initially, the total hours is zero, the `new_candles` is the starting amount (`a`), and the `burned_out_candles` starts at zero.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward: as long as Vasily has new candles, he'll light them. Each new candle burns for one hour, which increments the total hours. That used candle then adds to the count of burned-out candles.  When the number of `burned_out_candles` reaches `b`, I can make a new candle from that. I keep doing this until there are no more new candles and no more I can make from the used ones.\n\nSo, the core of the script will be a `while` loop that continues as long as `new_candles` is greater than zero.  Inside the loop:\n\n1.  **Light Candles:** I'll set the `hours_this_round` to the number of `new_candles` he has. That's the number of hours I can light up the room with those candles. I add this to the total. Then, each of the candles are added to the count of burned-out candles, and `new_candles` is reset to 0.\n2.  **Make New Candles:** I calculate how many new candles can be made from the `burned_out_candles` using integer division (`//`). The remainder of that division (`%`) is the number of used ones that didn't make a new candle. Then, I add the new candles to the `new_candles` pool.\n\nThe loop ends when `new_candles` hits zero. I can then return the `total_hours` – that's the answer.  I think this will be a pretty efficient approach, and I'll make sure to add some comments so it's readable. I'll also add a test with the example walkthrough they provided to be sure it works.\n",
