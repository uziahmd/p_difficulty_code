Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Substitutes in Number\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Substitutes in Number\".  The gist is this: Andrew has a string of digits (`s`), and Eugene sends him a series of replacement queries (`di -> ti`).  The final task is to figure out the numerical value of the resulting string, modulo 1000000007. Seems straightforward, but I need to be careful.\n\nThe naive approach – just performing the replacements directly – is a red flag. The constraints tell me the initial string and the number of queries can be up to 10^5, and the lengths of the replacement strings can add up to 10^5.  If each replacement *doubles* the string's length, I'm heading for an exponential explosion that will tank my runtime and memory usage.  I need to be smarter.\n\nThe key insight is that I don't need the *actual* final string; I just need its value modulo 1000000007.  This screams \"modular arithmetic\" at me.  I start thinking about how to represent the value of a string: `t_k t_{k-1} ... t_1 t_0` is equivalent to `t_k * 10^k + t_{k-1} * 10^(k-1) + ... + t_1 * 10^1 + t_0 * 10^0`.\n\nIf I have a string made up of concatenated substrings, the value is just the sum of the value of each substring multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the length of the *following* substrings. This suggests working with `(value, length)` pairs. For each digit (0-9), I'll keep track of `val[d]` and `len[d]`. `val[d]` is the numerical value that `d` eventually becomes, and `len[d]` is its final length.\n\nCrucially, because I'm dealing with exponents in `10^L`, I need to use Fermat's Little Theorem to optimize `10^L mod MOD`. This means the length (`len[d]`) needs to be calculated modulo `MOD - 1`, not just `MOD`.\n\nMy initial state is simple: for each digit `d`, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`. Then, I'll process the queries in order.  A query \"di -> ti\" means that digit `di` is *replaced* by the value and length represented by the characters of `ti`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the value of a final string `s` (after a series of digit replacements) modulo 1000000007. The initial string `s` can be up to 10^5 characters long, and there can be up to 10^5 queries. The sum of lengths of replacement strings `ti` is also up to 10^5. A naive string replacement approach would be too slow because the string length can grow exponentially.\n\nWe need a method to calculate the final numerical value without explicitly constructing the final string. The value of a number is determined by its digits and their positions (powers of 10). For example, the number represented by string \"123\" is `1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0`. If we replace '1' with \"45\", '2' with \"6\", and '3' with \"7\", the string becomes \"4567\". Its value is `4*10^3 + 5*10^2 + 6*10^1 + 7*10^0`.\n\nNotice that the replacement rule \"di -> ti\" means that every occurrence of `di` is replaced by `ti`. This suggests that the transformation of each digit is independent. However, the order of queries matters: if \"2 -> 00\" is followed by \"0 -> 7\", then original '2's become \"00\", and then these '0's become '7's, resulting in \"77\". If the order was \"0 -> 7\" then \"2 -> 00\", an original '2' would become \"00\", and the '0's would not be affected by the `0 -> 7` rule because it was already processed. This implies we should process queries in reverse order.\n\nLet's consider the effect of a query `di -> ti` if we process queries in reverse. When we process query `k` (the `k`-th query in the input order, but `n-k-1`-th in reverse order), we want to know what `di` *will eventually become*. All queries *after* query `k` (which we have already processed in our reverse pass) have defined the ultimate transformations for digits `0-9`. So, `ti` itself might contain digits that have already been scheduled for further transformations.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWe need to keep track of two values for each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `len[d]`: The length of the string that `d` eventually transforms into. Since lengths are used as exponents for powers of 10, we need `10^L mod MOD`. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD` (for `L > 0`). So, we should store `len[d]` modulo `MOD - 1`. If `L=0`, `10^0 = 1`.\n\nInitialize `val` and `len` for each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `len[d] = 1`\n\nNow, process queries from the *last* query to the *first*.\nFor a query `di -> ti`:\nLet `d_char` be the digit `di`.\nThe new `val[d_char]` and `len[d_char]` will be computed based on `ti`.\nIf `ti` is empty:\n*   `val[d_char] = 0`\n*   `len[d_char] = 0`\nIf `ti` is not empty:\nIterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from left to right.\nFor each character `c`:\n*   Its current numerical value is `val[int(c)]`.\n*   Its current length is `len[int(c)]`.\n*   The contribution of `c` to the total value of `ti` is `val[int(c)] * (10^current_total_length)`.\n*   The `current_total_length` is updated by adding `len[int(c)]`.\n\nLet's maintain `current_total_val = 0` and `current_total_len = 0` for `ti`.\nFor each digit `c` in `ti` (from left to right):\n1.  Get the value and length that `c` will eventually become: `v_c = val[int(c)]`, `l_c = len[int(c)]`.\n2.  Update `current_total_val`: `current_total_val = (current_total_val * pow(10, l_c, MOD) + v_c) % MOD`.\n3.  Update `current_total_len`: `current_total_len = (current_total_len + l_c) % (MOD - 1)`.\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`:\n*   `val[d_char] = current_total_val`\n*   `len[d_char] = current_total_len`\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse order, we have the final `val[d]` and `len[d]` for each original digit `d`.\nFinally, calculate the value of the initial string `s`.\nInitialize `final_ans = 0` and `final_len_exp = 0`.\nIterate through the characters `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n1.  Get the value and length that `c` will eventually become: `v_c = val[int(c)]`, `l_c = len[int(c)]`.\n2.  Update `final_ans`: `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, l_c, MOD) + v_c) % MOD`.\n3.  Update `final_len_exp`: `final_len_exp = (final_len_exp + l_c) % (MOD - 1)`.\n\nThe result is `final_ans`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `s = \"222\"`, queries: `2->0`, `0->7`\n\nInitial state:\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (all modulo `MOD-1`)\n\nQueries in reverse:\n1.  `0 -> 7` (last query):\n    `d_char = '0'`, `ti = \"7\"`.\n    `c = '7'`: `v_7 = val[7] = 7`, `l_7 = len[7] = 1`.\n    `current_total_val = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`.\n    `current_total_len = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`.\n    Update for '0': `val[0] = 7`, `len[0] = 1`.\n\n    State after 1st reverse query:\n    `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  `2 -> 0` (first query):\n    `d_char = '2'`, `ti = \"0\"`.\n    `c = '0'`: `v_0 = val[0] = 7`, `l_0 = len[0] = 1`.
