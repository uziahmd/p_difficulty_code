The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The input is the plate's dimensions (`w` and `h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`). This seems like a straightforward problem. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the rings are defined. Each ring is a border of an inner rectangle. The i-th ring starts 2*(i-1) cells away from the original edge of the plate, and extends one cell wide. This means the dimensions of the i-th inner rectangle are `w - 4(i - 1)` and `h - 4(i - 1)`.\n\nNow, how do I calculate the number of cells in a single ring? I can calculate the perimeter of this inner rectangle. Since the corners are counted twice, I have to subtract 4 to avoid double-counting. So, the number of cells in the i-th ring will be `2 * (w - 4(i-1)) + 2 * (h - 4(i-1)) - 4`. Alternatively, I could use the difference in areas between the outer and inner rectangle which also works, so I have the option of `(w - 4(i - 1)) * (h - 4(i - 1)) - (w - 4(i - 1) - 2) * (h - 4(i - 1) - 2)`.\n\nThe problem constraint tells me that `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. I should analyze these values.  The constraint on `k` is important. The minimum dimension decreases by 4 for each ring. The formula on `k` ensures the plate will not shrink to nothing, so all the dimensions of inner rectangles will always be >= 3. This means that I can safely apply either of the formulas above for all rings. I will choose the former for now.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of gilded cells, I have to iterate from `i = 1` to `k`, and sum up the cells in each ring. So I will have a loop where I compute `W_i` and `H_i` using the original `w` and `h` values and the value of `i`, then use this dimension in the formula mentioned above. I'll maintain a running total to store this result. Looks like I have a plan! I can start writing the Python script now.\n",
