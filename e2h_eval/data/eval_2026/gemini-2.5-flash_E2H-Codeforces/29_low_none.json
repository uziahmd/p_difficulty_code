Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling a String Manipulation and Modular Arithmetic Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got a competitive programming problem here that's hitting the classic string manipulation and modular arithmetic combo.  I see the core task is to process a string `s` through a series of replacement queries, and then calculate the final result modulo `1000000007`.  The catch, of course, is the potential for the string to balloon in size.\n\nLet's break it down.  I start with this initial string `s` of digits. Then, I'm given `n` queries, each a replacement rule: `di -> ti`.  That means find every instance of digit `di` and replace it with the string `ti`.  Crucially, these replacements are *sequential* and can chain, meaning if `ti` contains digits that also get replaced later, those changes will cascade.  The final step is to interpret the resulting string as a number, ignore any leading zeroes, and compute the modulo.\n\nThe initial gut reaction is to just do the replacements directly. But the constraints scream trouble: `|s|` can be up to `10^5`, and `n` can also be `10^5`. If a single replacement rule is, say, `1 -> 11`, that would cause exponential string growth, quickly exceeding memory and time limits. This won't fly.\n\nThe key insight is this *dependency* inherent in the query application. Each replacement step impacts all subsequent ones. So, I need to find a way to model or represent these dependencies efficiently, without having to expand the string fully.  Maybe I can pre-compute some transformation information or use a more clever approach to apply the replacements without actually modifying the string itself. I have to think about how to apply these replacements in a smarter way.  I need to go deeper than just a brute-force approach.\n",
