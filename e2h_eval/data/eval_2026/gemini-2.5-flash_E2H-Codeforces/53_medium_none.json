    "thought": "**The Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to identify the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice, and these occurrences can overlap.  The input is a single string of lowercase Latin letters (length up to 100), and the output is an integer representing this maximum length.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down.  I need to consider all possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible (length of the string minus 1) and working down to 1.  For each length, I'll have to iterate through all possible substrings of that length within the input string.  Then, for each substring, I've got to count how many times it actually shows up in the original string, keeping in mind that overlapping occurrences matter.\n\nThe crux of the challenge lies in efficiently counting these overlapping occurrences. Using Python's built-in `count()` function won't quite cut it, since it only finds non-overlapping instances. So, I need to devise a more granular approach. My plan is to use nested loops: the outer loop handles the substring length, the middle loop iterates through potential starting positions for each substring of that length, and the inner loop goes through the entire string to check and increment the count if there's a match. I'll need to use string slicing to create the substring. It's a brute-force approach, but given the relatively small input size limit of 100, it should be fast enough.\n\nI need to keep track of a `max_len` variable. As soon as I find a substring length that satisfies the \"at least twice\" condition, I'll update `max_len` and break out of the loops, because that would be the longest length.\n\nThe crucial part is the nested loops and checking of the strings. The main complexity should be in the loop iterations and the string comparisons themselves. It's going to be something like `O(N^4)` in the worst case (where N is the length of the input string) because I need nested loops.\n\nI think that should be a robust solution! I'm ready to code this up and test it with a few examples.\n",
