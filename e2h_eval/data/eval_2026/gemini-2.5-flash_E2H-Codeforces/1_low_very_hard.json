The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`). My initial thought is to break down the problem by analyzing the structure of each ring.\n\nThe core idea is that each ring is formed around an \"inner rectangle.\" The first ring sits on the edge, the second two cells in, and so on. Mathematically, this means the *i*-th ring borders an inner rectangle with dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  I'll call these `W_i` and `H_i` respectively.\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check. For the first ring (`i=1`), I get `W_1 = w` and `H_1 = h`, which makes sense. This confirms that the initial logic holds. The number of cells in the *i*-th ring will be the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus 4 (to avoid double-counting corners). This translates to `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to get the overall count. Since each ring is defined by a distinct inner rectangle, and given that each ring has a width of 1 cell, the rings shouldn't overlap. Looking at consecutive rings, the difference in the dimensions of the inner rectangles seems to be 4 on each side. So, for the *i*-th ring, the inner rectangle is `W_i x H_i`. The next inner rectangle, for the *(i+1)*-th ring is `(W_i - 4) x (H_i - 4)`. This confirms that each ring occupies its own distinct set of cells.\n\nTherefore, the total number of gilded cells is simply the sum of the cells in each of the `k` rings. My Python script will iterate through each ring and calculate its cell count based on these formulas, adding each result to a cumulative total.\n",
