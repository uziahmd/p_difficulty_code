Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Feed the Golorp - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and my mind is racing with how to approach this. It's a classic computational problem, disguised as a quirky name for some reason. The core of it boils down to constraint satisfaction, which is right up my alley.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem. The \"Golorp Name\" is the key. It's not just a string; it's a concise language to represent a mathematical expression and constraints. I'm seeing a pattern here: `?(<expression>):-<constraints>`. The `_` symbols are the variables, and their number defines the \"jaws\", hence, the number of input digits the solution needs. It's crucial, in order to get the lexicographically smallest solution, that I process these digits from least to greatest, I presume.\n\nThe expression part, with the variables and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), defines the calculation. The constraints, separated by commas and involving relational operators (`>`, `<`, `=`), are the gatekeepers. It looks like an expression must be evaluated with these variable constraints satisfied, and then evaluated to return True.\n\nNow, my initial thought is, how do I parse the Golorp Name? I need a way to cleanly separate the expression and constraints. Then, I need to figure out how to represent the variables. The number of underscores clearly matters, but how do I number them? Do I just increment a counter as I go through the string? I need to think about that, though in Python, it might not be very important. I could just use a dictionary or a list to store the variables.\n\nThe core algorithm, I believe, will be a backtracking or brute-force approach. I'll need to try different combinations of digits (0-9) for each variable, in a systematic, lexicographically smallest order. I'll evaluate the expression with those values, and then check if the resulting constraints are satisfied. If both expression and constraints check, I've got a valid solution!\n\nI need to be mindful of division by zero. I must handle division by zero errors gracefully. This could be done through if statements.\n\nIf no solution works, I output \"false\".\n\nMy next step is to start writing down some functions in Python to parse this name string into something usable. I'll have a function to parse the expression, another to parse the constraints, and then a backtracking function to handle the variable assignments and constraint checking. Lexicographical order and handling the \"false\" scenario are paramount! Let's get to coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digit values (0-9) for a set of variables that satisfy an arithmetic expression and a set of relational constraints. If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe input string represents a Golorp's name, which defines its diet. It has the format `?(<expression>):-<constraints>`.\n\n**1. Parsing the Golorp Name:**\n\n*   **Variables:** Underscores `_` represent variables. All occurrences of `_` in the entire string refer to the same set of variables. The problem statement \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws\" implies that variables are ordered by their first appearance in the string.\n    *   We can replace each `_` with a placeholder like `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, etc., based on its first appearance.\n    *   Example: `?(__-_/___*__):-___>__`\n        *   The first `_` becomes `x0`.\n        *   The second `_` becomes `x1`.\n        *   The third `_` becomes `x2`.\n        *   The fourth `_` becomes `x3`.\n        *   The fifth `_` becomes `x4`.\n        *   The sixth `_` becomes `x5`.\n        *   The seventh `_` becomes `x6`.\n        *   The string becomes `?(x0x1-x2/x3x4*x5):-x6>x7`. No, this is wrong. The variables are indexed by their *position* in the sequence of underscores.\n        *   Correct interpretation: The first `_` in the entire string is variable `v0`, the second `_` is `v1`, and so on.\n        *   Example: `?(__-_/___*__):-___>__`\n            *   `_` (1st) -> `v0`\n            *   `_` (2nd) -> `v1`\n            *   `_` (3rd) -> `v2`\n            *   `_` (4th) -> `v3`\n            *   `_` (5th) -> `v4`\n            *   `_` (6th) -> `v5`\n            *   `_` (7th) -> `v6`\n            *   The string becomes `?(v0v1-v2/v3v4*v5):-v6>v7`. Still wrong. The example `?(__-_/___*__):-___>__.` corresponds to `0010`. This means there are 4 variables. The number of underscores in the expression part determines the number of variables. The underscores in constraints refer to these same variables.\n            *   Let's re-examine `?(__-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n                *   `__` (first group) -> `v0`\n                *   `-`\n                *   `_` (second group) -> `v1`\n                *   `/`\n                *   `___` (third group) -> `v2`\n                *   `*`\n                *   `__` (fourth group) -> `v3`\n                *   This implies 4 variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n                *   The expression is `(v0 - v1 / v2 * v3)`.\n                *   The constraint part `:-___>__` refers to `v2 > v3`.\n                *   The output `0010` means `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\n                *   Expression: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`.\n                *   Constraint: `v2 > v3` -> `1 > 0`, which is true.\n                *   The expression result is 0. This interpretation makes sense.\n\n*   **Refined Variable Parsing:**\n    1.  Split the input string at `):-`. The left part is `?(<expression>)`, the right part is `<constraints>`.\n    2.  In the `<expression>` part, identify sequences of `_`. Each sequence `_..._` represents a single variable. Let `v0` be the first such variable, `v1` the second, and so on. The number of underscores in a sequence doesn't matter for its identity, only its position.\n    3.  Similarly, in the `<constraints>` part, identify sequences of `_`. These also refer to `v0, v1, ...` based on their *relative* position within the constraint. For example, in `v2 > v3`, `v2` is the first variable in the constraint, and `v3` is the second.\n    4.  The total number of unique variables `N` is determined by the number of `_` groups in the expression part.\n\n*   **Expression Parsing:** The expression is an infix arithmetic expression. It involves variables (`v0` to `vN-1`) and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. The result of this expression must be 0 (as seen in the example `0010` where `0-0/1*0=0`). This is a common pattern in Befunge-like languages where the stack top must be zero for program termination.\n\n*   **Constraint Parsing:** Constraints are separated by commas. Each constraint is `operand1 <op> operand2`, where `operand1` and `operand2` are variables (e.g., `v2` and `v3`). Operators are `>`, `<`, `=`.\n\n**Data Structures for Parsed Info:**\n\n*   `num_vars`: Total number of variables (e.g., 4 for `0010`).\n*   `expr_tokens`: A list of tokens representing the expression (e.g., `['v0', '-', 'v1', '/', 'v2', '*', 'v3']`).\n*   `constraints`: A list of tuples, each `(var_idx1, op_str, var_idx2)`.\n\n**2. Evaluation:**\n\n*   We need to assign values (0-9) to `v0, v1, ..., vN-1`.\n*   **Lexicographical Smallest:** This implies a recursive backtracking approach. We try `v0=0`, then `v0=1`, etc. For each choice of `v0`, we try `v1=0`, then `v1=1`, etc., and so on. The first valid assignment found will be the lexicographically smallest.\n\n*   **`evaluate_expression(values)`:**\n    *   Takes a dictionary `values` mapping variable names (e.g., 'v0') to their assigned digits.\n    *   Substitutes variable names in `expr_tokens` with their values.\n    *   Evaluates the resulting arithmetic expression.\n    *   Handles division by zero: If a division by zero occurs, the expression is invalid.\n    *   Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) must be respected. This can be done using a shunting-yard algorithm to convert to postfix (RPN) or by using Python's `eval()` on a carefully constructed string. Given the limited operators and single-digit values, `eval()` is simpler but requires careful string construction.\n\n*   **`check_constraints(values)`:**\n    *   Takes a dictionary `values`.\n    *   For each constraint `(var_idx1, op_str, var_idx2)`:\n        *   Get `val1 = values[f'v{var_idx1}']` and `val2 = values[f'v{var_idx2}']`.\n        *   Evaluate `val1 op_str val2`. If any constraint is false, return `false`.\n    *   If all constraints are true, return `true`.\n\n**3. Backtracking Algorithm:**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # ...

This correctly handles operator precedence.\n    *   Operators: `*`, `/` have higher precedence than `+`, `-`.\n    *   Associativity: Left-associative.\n\nLet's walk through an example for parsing and evaluation: `?(__-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n1.  Split: `expr_str = \"__-_/___*__\"`, `constraints_str = \"___>__\"`\n2.  Map `_` groups to variables:\n    *   `__` (1st group in expr_str) -> `v0`\n    *   `_` (2nd group in expr_str) -> `v1`\n    *   `___` (3rd group in expr_str) -> `v2`\n    *   `__` (4th group in expr_str) -> `v3`\n    *   `num_vars = 4`\n3.  `expr_tokens = ['v0', '-', 'v1', '/', 'v2', '*', 'v3']`\n4.  `constraints = [(2, '>', 3)]` (since `___` is `v2` and `__` is `v3` in the constraint part)\n\nNow, with `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`:\n*   `evaluate_expression`: `['0', '-', '0', '/', '1', '*', '0']`\n    *   RPN conversion: `['0', '0', '1', '/', '0', '*', '-']` (or similar, depends on exact shunting-yard)\n    *   Evaluation:\n        *   `0 0 1 /` -> `0 / 1 = 0` (stack: `[0, 0]`)\n        *   `0 *` -> `0 * 0 = 0` (stack: `[0]`)\n        *   `0 -` -> `0 - 0 = 0` (stack: `[0]`)\n    *   Result: `0`. This is valid.\n*   `check_constraints`: `v2 > v3` -> `1 > 0` -> True. This is valid.\n*   Solution: `0010`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   Division by zero: `evaluate_expression` must return an invalid state (e.g., `None`) if `b` is 0 in `a / b`.\n*   Empty constraints: If `constraints_str` is empty, `check_constraints` should always return `True`.\n*   No solution: The `backtrack` function will eventually return `False` if no valid assignment is found, leading to \"false\" output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Operator precedence for shunting-yard algorithm\nPRECEDENCE = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '/': 2}\n\ndef apply_op(op, b, a):\n    \"\"\"Applies an operator to two operands.\"\"\"\n    if op == '+': return a + b\n    if op == '-': return a -
