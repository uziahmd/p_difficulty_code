He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Python Script for Counting Trailing Zeroes**\n\nAlright, so I've been tasked with writing a Python script to tackle this competitive programming problem. The core of the challenge is finding the number of positive integers 'n' whose factorial (n!) ends with exactly 'm' trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of these 'n' values and then list them in increasing order.\n\nMy initial thought is to dive into how trailing zeroes emerge in a factorial. It's all about prime factorization, specifically, counting the pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are always more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of 5s that are factors of n!. I'll use Legendre's formula to calculate that, which boils down to `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. This continues until the denominator exceeds 'n'.\n\nNow, I'm observing the behavior of this zero-counting function, `Z(n)`. It's non-decreasing, and it only changes when 'n' is a multiple of 5. I realize that `Z(n)` remains constant for a range of five consecutive 'n' values: `5k`, `5k+1`, `5k+2`, `5k+3`, and `5k+4`. However, `Z(n)` jumps at multiples of 5, the size of the jump depends on how many times that number is a multiple of 5. The key is if `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n)` will be equal to `m` for 5 consecutive values, or there won't be any values of `n` that equals `m`.\n\nMy strategy then becomes this: use binary search to find the smallest 'n', let's call it `n_0`, such that `Z(n_0)` is greater than or equal to 'm'. If `Z(n_0)` equals 'm', then I've got a valid starting point, and I know there are 5 consecutive solutions. If `Z(n_0)` is not exactly 'm', it means 'm' is an impossible number of trailing zeroes, and I output 0.\n\nTo ensure this works, I need to bound my search. Since 'm' is at most 100,000, and knowing that the value is approximately `n/4`, I'll use `5 * m` as my upper bound for the binary search, it should be plenty big enough. The function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` will be used to efficiently calculate the number of trailing zeroes.\n\nI'm making sure my Python code efficiently implements the binary search, including the logic for identifying the 5 consecutive solutions or determining that no solution exists. I'm focusing on the edge cases where the binary search yields no solution. Finally, I'll clean up the code for concise, runnable submission. I'll test it out thoroughly with different 'm' values.\n",
