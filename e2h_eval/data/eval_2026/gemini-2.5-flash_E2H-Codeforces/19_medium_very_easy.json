The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Connected Subgraph Sum**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to choose a connected group of districts from a tree-like structure, maximizing the sum of values associated with those districts (where each district's value is 2 raised to its index). We need to remove some districts (k of them) and output them in sorted order.\n\nFirst, I recognize that the key is the rapid growth of the `2^i` values.  Including a district with a larger index is *always* preferable to any combination of smaller indices that sum to the same total power of 2.  This suggests a greedy approach.\n\nThe problem then transforms:  We want the *largest possible* `n-k` districts that still form a connected subgraph. We need a way to build a connected component incrementally.\n\nMy initial thought is to work backward from the largest district number (`n`), greedily adding districts as long as they maintain connectivity.  I'll start with `n`, then try to include `n-1`, and so on. If I can't include a particular node without disconnecting the existing component, I move on. This sounds like it could involve a disjoint set union data structure to quickly check and maintain connectivity.\n\nHowever, I realize this greedy approach needs a more structured implementation.  I'll use a priority queue (specifically a max-heap) to keep track of the available, largest-valued nodes. Nodes in the priority queue represent potential candidates for inclusion.\n\nThe critical step involves ensuring connectivity. I'll maintain a \"visited\" or \"selected\" set to mark nodes that are *already* included in the connected component. When I expand the connected component, I add a new node (popped from the max-heap) to this \"selected\" set.  I then iterate through its neighbors. If a neighbor is *not* already in the selected set, I push it onto the priority queue to be considered later. It will not be re-added to PQ if already visited.\n\nThe algorithm effectively boils down to a modified version of Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but here we’re maximizing node weights. We start with the largest node and grow outwards, prioritizing the largest-valued neighbors while avoiding cycles.\n\nAfter selecting the `n-k` nodes, I will have the `k` nodes that were *not* selected. These are the nodes I remove, and my final step is just to sort this collection and output it. The total runtime should be O(N log N) dominated by the heap operations, which is within the time limit. Space should also be O(N) due to the graph representation, visited array, and priority queue.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the total number of fans (sum of `2^i` for selected district `i`) is maximized. We need to output the `k` districts that are removed, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. Specifically, `2^i > \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j`. This means that including a district `i` is always strictly better than including any combination of districts with smaller indices that we could potentially substitute for `i`. Therefore, to maximize the total number of fans, we must greedily select districts with the largest possible indices.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach similar to Prim's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree, but adapted to maximize node weights. We want to grow a connected component starting from the highest-indexed node, adding nodes with the largest possible indices at each step until we have `n - k` nodes.\n\nHere's the algorithm:\n1.  **Represent the tree**: Use an adjacency list to store the connections between districts.\n2.  **Initialization**:\n    *   `num_to_keep = n - k`: This is the target number of districts we want to keep.\n    *   `is_selected = [False] * (n + 1)`: A boolean array to mark whether a district has been selected to be part of the final connected component. Initially, all are `False`.\n    *   `pq`: A min-priority queue (using `heapq` in Python) to store candidate districts to be added. We'll store `(-district_id, district_id)` tuples. Using the negative `district_id` ensures that `heapq.heappop()` retrieves the district with the largest `district_id` (max-heap behavior).\n    *   `selected_count = 0`: Counts how many districts we have currently selected.\n3.  **Start the selection process**:\n    *   Add the largest district, `n`, to the priority queue: `heapq.heappush(pq, (-n, n))`. District `n` is always the best starting point because it has the highest fan count `2^n`.\n4.  **Greedy Expansion**:\n    *   While `pq` is not empty and `selected_count < num_to_keep`:\n        *   Pop the district `u` with the largest `district_id` from `pq`: `neg_u, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`.\n        *   **Check if already selected**: If `is_selected[u]` is already `True`, it means this district was previously selected (perhaps added to `pq` via a different path and then processed). Skip it.\n        *   **Select district `u`**: Mark `is_selected[u] = True` and increment `selected_count`.\n        *   **Explore neighbors**: For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` has not yet been selected (`not is_selected[v]`), add `v` to the priority queue: `heapq.heappush(pq, (-v, v))`. This makes `v` a candidate for future selection.\n5.  **Identify removed districts**: After the loop terminates (when `selected_count` reaches `num_to_keep`), iterate from `1` to `n`. Any district `i` for which `is_selected[i]` is `False` is a district that was removed.\n6.  **Output**: Collect all removed districts, sort them in increasing order, and print them space-separated.\n\nThis greedy strategy guarantees optimality because the `2^i` weights are so dominant. By always picking the largest available district that maintains connectivity with the current component, we ensure that the sum of `2^i` values is maximized. The graph being a tree guarantees that we can always form a connected component of any size up to `n`.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n*   Building the adjacency list: `O(N)` since there are `N-1` edges.\n*   Priority queue operations: Each district is pushed onto the priority queue at most once and popped at most once. Each push/pop takes `O(log N)` time. There are `N` such operations in total.\n*   Iterating through neighbors: Each edge `(u, v)` is considered at most twice (once when processing `u`, once when processing `v`). This is `O(N)`.\n*   Collecting and sorting removed districts: `O(N log k)` where `k` is the number of removed districts. In the worst case, `k` can be `N-1`, so `O(N log N)`.\nOverall time complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `10^6 * log(10^6) approx 10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`, which is well within typical time limits.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n*   Adjacency list: `O(N)` (stores `2*(N-1)` entries).\n*   `is_selected` array: `O(N)`.\n*   Priority queue: `O(N)` in the worst case (stores all unselected neighbors).\nOverall space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Number of nodes to keep\n    num_to_keep = n - k\n\n    # is_selected[i] = True if node i has been selected to be part of the final component\n    is_selected = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Priority queue stores (-node_id, node_id) to simulate a max-heap.\n    # We want to pop the node with the largest ID.\n    pq = []\n\n    # Start with the largest node, n.\n    # It's added to the PQ, but not yet marked as selected.\n    heapq.heappush(pq, (-n, n))\n\n    selected_count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until we have selected num_to_keep nodes or PQ is empty\n    while pq and selected_count < num_to_keep:\n        neg_node_id, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        # If node u has already been selected, skip it.\n        # This can happen if it was added to PQ via multiple paths before being processed.\n        if is_selected[u]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Select node u\n        is_selected[u] = True\n        selected_count += 1\n\n        # Explore neighbors of u\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            # If neighbor v has not been selected yet, add it to the priority queue\n            # as a candidate for future selection.\n            if not is_selected[v]:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-v, v))\n\n    # Collect the removed nodes (those not marked as selected)\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not is_selected[i]:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n            \n    # Print the removed nodes in increasing order\n    print(*(sorted(removed_nodes)))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
