They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Mushroom Strife - My Thoughts on Tackling the Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem to solve. The goal is to figure out the number of mushrooms on each lawn, given some relationships between them.  Here's my thought process:\n\n**First off, the problem:** We're given a graph where each lawn is a node, and the edges represent roads.  Each road has two numbers: `g` (the GCD of mushrooms on the connected lawns) and `l` (the LCM). The task is to determine the mushroom count for each lawn or say it's impossible.\n\n**The Key Property:** The core mathematical insight is this: the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.  So, `g * l = a * b`, where 'a' and 'b' are the mushroom counts.  This means `l` has to be divisible by `g`.\n\n**Breaking it Down:** Let's assign the mushroom count for each lawn as `val[i]`. We can express the constraints for each road. For a road `(u, v, g, l)` we know:\n*   `l` is divisible by `g`\n*   `val[u]` and `val[v]` are both multiples of `g`.\n*   `l` is divisible by `val[u]` and `val[v]`.\n*   `val[u] * val[v] = g * l`\n*   `GCD(val[u], val[v]) = g`\n\n**The Algorithm Idea:**  Since `n` is up to 100, a graph-based solution is promising. It seems like the core idea might be about constraint satisfaction or a search. I'm thinking of  trying to find the values of `val[i]` by propagating constraints from one lawn to another.\n\n**Initial Considerations and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Isolated nodes:**  If a node has no edges, any mushroom count is valid; we can just set it to 1, or the smallest possible `g`.\n*   **Edge constraints:** For an edge `(u, v, g, l)`, if we know `val[u]`, then `val[v]` is uniquely determined (if it exists). `val[v] = (g * l) // val[u]`, and we must check `GCD(val[u], val[v]) == g` to ensure consistency.\n\n**The Challenge:** The big issue is that we don't know the mushroom counts initially.  I need a way to assign a value to `val[i]` and then propagate those constraints.  It seems backtracking is a good path, where we try different values and, if it fails, backtrack.  I could set `val[1]` or start from the smallest `g` value.\n*   **Generating Candidate Values:** `val[i]` must be a multiple of `g` and a divisor of `l`. So, possible `val[i]` values are of form `k * g`, where `k` divides `l/g`. The `k` values can be up to the number of divisors of `l/g`, which can be large, but not too extreme.\n\n**Revised Idea: Depth-First Search with Backtracking**\n\n1.  **Represent the Graph:** Store the edges `(u, v, g, l)` in an adjacency list.\n2.  **`solve_component()`:** Start DFS from any unvisited node in a connected component, where:\n    *   Find the first unassigned node in the component.\n    *   Iterate through potential values `val_to_try` based on the given edge's constraints from previous already assigned nodes.\n    *   If no neighbors are assigned yet (meaning unconstrained nodes), create multiple candidates based on GCD and LCM and the prime factorization of `l/g`.\n    *   If any edge leads to an assignment which is not valid, stop.\n    *   If valid, recursively call `solve_component()` and backtrack at the end.\n    *   If a consistent solution is found, copy `current_ans` to the final solution `ans` and stop.\n    *   If no values satisfy the current constraints, backtrack.\n\n3.  If no solution is found after this loop, print \"NO\".\n4.  If a solution is found, output the mushroom counts (`ans[i]`).\n\nThis DFS approach looks promising. The main focus will be on efficiently pruning the search space by checking constraints early and generating values that satisfy the requirements.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to restore the number of mushrooms on `n` lawns given `m` roads. For each road connecting lawns `u` and `v`, we are given the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on `u` and `v`. We need to find any valid assignment of mushroom counts or report that none exists.\n\nLet `a` be the number of mushrooms on lawn `u` and `b` be the number of mushrooms on lawn `v`. We are given `g = GCD(a, b)` and `l = LCM(a, b)`.\nA fundamental property of GCD and LCM is that for any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.\nTherefore, for each road `(u, v)` with given `g` and `l`, we must have `a * b = g * l`.\n\nAdditionally, the following conditions must hold:\n1.  `l` must be a multiple of `g`. If `l % g != 0` for any edge, no solution exists.\n2.  `a` must be a multiple of `g`.\n3.  `b` must be a multiple of `g`.\n4.  `l` must be a multiple of `a`.\n5.  `l` must be a multiple of `b`.\n\nThese conditions imply that both `a` and `b` must be of the form `k * g` where `k` is a divisor of `l/g`.\nLet `a = g * x` and `b = g * y`.\nFrom `GCD(a, b) = g`, it follows that `GCD(g*x, g*y) = g * GCD(x, y) = g`, which means `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\nFrom `a * b = g * l`, we have `(g*x) * (g*y) = g * l`, which simplifies to `g * x * y = l`, or `x * y = l / g`.\n\nSo, for each edge `(u, v, g, l)`, we need to find `val[u]` and `val[v]` such that:\n*   `val[u] = g * x`\n*   `val[v] = g * y`\n*   `x * y = l / g`\n*   `GCD(x, y) = 1`\n\nThe constraint `GCD(x, y) = 1` means that `x` and `y` must share no common prime factors. If `l/g = p_1^{e_1} * p_2^{e_2} * ... * p_k^{e_k}` is the prime factorization of `l/g`, then `x` must be a product of some `p_i^{e_i}` terms, and `y` must be a product of the remaining `p_j^{e_j}` terms. There are `2^k` such pairs `(x, y)`. Since `l/g <= 10^6`, the maximum number of distinct prime factors `k` is small (e.g., `2*3*5*7*11*13*17 = 510510`, so `k <= 7`). Thus, `2^k` is at most `2^7 = 128`. This means for each edge, there are at most 128 pairs of `(a, b)` values that satisfy the GCD/LCM conditions.\n\nGiven `N <= 100`, we can use a backtracking (DFS) approach to assign values to `val[i]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Store edges in an adjacency list `adj`: `adj[u]` contains tuples `(v, g, l)`.\n    *   Initialize `ans = [0] * (n + 1)` to store the mushroom counts, where `0` means unassigned.\n    *   `possible_values[i]` will store a set of candidate values for `val[i]`. Initialize all `possible_values[i]` to `None` or an empty set.\n\n2.  **Pre-check and Initial Constraints:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n        *   If `l % g != 0`, print \"NO\" and exit. This is an immediate contradiction.\n        *   For each `i` (from `u` and `v`), if `possible_values[i]` is `None`, initialize it with all multiples of `g` that divide `l`. This is too broad. A better approach is to use the `g` and `l` to constrain the value.\n        *   Instead of `possible_values`, let's just use the `ans` array and propagate.\n\n3.  **Backtracking (DFS):**\n    *   `dfs(idx)`: Tries to assign a value to `ans[idx]`.\n        *   **Base Case:** If `idx > n`, all lawns have been assigned values. Check if the current assignment `ans` is consistent with all edges. If `check_all_edges_consistency()` returns `True`, we found a solution. Print \"YES\" and `ans`, then exit.\n        *   **Skip if already assigned:** If `ans[idx] != 0`, it means `ans[idx]` was determined by a previous propagation. Recurse: `dfs(idx + 1)`.\n        *   **Determine Candidate Values for `ans[idx]`:**\n            *   Collect all constraints from adjacent nodes `j` where `ans[j]` is already known. If `ans[j]` is known for `(idx, j, g_ij, l_ij)`:\n                *   Calculate the required value for `idx`: `req_val_idx = (g_ij * l_ij) // ans[j]`.\n                *   Verify `GCD(ans[j], req_val_idx) == g_ij` and `LCM(ans[j], req_val_idx) == l_ij`. If not, this path is invalid, return `False`.\n                *   If `ans[idx]` was already determined to a *different* value by another neighbor, return `False` (conflict).\n                *   If `ans[idx]` is `0` or `req_val_idx`, set `ans[idx] = req_val_idx`. This means `ans[idx]` is uniquely determined.\n            *   If `ans[idx]` is now non-zero (uniquely determined):\n                *   Recursively call `dfs(idx + 1)`. If it returns `True` (solution found), return `True`.\n                *   If not, backtrack: `ans[idx] = 0`. Return `False`.\n            *   If `ans[idx]` is still `0` (not uniquely determined by neighbors):\n                *   If `idx` has no edges (`adj[idx]` is empty): `ans[idx] = 1` (arbitrary valid value for isolated node). Recurse `dfs(idx + 1)`. If it returns `True`, return `True`. Backtrack `ans[idx] = 0`. Return `False`.\n                *   If `idx` has edges but no assigned neighbors, we must try different values for `ans[idx]`. We can pick an arbitrary edge `(idx, v, g_edge, l_edge)` from `adj[idx]` to generate candidate values.\n                    *   Let `val_ratio = l_edge // g_edge`.\n                    *   Find all `x` such that `x` divides `val_ratio` and `GCD(x, val_ratio // x) == 1`.\n                    *   For each such `x`, a candidate for `ans[idx]` is `candidate_val = g_edge * x`.\n                    *   **Crucially, check `candidate_val` against ALL incident edges of `idx`:**\n                        *   For each `(idx, neighbor, g_n, l_n)` in `adj[idx]`:\n                            *   `candidate_val` must be a multiple of `g_n`.\n                            *   `l_n` must be a multiple of `candidate_val`.\n                            *   If `ans[neighbor]` is known: `GCD(candidate_val, ans[neighbor])` must be `g_n`, and `LCM(candidate_val, ans[neighbor])` must be `l_n`.\n                        *   If `candidate_val` passes all these checks:\n                            *   Set `ans[idx] = candidate_val`.\n                            *   Recurse `dfs(idx + 1)`. If it returns `True`, return `True`.\n                            *   Backtrack: `ans[idx] = 0`.\n                *   If no candidate value leads to a solution, return `False`.\n\n4.  **Helper Functions:**\n    *   `gcd(a, b)`: Use `math.gcd`.\n    *   `lcm(a, b)`: `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.\n    *   `get_prime_factors(num)`: Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their exponents for `num`.\n    *   `check_all_edges_consistency()`: Iterates through all edges and verifies `GCD(ans[u], ans[v]) == g` and `LCM(ans[u], ans[v]) == l`.\n\n**Optimization and Refinement:**\nThe `dfs` function can be simplified. Instead of `dfs(idx)`, we can use `dfs()` and find the next unassigned node.\nThe `check_all_edges_consistency()` is too slow to call frequently. It should only be called once at the very end.\nThe critical part is the pruning: when trying a `candidate_val` for `ans[idx]`, we must verify it against *all* incident edges. This is done by checking `candidate_val % g_n == 0`, `l_n % candidate_val == 0`, and if `ans[neighbor]` is known, also `GCD(candidate_val, ans[neighbor]) == g_n` and `LCM(candidate_val, ans[neighbor]) == l_n`.\n\n**Final Algorithm Structure:**\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Global variables for N, M, adjacency list, and final answer\nN = 0\nM = 0\nadj = []\nans = []\nedges = [] # Store all edges for final consistency check\n\n# Flag to stop search once a solution is found\nsolution_found = False\n\ndef get_prime_factors(n):\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef check_valid(u_val, v_val, g, l):\n    \"\"\"Checks if u_val and v_val satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints.\"\"\"\n    if u_val == 0 or v_val == 0: # One or both are unassigned\n        return True\n    \n    # Check basic properties\n    if u_val % g != 0 or v_val % g != 0: return False\n    if l % u_val != 0 or l % v_val != 0: return False\n\n    # Check GCD and LCM\n    if math.gcd(u_val, v_val) != g: return False\n    # To avoid overflow, calculate LCM as (u_val // g) * v_val\n    # Or (v_val // g) * u_val\n    # Or (u_val * v_val) // math.gcd(u_val, v_val)\n    # Since u_val, v_val <= 10^6, u_val * v_val can be 10^12, which fits Python int.\n    if (u_val * v_val) // math.gcd(u_val, v_val) != l: return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef dfs(idx):\n    global solution_found, ans\n\n    if solution_found:\n        return True\n\n    if idx > N:\n        # All lawns assigned.
