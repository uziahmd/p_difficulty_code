Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Refinement**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this interesting problem: given a character grid, determine if it forms an \"X\" shape based on these very specific rules.  I've got this detailed breakdown of the conditions: all the diagonal characters must be the same, and all the non-diagonal characters must be a *different* single character.  The grid is guaranteed to be odd-sized, which is good.  My initial thoughts are to map out these conditions, check the cases, and then find the character mismatches, which would be an 'NO' right away.\n\nSo, I start by outlining the algorithm.  First, read in the grid's size, *n*.  Then, read the grid itself, storing it so I can access individual characters.  The crucial part is identifying these diagonal and non-diagonal positions.  The main diagonals are straightforward: where the row and column indices are equal, or where their sum equals n-1.  A really crucial step is how to compare these, so it's important to find a reliable method.\n\nI figured that picking the character at `grid[0][0]` as the diagonal character (`diag_char`) is a valid choice. Then for the non-diagonal character, I could just choose `grid[0][1]`.  Since `n` is at least 3, that cell is guaranteed to be non-diagonal.  That's my starting point.\n\nBefore diving into the iteration, I quickly check if `diag_char` and `non_diag_char` are the same.  If they are, it's an immediate \"NO\" because the condition is violated.\n\nNow, I iterate through the grid.  For each cell, I test if it's on a diagonal using the `row == col` OR `row + col == n - 1` logic.  If it's on a diagonal, I ensure the character at that cell matches the `diag_char`.  If it's *not* on a diagonal, I make sure the character matches the `non_diag_char`. If a mismatch is found, it's a \"NO\", and I exit the iteration.\n\nIf I get through the entire grid without any violations, it must be an \"X\", so I print \"YES\".\n\n**Code Implementation and Considerations**\n\nI'm thinking about the input. The problem description suggests multiple test cases in a single input.  However, this kind of competitive programming usually has each script run processing one, with input read through stdin.  This also matches the output format - print one \"YES\" or \"NO\" per grid.\n\nI start by writing the Python code. I use `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficient input.  I'll store the grid as a list of strings. I make sure to strip off any trailing newline characters from input lines using `.strip()`.\n\nI carefully set `diag_char` and `non_diag_char` as described.  I added a check at the beginning, `if diag_char == non_diag_char`, to catch the immediate \"NO\" case.\n\nDuring the iteration through the grid, I included the check for whether each cell is on a diagonal or not, and then I ensure the grid value matches the `diag_char` or `non_diag_char`, as appropriate.  I print \"NO\" and return immediately if any violation is found. If the loops complete without issues, I finally print \"YES\".\n\nFinally, I made some mental checks with example cases. Also, I analyzed the constraint, confirmed the code handles the input correctly and efficiently for large `n`s. The overall logic and code seem sound and efficient.\n",
