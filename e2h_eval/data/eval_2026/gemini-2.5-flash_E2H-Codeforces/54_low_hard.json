Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Regular N-gon Angle Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this problem of finding three vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a target angle 'a'.  The key here is understanding the geometry.  I know all the vertices lie on a circumcircle and the angle formed is an inscribed angle, which is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nMy initial thought is to fix one vertex, say vertex 1 (or 2, it doesn't really matter thanks to symmetry), and then vary the other two. This reduces the problem to finding the most suitable arc length.  The arc length corresponds to the number of vertices *not* on the arc which does *not* contain the fixed vertex.\n\nThe core insight is this: The number of vertices on the arc *determines* the angle.  If I choose vertex i and j, the arc length will be related to (j - i), and this (j-i) value *without* using modulo gives me the number of vertices on the opposite side of our chosen v2 vertex. I need to keep the arithmetic simple; modulo calculations are unnecessarily complicated here.\n\nThe arc length will be directly proportional to the angle.  So, I need to find `i` and `j` such that the angle they form is as close as possible to 'a'. I need to translate `(j-i)` into an angle using the `360/n` per arc idea.  I am thinking this can be reduced to the form: `((j-i)*180)/n`.\n\nOnce I choose v2=1, the goal is to optimize the `j-i` value to give an angle closest to my target 'a'. That should give me the three vertices I'm looking for. Let's start coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices.\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nLet's fix one vertex of the angle, say `v2`. Without loss of generality, let `v2` be vertex 1.\nThe other two vertices, `v1` and `v3`, must be distinct from `v2` and from each other.\nLet `v1` be vertex `i` and `v3` be vertex `j`. The angle `i-1-j` subtends the arc `ij` that does not contain vertex 1.\n\nThe `n` vertices of a regular `n`-gon divide the circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each such arc corresponds to a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nAn inscribed angle that subtends `k` such elementary arcs will have a measure of `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * 180/n` degrees.\n\nLet's fix `v2` as vertex 1.\nLet `v1` be vertex 2. This is an arbitrary choice to simplify the setup.\nNow, `v3` can be any vertex from 3 to `n`.\nIf `v2` is vertex 1, and `v1` is vertex 2, then `v3` can be any vertex `k` where `3 <= k <= n`.\nThe angle `2-1-k` subtends the arc from vertex 2 to vertex `k` that does not contain vertex 1.\nThe number of elementary arcs on this path is `k - 2`.\nSo, the angle `2-1-k` will be `(k - 2) * 180 / n` degrees.\n\nLet `m = k - 2`. As `k` ranges from 3 to `n`, `m` ranges from 1 to `n - 2`.\nSo, the possible angles are `m * 180 / n` for `m = 1, 2, ..., n - 2`.\nThese are all distinct possible angles that can be formed using vertex 1 as the angle's vertex, and vertex 2 as one of its sides' endpoints. Since the polygon is regular, the set of all possible angles formed by any three vertices will be the same set.\n\nWe need to find an `m` (between 1 and `n-2` inclusive) such that `|m * 180 / n - a|` is minimized.\nLet `target_m = a * n / 180`. This is the ideal (possibly non-integer) `m` value.\nWe need to find an integer `m` close to `target_m`.\nThe two integer values closest to `target_m` are `floor(target_m)` and `ceil(target_m)`.\nLet `m1 = floor(target_m)` and `m2 = ceil(target_m)`.\n\nWe should consider `m1` and `m2` as candidates, but we must ensure they are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n1. If `m1 < 1`, then the smallest possible `m` is 1. We should choose `m = 1`.\n2. If `m2 > n - 2`, then the largest possible `m` is `n - 2`. We should choose `m = n - 2`.\n3. Otherwise, both `m1` and `m2` are in the range `[1, n-2]`. We calculate the absolute difference for both:\n   `diff1 = |m1 * 180 / n - a|`\n   `diff2 = |m2 * 180 / n - a|`\n   We choose the `m` that gives the smaller difference. If `diff1 <= diff2`, we pick `m1`. Otherwise, we pick `m2`.\n\nAfter finding the optimal `m`, we can construct the vertices.\nLet `v2 = 1`.\nLet `v1 = 2`.\nThen `v3` should be `2 + m`.\nSo, the vertices are `1`, `2`, and `2 + m`. (Note: The problem asks for `v1, v2, v3` in that order, where `v2` is the vertex of the angle. So our output should be `2`, `1`, `2+m`.)\n\nLet's trace with an example: `n = 4, a = 67`.\n`target_m = 67 * 4 / 180 = 268 / 180 = 1.488...`\nValid `m` range is `[1, n-2] = [1, 4-2] = [1, 2]`.\n`m1 = floor(1.488...) = 1`.\n`m2 = ceil(1.488...) = 2`.\nBoth `m1=1` and `m2=2` are in the range `[1, 2]`.\n\nCalculate differences:\nFor `m = 1`: angle is `1 * 180 / 4 = 45` degrees. `diff1 = |45 - 67| = 22`.\nFor `m = 2`: angle is `2 * 180 / 4 = 90` degrees. `diff2 = |90 - 67| = 23`.\n\nSince `diff1 < diff2`, we choose `m = 1`.\nThe vertices are `v2 = 1`, `v1 = 2`, `v3 = 2 + m = 2 + 1 = 3`.\nOutput: `2 1 3`. This matches the example output.\n\nAnother example: `n = 4, a = 68`.\n`target_m = 68 * 4 / 180 = 272 / 180 = 1.511...`\nValid `m` range is `[1, 2]`.\n`m1 = floor(1.511...) = 1`.\n`m2 = ceil(1.511...) = 2`.\nBoth `m1=1` and `m2=2` are in the range `[1, 2]`.\n\nCalculate differences:\nFor `m = 1`: angle is `45` degrees. `diff1 = |45 - 68| = 23`.\nFor `m = 2`: angle is `90` degrees. `diff2 = |90 - 68| = 22`.\n\nSince `diff2 < diff1`, we choose `m = 2`.\nThe vertices are `v2 = 1`, `v1 = 2`, `v3 = 2 + m = 2 + 2 = 4`.\nOutput: `2 1 4`. This matches one of the example outputs (`4 1 2` is also correct, as the order of `v1` and `v3` doesn't matter for the angle).\n\nFinal check on edge cases for `m`:\n- If `target_m < 1`: `m1` would be 0 or negative. We must use `m=1`. Example: `n=10, a=1`. `target_m = 1*10/180 = 0.055`. `m1=0, m2=1`. Choose `m=1`.\n- If `target_m > n-2`: `m2` would be `n-1` or more. We must use `m=n-2`. Example: `n=10, a=179`. `target_m = 179*10/180 = 9.94`. `n-2 = 8`. `m1=9, m2=10`. Both are outside `[1, 8]`. We need to clamp.\n\nCorrected logic for `m`:\nLet `m_val = a * n / 180.0`.\nCandidate `m` values are `floor(m_val)` and `ceil(m_val)`.\nInitialize `best_m = 1`.\nInitialize `min_diff = abs(1 * 180.0 / n - a)`.\n\n`m_candidate1 = floor(m_val)`\n`m_candidate2 = ceil(m_val)`\n\nIf `m_candidate1 >= 1` and `m_candidate1 <= n - 2`:\n  `diff = abs(m_candidate1 * 180.0 / n - a)`\n  If `diff < min_diff`:\n    `min_diff = diff`\n    `best_m = m_candidate1`\n  # If diff == min_diff, best_m remains the smaller m, which is fine.\n\nIf `m_candidate2 >= 1` and `m_candidate2 <= n - 2` and `m_candidate2 != m_candidate1`:\n  `diff = abs(m_candidate2 * 180.0 / n - a)`\n  If `diff < min_diff`:\n    `min_diff = diff`\n    `best_m = m_candidate2`\n  # If diff == min_diff, best_m remains the smaller m, which is fine.\n\nThis ensures `best_m` is always within `[1, n-2]` and corresponds to the minimum difference.\nThe vertices are `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=2+best_m`.\nOutput `v1 v2 v3`.\n\nExample `n=3, a=15`:\n`target_m = 15 * 3 / 180 = 45 / 180 = 0.25`.\nValid `m` range is `[1, n-2] = [1, 1]`. So `m` must be 1.\n`m1 = floor(0.25) = 0`.\n`m2 = ceil(0.25) = 1`.\n\nInitial `best_m = 1`, `min_diff = abs(1 * 180.0 / 3 - 15) = abs(60 - 15) = 45`.\n`m_candidate1 = 0`. This is `< 1`, so ignore.\n`m_candidate2 = 1`. This is in `[1, 1]`.\n  `diff = abs(1 * 180.0 / 3 - 15) = abs(60 - 15) = 45`.\n  `diff` is not `< min_diff` (it's equal). So `best_m` remains `1`.\nFinal `best_m = 1`.\nVertices: `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=2+1=3`.\nOutput: `2 1 3`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The possible angles are m * 180 / n, where m is an integer from 1 to n-2.\n    # We want to find m such that |m * 180 / n - a| is minimized.\n    # Let target_m = a * n / 180.\n    # We are looking for an integer m in [1, n-2] closest to target_m.\n\n    target_m_float = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n    # Candidate m values are floor(target_m_float) and ceil(target_m_float)\n    # as long as they are within the valid range [1, n-2].\n\n    best_m = -1\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Consider m = floor(target_m_float)\n    m1 = math.floor(target_m_float)\n    if 1 <= m1 <= n - 2:\n        current_angle = m1 * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m1\n        # If diff == min_diff, we prefer the smaller m, so best_m remains m1 if it was already set,\n        # or takes m1 if best_m was not set.\n\n    # Consider m = ceil(target_m_float)\n    m2 = math.ceil(target_m_float)\n    if 1 <= m2 <= n - 2:\n        # Avoid re-evaluating if m1 and m2 are the same (e.g., target_m_float is an integer)\n        if m1 == m2 and best_m != -1: # if m1 was already processed and it's the same as m2, no need to re-process\n            pass\n        else:\n            current_angle = m2 * 180.0 / n\n            diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n                best_m = m2\n            elif diff == min_diff:\n                # If differences are equal, prefer the smaller m.\n                # Since m1 < m2 (unless m1==m2), if m1 was already chosen, keep it.\n                # If m1 was invalid, but m2 is valid, and best_m is still -1 or from an invalid m,\n                # then m2 becomes best_m.\n                # This logic is a bit tricky.
