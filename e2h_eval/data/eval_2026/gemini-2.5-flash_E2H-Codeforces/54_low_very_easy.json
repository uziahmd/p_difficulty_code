Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\"**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to tackle this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem. The core of it is finding three vertices, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, in a regular `n`-gon such that the angle formed at `v2` is as close as possible to a target angle `a`.  The vertices are numbered 1 to `n`.\n\nMy strategy is to leverage the geometry of a regular polygon.  I'm thinking about it in terms of inscribed angles and their relationship to central angles in the circumcircle.  If `v2` is the vertex of the angle, then the angle `v1-v2-v3` is an inscribed angle.  The key is that an inscribed angle's measure is half of the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nNow, let's consider fixing `v2` at, say, vertex 1.  It simplifies things. The central angle between any two adjacent vertices is `360 / n` degrees. If I know where `v1` and `v3` are, I can figure out the arc they define.\n\nLet `v1` be vertex `i` and `v3` be vertex `j`.  The key here is finding the central angle subtended by the arc between `i` and `j` (not going through the fixed vertex 1). If I can represent `i` and `j` in terms of how many segments they're away from `v2`, I'll be in business.  If `v2` is always at 1, that simplifies a lot to thinking in terms of the difference between `i` and `j` along the polygon. The length of the arc not containing 1 is then related to `|i-j|`. The formula for the central angle subtending the arc should be something along the lines of `|i - j| * (360 / n)`.  I can then halve that to get the inscribed angle. Then iterate through all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, calculating the angle and comparing to `a`. I need to remember the distinct vertex requirement. I'll need to keep track of the closest angle and the corresponding vertices.\n\nSo, the general idea is this:\n1. Fix `v2`.\n2. Iterate through all possible `v1` and `v3` combinations.\n3. Calculate the angle `v1-v2-v3`.\n4. Determine which combination yields an angle closest to `a`.\n5. Output `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output `v1, v2, v3`. The vertices are numbered 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\nLet's analyze the angles that can be formed by three vertices of a regular `n`-gon.\nConsider the `n`-gon inscribed in a circle. Any angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` (with `v2` being the vertex of the angle) is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet `v2` be a fixed vertex. Without loss of generality, let's choose `v2` to be vertex 2.\nThe vertices are numbered 1, 2, ..., `n` in clockwise order.\nThe central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360 / n` degrees.\nLet `v1` be vertex 1.\nThen `v3` can be any vertex from 3 to `n`.\nIf `v1` is vertex 1 and `v2` is vertex 2, then the angle `1-2-v3` subtends the arc from vertex 1 to vertex `v3` (not passing through vertex 2).\nThe number of edges (or segments) on this arc is `v3 - 1` (if `v3 > 1`).\nSo, the central angle subtending this arc is `(v3 - 1) * (360 / n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-v3` is half of this central angle: `(v3 - 1) * (360 / n) / 2 = (v3 - 1) * (180 / n)` degrees.\n\nLet `k = v3 - 1`. Since `v3` must be distinct from `v1=1` and `v2=2`, `v3` can range from 3 to `n`.\nThis means `k` can range from `3 - 1 = 2` to `n - 1`.\nSo, the possible angles are `k * (180 / n)` for `k` from 2 to `n - 1`.\nThese are all distinct angles. The smallest is `2 * (180 / n)` and the largest is `(n - 1) * (180 / n)`.\n\nWe need to find a `k` (where `2 <= k <= n - 1`) such that `|k * (180 / n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `unit_angle = 180 / n`. We are looking for `k * unit_angle` closest to `a`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` such that `|k - a / unit_angle|` is minimized.\nLet `target_k_float = a / unit_angle = a * n / 180`.\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[2, n - 1]` that is closest to `target_k_float`.\n\nThere are two candidate integer values for `k`: `floor(target_k_float)` and `ceil(target_k_float)`.\nLet `k1 = floor(target_k_float)` and `k2 = ceil(target_k_float)`.\nWe need to check which of these, when clamped to the valid range `[2, n - 1]`, gives the minimum absolute difference.\n\nThe valid range for `k` is `[2, n - 1]`.\n1. If `k1 < 2`, then the smallest possible `k` is 2. We should consider `k=2`.\n2. If `k2 > n - 1`, then the largest possible `k` is `n - 1`. We should consider `k=n-1`.\n3. Otherwise, `k1` and `k2` are within the valid range `[2, n - 1]`. We compare `|k1 * unit_angle - a|` and `|k2 * unit_angle - a|`.\n\nLet's choose `v2 = 2` and `v1 = 1`.\nWe iterate `k` from `2` to `n-1`. For each `k`, the angle formed is `current_angle = k * (180 / n)`.\nWe keep track of the `best_diff = infinity` and the corresponding `best_k`.\nIf `abs(current_angle - a)` is less than `best_diff`, we update `best_diff = abs(current_angle - a)` and `best_k = k`.\n\nAfter finding the `best_k`, the vertices are `v1=1`, `v2=2`, and `v3 = best_k + 1`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `n=4, a=67`\n`unit_angle = 180 / 4 = 45`.\nPossible `k` values: `[2, 3]` (`n-1 = 3`).\n- For `k=2`: angle is `2 * 45 = 90`. Difference `|90 - 67| = 23`.\n- For `k=3`: angle is `3 * 45 = 135`. Difference `|135 - 67| = 68`. (Wait, this is wrong. The max angle for a square is 90 degrees. What's wrong?)\n\nAh, the formula `k * (180 / n)` assumes `v1` and `v3` are on opposite sides of `v2` relative to the diameter passing through `v2`.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1v3` (not passing through `v2`).\nThe number of edges on this arc is `(index(v3) - index(v1))` if `v3` is clockwise from `v1` (not passing through `v2`).\nLet's fix `v2` to be vertex 1.\n`v1` and `v3` are other vertices.\nLet `v1` be `1 + i` and `v3` be `1 + j`.\nThe number of edges between `v1` and `v3` (the arc not containing `v2`) is `|i - j|`.\nThe angle is `|i - j| * (180 / n)`.\nHere `i` and `j` are the \"steps\" from `v2`.\n`i` can be from `1` to `n-1`. `j` can be from `1` to `n-1`.\nAnd `i != j`.\nThe maximum number of steps between `v1` and `v3` is `n-1`.\nThe minimum is `1`.\nSo `k` (the number of steps) can range from `1` to `n-1`.\n\nLet's retry:\nFix `v2` as vertex 2.\nFix `v1` as vertex 1.\nThen `v3` can be any vertex `j` from `3` to `n`.\nThe arc `1-j` (not passing through 2) has `j-1` segments.\nThe central angle is `(j-1) * (360/n)`.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-j` is `(j-1) * (180/n)`.\nLet `k = j-1`. Since `j` ranges from `3` to `n`, `k` ranges from `2` to `n-1`.\nThis is exactly what I had before.\n\nWhy did `n=4, a=67` give `45` in the example?\n`unit_angle = 180/4 = 45`.\n`k` from `2` to `3`.\n`k=2`: angle `2 * 45 = 90`. Diff `|90 - 67| = 23`. Vertices `1, 2, 3`.\n`k=3`: angle `3 * 45 = 135`. Diff `|135 - 67| = 68`. Vertices `1, 2, 4`.\nThe code would pick `k=2`, output `1 2 3`.\nBut the example output is `2 1 3`, which means `v1=2, v2=1, v3=3`.\nAngle `2-1-3`.\nThis angle subtends arc `2-3`. Arc `2-3` has 1 segment.\nAngle is `1 * (180 / n) = 1 * (180 / 4) = 45`.\nDifference `|45 - 67| = 22`.\nThis is indeed better than 23.\n\nMy understanding of `k` was off.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` depends on the number of polygon edges `k` on the arc `v1v3` *that does not contain `v2`*.\nThis `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\nIf `k=1`, the angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\nIf `k=n-2`, the angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\nThe maximum possible angle for an `n`-gon is `(n-2) * (180/n)`, which is the internal angle of the polygon. For `n=4`, max angle is `(4-2)*(180/4) = 2 * 45 = 90`. For `n=3`, max angle is `(3-2)*(180/3) = 1 * 60 = 60`.\n\nSo, the possible angles are `k * (180 / n)` where `k` is the number of edges on the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`).\nThis `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\n\nLet `v2` be vertex 2.\nLet `v1` be vertex 1.\nThen `v3` can be vertex `j` such that the arc `1-j` has `k` segments and does not contain vertex 2.\nIf `j` is `1+k`, then the arc `1-(1+k)` has `k` segments.\nWe need `v2` not to be on this arc.\nIf `v2=2`, and `v1=1`, then `v3` must be `1+k` where `k` is the number of segments.\n`v3` must not be `2`. So `1+k != 2`, meaning `k != 1`.\nSo if `v2=2, v1=1`, then `v3` can be `3, 4, ..., n`.\nThe number of segments `k` on arc `1-v3` is `v3-1`.\nSo `k` ranges from `2` to `n-1`. This is what I had.\n\nThis means the setup `v1=1, v2=2, v3=k+1` for `k` from `2` to `n-1` generates angles `k * (180/n)`.\nThis set of angles does *not* include `1 * (180/n)`.\nTo get `1 * (180/n)`, we need `k=1`.\nFor `k=1`, we need `v1` and `v3` to be adjacent to `v2`.\nFor example, `v2=2`, `v1=1`, `v3=3`. The arc `1-3` (not containing 2) has 2 segments. Angle is `2 * (180/n)`.\nThis is `1-2-3`.\n\nThe example output `2 1 3` for `n=4, a=67` implies `v1=2, v2=1, v3=3`.\nThe angle `2-1-3` means `v2=1`. `v1=2`, `v3=3`.\nThe arc `2-3` (not containing 1) has `(3-2) = 1` segment.\nSo the angle is `1 * (180/n)`. For `n=4`, this is `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\nThis angle `45` is obtained by choosing `k=1`.\n\nSo the actual range for `k` (number of segments on the arc `v1v3` not containing `v2`) is `1` to `n-2`.\nLet `v2` be vertex 1.\nLet `v1` be vertex `n` (or `n+1` if we consider 0-indexed and `v2` is 0).\nLet `v3` be vertex 2.\nThe angle `n-1-2` (where `v2=1`) subtends the arc `n-2`.\nThe arc `n-2` (not containing 1) has `(n-1)` segments if we go `n -> (n-1) -> ... -> 2`. This is `n-2` segments.\nNo, it's `(n-1)` segments from `n` to `1` and then `1` segment from `1` to `2`.\nThe number of segments on arc `n-2` (not containing 1) is `(n-1) + 1 = n`. This is wrong.\nThe arc `n-2` (not containing 1) means we go from `n` to `n-1` ... to `2`. This is `n-2` segments.\nSo the angle `n-1-2` is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. This is the largest possible angle.\n\nTo get `k` segments, we can pick `v2=1`.\nThen `v1` can be vertex `n`.\nThen `v3` can be vertex `1+k`.\nThe angle `n-1-(1+k)` subtends the arc `n-(1+k)`.\nThe number of segments on this arc is `(n - (1+k)) + 1` (if `1+k` is clockwise from `n`).\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nA simpler approach:\nFix `v2` to be vertex 1.\n`v1` and `v3` must be two other distinct vertices.\nLet `v1` be vertex `i` and `v3` be vertex `j`.\nThe angle `i-1-j` subtends the arc `ij` (the arc that does not contain vertex 1).\nThe number of edges on this arc is `|i - j|` if `i` and `j` are on the same side of vertex 1.\nNo, this is `min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)`. This is the chord length.\nThe number of segments on the arc `i-j` (not containing 1) is `min( (j-i+n)%n, (i-j+n)%n )`.\nNo, it's simpler. The number of vertices between `i` and `j` (inclusive of `i` and `j`, exclusive of `1`) is `k`.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` is `k * (180/n)`, where `k` is the number of vertices on the minor arc `v1v3` (excluding `v1` and `v3` themselves).\nThis is not correct either.\n\nLet's use the standard formula for inscribed angles in a regular polygon.\nIf `v2` is vertex `P`, `v1` is vertex `P-x` and `v3` is vertex `P+y` (indices modulo `n`).\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` is given by `(x + y) * (180 / n)`.\nHere `x` is the number of edges from `v2` to `v1` (counter-clockwise) and `y` is the number of edges from `v2` to `v3` (clockwise).\n`x` and `y` must be positive integers.\n`x` can range from `1` to `n-2`. `y` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\nAlso, `x+y` must be less than `n`.\nThe sum `x+y` represents the number of segments on the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`).\nSo the number of segments `k = x+y` can range from `1 + 1 = 2` up to `n-1`.\nNo, `x+y` can be at most `n-1`.\nFor instance, if `v2` is vertex 1.\n`v1` is vertex `n`. (`x=1`)\n`v3` is vertex `2`. (`y=1`)\nAngle `n-1-2` is `(1+1) * (180/n) = 2 * (180/n)`.\nIf `v1` is vertex `n-1` (`x=2`).\n`v3` is vertex `2` (`y=1`).\nAngle `(n-1)-1-2` is `(2+1) * (180/n) = 3 * (180/n)`.\n\nThe maximum `x` is `n-2` (e.g., `v1` is vertex 3, `v2` is vertex 1).\nThe maximum `y` is `n-2` (e.g., `v3` is vertex `n-1`, `v2` is vertex 1).\nThe sum `x+y` can be at most `n-1` (e.g., `v1` is vertex `n`, `v3` is vertex `n-1`).\nIf `v2` is 1, `v1` is `n`, `v3` is `n-1`. This is `n-1-(n-1)`. This is not `x+y`.\nThe indices `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct.\nLet `v2` be vertex 1.\n`v1` can be any vertex `i` in `[2, n]`.\n`v3` can be any vertex `j` in `[2, n]`, `j != i`.\nThe angle `i-1-j` is `k * (180/n)` where `k` is the number of edges on the arc `ij` (not containing 1).\nThe number of edges on arc `ij` (not containing 1) is `min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)`.\nFor example, `n=4`. Vertices 1, 2, 3, 4.\nLet `v2=1`.\nPossible `(i, j)` pairs (distinct, not 1):\n`(2,3)`: `k = min(|2-3|, 4-|2-3|) = min(1,3) = 1`. Angle `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\n`(2,4)`: `k = min(|2-4|, 4-|2-4|) = min(2,2) = 2`. Angle `2 * (180/4) = 90`.\n`(3,2)`: `k = min(|3-2|, 4-|3-2|) = min(1,3) = 1`. Angle `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\n`(3,4)`: `k = min(|3-4|, 4-|3-4|) = min(1,3) = 1`. Angle `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\n`(4,2)`: `k = min(|4-2|, 4-|4-2|) = min(2,2) = 2`. Angle `2 * (180/4) = 90`.\n`(4,3)`: `k = min(|4-3|, 4-|4-3|) = min(1,3) = 1`. Angle `1 * (180/4) = 45`.\n\nSo, for `n=4`, the possible angles are `45` and `90`.\nThe `k` values are `1` and `2`.\nThe range of `k` is `1` to `floor(n/2)` if `n` is even, or `floor(n/2)` if `n` is odd.\nNo, `k` can be up to `n-2`.\nThe number of segments on the arc `ij` (not containing 1) is `abs(i-j)` if `i,j` are on the same side of `1`.\nLet `v2` be vertex 1.\nLet `v1` be vertex 2.\nThen `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\nThe angle `2-1-j` subtends arc `2-j`.\nThe number of edges on arc `2-j` (not containing 1) is `j-2`.\nSo `k = j-2`. Since `j` ranges from `3` to `n`, `k` ranges from `1` to `n-2`.\nThis means all angles `k * (180/n)` for `k` from `1` to `n-2` are possible.\nThis is the correct range of possible angles.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate `n=4, a=67`.\n`unit_angle = 180 / 4 = 45`.\nPossible `k` values: `1` to `n-2 = 4-2 = 2`. So `k` can be `1` or `2`.\n- For `k=1`: angle is `1 * 45 = 45`. Difference `|45 - 67| = 22`.\n  Vertices: `v2=1`, `v1=2`. To get `k=1` segments on arc `v1v3`, `v3` must be `2+1=3`.\n  So `v1=2, v2=1, v3=3`. Output `2 1 3`.\n- For `k=2`: angle is `2 * 45 = 90`. Difference `|90 - 67| = 23`.\n  Vertices: `v2=1`, `v1=2`. To get `k=2` segments on arc `v1v3`, `v3` must be `2+2=4`.\n  So `v1=2, v2=1, v3=4`. Output `2 1 4`.\n\nComparing differences `22` and `23`, `22` is smaller. So we choose `k=1`.\nThe vertices are `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=3`. This matches the example output `2 1 3`.\n\nThis looks like the correct logic.\nThe possible angles are `k * (180 / n)` for `k` from `1` to `n-2`.\nWe need to find `k` in this range that minimizes `|k * (180 / n) - a|`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `a`.\n2. Calculate `unit_angle = 180 / n`.\n3. Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n4. Iterate `k` from `1` to `n-2`:\n   a. Calculate `current_angle = k * unit_angle`.\n   b. Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n   c. If `diff < min_diff`:\n      `min_diff = diff`\n      `best_k = k`\n5. Print `2 1 (best_k + 2)`.\n   (Vertex `v2` is 1, `v1` is 2, `v3` is `best_k + 2`. This means `v1` and `v3` are `best_k` segments apart, with `v2` not on that arc.)\n   The vertices are `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=best_k+2`.\n   Example: `n=3, a=15`.\n   `unit_angle = 180 / 3 = 60`.\n   `k` from `1` to `n-2 = 3-2 = 1`. So `k=1` is the only option.\n   `k=1`: angle `1 * 60 = 60`. Diff `|60 - 15| = 45`.\n   `best_k = 1`.\n   Output: `2 1 (1+2) = 2 1 3`.\n   This is equivalent to `1 2 3` by relabeling, which is the example output.\n\nLet's check `n=4, a=68`.\n`unit_angle = 45`.\n`k` from `1` to `2`.\n`k=1`: angle `45`. Diff `|45 - 68| = 23`.\n`k=2`: angle `90`. Diff `|90 - 68| = 22`.\n`min_diff = 22`, `best_k = 2`.\nOutput: `2 1 (2+2) = 2 1 4`.
