A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's a pretty standard resource allocation problem, but I need to be careful with how they've defined the units and the consumption rates.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: `n` friends, `k` bottles, `l` ml/bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices/lime, `p` grams of salt, `nl` ml/toast/friend, and `np` grams/toast/friend.  The goal is to figure out the *maximum number of toasts each friend can make*.\n\nThe core idea is to find the *limiting factor* among the available resources: the drink, the lime slices, and the salt. I can't just consider the total number of toasts, I need to account for each *friend*.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking I'll proceed:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total resources:**\n    *   Total drink: `k * l` ml\n    *   Total lime slices: `c * d` slices\n    *   Total salt: `p` grams\n\n2.  **Calculate the total individual toasts possible from each resource:**\n    *   **Drink:** Each *friend* needs `nl` ml per toast.  Since there are `n` friends, the total number of toasts that *could* be made with this amount of drink is `(k * l) / nl`. *Important:* This number is the total number of toasts, not the number per friend. I need to keep that in mind.\n    *   **Lime slices:**  Each *friend* needs 1 slice per toast, so the total number of toasts possible is simply `c * d`. Again, this isn't per friend, it's the total.\n    *   **Salt:** Each *friend* needs `np` grams of salt per toast.  So, the total number of toasts possible is `p / np`. This number, as before, is the *total* number of toasts that could be made.\n\n3.  **Find the limiting factor:**  I need to find the *minimum* number of total toasts I can make across all three resources. That is, the minimum of `(k * l) / nl`, `c * d`, and `p / np`. That minimum represents the maximum *total* number of toasts possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate toasts per friend:** Since all friends make the same number of toasts, I need to divide that minimum (the limiting resource's total toast count) by the number of friends, `n`. However, the problem explicitly asks for the number of toasts *each friend* can make. It seems like the limiting factor will represent the total number of individual toasts, regardless of the individual, and then I will use that number to get my final answer.\n\nSo, I'll take the integer part of the total number of toasts *per person*, which is the minimum value divided by n (the number of friends) and return that. I'm going to make a note to double-check my interpretation of `nl` and `np` when I test this.\n",
