            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Tile Formations: A Minimization Problem**\n\nAlright, let's get into this. I'm looking at a hand of three tiles - `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` - and trying to figure out the least number of extra tiles, or \"draws,\" I need to make a \"mentsu.\" A mentsu, as we know, can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit).\n\nFirst, I'll see if the initial hand already forms a mentsu.  That's my base case, right? Zero draws.  I'll check for a koutsu – are all three tiles identical?  If not, I'll check for a shuntsu.  That means the tiles have to be of the same suit, and their numbers have to be sequential. I'll sort the numbers and then make sure they're in the correct order.\n\nIf the initial hand *doesn't* form a mentsu, I have to consider drawing one tile, `t4`. Now, the crucial part is recognizing that if I draw one tile, I need to check if *any* combination of three tiles from the four (the initial three plus the draw) form a mentsu. This essentially simplifies to checking if any *two* of the initial tiles, along with `t4`, can make a mentsu.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: analyzing the possible scenarios for that one draw. I'll break it down into koutsu and shuntsu cases:\n\n*   **For a koutsu:** If I have two identical tiles in my initial hand (say, `t1` and `t2`), then drawing a duplicate of that tile completes a koutsu. Easy peasy.\n\n*   **For a shuntsu:**  I'll look for pairs within the initial hand. If I have two sequential tiles of the same suit (`N` and `N+1`), I can draw either `N-1` or `N+2` (as long as they're valid numbers).  Alternatively, if I have tiles with a gap of one (`N` and `N+2`) of the same suit, drawing `N+1` would make a shuntsu.\n\nSo, the game is to systematically check these possibilities to determine the minimum number of draws: 0 if the initial hand is already a mentsu, or 1 if a single draw can complete a mentsu. I'm confident I can make this efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, '1s' is `(1, 's')`.\n\nWe need to check for 0, 1, or 2 draws in increasing order.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nA mentsu can be formed with the initial three tiles.\n1.  **Koutsu:** All three tiles are identical.\n    Example: `[1s, 1s, 1s]`\n2.  **Shuntsu:** All three tiles are of the same suit and their numbers are sequential.\n    Example: `[1s, 2s, 3s]` (after sorting numbers)\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, we consider drawing one tile. This means we need to find if any two of the initial three tiles can form a mentsu with one additional tile.\n1.  **Koutsu:** Two of the initial three tiles are identical. We can draw a third tile identical to them.\n    Example: `[1s, 1s, 5m]`. Draw `1s` to form `[1s, 1s, 1s]`.\n2.  **Shuntsu:** Two of the initial three tiles are of the same suit and can form a shuntsu with one additional tile.\n    *   **Adjacent numbers:** `[N, N+1]` of the same suit. We can draw `N-1` (if `N > 1`) or `N+2` (if `N+1 < 9`).\n        Example: `[1s, 2s, 5m]`. Draw `3s` to form `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\n    *   **Numbers separated by one:** `[N, N+2]` of the same suit. We can draw `N+1`.\n        Example: `[1s, 3s, 5m]`. Draw `2s` to form `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf 0 or 1 draw is not enough, we consider drawing two tiles. This means we need to find if any of the initial three tiles can form a mentsu with two additional tiles.\n1.  **Koutsu:** We have one tile `T`. We can draw two more `T` tiles to form `[T, T, T]`. This is always possible.\n    Example: `[1s, 5m, 7p]`. Draw `1s, 1s` to form `[1s, 1s, 1s]`.\n2.  **Shuntsu:** We have one tile `(N, S)`. We can draw `(N+1, S)` and `(N+2, S)` (if `N+2 <= 9`) or `(N-1, S)` and `(N+1, S)` (if `N-1 >= 1` and `N+1 <= 9`) or `(N-2, S)` and `(N-1, S)` (if `N-2 >= 1`). This is always possible for any tile `(N, S)` as long as `N` is not `1` or `9` (for `(N-1, N, N+1)`), or `N` is not `8` or `9` (for `(N, N+1, N+2)`), or `N` is not `1` or `2` (for `(N-2, N-1, N)`). Since we can pick *any* tile to form a shuntsu, we can always choose one like `1s` and draw `2s, 3s`.\n\nSince we can always form a koutsu or shuntsu with two draws (e.g., take any tile `T` from hand and draw two more `T`s, or draw `1s, 2s, 3s` regardless of hand), the maximum answer is 2.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Read the three tile strings. Convert them into a list of tuples `(number, suit)`. Sort the list to simplify comparisons.\n    Example: `['3p', '9m', '2p']` becomes `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`.\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws:**\n    *   **Koutsu:** Check if `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Check if `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit` AND `t1.num + 1 == t2.num` AND `t2.num + 1 == t3.num`.\n    *   If either is true, print `0` and exit.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw:**\n    Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(ti, tj)` from the initial three tiles.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Check if `ti == tj`. If yes, we can draw `ti` to form a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Check if `ti.suit == tj.suit`.\n        *   If `abs(ti.num - tj.num) == 1` (e.g., `[1s, 2s]`): We can draw `ti.num - 1` or `tj.num + 1` (if valid numbers).\n        *   If `abs(ti.num - tj.num) == 2` (e.g., `[1s, 3s]`): We can draw `ti.num + 1` (or `tj.num - 1`).\n    *   If any of these conditions are met for any pair, print `1` and exit.\n\n4.  **Check for 2 Draws:**\n    If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, print `2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`**\n\n1.  **Parsed Tiles (sorted):** `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`\n    Let `t1=(2,'p'), t2=(3,'p'), t3=(9,'m')`.\n\n2.  **Check 0 Draws:**\n    *   Koutsu? `t1 == t2 == t3` is false.\n    *   Shuntsu? `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit` is false (`p, p, m`).\n    *   Result: Not 0 draws.\n\n3.  **Check 1 Draw:**\n    *   **Pairs:**\n        *   `(t1, t2) = ((2,'p'), (3,'p'))`:\n            *   Koutsu? `t1 == t2` is false.\n            *   Shuntsu? `t1.suit == t2.suit` is true (`p`). `abs(t1.num - t2.num) = abs(2-3) = 1`. This is a `[N, N+1]` pair. We can draw `N-1` (`1p`) or `N+2` (`4p`). So, `1p` or `4p` would form a shuntsu.\n            *   We found a way to win with 1 draw! Print `1`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into a list of (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier comparison, especially for shuntsu\n    # Sorting by suit then number helps group similar tiles\n    tiles.sort()\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu is already present in the initial 3 tiles.\n\n    # Check for Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    if (tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1] and # Same suit\n        tiles[0][0] + 1 == tiles[1][0] and # Sequential numbers\n        tiles[1][0] + 1 == tiles[2][0]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We need to draw one tile to form a mentsu.\n    # This means two of the current tiles can form a mentsu with one drawn tile.\n\n    # Check for Koutsu (two identical tiles)\n    # If any two tiles are identical, we can draw the third identical tile.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2] or tiles[0] == tiles[2]:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu (two tiles of the same suit that are part of a sequence)\n    # Consider all unique pairs of tiles\n    \n    # Pair (tiles[0], tiles[1])\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1]: # Same suit\n        diff = abs(tiles[0][0] - tiles[1][0])\n        if diff == 1: # e.g., 1m 2m.
