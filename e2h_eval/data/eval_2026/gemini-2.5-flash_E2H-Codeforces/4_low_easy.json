The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses Efficiently**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is figuring out the number of losses for each player, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over a large number of rounds.  I see that directly simulating every round is out of the question because 'n' can be up to 2 * 10^9.  I need a smarter approach.\n\nThe key observation here is the cyclic nature of their strategies. Nikephoros and Polycarpus repeat their moves according to sequences A and B, respectively.  That repetition has to be the key. Since the sequences are cyclic, the game's state will repeat. I figure that cycle length should be the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the sequences, which are m and k. Calculating this LCM is essential - luckily, it is given that the sequences are not so big, so this method is viable.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Find the cycle length (L):**  I'll need to calculate the `lcm(m, k)`.  I know how to do that using the `gcd(m, k)`: `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)`.  That will be my first step.\n\n2.  **Simulate a single cycle:** I'll iterate through one full cycle of length L, keeping track of the individual losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus. For each round within the cycle, I'll compare the moves and increment the relevant loss counter. This is the crucial step of doing the heavy work. This gives me `nikephoros_losses_cycle` and `polycarpus_losses_cycle`.\n\n3.  **Scale up for n rounds:** Finally, I'll use the results from the cycle simulation to extrapolate for the total 'n' rounds. I'll divide 'n' by the cycle length to find the number of full cycles and then multiply my cycle losses by that. I will also have to account for the remaining rounds after the full cycles, since the number of rounds may not be a multiple of the cycle length.\n\nThat should do it.  The simulation of a single cycle will be the most computationally intensive part, but since the sequences are relatively short, that should be manageable. This cyclical approach should allow me to solve this efficiently. I will have the correct number of losses for each player.\n",
