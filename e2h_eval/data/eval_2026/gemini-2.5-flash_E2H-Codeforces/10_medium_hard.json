Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Golorp's Diet: Unraveling the Variable Assignment**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to feed this \"golorp,\" which seems to be some kind of program with a peculiar way of consuming variables. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits that will \"feed\" the golorp, or declare it impossible.  The key is understanding how the golorp's \"diet\" is defined by its name, and especially how those pesky underscores `_` relate to the variables.\n\nI've been poring over the examples, and the most consistent approach I've found so far is that each contiguous sequence of underscores within the *expression* part of the golorp's name represents a *distinct* variable. The output, then, is a list of these variables' values.\n\nSo, the golorp name looks like `?(<expression>):-<constraints>.`.  The `<expression>` part contains arithmetic operations, and the `<constraints>` part contains comparisons, all involving these underscore sequences.\n\nHere's my thought process on how these variables are used:\n\n1.  **Variable Definition:** I identify *every* contiguous sequence of underscores `_` in the expression part. Each unique sequence, in the order it appears, defines a separate variable.\n2.  **Output Length:** The number of variables is equal to the number of underscore sequences. This means that the output's length is determined by the number of unique sequences of underscores in the expression.\n3.  **Variable Values:** The output of the golorp is the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits that can satisfy the golorp's constraints. It appears, this output is the sequence of values assigned to each variable.\n4. **Referencing Variables:** A sequence of underscores in the *constraints* part refers to the variable with the *same length* that appeared earlier in the expression.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to evaluate the expression and apply the constraints to find the \"solution.\" The expression itself might be important for \"feeding\" the golorp, but the problem states it's about minimizing the output sequence that the user is trying to obtain.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies a given set of constraints defined by a \"golorp's name\". The name is a string of the form `?(<expression>):-<constraints>.`.\n\nLet's break down the interpretation of the golorp's name based on the examples provided:\n\n1.  **Input Variables:** The input variables are determined by the contiguous sequences of underscores (`_`) found within the `<expression>` part of the golorp's name. Each such sequence, in order of appearance, corresponds to one input digit.\n    *   Example: For `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`, the expression is `_-_/___*__`.\n        The sequences of underscores are: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`.\n        This means there are 4 input variables. Let's call them `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n        The output `0010` for this example means `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`.\n\n2.  **Variable Mapping for Evaluation:** When an underscore sequence appears in either the `<expression>` or `<constraints>` part, its *value* is determined by the input variable assigned to the *first occurrence* of an underscore sequence of that specific *length* within the `<expression>` part.\n    *   Let `var_for_len[L]` store the input variable `x_i` that corresponds to the first `_` sequence of length `L` encountered in the `<expression>`.\n    *   For `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n        *   First `_` (length 1) is `x0`. So, `var_for_len[1] = x0`.\n        *   Second `_` (length 1) is `x1`. `var_for_len[1]` is already `x0`, so it remains `x0`.\n        *   First `___` (length 3) is `x2`. So, `var_for_len[3] = x2`.\n        *   First `__` (length 2) is `x3`. So, `var_for_len[2] = x3`.\n    *   When we evaluate `_` anywhere, its value is `var_for_len[1]` (which is `x0`).\n    *   When we evaluate `___` anywhere, its value is `var_for_len[3]` (which is `x2`).\n    *   When we evaluate `__` anywhere, its value is `var_for_len[2]` (which is `x3`).\n\n3.  **Arithmetic Operations:** The `<expression>` part uses standard arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Integer division is implied. Division by zero should make the sequence invalid.\n    *   The problem statement doesn't explicitly mention operator precedence, but standard mathematical precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, left-to-right for same precedence) is usually assumed. Parentheses `()` are used to override precedence.\n\n4.  **Constraints:** The `<constraints>` part uses comparison operators: `>` and `<`. Multiple constraints are separated by `,`. All constraints must be true for a sequence to be valid.\n\n5.  **Goal:** Find the lexicographically smallest sequence `x0x1...xN-1` (where `N` is the number of `_` sequences in the expression) such that all constraints are satisfied, and no division by zero occurs. If no such sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input string:**\n    *   Extract the `<expression>` and `<constraints>` substrings.\n    *   Identify all `_` sequences in the `<expression>` part and store their lengths. Let these be `e_seq_lengths = [L_0, L_1, ..., L_{N-1}]`. `N` is the number of input variables.\n    *   Create the `var_for_len` mapping: Iterate through `e_seq_lengths`. For each `L_i`, if `L_i` is not yet a key in `var_for_len`, map `L_i` to `i` (the index of the input variable `x_i`).\n\n2.  **Recursive Backtracking (Depth-First Search):**\n    *   We need to find `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}`. This is a search problem. Since we want the lexicographically smallest sequence, we can iterate through possible values for `x_0` from 0 to 9, then for `x_1` from 0 to 9, and so on. This naturally finds the lexicographically smallest solution first.\n    *   A recursive function `solve(k, current_values)` will try to assign a digit to `x_k`.\n        *   Base Case: If `k == N` (all variables assigned), check if `current_values` satisfies all constraints. If yes, this is a valid solution. Since we are searching lexicographically, the first valid solution found will be the smallest. Return `current_values`.\n        *   Recursive Step: For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n            *   Assign `x_k = digit`.\n            *   Call `solve(k + 1, current_values_with_digit)`.\n            *   If `solve` returns a valid sequence, propagate it up.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Expressions and Constraints:**\n    *   To evaluate an arithmetic expression or a comparison, we need a helper function that takes the current assignments `current_values` and the `var_for_len` map.\n    *   This helper function will tokenize the expression/constraint string, replacing each `_` sequence with its corresponding value from `current_values` using `var_for_len`.\n    *   Then, it will evaluate the resulting arithmetic expression (e.g., `0 - 0 / 1 * 0`) or comparison (e.g., `1 > 0`).\n    *   **Crucial detail:** Division by zero must be handled. If `B / C` is encountered and `C` evaluates to 0, the entire sequence of `x_i` is invalid.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Parsing:** Regular expressions can be used to extract the expression and constraint parts, and to find `_` sequences.\n*   **Expression Evaluation:** Python's `eval()` function can evaluate arithmetic expressions. However, it's safer and more robust to implement a custom parser for the specific operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and handle precedence and division by zero explicitly. Given the simplicity of the expressions (only digits and operators, no nested parentheses beyond the initial `?()` structure), a simple stack-based shunting-yard algorithm or direct recursive descent parser could work. For competitive programming, `eval()` is often used if inputs are trusted and the syntax is simple. We need to be careful about `eval` and division by zero, as `1/0` raises an exception. We can wrap `eval` in a `try-except` block.\n*   **Constraint Evaluation:** Similar to expression evaluation, but resulting in a boolean.\n\nLet's refine the evaluation process:\nA function `evaluate(sub_string, current_values, var_for_len)`:\n1.  Initialize an empty list `tokens`.\n2.  Iterate through `sub_string`:\n    *   If current char is `_`: find the full `_` sequence. Get its length `L`. Look up `var_for_len[L]` to get the index `idx` of the input variable. Append `str(current_values[idx])` to `tokens`. Skip ahead past the `_` sequence.\n    *   If current char is an operator `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`, `>`, `<`, `,`: append the char to `tokens`.\n    *   If current char is a digit: append the digit to `tokens`. (This case is unlikely given the problem description, variables are `_` sequences).\n3.  Join `tokens` into a string.\n4.  If it's an arithmetic expression, `eval()` it. Handle `ZeroDivisionError`.\n5.  If it's a comparison, `eval()` it.\n\n**Example 1 walkthrough with the refined logic:**\n`S = ?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   `<expression>`: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   `<constraints>`: `___>__`\n2.  **Input Variables:**\n    *   `e_seq_lengths` = `[1, 1, 3, 2]` (lengths of `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`)\n    *   `N = 4` input variables: `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\n3.  **`var_for_len` map:**\n    *   `_` (len 1) is `x0`. `var_for_len[1] = 0`.\n    *   `_` (len 1) is `x1`. `var_for_len[1]` remains `0`.\n    *   `___` (len 3) is `x2`. `var_for_len[3] = 2`.\n    *   `__` (len 2) is `x3`. `var_for_len[2] = 3`.\n    *   So, `var_for_len = {1: 0, 3: 2, 2: 3}`.\n\n4.  **Backtracking `solve(k, current_values)`:**\n    *   `solve(0, [])`:\n        *   Try `x0 = 0`: `solve(1, [0])`\n            *   Try `x1 = 0`: `solve(2, [0, 0])`\n                *   Try `x2 = 0`: `solve(3, [0, 0, 0])`\n                    *   Try `x3 = 0`: `solve(4, [0, 0, 0, 0])`\n                        *   Base case.
