There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Maximum Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of maximizing the winner's games in a knockout tournament.  The key rule here is that two players can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one.  That's my starting point.\n\nI'm thinking, let's call the number of games the winner plays 'W'.  Since it's a knockout format, we know there are 'n-1' total games.  The winner plays 'W' of them.  To maximize 'W', I need to figure out the minimal number of players ('n') required to support a winner with that many games.\n\nLet's say the winner has played 'k' games. To play the next, the (k+1)-th game, their opponent's game count must be either 'k-1' or 'k'. I can't have an opponent with more than 'k' games because they would have played the winner. I'm focusing on \"funneling\" players.\n\nI'm starting to formalize this using some notation:  `f(k)` as the maximum number of players we can build up to get one winner with 'k' games.  And `N_k` for the minimal number of players to create a winner who has played 'k' games. I am searching for the maximum k such that `N_k <= n`.\n\nTo build the tournament, I'm thinking about how the winner's path evolves.  If the winner has played 'k' games, their opponents will need to have played 'k-1' or 'k-2' games. I want to build the minimum structure. \n\nLet's look at the early games.\nWinner (0) vs Opponent 1 (0). 2 players, Winner has played 1 game.\nWinner (1) vs Opponent 2 (0 or 1).\nIf opponent 2 has 0 games, Winner(1) vs Opponent2(0), the total number of players is 3. The winner has played 2 games.\nIf opponent 2 has 1 game, then Opponent 2 must have won against somebody who has not played any games. Then, Winner (1) vs Opponent 2 (1) is 4 players and the winner has played 2 games.\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence! This might be it. Let's say `F(k)` is the minimum players for the winner to play 'k' games.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play, given a rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `W` be the winner of the tournament. Let `k_W` be the number of games `W` has played. We want to maximize `k_W`.\nSuppose `W` has played `k` games and is about to play their `(k+1)`-th game. `W` has won all `k` games. Let `P` be `W`'s opponent for this `(k+1)`-th game. `P` must also have won all their games to reach this point.\nLet `k_P` be the number of games `P` has played.\nAccording to the rule, `abs(k - k_P) <= 1`.\nSince `P` is an opponent for `W`'s `(k+1)`-th game, `P` cannot have played more games than `W` has already played. If `P` had played `k+1` games, it would mean `P` has won `k+1` games, which is impossible if `W` has only played `k` games (as they would have already met and one would have been eliminated).\nTherefore, `k_P` must be less than or equal to `k`.\nCombining these, `k_P` can only be `k` or `k-1`.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required in a tournament such that a winner can play `k` games.\nLet's analyze `f(k)`:\n- To play 0 games: This means the player hasn't played yet. All `n` players are in this state initially. `f(0)` is not directly meaningful in terms of games played by a winner.\n- To play 1 game: The winner plays against one opponent. Both start with 0 games played. (0 vs 0). This requires 2 players. So, `f(1) = 2`.\n- To play 2 games: The winner has played 1 game. For their second game, they need an opponent.\n    - Option 1: Opponent has played 0 games. (1 vs 0). This means the opponent is a fresh player. This requires `f(1)` players for the winner's side (2 players for winner's first game) + 1 new player for the opponent. Total = 2 + 1 = 3 players.\n    - Option 2: Opponent has played 1 game. (1 vs 1). This means the opponent also won one game. This requires `f(1)` players for the winner's side + `f(1)` players for the opponent's side. Total = 2 + 2 = 4 players.\n    To minimize players, we choose Option 1, so `f(2) = 3`.\n- To play 3 games: The winner has played 2 games. For their third game, they need an opponent.\n    - Option 1: Opponent has played 1 game. (2 vs 1). This requires `f(2)` players for the winner's side + `f(1)` players for the opponent's side. Total = 3 + 2 = 5 players.\n    - Option 2: Opponent has played 2 games. (2 vs 2). This requires `f(2)` players for the winner's side + `f(2)` players for the opponent's side. Total = 3 + 3 = 6 players.\n    To minimize players, we choose Option 1, so `f(3) = 5`.\n- To play 4 games: The winner has played 3 games. For their fourth game, they need an opponent.\n    - Option 1: Opponent has played 2 games. (3 vs 2). This requires `f(3)` players for the winner's side + `f(2)` players for the opponent's side. Total = 5 + 3 = 8 players.\n    - Option 2: Opponent has played 3 games. (3 vs 3). This requires `f(3)` players for the winner's side + `f(3)` players for the opponent's side. Total = 5 + 5 = 10 players.\n    To minimize players, we choose Option 1, so `f(4) = 8`.\n\nThe sequence `f(k)` seems to follow `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`, with initial values `f(0)=1` (a player who hasn't played yet) and `f(1)=2`.\nLet's verify.\n`f(0) = 1` (a single player, no games played)\n`f(1) = 2` (winner plays 1 game, needs 1 opponent. Winner (0) vs Opponent (0). Total 2 players.)\n`f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`. (Winner (1) vs Opponent (0). Winner side needs `f(1)` players, Opponent side needs `f(0)` players).\n`f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`. (Winner (2) vs Opponent (1). Winner side needs `f(2)` players, Opponent side needs `f(1)` players).\n`f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`. (Winner (3) vs Opponent (2). Winner side needs `f(3)` players, Opponent side needs `f(2)` players).\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically, `f(k) = F_{k+2}`, where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`.\nSo, `f(k)` is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\nWe need to generate Fibonacci numbers until `F_{k+2}` exceeds `n`.\nGiven `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need an efficient way to find `k`.\nFibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `F_m` is approximately `phi^m / sqrt(5)`, where `phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 approx 1.618`.\n`F_m <= 10^18` implies `phi^m / sqrt(5) <= 10^18`.\n`phi^m <= sqrt(5) * 10^18`.\n`m * log(phi) <= log(sqrt(5)) + 18 * log(10)`.\n`m <= (log(sqrt(5)) + 18 * log(10)) / log(phi)`.\n`m <= (0.35 + 18) / 0.209 approx 18.35 / 0.209 approx 87.7`.\nSo, the index `m` will be around 87-90. This means `k+2` will be around 87-90, so `k` will be around 85-88. We can simply iterate and calculate Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet's implement this:\nInitialize `a = 1` (representing `F_2 = f(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F_3 = f(1)`).\nInitialize `games = 1` (since `f(1)=2` is the first value we check against `n` for a possible winner's game count).\nIf `n=2`, the winner plays 1 game.\nIf `n=3`, `f(1)=2 <= 3`, `f(2)=3 <= 3`, `f(3)=5 > 3`. So max games is 2.\nIf `n=4`, `f(1)=2 <= 4`, `f(2)=3 <= 4`, `f(3)=5 > 4`. So max games is 2.\n\nThe loop should be:\n`a = 1` (corresponds to `f(0)`)\n`b = 2` (corresponds to `f(1)`)\n`k = 1` (number of games for `b`)\n\nIf `n == 2`, `k=1`.\nOtherwise, while `b <= n`:\n  `temp = b`\n  `b = a + b`\n  `a = temp`\n  `k = k + 1`\nThe loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, `a` holds the largest Fibonacci number `f(k_max)` that is less than or equal to `n`, and `k_max` is the corresponding number of games.\nSo, the answer is `k-1`.\n\nLet's trace for `n=10`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`\n`n=10`.\n1. `b=2 <= 10`: `temp=2, b=1+2=3, a=2, k=2`. (`f(2)=3`)\n2. `b=3 <= 10`: `temp=3, b=2+3=5, a=3, k=3`. (`f(3)=5`)\n3. `b=5 <= 10`: `temp=5, b=3+5=8, a=5, k=4`. (`f(4)=8`)\n4. `b=8 <= 10`: `temp=8, b=5+8=13, a=8, k=5`. (`f(5)=13`)\n5. `b=13 > 10`: Loop terminates.\nThe answer is `k-1 = 5-1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example outputs.\n\nFinal check on edge case `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`\n`n=2`.\n1. `b=2 <= 2`: `temp=2, b=1+2=3, a=2, k=2`.\n2. `b=3 > 2`: Loop terminates.\nAnswer is `k-1 = 2-1 = 1`.
