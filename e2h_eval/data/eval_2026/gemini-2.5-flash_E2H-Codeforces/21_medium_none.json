The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Competitive Programming Chest Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is a matching problem. We have chests and keys, each with a number.  A key can open a chest *only* if the sum of their numbers is odd.  That means one number must be even, and the other odd. Each key and each chest can be used only once.\n\nSo, I need to maximize the number of opened chests. The key insight? Focus on *parity* (even or odd), not the actual numbers. I need to count:\n*   `C_even`:  Even chests.\n*   `C_odd`: Odd chests.\n*   `K_even`: Even keys.\n*   `K_odd`: Odd keys.\n\nThink about it:  An even chest *needs* an odd key, and vice versa.  This creates two independent subproblems:\n\n1.  How many even chests can I open with odd keys?  The answer is the *smaller* of `C_even` and `K_odd` (limited by the resources).\n2.  How many odd chests can I open with even keys? The answer is the smaller of `C_odd` and `K_even`.\n\nSince these two are independent, the *total* number of opened chests is just the sum of these two results!  `min(C_even, K_odd) + min(C_odd, K_even)`. That's it! Efficient solution, O(n+m) time, and O(1) space if I process the numbers as I read them.  I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for I/O in Python. It's clean, fast, and elegant.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe core condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\n- If `a_i` is an even number, then `b_j` must be an odd number for the sum to be odd.\n- If `a_i` is an odd number, then `b_j` must be an even number for the sum to be odd.\n\nThis observation simplifies the problem significantly. We can categorize both chests and keys by their parity:\n\n1.  **Count even and odd chests:**\n    Let `chest_even_count` be the number of chests with an even number.\n    Let `chest_odd_count` be the number of chests with an odd number.\n\n2.  **Count even and odd keys:**\n    Let `key_even_count` be the number of keys with an even number.\n    Let `key_odd_count` be the number of keys with an odd number.\n\nNow, we can form two independent sets of pairings:\n\n*   **Pairing 1: Even chests with odd keys.**\n    The number of even chests that can be opened is limited by the available `chest_even_count` and the available `key_odd_count`. The maximum number of such pairings is `min(chest_even_count, key_odd_count)`.\n\n*   **Pairing 2: Odd chests with even keys.**\n    Similarly, the number of odd chests that can be opened is limited by the available `chest_odd_count` and the available `key_even_count`. The maximum number of such pairings is `min(chest_odd_count, key_even_count)`.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use disjoint sets of chests (even vs. odd) and keys (odd vs. even), they do not interfere with each other. Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is simply the sum of the maximums from these two independent pairing types.\n\n**Total opened chests = `min(chest_even_count, key_odd_count) + min(chest_odd_count, key_even_count)`**\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chest_even_count = 0` and `chest_odd_count = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `chest_even_count`; otherwise, increment `chest_odd_count`.\n4.  Initialize `key_even_count = 0` and `key_odd_count = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `key_even_count`; otherwise, increment `key_odd_count`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(chest_even_count, key_odd_count) + min(chest_odd_count, key_even_count)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1.  **Chests:**\n    *   `9` (odd)\n    *   `14` (even)\n    *   `6` (even)\n    *   `2` (even)\n    *   `11` (odd)\n    `chest_even_count = 3`, `chest_odd_count = 2`\n\n2.  **Keys:**\n    *   `8` (even)\n    *   `4` (even)\n    *   `7` (odd)\n    *   `20` (even)\n    `key_even_count = 3`, `key_odd_count = 1`\n\n3.  **Calculate pairings:**\n    *   Even chests with odd keys: `min(chest_even_count, key_odd_count) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    *   Odd chests with even keys: `min(chest_odd_count, key_even_count) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4.  **Total opened chests:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis approach is efficient, running in `O(n + m)` time complexity (for reading input and counting parities) and `O(1)` space complexity (beyond input storage). The maximum values of `n, m` ($10^5$) and `a_i, b_j` ($10^9$) are well within typical limits for this solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m, the number of chests and keys.\n    # sys.stdin.readline() is used for faster input in competitive programming.\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd chest numbers.\n    chest_even_count = 0\n    chest_odd_count = 0\n\n    # Read the chest numbers from the second line.\n    # We iterate through the numbers using map(int, ...) to convert them to integers\n    # without storing the entire list in memory, which is efficient for large inputs.\n    a_values_iterator = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    for a_val in a_values_iterator:\n        # Check if the chest number is even or odd and update counts.\n        if a_val % 2 == 0:\n            chest_even_count += 1\n        else:\n            chest_odd_count += 1\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd key numbers.\n    key_even_count = 0\n    key_odd_count = 0\n\n    # Read the key numbers from the third line.\n    b_values_iterator = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    for b_val in b_values_iterator:\n        # Check if the key number is even or odd and update counts.\n        if b_val % 2 == 0:\n            key_even_count += 1\n        else:\n            key_odd_count += 1\n\n    # To open a chest, the sum of its number and the key's number must be odd.\n    # This means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n    # Calculate the number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys.\n    # This is limited by the minimum of available even chests and available odd keys.\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chest_even_count, key_odd_count)\n\n    # Calculate the number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys.\n    # This is limited by the minimum of available odd chests and available even keys.\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chest_odd_count, key_even_count)\n\n    # The total maximum number of chests opened is the sum of these two independent types of pairings.\n    total_opened_chests = matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key\n\n    # Print the result to standard output.\n    # sys.stdout.write() is used for faster output.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_opened_chests) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program logic.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
