He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "**Analyzing a Competitive Programming String Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task is to determine if a string `S` follows a specific pattern: it's built by three entities, A, B, and C, each appending characters to an initial string. A starts with lowercase 'a's, B adds 'b's, and C adds 'c's. The key constraint is that the number of 'c's appended by C must equal the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string after A and B have done their work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the string's structure if it's valid.  It's a straightforward sequence: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Importantly, the problem says there's *at least* one 'a' and one 'b', which, combined with C's rule, means there's also at least one 'c'. So no section can be empty.  This forms the core pattern: `a...ab...bc...c`.\n\nMy approach:  parse the string, count the 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's, and then check against the rules. I'll iterate through the string, maintaining a state.  Start expecting 'a's. Once I see a 'b', move to the 'b' state.  If a 'c' appears before a 'b', or an 'a' after a 'b' or anything besides 'c' after 'b' then it's invalid immediately. Finally, check if the counts satisfy the criteria: All are positive, and the number of 'c's equals the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's. Also verify I consume the whole input string.\n\nThe code reflects this: I have a loop to read the input. I have counters for each character, which I increment in their respective while loop until finding a non-matching character. I have `if`s to check the conditions.\n\nEdge cases? The problem *is* tagged \"hard\", so I should think.  Well, the rules about all three letter types being present are strict. If a 'b' appears before an 'a' then it's bad. The same is true for 'c' before 'b' or after 'b' but not after 'c'. The equal-count rule for 'c's covers when all counts are equal.\n\nThe whole plan seems solid. Linear time complexity, O(1) space, and correctly detects invalid string formats.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` could have been formed according to a specific set of rules. Let's break down these rules and how they translate into conditions for the string `S`.\n\n**Rules for String Formation:**\n\n1.  **A's step:** A starts with a string of `N_a` lowercase 'a's.\n2.  **B's step:** B appends `N_b` lowercase 'b's to A's string. At this point, the string has `N_a` 'a's followed by `N_b` 'b's. The problem states that \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" at this point. This means `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step:** C appends `N_c` lowercase 'c's to the end of the string. The crucial condition is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`. Since `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`, this implies that `N_c` must also be at least `1`.\n\n**Summary of Derived Conditions for a Valid String:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. No other characters or orderings are allowed (e.g., 'b's cannot appear before 'a's, 'a's cannot appear after 'b's, etc.).\n2.  **Counts:**\n    *   The number of 'a's (`N_a`) must be at least 1.\n    *   The number of 'b's (`N_b`) must be at least 1.\n    *   The number of 'c's (`N_c`) must be at least 1.\n    *   The number of 'c's (`N_c`) must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can check these conditions by iterating through the input string `S` once.\n\n1.  **Parse and Count:**\n    *   Initialize `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` to 0.\n    *   Use an index `i` to traverse the string.\n    *   First, count all leading 'a's: While `s[i]` is 'a', increment `count_a` and `i`.\n    *   Next, count all 'b's: While `s[i]` is 'b', increment `count_b` and `i`.\n    *   Finally, count all 'c's: While `s[i]` is 'c', increment `count_c` and `i`.\n\n2.  **Validate Structure:**\n    *   After the three counting loops, if `i` is less than the length of the string `n`, it means there are characters remaining in `S` that do not fit the `a...ab...bc...c` pattern. This indicates an invalid structure (e.g., `aaabbca` has an 'a' after 'c's, `abccb` has a 'b' after 'c's). In this case, print \"NO\".\n\n3.  **Validate Counts:**\n    *   If the structure is valid (i.e., `i == n`), then check the count conditions:\n        *   Ensure `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, AND `count_c >= 1`. If any of these is false, print \"NO\".\n        *   If all counts are at least 1, then check if `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`. If this condition is met, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`aaabccc`):**\n\n1.  `s = \"aaabccc\"`, `n = 7`. `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0, i=0`.\n2.  **Count 'a's:** `s[0]='a', s[1]='a', s[2]='a'`. `count_a` becomes 3, `i` becomes 3.\n3.  **Count 'b's:** `s[3]='b'`. `count_b` becomes 1, `i` becomes 4.\n4.  **Count 'c's:** `s[4]='c', s[5]='c', s[6]='c'`. `count_c` becomes 3, `i` becomes 7.\n5.  **Validate Structure:** `i` (7) is equal to `n` (7). Structure is valid.\n6.  **Validate Counts:**\n    *   `count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3`. All are `>= 1`. (True)\n    *   Is `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3)? Yes.\n    *   Is `count_c == count_b` (3 == 1)? No.\n    *   Since `True OR False` is True, print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach is efficient, performing a single pass over the string, resulting in O(N) time complexity, where N is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input string from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Get the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Initialize counters for 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    # Initialize an index to iterate through the string\n    i = 0\n\n    # Phase 1: Count 'a's\n    # Iterate while the current character is 'a' and we are within string bounds\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1  # Increment 'a' count\n        i += 1        # Move to the next character\n\n    # Phase 2: Count 'b's\n    # Iterate while the current character is 'b' and we are within string bounds\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1  # Increment 'b' count\n        i += 1        # Move to the next character\n\n    # Phase 3: Count 'c's\n    # Iterate while the current character is 'c' and we are within string bounds\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1  # Increment 'c' count\n        i += 1        # Move to the next character\n\n    # Validation 1: Check if the entire string was consumed and follows the a...ab...bc...c pattern\n    # If 'i' is less than 'n' after all loops, it means there are characters remaining\n    # in the string that do not fit the expected sequence (e.g., 'a' after 'b', 'b' after 'c',\n    # or any character after 'c's).
