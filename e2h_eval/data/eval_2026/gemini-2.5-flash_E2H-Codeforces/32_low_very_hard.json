    "thought": "**Tackling the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Array Stabilization\" problem, and the core challenge is minimizing the instability after removing a single element. Instability, as they've defined it, is just the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array. My immediate thought is, \"Where's the instability coming from?\" Clearly, it's the gap between the extremes.\n\nLet's break this down. If I remove any element *other* than the maximum or minimum, the overall range, the instability, stays the same. The maximum and minimum are still there, so the difference remains `max_val - min_val`.  \n\nThe interesting cases are when I remove the maximum or the minimum. If I remove the maximum (`max_val`), I'm essentially replacing it with the second-largest element (`second_max_val`).  The minimum stays the same (unless the whole array is the same value, in which case we get zero instability). So, removing the max results in `second_max_val - min_val`.  Similarly, if I remove the minimum (`min_val`), the new instability becomes `max_val - second_min_val`.\n\nNow, the trick here is in handling duplicates. The problem states \"remove exactly one element\", but it doesn't specify unique maximums or minimums. If the maximum value is repeated, removing one instance won't necessarily change the maximum. The key is removing *one* element equal to the original maximum to make the new maximum the \"second_max_val\".\n\nSo, I'm thinking, to minimize the instability, I should aim to either lower the maximum or raise the minimum. The only way to *definitely* reduce the maximum is to get rid of *the* maximum value.  This analysis seems sound - focusing on the original maximum and minimum is the right approach. Let's translate this into an efficient algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from an array `a` of `n` integers to minimize the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nLet the original array be `a`.\nLet `max_orig` be the maximum element in `a` and `min_orig` be the minimum element in `a`.\n\nWhen we remove an element, the instability of the new `n-1` element array is `max(new_array) - min(new_array)`. To minimize this value, we want to either decrease `max(new_array)` or increase `min(new_array)`.\n\nConsider the elements that determine the instability: the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values.\n\n1.  **If we remove an element `x` that is neither the maximum nor the minimum value in the original array (i.e., `min_orig < x < max_orig`)**:\n    In this case, `min_orig` will still be the minimum element in the remaining array, and `max_orig` will still be the maximum element. The instability will remain `max_orig - min_orig`.\n\n2.  **If we remove the maximum element `max_orig`**:\n    For the maximum element to change, `max_orig` must be removed. The new maximum element will then be the second largest element in the original array. Let's call this `second_max_orig`. The minimum element in the remaining array will still be `min_orig` (unless `n=2` and `min_orig = max_orig`, which is a special case covered by sorting).\n    The instability in this case would be `second_max_orig - min_orig`.\n\n3.  **If we remove the minimum element `min_orig`**:\n    For the minimum element to change, `min_orig` must be removed. The new minimum element will then be the second smallest element in the original array. Let's call this `second_min_orig`. The maximum element in the remaining array will still be `max_orig`.\n    The instability in this case would be `max_orig - second_min_orig`.\n\nAny element we remove will lead to one of these three scenarios. To find the minimum possible instability, we need to compare the results of these scenarios.\n\nThe most straightforward way to find `max_orig`, `min_orig`, `second_max_orig`, and `second_min_orig` is to sort the array `a`.\nLet the sorted array be `a_sorted`.\nThen:\n*   `min_orig` is `a_sorted[0]`\n*   `second_min_orig` is `a_sorted[1]`\n*   `max_orig` is `a_sorted[n-1]`\n*   `second_max_orig` is `a_sorted[n-2]`\n\nNow, we can calculate the two relevant instabilities:\n*   If we remove `max_orig` (i.e., `a_sorted[n-1]`), the instability is `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]`.\n*   If we remove `min_orig` (i.e., `a_sorted[0]`), the instability is `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]`.\n\nThe minimum possible instability will be the minimum of these two values.\n`min( (a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]), (a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]) )`\n\nThis approach covers all cases. If we remove an element that is not `a_sorted[0]` or `a_sorted[n-1]`, the instability would be `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]`. This value will always be greater than or equal to both `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]` (since `a_sorted[n-1] >= a_sorted[n-2]`) and `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]` (since `a_sorted[0] <= a_sorted[1]`). Therefore, we only need to consider removing the absolute minimum or absolute maximum element.\n\n**Example 1:** `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`, `n = 4`\nSorted `a_sorted = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n`a_sorted[0] = 1` (min)\n`a_sorted[1] = 3` (second min)\n`a_sorted[n-2] = a_sorted[2] = 3` (second max)\n`a_sorted[n-1] = a_sorted[3] = 7` (max)\n\n1.  Remove `max_orig` (7): Instability = `second_max_orig - min_orig` = `3 - 1 = 2`.\n2.  Remove `min_orig` (1): Instability = `max_orig - second_min_orig` = `7 - 3 = 4`.\n\nThe minimum is `min(2, 4) = 2`.\n\n**Example 2:** `a = [1, 100000]`, `n = 2`\nSorted `a_sorted = [1, 100000]`\n`a_sorted[0] = 1` (min)\n`a_sorted[1] = 100000` (second min, second max, max)\n\n1.  Remove `max_orig` (100000): Instability = `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]` = `a_sorted[0] - a_sorted[0]` = `1 - 1 = 0`.\n2.  Remove `min_orig` (1): Instability = `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]` = `a_sorted[1] - a_sorted[1]` = `100000 - 100000 = 0`.\n\nThe minimum is `min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the `n` integers into an array `a`.\n3. Sort the array `a`.\n4. Calculate `instability1 = a[n-2] - a[0]`.\n5. Calculate `instability2 = a[n-1] - a[1]`.\n6.
