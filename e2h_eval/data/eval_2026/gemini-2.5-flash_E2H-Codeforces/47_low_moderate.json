During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the LCM Minimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem. The core is finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. If there are ties, smallest `k` wins.\n\nFirst, I reframed the problem. Let `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. The goal becomes minimizing `lcm(x, y)`. I know that `lcm(x, y)` is `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. This tells me minimizing the LCM boils down to managing the greatest common divisor.\n\nI introduced `g` as the gcd of `x` and `y`.  Since `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, their difference, `y - x`, simplifies to `b - a`.  A key insight is that `g` (the gcd) *must* divide the difference, meaning `g` must be a divisor of `b-a`.  Therefore, I'll iterate through the divisors of `|b-a|`, which I'll call `d`.\n\nI figured that I can assume `a <= b` without loss of generality. I'll just take the absolute difference to keep things organized.\n\nNow, for each divisor `g` of `d`, I need to find the smallest `k` that satisfies a few conditions:  `g` divides both `a+k` and `b+k`, and `a+k` and `b+k` are non-negative, which is always true. Given `g`, I need to find the smallest k such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\nSo `a + k = m*g`. Therefore `k = m * g - a`. Since k is non-negative, `m * g >= a`. Thus the smallest `m` is `ceil(a/g)`.\n\nTo find this value I noticed that the smallest k comes from the modulo operator: `(g - (a % g)) % g`. I think this efficiently calculates the \"gap\" needed to reach the next multiple of `g` after `a`. If `a` is already a multiple of `g` (if `a % g == 0`), then `k` is zero; otherwise, `k` is `g - (a % g)`.\n\nSo the strategy: go through the divisors of `|b-a|`, use the `k = (g - (a % g)) % g` to find the smallest k for each g. Compute the lcm of `a+k` and `b+k`. Pick the smallest.\n",
