The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.** The task at hand is the \"Frog Jumping\" problem. It's a competitive programming challenge, so efficiency is key. My initial thought process revolves around understanding the problem, identifying crucial constraints, and then brainstorming possible approaches.\n\nFirst, I need to get a clear picture of what the frog can do.  It starts at 0, and can either jump forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units. The catch is that every jump must keep the frog within the range of 0 to x. This 'f(x)' is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, starting from 0, and staying within 0 and x. I'm asked to calculate the sum of f(i) from 0 to 'm'.\n\nThe constraint that 'm' can be up to 10^9 is a huge red flag. A naive solution that loops through each 'i' from 0 to 'm' and calculates f(i) individually is going to be incredibly slow, or it's just impossible. So, I need to find a more clever way. The smaller values of 'a' and 'b' (up to 10^5) are important. They hint that maybe I can exploit some mathematical relationship, perhaps something involving the greatest common divisor, least common multiple, or some other number-theoretic concept.\n\nTo determine f(x) for each x, I considered that it's a reachability problem. I might use a Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or dynamic programming approach. I can create a 'reachable' array, where each index from 0 to x represents an integer, and the value is true if the frog can reach it and false otherwise. The core idea would be to start at 0, mark it as reachable, and then explore possible jumps, but this is memory inefficient for large 'x'.\n\nOkay, I need to refine my approach. While the reachability aspect seems reasonable, creating a giant array for x could be too much. I'll need to explore some properties related to a and b.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, given that it can jump `+a` or `-b`, and it must *never* jump outside the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `S_x` be the set of reachable integers within `[0, x]`. `f(x) = |S_x|`.\nThe condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" means:\n1. If the frog is at `k`, it can jump to `k+a` only if `k+a <= x`.\n2. If the frog is at `k`, it can jump to `k-b` only if `k-b >= 0`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum starting point `x_min` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, x_min]`. If `k` is not reachable for any `x_min`, we can set `dp[k] = infinity`.\nInitially, `dp[0] = 0`. All other `dp[k] = infinity`.\nWe can use a Dijkstra-like algorithm to fill `dp` values. The states are `0, 1, ..., a+b-1` (or more generally, `0, ..., max(a,b)+b-1` or `0, ..., a+b-1` since `gcd(a,b)` is involved). The maximum possible value for `k` that can be reached is `a+b-1` (or `a+b` or `a+b-1` for `k` to be reachable in `[0, k]`).\n\nConsider the state `k % g` where `g = gcd(a,b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`.\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum `x_min` required to reach `r` *from `0`* (where `r` is a multiple of `g`).\nWe are looking for `dp_val[k]` which is the minimum `x` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\nThe initial state is `dp_val[0] = 0`. All other `dp_val[k] = infinity`.\nWe can use a 0-1 BFS (deque) because edge weights are effectively 0 or `a` (or `b`).\nWhen moving `k -> k+a`: `dp_val[k+a] = max(dp_val[k], k+a)`\nWhen moving `k -> k-b`: `dp_val[k-b] = dp_val[k]` (since `k-b < k`, the constraint `k-b <= x` is weaker than `k <= x`).\n\nLet's refine the `dp_val` definition: `dp_val[k]` is the minimum `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\n`dp_val[0] = 0`. All other `dp_val[i] = infinity`.\nUse a deque for 0-1 BFS. Push `(0, 0)` to deque.\nWhen we pop `(curr, cost)` from deque:\n1. Try `curr + a`: New cost `new_cost_a = max(cost, curr + a)`. If `new_cost_a < dp_val[curr+a]`, update `dp_val[curr+a]` and push `(curr+a, new_cost_a)` to back.\n2. Try `curr - b`: New cost `new_cost_b = cost`. If `new_cost_b < dp_val[curr-b]`, update `dp_val[curr-b]` and push `(curr-b, new_cost_b)` to front.\nThe maximum value `k` can take is `a+b-1` (or `a+b-1` if `gcd(a,b)` is involved, or `a+b` if we allow going up to `a+b`). The maximum `k` for which `dp_val[k]` is finite is `a+b-1`.\nThe range of `k` values we need to compute `dp_val` for is `[0, a+b-1]`.\nThe values `dp_val[k]` will be at most `a+b-1`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`. All reachable numbers must be multiples of `g`.\nWe only need to compute `dp_val[k]` for `k` in `[0, a+b-1]`.\nThe `dp_val[k]` values are the minimum `x` for which `k` is reachable.\n`f(x)` can be found by counting how many `k` in `[0, x]` satisfy `dp_val[k] <= x`.\nSince `dp_val[k] <= k` (because to reach `k`, `k` itself must be `in [0, x]`), this condition simplifies to `dp_val[k] <= x`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` for which `dp_val[k]` is finite is `a+b-1`.\nFor `k >= a+b`, `dp_val[k]` is infinity. This is because any number `k >= a+b` can only be reached if we make a jump `+a` from `k-a`. But `k-a >= b`. If we are at `k-a` and want to reach `k`, we must have been able to reach `k-a` within `[0, X]`. If `k-a >= b`, we can always make a `-b` jump from `k-a` to `k-a-b`. This implies that if `k-a` is reachable, then `k-a-b` is also reachable. This structure implies that all numbers `k % g` for `k >= a+b` are reachable if `a+b` is reachable.\nMore precisely, for any `k >= a+b-1`, if `k` is reachable, then `k+g` is also reachable.\nThis is because if `k` is reachable, then `k = c_1 a - c_2 b` for some non-negative integers `c_1, c_2`.\nSince `k >= a+b-1`, we can always find a path to `k+g`.\nThe `dp_val[k]` values for `k` multiples of `g` and `k < a+b` are what we need.\nFor `k >= a+b`, if `k` is a multiple of `g`, then `dp_val[k] = k`. This is because any `k` in this range can be reached by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps, and the maximum value encountered on such a path will be `k` itself. For example, to reach `k`, we can reach `k-g` and then jump `+a` `(g/gcd(a,b))` times and `-b` `(g/gcd(a,b))` times to reach `k`. The maximum value on this path will be `k`.\n\nSo, `dp_val[k]` is computed for `k` from `0` to `a+b-1`.\nFor `k >= a+b`, `dp_val[k] = k` if `k % g == 0`, otherwise `infinity`.\n\nNow, let's calculate `f(x)`.\n`f(x) = count(k | 0 <= k <= x, dp_val[k] <= x)`\nSince `dp_val[k] <= k`, this is `count(k | 0 <= k <= x, dp_val[k] <= x)`.\nThe `dp_val[k]` values are non-decreasing.\nLet `L = a+b`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `m`:\n`f(i)`:\n  Count `k` in `[0, min(i, L-1)]` such that `dp_val[k] <= i`.\n  If `i >= L`:\n    Count `k` in `[L, i]` such that `k % g == 0`. This is `(i - L)/g + 1` if `L % g == 0`.\n    More generally, it's `floor(i/g) - ceil(L/g) + 1` if `L` is adjusted to be the smallest multiple of `g` greater than or equal to `L`.\n    Let `L_g = ceil(L/g) * g`. Then count is `(i - L_g)/g + 1`.\n\nLet's compute `dp_val[k]` for `k` from `0` to `a+b-1`.\nThe maximum value of `a+b-1` is `2 * 10^5 - 1`. This is feasible.\n\n```python\nimport collections\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # dp_val[k] stores the minimum X such that k is reachable within [0, X].\n    # We only need to compute dp_val for k up to a + b - 1.\n    # For k >= a + b, if k is a multiple of g, dp_val[k] = k.
