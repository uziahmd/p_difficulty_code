They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down. I'm trying to solve a competitive programming problem called \"Playoff,\" which, at its heart, is about determining the possible winning skill levels in a tournament. The tournament structure is pretty standard: $2^n$ teams, $n$ phases, single elimination. Each team has a skill level, and the rules of each phase dictate whether the higher or lower skilled team wins. The rule string, 's', is key here, with '0' meaning lower skill wins, and '1' meaning higher skill wins.**\n\n**My initial thoughts revolve around how to make a team with a specific skill level, say 'X', win. For 'X' to win, it needs to be able to win 'n' games, one in each phase. Each game pits 'X' against another team (or the winner of a sub-bracket). The tricky bit is figuring out the minimum and maximum skill values 'X' can be. For example, to make a small value to win, I need 'X' smaller than opponent values, which is easier if the first games rule is \"the lower skill must win\" since X can be small and defeat even smaller skilled players. The maximum value that can win is a little trickier, I need a 'bigger' number that can defeat 'lower' opponent skills. This leads me to examine the range of possible 'X' values.  I'm counting how many times 'X' has to be greater and smaller to compute these values.**\n\n**The thing that's making this hard is the *interconnectedness* of the games. The opponents of 'X' aren't just random teams; they're winners of sub-tournaments, and these \"winners\" have their own constraints dictated by the rules and skill permutation.**\n**I've tried a few strategies. It seems that the range should be simple, but there's no way to prove it correct. I had an idea of building the string and making sure the lower and higher skills are available. I tried to derive an equation using the number of '1's (games where 'X' must be greater) and '0's (games where 'X' must be smaller) in the rule string. I'm considering what skills have been used from the starting permutation.**\n\n**So, the problem boils down to finding a permutation that is good for each skill.**\n**I've tried figuring out the bounds on the skill X. I'm thinking of building up an example and using all $n+1$ values, where the $n$ values are for a winning streak, where the rules of $s$ are obeyed. I also think I may be able to ignore the initial pairings, it only cares about the resulting outcome for each skill. But the order the skill is winning is critical. I'm thinking about which skill can go in which position, to win against other skills.**\n\n**I keep coming back to this: For a winning skill 'X', I need to assign other skills to $p_i$, and the way the team wins is only driven by a rule 's'.**\n**I need to establish the bounds of my winning skills to ensure all requirements are met. My instinct is that there has to be something simpler I'm missing. I keep getting lost in the details of the tournament and sub-tournaments. The crucial thing to remember is the initial structure does not matter. The permutation is free. This problem is now simpler and I can start to solve it.**\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament. We are given $n$, the number of phases (total $2^n$ teams), and a string $s$ of length $n$. $s_i$ determines the rule for phase $i$: if $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill team wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill team wins. We can assign any permutation of skills $1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the initial $2^n$ teams.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament.\nA team that wins the tournament must win $n$ games, one in each phase.\nFor each phase $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n- If $s_i = '0'$, the team with skill $X$ must have a lower skill than its opponent in phase $i$.\n- If $s_i = '1'$, the team with skill $X$ must have a higher skill than its opponent in phase $i$.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the total count of '0's in the string $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the total count of '1's in the string $s$.\nNote that $N_0 + N_1 = n$.\n\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament:\n1. In $N_1$ games (where $s_i = '1'$), $X$ must be greater than its opponent. This means $X$ needs to \"defeat\" $N_1$ other distinct skill values that are smaller than $X$.\n2. In $N_0$ games (where $s_i = '0'$), $X$ must be smaller than its opponent. This means $X$ needs to \"defeat\" $N_0$ other distinct skill values that are larger than $X$.\n\nThe opponents that $X$ faces in its $n$ games must be distinct. Their skill values must also be distinct from each other and from $X$.\nSo, we need to find $N_1$ distinct skill values $Y_1, \\dots, Y_{N_1}$ such that $Y_j < X$, and $N_0$ distinct skill values $Z_1, \\dots, Z_{N_0}$ such that $Z_j > X$. These $n$ skill values ($Y_j$'s and $Z_j$'s) must also be distinct from $X$.\n\nTo satisfy the condition $Y_j < X$ for $N_1$ distinct $Y_j$'s, the smallest possible values for these $Y_j$'s are $1, 2, \\dots, N_1$. For $X$ to be greater than all of them, $X$ must be at least $N_1+1$. This is because there are only $X-1$ skills less than $X$, so we need $N_1 \\le X-1$, which implies $X \\ge N_1+1$.\n\nTo satisfy the condition $Z_j > X$ for $N_0$ distinct $Z_j$'s, the largest possible values for these $Z_j$'s are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-N_0+1$. For $X$ to be smaller than all of them, $X$ must be at most $2^n-N_0$. This is because there are only $2^n-X$ skills greater than $X$, so we need $N_0 \\le 2^n-X$, which implies $X \\le 2^n-N_0$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, a potential winning skill $X$ must be in the range $[N_1+1, 2^n-N_0]$.\n\nThe crucial observation in problems like this is that since we can assign the permutation $p$ arbitrarily, we can ensure that the team with skill $X$ always faces opponents with the desired skill properties, as long as such skills exist. The specific structure of the tournament (who plays whom in which phase) only determines the number of games a team plays and the phase rules ($s_i$). It does not constrain the *skill values* of the opponents beyond the fact that they must exist and be distinct.\n\nTherefore, any integer $X$ in the range $[N_1+1, 2^n-N_0]$ is a winning integer.\nLet's check the examples:\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s='101'$\n$N_0 = 1$ (for $s_2='0'$)\n$N_1 = 2$ (for $s_1='1', s_3='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nThe range is $[N_1+1, 2^n-N_0] = [2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$. This suggests my initial analysis is slightly off, or there's an implicit constraint I missed.\n\nThe example output difference implies that the *number of teams* that are effectively \"smaller\" than the winner or \"larger\" than the winner might be different from $N_1$ and $N_0$. This happens if the opponents are not just single teams, but winners of sub-tournaments that also must contain specific skill values.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem statement carefully: \"in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\" or \"higher skill level wins\". This applies to *any* match in that phase.\nConsider the $N_1$ '1's in $s$. Each '1' means $X$ must beat an opponent $O_i$ with $X > O_i$.\nConsider the $N_0$ '0's in $s$. Each '0' means $X$ must beat an opponent $O_j$ with $X < O_j$.\n\nThe key is to count how many teams must be \"smaller\" than $X$ and how many must be \"larger\" than $X$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner $W$ of a game in phase $i$ has skill $W$. Its opponent $O$ has skill $O$. $W > O$. $O$ is eliminated.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner $W$ has skill $W$. Its opponent $O$ has skill $O$. $W < O$. $O$ is eliminated.\n\nLet's count how many teams a winning $X$ must be *strictly greater than* and *strictly less than*.\nThe winning team $X$ plays $n$ games.\nFor each $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nFor each $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nConsider the game in phase $i$. The winner $W$ plays an opponent $O$. $O$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $W > O$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $W < O$.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the \"strength\" of the opponents matters.\nFor any team to win a sub-tournament of $2^k$ teams, it must win $k$ games.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent. This opponent is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\nThis means $X$ must be greater than a value that is itself \"strong enough\" to win $i-1$ games.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent. This opponent is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\nThis means $X$ must be smaller than a value that is itself \"strong enough\" to win $i-1$ games.\n\nLet's count the number of '1's and '0's in $s$.\nLet $s_{left}$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nLet $s_{right}$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThese are just $N_0$ and $N_1$ from before.\nThe range of winning skills is $2^{s_{left}} \\dots 2^n - 2^{s_{right}} + 1$. No, this is not it.\nThis is a common pattern in tournament problems. The minimum possible skill that can win is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s \\text{ from right to left})$.\nThe maximum possible skill that can win is $2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s \\text{ from right to left})$.\n\nLet's count the $N_0$ and $N_1$ again, but this time $N_0$ is the count of '0's and $N_1$ is the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe range of winning skills is from $1 + \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='1'} 2^{i-1}$ to $2^n - \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='0'} 2^{i-1}$. This is also not it.\n\nThe actual range is determined by the number of '0's and '1's in $s$ directly.\nLet $C_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $C_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum possible winning skill is $1 + C_1$.\nThe maximum possible winning skill is $2^n - C_0$.\nThis is the same range as before, $[C_1+1, 2^n-C_0]$. Still yields $[3,7]$ for example 1.\n\nThe example output $4, 5, 6, 7$ for $n=3, s='101'$ is the key.\nFor $s='101'$, $C_0=1, C_1=2$.\nThe range $X \\in [C_1+1, 2^n-C_0]$ implies $X \\in [2+1, 8-1] = [3,7]$.\nThe example output $4,5,6,7$ is $X \\in [2^{C_1}, 2^n - 2^{C_0} + 1]$. No.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that must be \"weaker\" than the winner and \"stronger\" than the winner.\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win, it must win $n$ games.\nIn games where $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nIn games where $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nCrucially, the skill values $1, \\dots, 2^n$ are assigned to the initial $2^n$ teams.\nThe team with skill $X$ will play $n$ games.\nIn the first game, it plays one opponent.\nIn the second game, it plays the winner of a 2-team sub-tournament.\nIn the third game, it plays the winner of a 4-team sub-tournament.\n...\nIn the $k$-th game (phase $k$), it plays the winner of a $2^{k-1}$-team sub-tournament.\n\nLet's count $N_0$ = number of '0's in $s$, and $N_1$ = number of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum skill value that can win is $1 + (\\text{number of } '1'\\text{s in } s \\text{ from right to left})$. This is $1 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{if } s_i = '1' \\text{ then } 2^{i-1} \\text{ else } 0$. No, this is not it. This is more complex.\n\nThe correct logic for this type of problem is often related to the number of teams that a winner must \"dominate\" or \"be dominated by\".\nA team that wins the tournament must beat $n$ opponents.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner $X$ must be greater than its opponent $O_i$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner $X$ must be smaller than its opponent $O_i$.\n\nConsider the total number of teams $2^n$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be strictly greater than is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be strictly smaller than is $2^{N_0}$.\nThis is because if $s_i = '1'$, $X$ beats $O_i$. $O_i$ is a winner of a $2^{i-1}$-team sub-tournament. If $X$ is to win, it must be the highest skill in its $2^{N_1}$-size \"stronger-than\" group.\nAnd if $s_i = '0'$, $X$ loses to $O_i$. $X$ must be the lowest skill in its $2^{N_0}$-size \"weaker-than\" group.\n\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nThe minimum winning skill is $1 + (2^{N_1}-1)$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$.\n\nSo the range of winning skills is $[2^{N_1}, 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1]$.\nLet's test this with the examples:\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s='101'$\n$N_0 = 1$ (one '0' at $s_2$)\n$N_1 = 2$ (two '1's at $s_1, s_3$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nMinimum winning skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[4, 7]$.\nThis matches the example output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s='1'$\n$N_0 = 0$\n$N_1 = 1$\n$2^n = 2^1 = 2$.\nMinimum winning skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThe range is $[2, 2]$.\nThis matches the example output: $2$.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s='01'$\n$N_0 = 1$ (one '0' at $s_1$)\n$N_1 = 1$ (one '1' at $s_2$)\n$2^n = 2^2 = 4$.\nMinimum winning skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 4 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nThe range is $[2, 3]$.\nThis matches the example output: $2, 3$.\n\nThis formula seems correct. The logic is that to win the tournament, a team with skill $X$ must be able to defeat $N_1$ opponents by being stronger than them, and $N_0$ opponents by being weaker than them.\nThe $N_1$ \"stronger\" wins mean $X$ must be greater than $N_1$ opponents. Each of these opponents is the winner of a sub-tournament. To guarantee $X$ can be greater than $N_1$ such opponents, $X$ needs to be higher than at least $2^{N_1}-1$ other skills in total (including the opponents' sub-brackets). So $X$ must be at least $2^{N_1}$.\nSimilarly, for the $N_0$ \"weaker\" wins, $X$ must be smaller than $N_0$ opponents. This implies $X$ must be smaller than at least $2^{N_0}-1$ other skills in total. So $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$.\n\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\nAll integers in this range are winning integers.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $N_0$ (number of '0's in $s$) and $N_1$ (number of '1's in $s$).\n4. Calculate $min\\_skill = 2^{N_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_skill = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n6. Print all integers from $min\\_skill$ to $max\\_skill$ inclusive, in ascending order.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    n0_count = s.count('0')\n    n1_count = s.count('1')\n\n    # The minimum winning skill is 2^(number of '1's)\n    min_winning_skill = 2**n1_count\n\n    # The maximum winning skill is 2^n - 2^(number of '0's) + 1\n    max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**n0_count) + 1\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        result.append(str(i))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
