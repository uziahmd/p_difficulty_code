    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Beautiful Multiset Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my immediate focus is figuring out how to construct a beautiful multiset and, more importantly, *count* the ways to do so given specific constraints. The core of the problem lies in the definition of a \"beautiful multiset.\" It boils down to this: for every possible prefix `s` of a binary string, we have a limit `c_s` on how many strings in our multiset can have that prefix.\n\nMy initial thoughts are along the lines of visualizing this as a full binary tree. Each node represents a binary string, and the children of a node are the strings formed by appending '0' and '1' respectively.  The count `count(s)` is essentially the total number of strings in the multiset that descend from the node representing `s`.  We have this crucial constraint: `count(s) <= c_s`.\n\nThe first instinct is to see if this screams max-flow or min-cost max-flow, but the problem's flavor, \"maximum size,\" and the tree structure suggest that a greedy or dynamic programming approach is likely more fruitful.  We need to exploit the relationships between the `c_s` values and the binary tree.\n\nThe constraints on `c_s` are key. If `s` is a prefix of some other string `s'`, then the counts *below* `s` have to be, at most, the limit at `s`.  If we have a string `s`, and its children are `s0` and `s1`, it follows that `c_s >= c_{s0} + c_{s1}` must always hold. This feels important for maximizing the size of the multiset. If that's not true, we're stuck.\n\nSo, to achieve the maximum size, I'm thinking the optimal strategy involves ensuring the constraints on the `c_s` values are satisfied, which translates into these tree-based relationships. This is where I need to focus my thinking to efficiently find and count the combinations that yield a beautiful multiset of size `f`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of $c_s$ values.\nA multiset of binary strings of length exactly $n$ is beautiful if for every binary string $s$ (length $1$ to $n$), the number of strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $x_t$ be the multiplicity of a string $t$ of length $n$ in the multiset. We want to maximize $\\sum_{t \\text{ len } n} x_t$.\nThe condition is $\\sum_{t \\text{ s.t. } s \\text{ is prefix of } t} x_t \\le c_s$.\n\nConsider the binary tree where nodes are binary strings and children of $s$ are $s0$ and $s1$. The leaves are strings of length $n$.\nFor any internal node $s$, the sum of strings starting with $s$ is the sum of strings starting with $s0$ plus the sum of strings starting with $s1$. That is, $\\text{count}(s) = \\text{count}(s0) + \\text{count}(s1)$.\nTo maximize the total number of strings, we should try to make $\\text{count}(s)$ as large as possible.\nThis implies that for any $s$, we must have $\\text{count}(s) \\le c_s$. And also $\\text{count}(s) = \\text{count}(s0) + \\text{count}(s1) \\le c_s$.\nSo, to obtain the maximum possible size, we should choose $x_t$ values greedily.\nFor any leaf string $t$ (length $n$), the maximum value for $x_t$ is $c_t$.\nFor any internal node $s$, the maximum value for $\\text{count}(s)$ is $\\min(c_s, \\text{count}(s0) + \\text{count}(s1))$.\nWorking from leaves up to the root, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the root node (empty string, length 0). Let $S(s)$ be the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nFor a leaf node $s$ (length $n$), $S(s) = c_s$.\nFor an internal node $s$ (length $L < n$), $S(s) = \\min(c_s, S(s0) + S(s1))$.\nThe maximum total size of the multiset is $S(\\text{empty string})$.\nLet $S_L$ denote the maximum possible sum of counts for strings of length $L$.\n$S_n$ is the sum of $c_s$ for all $2^n$ strings $s$ of length $n$.\n$S_{L-1}$ is the sum of $\\min(c_s, S(s0) + S(s1))$ for all $2^{L-1}$ strings $s$ of length $L-1$.\nThis recursive definition is for a single $s$.\nThe maximum total size of the multiset is $S(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string.\n$S(\\epsilon) = \\min(c_\\epsilon, S(0) + S(1))$. (We can define $c_\\epsilon = k$ or some very large number, as there is no $c_s$ for $s=\\epsilon$ explicitly given. However, it's usually implicitly handled by $c_0$ and $c_1$.) The problem statement says \"length from 1 to n\", so $c_0$ and $c_1$ are the first constraints.\nThe actual value is $S(\\epsilon) = S(0) + S(1)$ if we assume $c_\\epsilon$ is infinite.\nThe value $S(s)$ for any string $s$ is effectively $\\min(c_s, \\sum_{t \\text{ descendant of } s, \\text{len } n} c_t)$. This is incorrect.\nThe maximum size is given by the minimum cut in a specific graph, which for this tree structure simplifies to:\n$S(s) = \\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1}, c_{s00} + c_{s01} + c_{s1}, \\dots, \\sum_{t \\text{ descendant of } s, \\text{len } n} c_t)$.\nMore generally, $S(s) = \\min_{s' \\text{ prefix of } t \\text{ descendant of } s} (c_{s'} \\text{ scaled by number of leaves under } s' \\text{ not under } s)$.\nThis is equivalent to $S(s) = \\min(c_s, S(s0)+S(s1))$ where $S(t)$ for length $n$ is $c_t$. This is the standard max flow / min cut for this tree.\nLet $M_s$ be the maximum value $\\text{count}(s)$ can take.\n$M_s = c_s$ if $s$ has length $n$.\n$M_s = \\min(c_s, M_{s0} + M_{s1})$ if $s$ has length $<n$.\nThe total maximum size is $M_\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string. $M_\\epsilon = M_0 + M_1$.\n\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s_0$ of length $L-1$, such that $M_{s_0} = val$.\nThis is a standard DP approach for tree-like problems.\nSince all $2^L$ strings of length $L$ are symmetric, we can compute $dp[L][val]$ for a single string $s$ of length $L$.\n$dp[L][val]$: number of ways to choose $c_s, c_{s0}, c_{s1}, \\dots$ for strings $s'$ that have $s$ as a prefix, such that $M_s = val$.\nBase case: $L=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $M_s = c_s$. So $val$ must be chosen as $c_s$.\nThere is $1$ way to choose $c_s = val$. So $dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$.\nFor $L < n$:\n$M_s = \\min(c_s, M_{s0} + M_{s1})$. We want $M_s = val$.\nThis means $M_{s0} + M_{s1} \\ge val$ and $c_s \\ge val$.\nAlso, if $c_s > val$, then $M_{s0} + M_{s1}$ must be exactly $val$.\nIf $c_s = val$, then $M_{s0} + M_{s1}$ must be $\\ge val$.\n\nLet $P[L+1][sum\\_val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for strings of length $L+1$ to $n$ under $s0$ and $s1$ such that $M_{s0} + M_{s1} = sum\\_val$.\n$P[L+1][sum\\_val] = \\sum_{val_0+val_1=sum\\_val} dp[L+1][val_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][val_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{c_s=val}^k P[L+1][val] + \\sum_{c_s=val+1}^k \\sum_{sum\\_val=val+1}^{2k} P[L+1][sum\\_val] \\text{ (this is wrong)}$\nThe DP transition should be:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{sum\\_val=0}^{2k} P[L+1][sum\\_val] \\cdot (\\text{count ways to choose } c_s \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, sum\\_val)=val)$.\nThis is:\n1. If $sum\\_val = val$: $c_s$ can be any value from $val$ to $k$. There are $k-val+1$ choices for $c_s$.\n2. If $sum\\_val > val$: $c_s$ must be exactly $val$. There is $1$ choice for $c_s$.\n3. If $sum\\_val < val$: This case is impossible, as $\\min(c_s, sum\\_val)$ cannot be $val$.\nSo, $dp[L][val] = (k-val+1) \\cdot P[L+1][val] + \\sum_{sum\\_val=val+1}^{2k} P[L+1][sum\\_val]$.\nThe sum can be computed efficiently using suffix sums. Let $SuffP[L+1][x] = \\sum_{y=x}^{2k} P[L+1][y]$.\nThen $dp[L][val] = (k-val+1) \\cdot P[L+1][val] + SuffP[L+1][val+1]$.\nAll calculations are modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe state space for $val$ goes up to $k$. For $P[L+1][sum\\_val]$, $sum\\_val$ goes up to $2k$.\nThe convolutions can be computed using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform).\n$P[L+1]$ is the convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself.\n$dp[L+1]$ is a polynomial $D_{L+1}(x) = \\sum_{v=0}^k dp[L+1][v] x^v$.\n$P_{L+1}(x) = (D_{L+1}(x))^2 = \\sum_{s=0}^{2k} P[L+1][s] x^s$.\nThe maximum value for $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. $2k$ is $4 \\cdot 10^5$. A polynomial of degree $4 \\cdot 10^5$ needs FFT/NTT.\nThe complexity would be $O(N \\cdot K \\log K)$.\n$N=15, K=2 \\cdot 10^5 \\implies 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nLet's define the DP states carefully.\n$dp[L][val]$: the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ that are descendants of a *single* string $s$ of length $L$, such that $M_s = val$.\nThe length $L$ goes from $n$ down to $1$.\nThe final answer will be $P[1][f]$.\n\nInitialization:\nFor $L=n$: $dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$. All other $dp[n][val]=0$.\nFor $L=n-1$ down to $1$:\n1. Compute $P[L+1]$ from $dp[L+1]$ using NTT.\n   $P[L+1][s] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=s} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$.\n   The maximum $v_0, v_1$ are $k$, so max $s$ is $2k$.\n   Let $D_{L+1}(x) = \\sum_{v=0}^k dp[L+1][v] x^v$.\n   $P_{L+1}(x) = (D_{L+1}(x))^2$.\n2. Compute suffix sums for $P[L+1]$: $SuffP[L+1][x] = \\sum_{y=x}^{2k} P[L+1][y]$.\n3. Compute $dp[L][val]$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$:\n   $dp[L][val] = ((k-val+1) \\cdot P[L+1][val] + SuffP[L+1][val+1]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n   Note: $SuffP[L+1][2k+1]$ should be $0$.\n\nAfter computing $dp[1][val]$ for all $val$, the final answer is $P[1][f]$.\nThis is because $M_\\epsilon = M_0 + M_1$. We want $M_0 + M_1 = f$.\n$P[1][f]$ is $\\sum_{val_0+val_1=f} dp[1][val_0] \\cdot dp[1][val_1]$, which is exactly what we need.\n\nExample $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$L=1$.\nBase case: $dp[1][val]=1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k=42$.\nWe need to calculate $P[1][f]$.\n$P[1][s] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=s} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nSince $dp[1][v]=1$ for $v \\in [0, k]$, this is the number of ways to choose $v_0, v_1 \\in [0, k]$ such that $v_0+v_1=s$.\nFor $s=f=2$:\n$(v_0, v_1)$ can be $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$. All $v_0, v_1$ are in $[0, k]$ since $k=42 \\ge 2$.\nSo $P[1][2] = 3$. This matches the example.\n\nNTT implementation details:\nModulus $M = 998244353$ is a prime number.\nPrimitive root $g = 3$.\nThe length of transform must be a power of 2, say $N_{NTT}$, greater than $2k+1$.\n$2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. Next power of 2 is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nThe arrays for NTT will have size $N_{NTT}$.\nThe coefficients $dp[L][v]$ are up to $k$. The sum $P[L+1][s]$ can be up to $k \\cdot k \\cdot N_{NTT}$, which is $2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^5 \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^{16}$. This fits in a 64-bit integer, but we must take modulo at each step.\n\nLet's trace the values for $dp[L][val]$:\n$dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$.\nMax value of $P[n][s]$ is $s+1$ (for $s \\le k$), $2k-s+1$ (for $s > k$). Max is $k+1$.\n$P[n][s]$ will be at most $k+1 \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$SuffP[n][x]$ can be sum up to $2k$. Max value is $O(k^2)$.\n$dp[n-1][val] = (k-val+1) \\cdot P[n][val] + SuffP[n][val+1]$.\nMax value of $dp[n-1][val]$ is roughly $k \\cdot k + k^2 = O(k^2)$.\n$P[n-1][s]$ is $O((k^2)^2) = O(k^4)$.\n$dp[n-2][val]$ is $O(k \\cdot k^4 + k^5) = O(k^5)$.\nIn general, $dp[L][val]$ is $O(k^{2^{n-L+1}-1})$.\nThe final $P[1][f]$ will be $O(k^{2^n-2})$.\nFor $n=15$, $2^{15}-2$ is a huge power. The values can be very large.\nAll calculations must be modulo $998244353$.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\nWe want to find $M_\\epsilon = f$.\n$M_\\epsilon = M_0 + M_1$.\n$M_s = \\min(c_s, M_{s0} + M_{s1})$.\nThe $dp[L][val]$ counts ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for strings $s'$ under $s$ (including $s$) such that $M_s = val$.\nSo $dp[1][val]$ counts ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$ that are descendants of $0$ (including $0$), such that $M_0 = val$.\nSimilarly for $M_1 = val'$.\nThe total count for $M_0+M_1=f$ is $\\sum_{val+val'=f} dp[1][val] \\cdot dp[1][val']$.\nThis is exactly $P[1][f]$. The logic seems correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function for modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function for modular inverse (a^(-1) % mod)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT function\n# inverse=False for forward NTT, inverse=True for inverse NTT\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):\n        half_len = length // 2\n        root_val = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if inverse:\n            root_val = inv(root_val)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(half_len):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + half_len + k] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + half_len + k] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * root_val) % MOD\n\n    if inverse:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\n# Function to multiply two polynomials using NTT\ndef multiply_polynomials(poly1, poly2):\n    len1 = len(poly1)\n    len2 = len(poly2)\n    \n    # Determine NTT size (next power of 2 greater than or equal to len1 + len2 - 1)\n    ntt_size = 1\n    while ntt_size < len1 + len2 - 1:\n        ntt_size <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials to ntt_size\n    a = list(poly1) + [0] * (ntt_size - len1)\n    b = list(poly2) + [0] * (ntt_size - len2)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    a = ntt(a, False)\n    b = ntt(b, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    c = [(a[i] * b[i]) % MOD for i in range(ntt_size)]\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    c = ntt(c, True)\n    \n    # Resulting polynomial coefficients\n    result_len = len1 + len2 - 1\n    return c[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[val] stores the number of ways for a single string 's' of current length\n    # to have M_s = val.\n    # dp[n][val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= k\n    dp = [1] * (k + 1) # dp[val] for val from 0 to k\n\n    # Iterate from length n-1 down to 1\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # 1.
