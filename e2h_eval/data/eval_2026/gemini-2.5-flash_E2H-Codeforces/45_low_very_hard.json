There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Knockout Tournament Game Maximization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this knockout tournament problem. The core is figuring out how many games the *winner* can play, given this difference-of-games-played rule. Let's break it down.\n\nThe rule's the key: two players only meet if their games-played difference is at most one. It's a constraint, but it's also a building block. I started by thinking about a function, `f(k)`, which would represent the maximum number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games. The ultimate goal is to find the largest `k` where `f(k)` is at least the number of players, `n`.\n\nInitially, I thought, \"Maximize the winner's games by keeping them playing against fresh opponents.\" This is where I defined the naive assumption: If the winner plays `k` games, then at least `k` opponents are required. So I had this simple linear scenario where `f(k) = k + 1`.\n\nBut this \"linear\" approach quickly fell apart. My initial logic of adding players to ensure the winner gets enough games to play was correct but the definition of `f(k)` requires a careful look, as it applies to all games and all players. It's not just the winner's games that matter; the rule governs *every* match in the tournament. Therefore, my assumption was too simplistic. I need to think about how these games build up, how the rule restricts match pairings throughout the tournament.\n\nThe rule about the difference in games played is much more crucial than initially thought. It essentially imposes a structure on the whole tournament, like a kind of branching pattern. To reach the maximum number of games, this constraint must be fully considered and reflected in how I approach the problem. I need to rethink `f(k)` and the structure of the tournament, not just focusing on the winner but the entire \"network\" of games.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given `n` initial players. The crucial rule is: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner plays. We want to find the maximum `k` for a given `n`.\nLet `P(g)` be the minimum number of players required to have a winner who has played `g` games.\nAll players start with 0 games played.\n\n1.  **`g = 0`**: A player who has played 0 games is an initial player. This isn't a winner.\n2.  **`g = 1`**: The winner plays one game.\n    The winner (0 games) plays against one opponent (0 games). `abs(0-0) <= 1`. This is allowed.\n    The winner plays 1 game. Two players are needed. `P(1) = 2`.\n3.  **`g = 2`**: The winner plays two games.\n    The winner first plays a game. Let's say Player W plays Player A. Both have 0 games. W wins. W has 1 game played. A is eliminated.\n    Now W has 1 game played. W needs to play a second game.\n    To maximize `k` for a given `n`, we want to use the minimum number of players `P(g)`.\n    W (1 game) needs to play an opponent. The opponent must have played 0 or 1 game.\n    *   If W plays Player B (0 games): This is allowed. W wins. W has 2 games. Total players: W, A, B. So 3 players. `P(2) = 3`.\n        This simple strategy (winner always plays against a fresh player) gives `k+1` players for `k` games.\n        `P(g) = g+1`.\n        However, the example `n=4` gives `k=2`. If `P(g)=g+1`, then for `n=4`, `k=3`. This suggests `P(g)=g+1` is not always the optimal strategy to minimize players for a given `g`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `P(g)`: the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play `g` games.\nConsider the final game the winner plays (game `g`). The winner (W) has played `g-1` games. W plays against an opponent (O). Let O have played `g_O` games.\nBy the rule, `abs((g-1) - g_O) <= 1`. So, `g_O` must be `g-2`, `g-1`, or `g`.\nSince O is also a winner of previous games, O must have won all `g_O` games.\nTo minimize the total number of players `P(g)`, we should choose `g_O` such that the subtree rooted at O requires the minimum number of players, and the total number of players is minimized.\n\nLet `N(g)` be the minimum number of initial players required for a winner to play `g` games.\nThe winner plays `g` games. This means the winner reaches the final round of their bracket having played `g-1` games.\nIn the final game (game `g`), the winner (W) has played `g-1` games. W plays against an opponent (O).\nThe opponent O must have played `g_O` games, where `g_O` is `g-2`, `g-1`, or `g`.\nSince O is also a winner of their own bracket, O must have played `g_O` games.\nTo minimize `N(g)`, we should pair W with an opponent O such that O has played `g_O` games, and `N(g-1) + N(g_O)` is minimized.\nHowever, `g_O` cannot be `g` because if O played `g` games, then O would be the winner of their own bracket, having played `g` games. If W plays O, then W plays `g` games. This would mean `N(g) = N(g-1) + N(g)`. This doesn't make sense. O must have played fewer games than `g`.\nSo, `g_O` can be `g-1` or `g-2`.\n\nTo minimize `N(g)`:\n1.  W (who has played `g-1` games) plays against O (who has played `g-1` games).\n    This tournament requires `N(g-1)` players for W's side and `N(g-1)` players for O's side.\n    Total players: `N(g-1) + N(g-1) = 2 * N(g-1)`.\n2.  W (who has played `g-1` games) plays against O (who has played `g-2` games).\n    This tournament requires `N(g-1)` players for W's side and `N(g-2)` players for O's side.\n    Total players: `N(g-1) + N(g-2)`.\n\nTo minimize `N(g)`, we should choose the second option: `N(g) = N(g-1) + N(g-2)`. This is because `N(g)` is an increasing sequence, so `N(g-2) < N(g-1)`.\nThis recurrence relation `N(g) = N(g-1) + N(g-2)` with base cases is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet's establish the base cases:\n`N(0)`: A player who has played 0 games. This is an initial player. `N(0) = 1`.\n`N(1)`: A player who plays 1 game. W (0 games) vs O (0 games). W wins.\n    `N(1) = N(0) + N(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    This corresponds to `F_2 = 2` if `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...` or `F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2, F_3 = 3, ...` if `F_0=1, F_1=1`.\n    Let's align `N(g)` with Fibonacci numbers `F_i` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`\n    Then `N(0)` would correspond to a player who has played 0 games, and `N(1)` to a player who has played 1 game.\n    `N(g)` for `g` games played by winner.\n    `N(0) = 1` (an initial player)\n    `N(1) = 2` (W(0) vs O(0), W wins. W played 1 game. Total 2 players)\n    `N(2) = N(1) + N(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` (W(1) vs O(0), W wins. W played 2 games. Total 3 players)\n    `N(3) = N(2) + N(1) = 3 + 2 = 5` (W(2) vs O(1), W wins. W played 3 games. Total 5 players)\n    `N(4) = N(3) + N(2) = 5 + 3 = 8` (W(3) vs O(2), W wins. W played 4 games. Total 8 players)\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` corresponds to Fibonacci numbers `F_k` where `N(g) = F_{g+2}`.\n(Using `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`)\nSo, `N(g) = F_{g+2}` gives the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `g` games.\n\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `g` such that `N(g) <= n`.\nThis means we need to find the largest `g` such that `F_{g+2} <= n`.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n`n = 2`: `F_3 = 2`. `g+2 = 3 => g = 1`. Maximum games for winner is 1. Correct.\n`n = 3`: `F_4 = 3`. `g+2 = 4 => g = 2`. Maximum games for winner is 2. Correct.\n`n = 4`: `F_4 = 3`, `F_5 = 5`. Since `F_4 <= 4 < F_5`, the maximum `g` is 2. Correct.\n`n = 10`: `F_6 = 8`, `F_7 = 13`. Since `F_6 <= 10 < F_7`, the maximum `g` is 4. Correct.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the largest `k` such that `F_k <= n` and then outputting `k-2`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1`, `b = 2` (representing `F_2` and `F_3` in the `F_0=0, F_1=1` sequence, or `N(0)` and `N(1)`).\n2. Initialize `k = 1` (representing `g` for `N(g)`).\n3. Loop:\n   While `b <= n`:\n     `temp = b`\n     `b = a + b`\n     `a = temp`\n     `k = k + 1`\n4. The loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, `a` holds `F_{k+1}` (or `N(k-1)` if `k` is the number of games) and `b` holds `F_{k+2}` (or `N(k)`). The previous `k` (before the last increment) was the largest `g` such that `N(g) <= n`.\n   So, the result is `k`.\n\nLet's trace `n=10`:\nInitial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `k=1`\n1. `b=2 <= 10`: `temp=2`, `b=1+2=3`, `a=2`, `k=2`\n2. `b=3 <= 10`: `temp=3`, `b=2+3=5`, `a=3`, `k=3`\n3. `b=5 <= 10`: `temp=5`, `b=3+5=8`, `a=5`, `k=4`\n4. `b=8 <= 10`: `temp=8`, `b=5+8=13`, `a=8`, `k=5`\n5. `b=13 > 10`: Loop terminates.\nThe final `k` is 5. This means `N(5)` would be 13, so `N(4)` (which is `a=8`) is the largest `N(g)` less than or equal to `n`.\nThe `k` we output is the number of games played.\nThe loop `k` corresponds to `g`.\nWhen `b=13` and `a=8`, `k=5`. This means `N(5)=13`. The previous `N(4)=8`. So for `n=10`, the max games is 4.\nThe `k` variable in my trace is `g+1`. So if the final `k` is 5, the answer is `k-1 = 4`.\n\nLet's re-align the variables:\n`fib_prev = 1` (corresponds to `N(0)`)\n`fib_curr = 2` (corresponds to `N(1)`)\n`games_played = 1` (corresponds to `g` for `N(g)`)\n\nLoop:\nWhile `fib_curr <= n`:\n  `next_fib = fib_prev + fib_curr`\n  `fib_prev = fib_curr`\n  `fib_curr = next_fib`\n  `games_played = games_played + 1`\n\nAfter the loop, `games_played` will be the value for which `N(games_played)` is the first Fibonacci number greater than `n`.\nSo the answer is `games_played - 1`.\n\nTrace `n=10`:\nInitial: `fib_prev=1`, `fib_curr=2`, `games_played=1`\n1. `fib_curr=2 <= 10`: `next_fib=1+2=3`, `fib_prev=2`, `fib_curr=3`, `games_played=2`\n2. `fib_curr=3 <= 10`: `next_fib=2+3=5`, `fib_prev=3`, `fib_curr=5`, `games_played=3`\n3. `fib_curr=5 <= 10`: `next_fib=3+5=8`, `fib_prev=5`, `fib_curr=8`, `games_played=4`\n4. `fib_curr=8 <= 10`: `next_fib=5+8=13`, `fib_prev=8`, `fib_curr=13`, `games_played=5`\n5. `fib_curr=13 > 10`: Loop terminates.\nResult: `games_played - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. Correct.\n\nThis approach works for `n >= 2`.\nThe number of Fibonacci numbers up to `10^18` is small (around 90). So this will be very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for N(g) - minimum players for winner to play g games\n    # N(0) = 1 (a single player, hasn't played yet)\n    # N(1) = 2 (winner plays 1 game, needs 2 players: W(0) vs O(0))\n    # N(g) = N(g-1) + N(g-2) for g >= 2\n\n    # Let's use variables to store N(g-1) and N(g)\n    # fib_prev stores N(g-1)\n    # fib_curr stores N(g)\n    # games_played stores g\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Initial state: fib_prev = N(1) = 2, fib_curr = N(2) = 3\n    # This means games_played = 2.\n    # N(0) = 1\n    # N(1) = 2\n    # N(2) = 3\n    # N(3) = 5\n    # N(4) = 8\n    \n    # We want to find the largest 'g' such that N(g) <= n.\n    \n    # Initialize with N(1) and N(2)\n    fib_prev = 2 # Corresponds to N(1)\n    fib_curr = 3 # Corresponds to N(2)\n    games_played = 2 # Corresponds to the 'g' for fib_curr (N(g))\n\n    # Loop to find the largest g such that N(g) <= n\n    while fib_curr <= n:\n        next_fib = fib_prev + fib_curr\n        fib_prev = fib_curr\n        fib_curr = next_fib\n        games_played += 1\n    \n    # After the loop, fib_curr is the first N(g) that is > n.\n    # So, fib_prev is the largest N(g') that is <= n.\n    # The corresponding games_played for fib_prev is (games_played - 1).\n    print(games_played - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
