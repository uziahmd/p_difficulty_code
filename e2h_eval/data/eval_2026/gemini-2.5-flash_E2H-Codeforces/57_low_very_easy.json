His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Olympiad Ranking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad ranking problem. I've got `n` participants, and I need to figure out the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya. The tricky part is that I don't know which score from the first tour (`a`) corresponds to which score from the second tour (`b`). All I know is that Vasya's total score is at least `x`.\n\nThe key constraint here is that the total scores determine the ranking, and ties are resolved arbitrarily.  I need to use the fact that Vasya's total score is at least *x* to my advantage.\n\n**Maximizing and Minimizing Scores**\n\nTo find the best rank, I need to maximize Vasya's total score while minimizing everyone else's. The crucial piece of information is that *Vasya's* score is at least `x`. This limits how big a score I can make for Vasya, since all the scores in *a* and *b* are accounted for. So, I have to find a combination where Vasya can get as high as possible, *while still being a valid configuration for other participants* based on the given *a* and *b* scores.\n\nThis leads me to think about it as a matching problem. I need to strategically pair scores from *a* and *b* to determine the total scores for each participant, including Vasya. To get the best rank, I want Vasya to be at the top of the total scores, given the constraints.  So, I need to consider assignments that let Vasya's total score be as high as possible, given that Vasya's score is >= *x*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given the individual tour scores of all participants and the fact that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The key challenge is that we don't know which specific first tour score belongs to which specific second tour score, nor do we know which pair belongs to Vasya.\n\nParticipants are ranked by their total points (sum of tour 1 and tour 2). Higher points mean a better rank. If multiple participants have the same total points, their relative ranks can be assigned arbitrarily by the jury. This means if `P` participants have strictly more points than Vasya, and `K` participants (including Vasya) have the same total points as Vasya, Vasya's rank can be anywhere from `P + 1` (best case among those with same points) to `P + K` (worst case among those with same points).\n\nLet `n` be the number of participants, `x` be the minimum total points Vasya earned. Let `a` be the list of first tour scores and `b` be the list of second tour scores.\n\n**1. Finding the Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo achieve the best rank (rank 1), Vasya wants to maximize his total score while minimizing the scores of all other participants.\nThe best possible total score Vasya could have achieved is `max(a) + max(b)`. However, we cannot simply assign `max(a)` and `max(b)` to Vasya and then assign the remaining scores arbitrarily. The scores must be paired up.\nTo maximize Vasya's score, Vasya should take the highest possible score from `a` and the highest possible score from `b`.\nSo, Vasya's best possible score is `A_max + B_max`, where `A_max` is the largest score in `a` and `B_max` is the largest score in `b`.\nSince Vasya's score is guaranteed to be at least `x`, we must ensure `A_max + B_max >= x`. If it's less than `x`, this scenario is invalid, but the problem guarantees that there exists `i, j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. So, `A_max + B_max` will always be a valid score for Vasya.\nTo make Vasya rank 1, we assume he gets `max(a) + max(b)`. For everyone else, we try to minimize their scores. The minimum possible score for any other participant is `min(a) + min(b)`.\nIf Vasya gets `max(a) + max(b)`, then he will be the absolute winner (rank 1) unless some other participant could also achieve `max(a) + max(b)`. But this is not possible if `max(a)` and `max(b)` are unique. If there are multiple `max(a)` or `max(b)` values, it's more complex.\nHowever, the problem statement \"the first place has the participant who has got the most points\" and \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice\" implies that if Vasya can achieve the highest total score, he can get rank 1.\nThe maximum possible score for any participant is `max(a) + max(b)`. If Vasya achieves this score, he can be assigned rank 1 by the jury.\nThus, Vasya's best possible rank is **1**.\n\n**2. Finding the Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we want to:\na. Minimize Vasya's total score, subject to `Vasya_score >= x`.\nb. Maximize the scores of other participants, especially those who can score more than Vasya.\nc. If others have the same score as Vasya, assume the jury places Vasya last among them.\n\nLet's sort both `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n`a_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`b_sorted = sorted(b)`\n\nConsider the pairings `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This pairing strategy attempts to pair the smallest `a` with the largest `b`, the second smallest `a` with the second largest `b`, and so on. This specific pairing strategy is known to maximize the minimum sum, or minimize the maximum sum, depending on the context. In our case, it tends to create sums that are \"middle-ground\" or \"balanced\".\n\nLet's calculate the total score for each participant under this pairing: `P_i = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[n-1-i]`.\nThe set of all possible total scores for participants is `{P_0, P_1, ..., P_{n-1}}`.\nVasya is one of these participants. We know Vasya's score `S_V` must be at least `x`.\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we assume he gets the smallest possible score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\nSo, we find the minimum `P_i` from the calculated sums `P_0, ..., P_{n-1}` that is greater than or equal to `x`. Let this be `min_vasya_score`.\n`min_vasya_score = min(p for p in P if p >= x)`\n\nNow, we count how many participants could possibly score strictly more than `min_vasya_score`.\nAnd we count how many participants could possibly score exactly `min_vasya_score`.\nThese counts are directly available from the `P` array:\n`count_greater = sum(1 for p in P if p > min_vasya_score)`\n`count_equal = sum(1 for p in P if p == min_vasya_score)`\n\nVasya's worst rank would be `count_greater + count_equal`. This is because all `count_greater` participants will be ranked above Vasya. Among the `count_equal` participants (including Vasya), the jury can place Vasya last.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n1. **Sort `a` and `b`:**\n   `a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n   `b_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n2. **Pair `a_sorted[i]` with `b_sorted[n-1-i]`:**\n   `P_0 = a_sorted[0] + b_sorted[5] = 3 + 8 = 11`\n   `P_1 = a_sorted[1] + b_sorted[4] = 4 + 6 = 10`\n   `P_2 = a_sorted[2] + b_sorted[3] = 4 + 4 = 8`\n   `P_3 = a_sorted[3] + b_sorted[2] = 4 + 4 = 8`\n   `P_4 = a_sorted[4] + b_sorted[1] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n   `P_5 = a_sorted[5] + b_sorted[0] = 6 + 0 = 6`\n   The list of possible total scores `P = [11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`.\n\n3. **Find `min_vasya_score` (smallest score in `P` that is `>= x`):**\n   `x = 7`.\n   Scores in `P` that are `>= 7`: `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8]`.\n   `min_vasya_score = 8`.\n\n4. **Calculate `count_greater` and `count_equal`:**\n   Scores strictly greater than `min_vasya_score=8`: `[11, 10]`. So, `count_greater = 2`.\n   Scores equal to `min_vasya_score=8`: `[8, 8, 8]`. So, `count_equal = 3`.\n\n5. **Worst rank:** `count_greater + count_equal = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n\nSo, the best rank is 1, and the worst rank is 5.\n\nThis greedy strategy (sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending, then pairing them) is optimal for finding a configuration that allows Vasya to achieve a score `S_V >= x` while minimizing `S_V`, and also for determining the scores of other participants in a way that maximizes their advantage over Vasya. This is because by pairing the smallest `a_i` with largest `b_j` etc., we create a specific set of `n` sums. If Vasya's score is chosen as the minimum possible `S_V >= x` from this set, then any other participant with a score `S_k > S_V` will definitely be ranked higher. If `S_k = S_V`, they can also be ranked higher.\n\n**Final Answer Structure:**\nPrint `1` (for best rank) and `worst_rank` (calculated as above).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can achieve the highest possible score (max(a) + max(b))\n    # and be assigned rank 1 by the jury.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst possible rank for Vasya\n    # Sort 'a' in ascending order\n    a.sort()\n    # Sort 'b' in descending order\n    b.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Calculate the sum of points for each participant under this pairing\n    # This specific pairing (smallest a with largest b, etc.)\n    # creates a set of sums that allows us to determine the worst case for Vasya.\n    # Vasya will take the lowest possible score >= x from this set.\n    # The other participants will take the remaining scores.\n    # This pairing strategy helps to \"balance\" the scores, making it\n    # easier to determine ranks.\n    \n    # Calculate all possible total scores for the n participants\n    # using the sorted lists.\n    # Example: a=[1,2,3], b=[6,5,4] -> sums: 1+6=7, 2+5=7, 3+4=7\n    # Example: a=[1,1,1], b=[1,1,1] -> sums: 1+1=2, 1+1=2, 1+1=2\n    # Example: a=[4,3,5,6,4,4], b=[8,6,0,4,3,4]\n    # a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]\n    # b_sorted = [8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0] (reversed)\n    # sums = [3+8, 4+6, 4+4, 4+4, 5+3, 6+0] = [11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]\n    \n    participant_scores = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        participant_scores.append(a[i] + b[i])\n    \n    # We need to find the smallest score Vasya could have,\n    # such that his score is at least x.\n    # This score must be one of the `participant_scores` determined above.\n    # The problem guarantees that such a score exists.\n    \n    vasya_min_valid_score = float('inf')\n    for score in participant_scores:\n        if score >= x:\n            vasya_min_valid_score = min(vasya_min_valid_score, score)\n            \n    # Now, count how many participants could score strictly more than Vasya,\n    # and how many could score the same as Vasya.\n    # Vasya's worst rank will be (count of those scoring more) + (count of those scoring same).\n    \n    worst_rank = 0\n    for score in participant_scores:\n        if score > vasya_min_valid_score:\n            worst_rank += 1\n        elif score == vasya_min_valid_score:\n            worst_rank += 1\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
