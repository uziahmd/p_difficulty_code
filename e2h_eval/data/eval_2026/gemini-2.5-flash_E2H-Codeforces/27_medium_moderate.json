On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Optimizing LNDS Calculation for a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving finding the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a segment of a sequence containing only 1s and 2s. The sequence's length is up to 2000, which means an O(N^3) solution is out of the question, and I'm aiming for O(N^2).\n\nMy first thought was to iterate through all possible segments [l, r], reverse them, and then compute the LNDS of the resulting sequence. The LNDS of a sequence of 1s and 2s will be in the form of `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`, so it involves finding the maximum number of ones followed by the maximum number of twos. Calculating this LNDS directly for each reversal seems to be `O(N)` for each reverse and then a nested loop over each element.\n\nI started thinking about how the reversals change the structure of the subsequence. A non-decreasing sequence will select 1s and then 2s. Prefix sums for 1s and 2s came to mind, and prefix and suffix sums came to mind to compute the counts.\n\nPre-computing prefix and suffix sums for 1s and 2s seems efficient. I could then think about the modified array b, which involves the reversals. The sequence b is `a[1...l-1]` followed by `reverse(a[l...r])` followed by `a[r+1...n]`.  I realized I need to optimize this part to avoid recomputing it each time. My initial idea was to determine how the LNDS could use different sections of this modified array b.\n\nI was trying to use a fixed split point where I take all ones from the first part, then twos from the last part, but computing the total count of 1s and 2s, but this wouldn't work. The order of the elements matter here.\n\nThe key insight is that the optimal subsequence is the one that has the largest number of prefix 1s and suffix 2s after any point. Since, elements only being 1 and 2, the optimal LNDS means that all the 1s must come before the 2s, and the split point k is important. For the array `b`, this still meant an `O(N)` calculation for each `l` and `r` pair, which, again, would lead to `O(N^3)`.\n\nMy attention then turned to a cleverer counting approach that exploits the 1s and 2s constraint. The goal, as always, is to reduce computational complexity. I realize I want to take the 1s from the array until I'm out of them, and then I want to take all of the 2s from the array. This leads to the splitting point `k`. It seemed like the calculations remained complex.\n\nNow, let's fix l, r and split by k to find the number of 1s and 2s.\nHere is where I started to realize I needed the pre-computed arrays.\nI decided to precompute `prefix_ones[i]`, `prefix_twos[i]`, `suffix_ones[i]`, `suffix_twos[i]`, but still it wasn't clear how to use them with the reversed interval.\n\nI was stuck with the k-split-point technique. It appeared to have too much going on in terms of calculations. I tried fixing the `l` and `r` and focusing on the split points within the reversed segment to minimize the computations. I realized I was making it more complex and went back to simpler counting techniques using the prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nI was stuck and tried different approaches and, eventually, a new concept emerged:\n\nNow, for a fixed i and j which represent the start and end of the reversed interval, consider the number of ones that could be included. \nNow the idea becomes: `max_term = max_{idx in [i, j+1]} (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx])`.\nIt seems this calculation could be done in `O(N)`. This requires the precomputed values.\n\nI realized with this approach, I now have an `O(N^2)` solution.\nI can then focus on implementing the program.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a sequence `a` of 1s and 2s, after reversing exactly one chosen subsegment `a[l...r]`. The length `n` of the sequence `a` is up to 2000.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. Its length is the total number of 1s followed by the total number of 2s. To maximize this length, we can choose a \"split point\" `k` (an index from `0` to `n`). All 1s in the LNDS must come from indices `0` to `k-1`, and all 2s in the LNDS must come from indices `k` to `n-1`. The maximum LNDS for a given sequence `b` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_ones(b[0...k-1]) + count_twos(b[k...n-1]))`.\n\nLet the original sequence be `a` (0-indexed, `a[0...n-1]`).\nWe need to iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (0-indexed, `0 <= l <= r < n`). There are `O(N^2)` such pairs. For each pair `(l, r)`, we form a new sequence `b` by reversing `a[l...r]`. Then we compute the LNDS of `b`. A naive computation of LNDS takes `O(N)` time, leading to an `O(N^3)` overall solution, which is too slow for `N=2000`. We need an `O(N^2)` solution.\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for counts of 1s and 2s:\n`prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]` (for `i` from `0` to `n`)\n`prefix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]` (for `i` from `0` to `n`)\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe sequence `b` is `a[0...l-1]` followed by `reverse(a[l...r])` followed by `a[r+1...n-1]`.\nLet's denote `a_rev` as `reverse(a[l...r])`.\n\nWe want to maximize `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])` over all `k` from `0` to `n`.\nThe split point `k` can be in three regions:\n1. `k <= l`: The split point is before or at the start of the reversed segment.\n   `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = prefix_ones[k]`\n   `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = (prefix_twos[l] - prefix_twos[k]) + (prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (total 2s in a[r+1...n-1])`\n   This simplifies to `prefix_ones[k] + (total 2s in a) - prefix_twos[k]`.\n   More precisely, it's `prefix_ones[k] + (count of 2s in a[k...n-1])`. This is the LNDS of the *original* sequence `a` for split point `k`.\n   The maximum for `k <= l` is `max_{0 <= k <= l} (prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]))`.\n\n2. `k > r`: The split point is after the reversed segment.\n   `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]) + (prefix_ones[k] - prefix_ones[r+1])`\n   This simplifies to `prefix_ones[k]`.\n   `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = (total 2s in a[k...n-1])`.\n   Again, this is `prefix_ones[k] + (count of 2s in a[k...n-1])`, which is the LNDS of the original sequence `a` for split point `k`.\n   The maximum for `k > r` is `max_{r < k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]))`.\n\n3. `l < k <= r+1`: The split point is within or immediately after the reversed segment `a_rev`.\n   Let `k_prime = k - l`. This `k_prime` is the split point within `a_rev`.\n   `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (count of 1s in a_rev[0...k_prime-1])`\n   `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = (count of 2s in a_rev[k_prime...r-l]) + (count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1])`\n\n   The elements `a_rev[0...k_prime-1]` correspond to `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[r-(k_prime-1)]` in the original array.\n   The count of 1s in this segment is `prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-k_prime+1]`.\n   The elements `a_rev[k_prime...r-l]` correspond to `a[r-k_prime], ..., a[l]` in the original array.\n   The count of 2s in this segment is `prefix_twos[r-k_prime+1] - prefix_twos[l]`.\n\n   So, for `l < k <= r+1` (which means `0 < k_prime <= r-l+1`):\n   The LNDS contribution is:\n   `prefix_ones[l]`\n   `+ (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-k_prime+1])`  (1s from reversed segment's prefix)\n   `+ (prefix_twos[r-k_prime+1] - prefix_twos[l])`    (2s from reversed segment's suffix)\n   `+ (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])`             (2s from original segment's suffix)\n\n   Let `idx = r-k_prime+1`. As `k_prime` goes from `1` to `r-l+1`, `idx` goes from `r` down to `l`.\n   The expression becomes:\n   `prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[idx]) + (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])`\n   Rearranging terms:\n   `(prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + prefix_twos[n] + (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx])`\n\n   For fixed `l` and `r`, the terms `(prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l])`, `(prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1])`, and `prefix_twos[n]` are constants.\n   We need to maximize `(prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx])` for `idx` in `[l, r]`.\n\nCombining all three cases:\nThe overall maximum LNDS will be `max_{0 <= l <= r < n} (  max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_ones(b[0...k-1]) + count_twos(b[k...n-1]))  )`.\n\nLet `max_val` be the maximum LNDS found so far, initialized to 0.\nThe total number of 1s in `a` is `prefix_ones[n]`.\nThe total number of 2s in `a` is `prefix_twos[n]`.\n\nIterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n    `current_max_lnds_for_lr = 0`\n\n    # Case 1 & 2: Split point outside [l, r+1]\n    # This is equivalent to LNDS of original array for split points k <= l or k > r.\n    # We can handle this by considering the reversed segment as an identity operation.\n    # It's actually easier to compute the LNDS for the modified array directly.\n    # The crucial observation is that the maximum `prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx]` for `idx` in `[l, r]`\n    # is the only thing that changes when `l` and `r` change.\n    # The LNDS for the modified array `b` is:\n    # `prefix_ones[l]` (1s before `l`)\n    # `+ (total 2s in a) - prefix_twos[r+1]` (2s after `r`)\n    # `+ max_{idx in [l, r+1]} ( (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[idx]) + (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_twos[l]) )`\n    # Let `P1_before_l = prefix_ones[l]`\n    # Let `P2_after_r = prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]`\n    # The term to maximize for `idx` in `[l, r+1]` is `(prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[idx]) + (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_twos[l])`.\n    # This can be rewritten as `(prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx])`.\n    # Let `max_diff_val = -infinity`.\n    # For `idx` from `l` to `r`:\n    #   `max_diff_val = max(max_diff_val, prefix_twos[idx] - prefix_ones[idx])`\n    # `current_lnds = P1_before_l + P2_after_r + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + max_diff_val`\n\n    # A simpler formulation:\n    # Iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`.\n    #   Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n    #     `current_lnds = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])` # 1s before l, 2s after r\n    #     `# Now consider the reversed segment a[l...r]`\n    #     `# We want to find a split point `p` within `[l, r]` (inclusive of `l`, exclusive of `r+1`)\n    #     `# such that `1s_from_reversed_prefix + 2s_from_reversed_suffix` is maximized.`\n    #     `# The original indices for reversed segment `a[l...r]` are `l, l+1, ..., r`.\n    #     `# The reversed segment is `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\n    #     `# A split point `p` in `[l, r]` means we take `1s` from `a[r], ..., a[p]` and `2s` from `a[p-1], ..., a[l]`.\n    #     `# (Note: This is `p` as an *original* index within `[l, r]`.
