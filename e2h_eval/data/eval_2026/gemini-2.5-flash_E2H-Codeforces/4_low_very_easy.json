The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Losses in a Cyclic Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between Nikephoros and Polycarpus. My goal is to figure out the number of losses for each player over a given number of rounds. The key here is that they both use cyclic strategies – their moves repeat in a fixed sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Standard Rock-Paper-Scissors: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Draws happen when they choose the same item. A loss means a red spot. No problem there.\n\nNikephoros has a sequence 'A' and Polycarpus has a sequence 'B'.  Their lengths are 'm' and 'k', respectively.  The input will give me the total rounds 'n', and the sequences 'A' and 'B'. I need to output the losses for each.\n\nThe cyclic nature is the crucial part. Since the sequences repeat, the pattern of wins and losses will also repeat.  The cycle length is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the sequences, LCM(m,k). Let's call this cycle length 'L'.\n\nNow, within a full cycle of 'L' rounds, I need to figure out how many losses each player has.  This boils down to iterating through this cycle and counting them. I'll need a helper function to determine the winner of each round based on the moves.\n\nOnce I have the losses within one cycle, I can easily calculate the total losses. I divide the total rounds 'n' by the cycle length 'L' to get the number of full cycles. Multiply the cycle losses by this number. Then, I need to handle the remaining rounds – the part that doesn't form a complete cycle. I'll iterate through these remaining rounds and count their losses as well. Finally, I'll sum the losses from complete cycles and the remaining rounds to get the total losses for each player.\n\nHere's the plan: First, read the input values: total rounds (n), and sequences A and B, along with their lengths m and k. Then I'll write a function 'get_winner(move_N, move_P)' to compare moves and return the winner (-1 for Polycarpus, 1 for Nikephoros, or 0 for a draw). Next, I need to calculate the LCM and its components. Finally, I’ll iterate through and count accordingly, using the LCM to break down the calculation into manageable chunks.\n",
