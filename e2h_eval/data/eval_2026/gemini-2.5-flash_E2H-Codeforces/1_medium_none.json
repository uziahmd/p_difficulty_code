    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got a problem where we need to figure out the total number of \"gilded\" cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` and `h` (width and height), and there are `k` \"rings\" of gilded cells. Each ring is essentially a border around a shrinking rectangle within the plate. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The important detail here is the rings are 1 cell wide, and there's a non-gilded gap between each ring, which is 1 cell wide.\n\n**Formulating the Core Calculation**\n\nThe main challenge is calculating the number of border cells in each ring. A rectangle with dimensions `W x H` has `2W + 2H - 4` border cells, but that's only when `W` and `H` are at least 2. We'll need to be mindful of edge cases where one or both dimensions might become 1 during our loop.\n\nA simpler approach to calculate border cells:\n* Total cells: `W * H`\n* Inner cells: `(W - 2) * (H - 2)` (if W, H >= 2)\n* Border cells:  `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`.\n\nHowever, the inner cells calculation breaks down when we deal with a single-cell row or column (`W` or `H` is 1). So, We need `W * H - max(0, W - 2) * max(0, H - 2)`.\n\n**Optimization and Constraint Analysis**\n\nA neat simplification emerges due to the constraint on `k`. The constraint `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is key. When dealing with the dimensions for each ring (`w_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `h_i = h - 4(i - 1)`), this constraint *guarantees* that the minimum dimension of *any* ring will always be at least 3. This means we can *always* use the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` to accurately calculate the number of border cells in each ring. This avoids any messy `W` or `H` equals 1 situations!\n\n**The Algorithm and Code**\n\nHere’s the plan:\n1.  Read `w`, `h`, and `k` as input.\n2.  Initialize a variable `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n3.  Loop from `i = 0` to `k - 1` (using a 0-indexed loop for convenience).\n4.  Inside the loop, calculate `current_w = w - 4 * i` and `current_h = h - 4 * i`.\n5.  Calculate `cells_in_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n6.  Add `cells_in_ring` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n7.  Print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\nThe loop will run at most 25 times because `k` can be at most 25 according to the constraint. This fits within standard integer ranges. Each iteration's calculations are simple arithmetic and efficient. The logic is now well-established, and the edge cases are neatly handled because of the problem constraint.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` by `h` cells. There are `k` gilded rings. The `i`-th ring (1-indexed) is defined by the border cells of an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's analyze the dimensions of the rectangle for each ring:\n- For the 1st ring (`i=1`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(1 - 1)) x (h - 4(1 - 1)) = w x h`. This is the outermost ring.\n- For the 2nd ring (`i=2`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(2 - 1)) x (h - 4(2 - 1)) = (w - 4) x (h - 4)`.\n- In general, for the `i`-th ring, let `current_w = w - 4(i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4(i - 1)`.\n\nThe number of cells in a single ring is the number of border cells of its corresponding rectangle. For a rectangle of size `W x H`, the number of border cells is given by the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`, provided that `W >= 2` and `H >= 2`. If `W=1` or `H=1`, the formula needs adjustment.\n\nHowever, the problem provides a crucial constraint on `k`: `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.\nLet `min_dim = min(w, h)`. The constraint implies `k <= (min_dim + 1) / 4`.\nThis means `4k <= min_dim + 1`.\nWe want to find the minimum possible dimension for any ring. This occurs for the `k`-th ring.\nFor the `k`-th ring, the smallest dimension will be `min_dim_k = min_dim - 4(k - 1)`.\nFrom `4k <= min_dim + 1`, we can write `4(k - 1) + 4 <= min_dim + 1`, which simplifies to `4(k - 1) <= min_dim - 3`.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for `min_dim_k`:\n`min_dim_k = min_dim - 4(k - 1) >= min_dim - (min_dim - 3) = 3`.\nThis means that for every ring from `i=1` to `k`, both `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 3.\nTherefore, we can safely use the formula `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4` to calculate the number of cells for each ring.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells will be the sum of cells for all `k` rings.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read the input values `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n3. Loop `i` from `0` to `k - 1` (this `i` corresponds to `ring_number - 1` in the problem description).\n   a. Calculate the current width: `current_w = w - 4 * i`.\n   b. Calculate the current height: `current_h = h - 4 * i`.\n   c. Calculate the cells in the current ring: `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n   d. Add `cells_in_current_ring` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n4. Print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (7 9 2):**\n- `w = 7`, `h = 9`, `k = 2`\n- `total_gilded_cells = 0`\n\n- **For `i = 0` (1st ring):**\n  - `current_w = 7 - 4 * 0 = 7`\n  - `current_h = 9 - 4 * 0 = 9`\n  - `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n  - `total_gilded_cells = 28`\n\n- **For `i = 1` (2nd ring):**\n  - `current_w = 7 - 4 * 1 = 3`\n  - `current_h = 9 - 4 * 1 = 5`\n  - `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n  - `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n\n- Final result: `40`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles all examples and adheres to the problem constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read w, h, and k from a single line of input\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each ring from 1 to k.\n    # We use a 0-indexed loop variable 'i' from 0 to k-1,\n    # where 'i' corresponds to (ring_number - 1) in the problem's formula.\n    for i in range(k):\n        # Calculate the current width and height for the rectangle defining the i-th ring.\n        # The offset is 4 * (ring_number - 1), which is 4 * i for our 0-indexed 'i'.\n        current_w = w - 4 * i\n        current_h = h - 4 * i\n\n        # As established from the problem constraints on k,\n        # current_w and current_h will always be at least 3.\n        # Therefore, the number of border cells for a rectangle of size current_w x current_h\n        # can be robustly calculated using the perimeter formula: 2 * W + 2 * H - 4.\n        cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        # Add the cells of the current ring to the total.\n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_current_ring\n    \n    # Print the final total number of gilded cells.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_gilded_cells) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program.\nsolve()\n\n```",
