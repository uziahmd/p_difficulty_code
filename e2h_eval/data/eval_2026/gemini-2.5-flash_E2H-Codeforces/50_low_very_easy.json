    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Good\" Tree Problem: Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this competitive programming challenge. The core of the problem is finding the sum of distances from vertex 1 to vertex *n* across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. The definition of a \"good\" tree is key: it's an *n*-vertex tree where each edge weight is either +1 or -1, and for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges equals -1.\n\nMy first thought is to understand this \"good\" condition.  If we consider the product of these conditions across all vertices, a pattern emerges.  The product of all the vertex-specific products must equal (-1)^*n*.  However, each edge's weight appears twice in this overall product (once for each endpoint), and the square of an edge weight (+1 or -1) is always 1. Thus, we have the constraint: 1 = (-1)^*n*.  This means that for a \"good\" tree to even exist, *n* has to be even!  If *n* is odd, the whole premise falls apart, and the sum of distances is 0. This matches the example for n=1 (d(1,1)=0).\n\nNow, assuming *n* is even, the question becomes how many ways can we assign the weights to the edges such that the \"good\" condition is met? I realize we have a set of *n* equations (one per vertex), but these are not truly independent. The overall product argument shows that satisfying *n-1* of these equations automatically guarantees that the *n*-th is also satisfied (since we are assuming n is even).\n\nSo, my thought process shifts towards assigning edge weights. I need to determine how the freedom in assigning edge weights affects the final \"good\" tree structure. Let's fix the structure of the tree. There are $n^{n-2}$ possible tree structures based on Cayley's formula. We can freely assign $n-1$ edge weights.  Knowing this, the final step is to determine the methodology used to calculate $d(1,n)$ for each \"good\" tree.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1,n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nAn edge-weighted tree has $n$ vertices, and each edge weight is either $1$ or $-1$.\nA tree is \"good\" if for each vertex $i$, the product of the weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n$d(u,v)$ is the sum of weights of edges on the unique path from $u$ to $v$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for a \"good\" tree. For each vertex $i$, let $P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i,j) = -1$.\nConsider the product of $P_i$ over all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n P_i = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nOn the other hand, each edge $(u,v)$ contributes $w(u,v)$ to $P_u$ and $w(u,v)$ to $P_v$. So, $w(u,v)^2$ appears in the product $\\prod P_i$. Since $w(u,v) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $w(u,v)^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, $\\prod_{i=1}^n P_i = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} w(u,v)^2 = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} 1 = 1$.\nCombining these, we must have $1 = (-1)^n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, so the sum of $d(1,n)$ is $0$. This handles the $n=1$ case.\n\nNow, assume $n$ is even.\nFor any given tree structure, how many ways are there to assign weights to make it good?\nThere are $n-1$ edges. The $n$ conditions $P_i = -1$ are not independent; if $n-1$ conditions are met, the $n$-th is automatically met.\nWe can pick an arbitrary vertex, say $n$. For all other $n-1$ vertices $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, we set the condition $P_i = -1$.\nFor any edge $(u,v)$, we can express $w(u,v)$ in terms of other weights if $u$ or $v$ is a leaf, or by fixing an arbitrary root.\nConsider rooting the tree at vertex $n$. For any edge $(u,v)$ where $v$ is the parent of $u$, we can determine $w(u,v)$ based on $P_u$ and the weights of other edges incident to $u$.\nSpecifically, $w(u,v) = P_u \\cdot \\prod_{(u,k) \\in E, k \\neq v} w(u,k)$.\nWe can traverse the tree from leaves towards the root $n$. For each vertex $u \\neq n$, we can determine the weight of the edge connecting $u$ to its parent, say $(u, \\text{parent}(u))$, using $P_u = -1$ and the weights of edges connecting $u$ to its children. This works as long as we process children before parents.\nThis means we can freely choose weights for $n-2$ edges (e.g., all edges except those incident to $n$), and then the weights of the edges incident to $n$ are determined by the $P_i=-1$ conditions for $i \\neq n$.\nNo, this is not quite right.\nWe can choose $n-1$ edges. Pick an arbitrary spanning tree. For $n-1$ edges, we can assign weights. For example, for any $n-1$ edges, except one specific edge $(u,v)$, we can assign weights. Then, the weight of $(u,v)$ is determined by the conditions.\nA simpler way: choose any $n-1$ edges (say, $(v_1, v_2), \\dots, (v_{n-1}, v_n)$ if it's a path graph). We can assign weights to $n-1$ edges. The $n$ conditions are $P_i=-1$. The product of all $P_i$ is $1$. So, if we satisfy $n-1$ conditions, the last one is automatically satisfied.\nThis means we can choose $n-1$ edges, assign weights to $n-2$ of them arbitrarily (each $1$ or $-1$), and the weight of the $(n-1)$-th edge is then uniquely determined by one of the conditions.\nFor a given tree structure, there are $2^{n-2}$ ways to assign weights to make it good.\n\nThe total number of good trees is $n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ (if $n$ is even) or $0$ (if $n$ is odd).\n\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} d(1,n)$.\nLet $d(1,n; T) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} w(u,v)$.\nThe sum can be rewritten as $\\sum_{\\text{tree structure } G} \\sum_{\\text{weight assignment } W \\text{ for } G \\text{ making } G \\text{ good}} d(1,n; (G,W))$.\nLet's fix a tree structure $G$. Let $P_{1,n}$ be the unique path from $1$ to $n$ in $G$.\nLet $E_P$ be the set of edges on $P_{1,n}$.\nLet $E_{NP}$ be the set of edges not on $P_{1,n}$. $|E_P|$ is the length of the path, say $L$. $|E_{NP}| = (n-1) - L$.\nFor any edge $(u,v) \\in E_{NP}$, we can choose $w(u,v)$ to be $1$ or $-1$. There are $2^{|E_{NP}|}$ ways.\nFor any edge $(u,v) \\in E_P$, we can choose $w(u,v)$ to be $1$ or $-1$. There are $2^{|E_P|}$ ways.\nTotal $2^{n-1}$ ways to assign weights for a given tree.\nHowever, we need to satisfy the good tree conditions. We know there are $2^{n-2}$ ways.\nConsider an edge $(u,v) \\in E_P$. Let $X_{u,v}$ be its weight.\nConsider an edge $(x,y) \\in E_{NP}$. Let $Y_{x,y}$ be its weight.\nWe can choose weights for all edges except one, say $(1, \\text{neighbor of } 1 \\text{ on path to } n)$. Then the weight of this edge is determined by the $P_1=-1$ condition.\nThis means we can choose weights for $n-2$ edges arbitrarily.\nLet $S_P = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_P} w(u,v)$.\nLet's fix the weights of all edges except $w(1,k)$ where $k$ is the neighbor of $1$ on the path to $n$.\nThere are $n-2$ such edges.\nFor each of these $n-2$ edges, we can assign $1$ or $-1$. This gives $2^{n-2}$ ways.\nThe weight $w(1,k)$ is then determined by $P_1 = -1$.\nLet $w(1,k) = X$. For a fixed choice of $n-2$ edge weights, $X$ is determined.\nThe sum $S_P$ will be $X + \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_P, (u,v) \\neq (1,k)} w(u,v)$.\nLet $S'_P = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_P, (u,v) \\neq (1,k)} w(u,v)$.\nThen $S_P = X + S'_P$.\nThe sum we want is $\\sum (X + S'_P)$.\nFor a fixed tree structure $G$:\nFor each edge $(u,v) \\in E_P$, $w(u,v)$ can be $1$ or $-1$.\nFor each edge $(x,y) \\in E_{NP}$, $w(x,y)$ can be $1$ or $-1$.\nConsider the set of $n-2$ edges $E' = E \\setminus \\{(1,k)\\}$.\nFor each assignment of weights to $E'$, $w(1,k)$ is determined.\nLet $w(1,k) = W_0$.\nThe sum $d(1,n)$ is $W_0 + \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_P, (u,v) \\neq (1,k)} w(u,v)$.\nLet $S_P'$ be the sum of weights of path edges other than $(1,k)$.\nFor a fixed $S_P'$, how many ways are there to get $W_0=1$ and $W_0=-1$?\nThe $n-2$ edges can be chosen to be $1$ or $-1$.\nThe product $P_1 = w(1,k) \\prod_{(1,j) \\in E, j \\neq k} w(1,j) = -1$.\nLet $P'_1 = \\prod_{(1,j) \\in E, j \\neq k} w(1,j)$. Then $w(1,k) = -1/P'_1 = -P'_1$.\n$P'_1$ depends on the weights of edges incident to $1$ other than $(1,k)$. These edges are part of $E'$.\nThe weights of edges in $E'$ can be chosen in $2^{n-2}$ ways.\nFor any edge $(u,v) \\in E_P \\setminus \\{(1,k)\\}$, its weight $w(u,v)$ is chosen in $2^{n-2}$ ways. Half of these will have $w(u,v)=1$ and half $w(u,v)=-1$.\nSo $\\sum w(u,v) = 2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 + 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) = 0$ for any $(u,v) \\in E_P \\setminus \\{(1,k)\\}$.\nThus, $\\sum S_P' = 0$.\nWhat about $w(1,k)$? $w(1,k) = -P'_1$.\n$P'_1$ is a product of weights of edges incident to $1$ other than $(1,k)$.\nIf $1$ has degree $d_1$, then $P'_1$ is a product of $d_1-1$ edge weights.\nThe values of these $d_1-1$ edge weights can be chosen from $1$ or $-1$.\nThe other $n-2-(d_1-1)$ edge weights are chosen arbitrarily.\nSo $P'_1$ will be $1$ for $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ choices of weights and $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ choices.\nThus $w(1,k)$ will be $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ choices and $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ choices.\nSo $\\sum w(1,k) = 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) + 2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nTherefore, for any fixed tree structure $G$, $\\sum_{\\text{weight assignments}} d(1,n; (G,W)) = 0$.\n\nThis result is true for any $n \\ge 2$.\nIf $n=2$, there is only one tree structure: $1-2$. The path is $(1,2)$. $d(1,2) = w(1,2)$.\nThe conditions are $P_1 = w(1,2) = -1$ and $P_2 = w(1,2) = -1$.\nSo $w(1,2)$ must be $-1$. $d(1,2) = -1$.\nThe sum is $-1$. Modulo $998244353$, this is $998244352$.\nMy general argument says the sum should be $0$. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nThe argument \"For any edge $(u,v) \\in E_P \\setminus \\{(1,k)\\}$, its weight $w(u,v)$ is chosen in $2^{n-2}$ ways. Half of these will have $w(u,v)=1$ and half $w(u,v)=-1$\" is only true if $w(u,v)$ is one of the $n-2$ edges whose weights are chosen freely.\nLet $e_0 = (1,k)$. The other $n-2$ edges are $E' = E \\setminus \\{e_0\\}$.\nWe choose weights for $E'$ arbitrarily, and $w(e_0)$ is determined.\nFor any $e \\in E'$, $w(e)$ can be $1$ or $-1$. For half of the $2^{n-2}$ assignments, $w(e)=1$, and for the other half, $w(e)=-1$.\nSo, $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e) = 2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 + 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) = 0$ for any $e \\in E'$.\nThe sum of $d(1,n)$ for a fixed tree structure $G$ is $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} \\sum_{e \\in E_P} w(e) = \\sum_{e \\in E_P} \\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$.\nIf $e \\in E_P \\cap E'$, then $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e) = 0$.\nSo the only term that can be non-zero is for $e_0 = (1,k)$, if $e_0 \\in E_P$.\nIf $e_0 \\notin E_P$, then all edges on $P_{1,n}$ are in $E'$. So $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = 0$.\nThis means if $e_0=(1,k)$ is not on the path $P_{1,n}$, the sum is $0$.\nThis happens if $k$ is not the neighbor of $1$ on the path to $n$.\nBut $k$ is defined as the neighbor of $1$ on the path to $n$. So $e_0=(1,k)$ is always on the path.\n\nSo we need to evaluate $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e_0)$.\n$w(e_0) = -P'_1$, where $P'_1 = \\prod_{(1,j) \\in E, j \\neq k} w(1,j)$.\nThe edges $(1,j)$ for $j \\neq k$ are all in $E'$.\nLet $d_1$ be the degree of vertex $1$. There are $d_1-1$ such edges.\nThe weights of these $d_1-1$ edges are chosen freely, along with $n-2-(d_1-1)$ other edges in $E'$.\nFor $P'_1$ to be $1$, an even number of the $d_1-1$ edge weights must be $-1$.\nFor $P'_1$ to be $-1$, an odd number of the $d_1-1$ edge weights must be $-1$.\nLet $m = d_1-1$. The number of ways to pick $m$ weights such that their product is $1$ is $\\binom{m}{0} + \\binom{m}{2} + \\dots = 2^{m-1}$ (if $m \\ge 1$).\nThe number of ways to pick $m$ weights such that their product is $-1$ is $\\binom{m}{1} + \\binom{m}{3} + \\dots = 2^{m-1}$ (if $m \\ge 1$).\nIf $m=0$ (i.e., $d_1=1$, vertex $1$ is a leaf), then $P'_1$ is an empty product, which is $1$. In this case, $w(e_0) = -1$.\nIf $d_1=1$, then $m=0$. $P'_1=1$. So $w(e_0)=-1$. There is only $1$ such edge.\nThe number of ways to choose weights for $E'$ is $2^{n-2}$.\nIf $d_1=1$, then $P'_1=1$ always. So $w(e_0)=-1$ for all $2^{n-2}$ assignments.\nIn this case, $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e_0) = 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1)$.\nIf $d_1 > 1$, then $m \\ge 1$.\n$P'_1=1$ for $2^{m-1}$ choices of weights for incident edges.\n$P'_1=-1$ for $2^{m-1}$ choices of weights for incident edges.\nThe remaining $n-2-m$ edges can be chosen in $2^{n-2-m}$ ways.\nSo, $P'_1=1$ for $2^{m-1} \\cdot 2^{n-2-m} = 2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nAnd $P'_1=-1$ for $2^{m-1} \\cdot 2^{n-2-m} = 2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nThus, $w(e_0)=-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments, and $w(e_0)=1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nSo $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e_0) = 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) + 2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 = 0$ if $d_1 > 1$.\n\nSo, for a fixed tree structure $G$:\nIf $d_1=1$ (vertex $1$ is a leaf), then $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1)$.\nIf $d_1>1$, then $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = 0$.\n\nNow we need to sum this over all tree structures.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{G} (\\text{if } d_1=1 \\text{ then } 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1) \\text{ else } 0)$.\nThis is $2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (\\text{number of tree structures where } 1 \\text{ is a leaf})$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where vertex $1$ is a leaf is given by $n^{n-3}$ if $n \\ge 2$.\n(This can be derived using Prufer sequences. If $1$ is a leaf, $1$ does not appear in the Prufer sequence. There are $n-1$ choices for the first element that appears in the sequence, $n-1$ for the second, etc. $(n-1)^{n-2}$ sequences of length $n-2$ using labels $\\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. If $1$ is a leaf, it means $1$ is never an internal node. So it never appears in the Prufer sequence. The Prufer sequence has length $n-2$. The labels in the sequence are from $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. We need to pick $n-2$ labels from $\\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. There are $(n-1)^{n-2}$ such sequences. This corresponds to trees where $1$ is a leaf.)\nLet's verify this formula for $n=2$: $2^{2-3} = 2^{-1}$ which is not an integer.\nFor $n=2$, there is only one tree $1-2$. Vertex $1$ is a leaf. So the count is $1$. The formula should be $1$.\nThe formula $n^{n-3}$ is for $n \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=2$, the number of trees is $2^{2-2}=1$. Vertex $1$ is a leaf in this tree. So the count is $1$.\n\nCase $n=1$: Output $0$. (My initial check handles this)\nCase $n=2$: $n$ is even. Vertex $1$ is a leaf.\nThe sum is $2^{2-2} \\cdot (-1) = 2^0 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nModulo $998244353$, this is $998244352$. This matches the example.\n\nCase $n \\ge 3$ and $n$ is even:\nThe number of trees where $1$ is a leaf is $(n-1)^{n-2}$.\n(Let's re-derive this: The Prufer sequence has length $n-2$. If vertex $1$ is a leaf, it means $1$ never appears in the Prufer sequence. The $n-2$ elements of the Prufer sequence must be chosen from $\\{2, \\dots, n\\}$. There are $n-1$ choices for each position. So there are $(n-1)^{n-2}$ such sequences. Each sequence corresponds to a unique tree.)\nSo the total sum is $(n-1)^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1)$.\nModulo $998244353$.\n\nFinal check:\nIf $n$ is odd, answer is $0$.\nIf $n$ is even:\n  If $n=2$, answer is $-1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n  If $n \\ge 4$ (and even), answer is $(n-1)^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's test $n=4$:\n$n$ is even and $n \\ge 4$.\nAnswer should be $(4-1)^{4-2} \\cdot 2^{4-2} \\cdot (-1) = 3^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot (-1) = 9 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (-1) = -36$.\nModulo $998244353$, this is $998244317$.\nThe example for $n=4$ output is $998244343$. This is $-10$. My answer is $-36$. There is a mismatch.\n\nLet's re-examine the sum $d(1,n)$.\nMy argument for $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = 0$ if $d_1 > 1$ seems correct.\nPerhaps the assumption that $e_0=(1,k)$ is the only edge whose sum of weights might not be zero is flawed.\n\nLet $P_{1,n}$ be the path from $1$ to $n$. Let $E_P$ be the set of edges on this path.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{e \\in E_P} \\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$.\nLet $e=(u,v)$ be an edge on $P_{1,n}$.\nLet's choose $e$ to be the \"special\" edge $e_S=(u,v)$ whose weight is determined by $P_u=-1$ and all other $n-2$ edge weights.\nThe other $n-2$ edges are $E' = E \\setminus \\{e_S\\}$.\nFor any $e' \\in E'$, its weight $w(e')$ is chosen freely. So $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e') = 0$.\nThe weight $w(e_S)$ is determined by $P_u = w(e_S) \\prod_{(u,x) \\in E, x \\neq v} w(u,x) = -1$.\nSo $w(e_S) = - \\prod_{(u,x) \\in E, x \\neq v} w(u,x)$.\nLet $d_u$ be the degree of $u$. The product is over $d_u-1$ edges.\nIf $d_u=1$, then $u$ is a leaf. The product is $1$. So $w(e_S)=-1$.\nIf $d_u>1$, then the product is $1$ for $2^{d_u-2}$ choices and $-1$ for $2^{d_u-2}$ choices.\nSo $w(e_S)$ is $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments and $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nSo $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e_S) = 0$ if $d_u > 1$.\nAnd $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e_S) = 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1)$ if $d_u=1$.\n\nThe problem is that for each edge $e \\in E_P$, we need to calculate $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$.\nThe \"special\" edge $e_S$ must be chosen consistently.\nLet's fix a root for the tree, say vertex $1$.\nFor any vertex $v \\neq 1$, let $p(v)$ be its parent. The edge $(v, p(v))$ is an edge.\nThe condition $P_v = -1$ can be used to determine $w(v, p(v))$ once all $w(v,c)$ for children $c$ of $v$ are known.\nWe can determine weights for all edges $(v, p(v))$ for $v \\neq 1$ by processing vertices in post-order traversal (children before parents).\nThis means $w(v, p(v))$ is determined by the weights of edges incident to $v$ other than $(v,p(v))$ and $P_v=-1$.\nThe edges incident to $v$ other than $(v,p(v))$ are $(v,c)$ for children $c$ of $v$.\nThe weights $w(v,c)$ are determined by $P_c=-1$ and incident edges to $c$.\nThis is a recursive definition.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\nPick an arbitrary edge $(u,v)$. How many good trees have $w(u,v)=1$ and how many have $w(u,v)=-1$?\nLet $N_+(u,v)$ be the number of good trees with $w(u,v)=1$.\nLet $N_-(u,v)$ be the number of good trees with $w(u,v)=-1$.\nThe sum we want is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_P} (N_+(u,v) \\cdot 1 + N_-(u,v) \\cdot (-1))$.\nFor a given tree structure $G$, there are $2^{n-2}$ good weight assignments.\nLet $A_{u,v}$ be the set of good weight assignments for $G$.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{W \\in A_{u,v}} w(u,v)$.\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$.\nConsider the condition for $u$: $P_u = w(u,v) \\prod_{(u,x) \\in E, x \\neq v} w(u,x) = -1$.\nConsider the condition for $v$: $P_v = w(u,v) \\prod_{(v,y) \\in E, y \\neq u} w(v,y) = -1$.\nLet $Q_u = \\prod_{(u,x) \\in E, x \\neq v} w(u,x)$ and $Q_v = \\prod_{(v,y) \\in E, y \\neq u} w(v,y)$.\nThen $w(u,v) Q_u = -1$ and $w(u,v) Q_v = -1$.\nThis implies $Q_u = Q_v$.\nThis means that for any edge $(u,v)$, the product of weights of edges incident to $u$ (excluding $(u,v)$) must be equal to the product of weights of edges incident to $v$ (excluding $(u,v)$).\nLet $P'_x = \\prod_{(x,y) \\in E, y \\neq z} w(x,y)$.\nThe condition $P_x=-1$ for all $x$ means $w(x,y)P'_x = -1$.\nSo $P'_x = -w(x,y)$.\nThus, for any edge $(u,v)$, $P'_u = -w(u,v)$ and $P'_v = -w(u,v)$.\nThis means $P'_u = P'_v$.\nThis must hold for all edges $(u,v)$.\nThis implies that $P'_x$ must be the same value for all vertices $x$. Let this value be $K$.\nSo $P'_x = K$ for all $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThen $w(x,y) = -K$ for all edges $(x,y)$.\nIf $K=1$, then $w(x,y)=-1$ for all edges.\nIf $K=-1$, then $w(x,y)=1$ for all edges.\n\nLet's check this.\nIf all $w(x,y)=-1$:\n$P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} (-1) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)}$.\nFor $P_i=-1$, we need $\\text{deg}(i)$ to be odd for all $i$.\nIf all $w(x,y)=1$:\n$P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} 1 = 1$.\nFor $P_i=-1$, we need $1=-1$, which is impossible.\nSo, the only way to satisfy $P'_x = K$ for all $x$ is if $K=1$, and all edge weights are $-1$.\nThis implies that for a tree to be \"good\", all its edges must have weight $-1$, AND all vertices must have an odd degree.\n\nThe sum of degrees in a tree is $2(n-1)$.\nIf all degrees are odd, then $\\sum \\text{deg}(i)$ must be even. This is always true.\nAlso, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.\nIf all degrees are odd, then all $n$ vertices have odd degree. So $n$ must be even.\nThis confirms our earlier finding that $n$ must be even.\n\nSo for a tree structure $G$ to be good, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1. All edge weights must be $-1$. (This is the only possible assignment for $w(u,v)$).\n2. All vertices must have odd degree.\n\nIf a tree structure $G$ has all vertices with odd degree, then there is exactly one good weight assignment (all edges are $-1$). For this assignment, $d(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} (-1) = -L$, where $L$ is the length of the path from $1$ to $n$.\nIf a tree structure $G$ has at least one vertex with even degree, then there are no good weight assignments.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n1. If $n$ is odd, the answer is $0$.\n2. If $n$ is even, find the sum of $-L_{1,n}(G)$ over all tree structures $G$ where all vertices have odd degree.\n$L_{1,n}(G)$ is the length of the path from $1$ to $n$ in $G$.\n\nLet's check $n=2$. $1-2$. Degrees are $\\text{deg}(1)=1$, $\\text{deg}(2)=1$. Both odd.\nSo this tree is good. All weights are $-1$. $d(1,2) = -1$.\nSum is $-1$. This matches.\n\nLet's check $n=4$.\nWe need to sum $-L_{1,4}(G)$ over all trees $G$ on $4$ vertices where all degrees are odd.\nPossible degree sequences for $n=4$ with all odd degrees:\nSum of degrees is $2(4-1)=6$.\nOnly possible sequence is $(1,1,1,3)$ (a star graph with center at vertex of degree 3).\nFor $n=4$, there are $4^{4-2}=16$ trees.\nTrees with degree sequence $(1,1,1,3)$:\nThe vertex of degree $3$ can be any of the $4$ vertices.\nIf vertex $1$ has degree $3$: Edges are $(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)$. Path $1-4$ has length $1$. $L_{1,4}=1$. Contribution is $-1$.\nIf vertex $2$ has degree $3$: Edges are $(2,1), (2,3), (2,4)$. Path $1-4$ is $1-2-4$. Length $2$. $L_{1,4}=2$. Contribution is $-2$.\nIf vertex $3$ has degree $3$: Edges are $(3,1), (3,2), (3,4)$. Path $1-4$ is $1-3-4$. Length $2$. $L_{1,4}=2$. Contribution is $-2$.\nIf vertex $4$ has degree $3$: Edges are $(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)$. Path $1-4$ has length $1$. $L_{1,4}=1$. Contribution is $-1$.\nTotal sum for these trees: $(-1) + (-2) + (-2) + (-1) = -6$.\n\nWhat about other tree structures for $n=4$?\nPath graph $1-2-3-4$. Degrees are $(1,2,2,1)$. Not all odd. Not good.\nAny other tree on 4 vertices is a path or a star.\nSo the total sum for $n=4$ is $-6$.\nThe example output for $n=4$ is $998244343$, which is $-10 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nMy reasoning that $w(x,y)=-K$ for all edges and $K=1$ must be flawed.\nThe conditions $P'_u = P'_v$ for all edges $(u,v)$ implies that $P'_x$ is constant for all $x$ in any connected component. Since it's a tree, it's connected, so $P'_x = K$ for all $x$.\nThis reasoning is correct.\nThe conclusion was $w(x,y) = -K$ for all edges.\nSo either all edges are $1$ or all edges are $-1$.\nIf all edges are $1$, then $P_i = 1$ for all $i$. But we need $P_i=-1$. So this case is impossible.\nIf all edges are $-1$, then $P_i = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)}$. For $P_i=-1$, we need $\\text{deg}(i)$ to be odd.\nSo, a tree $G$ is good if and only if all its vertices have odd degree. And if it is good, all its edge weights must be $-1$.\nThis logic seems solid. The discrepancy with $n=4$ example is concerning.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully.\n\"for each vertex $i$, the product of the edge weights of all edges having $i$ as one endpoint is $-1$.\"\nThis is exactly $P_i=-1$.\n\"sum of $d(1,n)^\\ddagger$ of all such trees that are good.\"\n\nLet's re-verify the $n=4$ example.\nInput: 4. Output: 998244343 (which is -10).\nMy logic gives -6.\nThe example says:\n$d(1,4)$ is:\n$-2$ for $2$ trees;\n$-1$ for $8$ trees;\n$0$ for $4$ trees;\n$1$ for $2$ trees.\nSum is $2(-2) + 8(-1) + 4(0) + 2(1) = -4 - 8 + 0 + 2 = -10$.\n\nThis means my condition for \"good\" trees is missing something.\nMy condition: \"all vertices must have odd degree AND all edge weights must be $-1$\".\nThe example implies there are good trees where not all edge weights are $-1$.\nFor example, a tree with $d(1,4)=1$ must have some edges with weight $1$.\n\nWhat is wrong with $P'_x = K$ for all $x$?\n$P_u = w(u,v) \\cdot Q_u = -1$.\n$P_v = w(u,v) \\cdot Q_v = -1$.\nThis means $Q_u = Q_v$.\nThis means that for any edge $(u,v)$, the product of weights of edges incident to $u$ (excluding $(u,v)$) must be equal to the product of weights of edges incident to $v$ (excluding $(u,v)$).\nThis is correct.\nLet $Q_x = \\prod_{(x,y) \\in E, y \\neq \\text{parent}(x)} w(x,y)$ if $x$ is not root.\nThis is not $P'_x$. $P'_x$ is $\\prod_{(x,y) \\in E, y \\neq z} w(x,y)$, where $z$ is some arbitrary neighbor.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary root, say vertex $1$.\nFor any vertex $v \\neq 1$, let $p(v)$ be its parent.\nLet $w(v,p(v))$ be the weight of the edge connecting $v$ to $p(v)$.\nFor $v \\neq 1$, $P_v = w(v,p(v)) \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } v} w(v,c) = -1$.\nFor vertex $1$, $P_1 = \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } 1} w(1,c) = -1$.\n\nWe have $n-1$ edges. Let's fix $n-2$ edges, say all edges except $(1, \\text{child of } 1 \\text{ on path to } n)$.\nNo, this is not how it works.\nLet's try to determine the weights.\nFix an arbitrary root, say vertex $1$.\nFor any vertex $v \\neq 1$, let $p(v)$ be its parent.\nWe can choose weights for all edges $(v,c)$ where $c$ is a child of $v$. These are $n-1 - \\text{deg}(1)$ edges.\nNo, this is not how it works either.\n\nLet's try to use the general method for summing path sums.\n$\\sum d(1,n) = \\sum_G \\sum_W \\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} w(e)$.\nThis is $\\sum_G \\sum_{e \\in E} \\mathbb{I}(e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)) \\sum_W w(e)$.\nLet $S_e = \\sum_W w(e)$.\nWe need to find $S_e$ for each edge $e$.\n\nLet $e=(u,v)$ be an edge.\nConsider the $n$ conditions $P_i=-1$.\nPick an arbitrary edge $(x,y)$. We can choose weights for all $n-2$ edges in $E \\setminus \\{(x,y)\\}$ arbitrarily.\nLet $w(x,y)$ be the last edge whose weight is determined.\n$P_x = w(x,y) \\prod_{z \\neq y} w(x,z) = -1$.\nSo $w(x,y) = - (\\prod_{z \\neq y} w(x,z))$.\nLet $Q_x = \\prod_{z \\neq y} w(x,z)$.\nThen $w(x,y) = -Q_x$.\nThe weights of edges in $E \\setminus \\{(x,y)\\}$ are chosen in $2^{n-2}$ ways.\nFor any edge $e' \\in E \\setminus \\{(x,y)\\}$, $w(e')$ is $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments and $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nSo $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e') = 0$ for $e' \\in E \\setminus \\{(x,y)\\}$.\nFor $w(x,y)$, its value is $-Q_x$.\n$Q_x$ is a product of weights of $d_x-1$ edges. These edges are all in $E \\setminus \\{(x,y)\\}$.\nIf $d_x=1$, then $Q_x=1$, so $w(x,y)=-1$ for all $2^{n-2}$ assignments.\nIn this case $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(x,y) = 2^{n-2} \\cdot (-1)$.\nIf $d_x>1$, then $Q_x$ is $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments and $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nSo $w(x,y)$ is $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments and $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments.\nIn this case $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(x,y) = 0$.\n\nThis means that for any edge $(u,v)$ in a tree $G$, $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(u,v)$ is:\n$-2^{n-2}$ if $u$ is a leaf OR $v$ is a leaf. (because we can pick $(u,v)$ as the special edge, and if $d_u=1$, then $u$ is a leaf, $w(u,v)=-1$ always. If $d_v=1$, then $v$ is a leaf, $w(u,v)=-1$ always. The choice of which endpoint of the special edge to use for the product matters.)\nLet's be precise. Let $e=(u,v)$. Choose $u$ as the endpoint whose degree condition determines $w(u,v)$.\nThen $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(u,v) = -2^{n-2}$ if $d_u=1$.\nAnd $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(u,v) = 0$ if $d_u>1$.\n\nThe problem is that $w(u,v)$ is determined by $P_u$ AND $P_v$.\n$P_u = w(u,v) Q_u = -1$ and $P_v = w(u,v) Q_v = -1$.\nSo $Q_u = Q_v$.\nThis means $w(u,v) = -Q_u = -Q_v$.\nConsider choosing weights for $n-2$ edges $E' = E \\setminus \\{(u,v)\\}$.\n$w(u,v)$ is then determined by $P_u=-1$ (or $P_v=-1$).\nSo $w(u,v)=-Q_u$.\nThe sum $S_e = \\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$.\nIf $d_u=1$, then $Q_u=1$, so $w(u,v)=-1$ for all $2^{n-2}$ assignments. So $S_e = -2^{n-2}$.\nIf $d_u>1$, then $Q_u$ is $1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments and $-1$ for $2^{n-3}$ assignments. So $S_e = 0$.\nThis is only if we use $P_u$ to determine $w(u,v)$.\nThe same logic applies if we use $P_v$ to determine $w(u,v)$.\nSo if $d_v=1$, then $S_e = -2^{n-2}$.\nIf $d_v>1$, then $S_e = 0$.\n\nThis means for an edge $(u,v)$:\nIf $d_u=1$ or $d_v=1$ (i.e. $(u,v)$ is incident to a leaf), then $S_e = -2^{n-2}$.\nOtherwise ($d_u>1$ AND $d_v>1$), then $S_e = 0$.\n\nSo for a fixed tree structure $G$:\n$\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} S_e$.\nIf an edge $e=(u,v)$ on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ is incident to a leaf, its contribution is $-2^{n-2}$.\nOtherwise, its contribution is $0$.\n\nThe path $1 \\leadsto n$ has two endpoints, $1$ and $n$.\nIf $d_1=1$, then the edge incident to $1$ on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ is incident to a leaf ($1$). So its contribution is $-2^{n-2}$.\nIf $d_n=1$, then the edge incident to $n$ on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ is incident to a leaf ($n$). So its contribution is $-2^{n-2}$.\nAny other edge on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ is incident to two non-leaf vertices (unless $n=2$).\nIf $n=2$, the path is $1-2$. $d_1=1$, $d_2=1$. The edge $(1,2)$ is incident to two leaves. Its contribution is $-2^{2-2}=-1$. Sum is $-1$. Correct.\n\nIf $n>2$:\nThe edges on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ are $(v_0,v_1), (v_1,v_2), \\dots, (v_{L-1},v_L)$ where $v_0=1, v_L=n$.\nThe edge $(v_0,v_1)$ contributes $-2^{n-2}$ if $d_{v_0}=d_1=1$.\nThe edge $(v_{L-1},v_L)$ contributes $-2^{n-2}$ if $d_{v_L}=d_n=1$.\nFor any other edge $(v_i,v_{i+1})$ where $0<i<L-1$:\n$v_i$ has a neighbor $v_{i-1}$ on the path and $v_{i+1}$ on the path. So $d_{v_i} \\ge 2$.\n$v_{i+1}$ has a neighbor $v_i$ on the path and $v_{i+2}$ on the path. So $d_{v_{i+1}} \\ge 2$.\nThus $d_{v_i}>1$ and $d_{v_{i+1}}>1$. So these middle edges contribute $0$.\n\nSo for a fixed tree $G$ (with $n$ even):\n$\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = (-2^{n-2}) \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1))$.\n(If $n=2$, $1=v_0, 2=v_1$. $L=1$. The path has only edge $(v_0,v_1)$. $d_1=1, d_2=1$. This counts as $1+1=2$ leaves. So $-2^{n-2} \\cdot 2 = -2^{2-2} \\cdot 2 = -2$. This is wrong. It should be $-1$.\nIf $n=2$, the path is $1-2$. $d_1=1, d_2=1$. The edge $(1,2)$ is incident to $1$ (a leaf) and $2$ (a leaf). So its contribution is $-2^{n-2}$.\nSo the sum is $1 \\cdot (-2^{n-2})$ if $n=2$.\nMy formula is $\\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} S_e$. If $e=(1,2)$, then $S_{(1,2)} = -2^{n-2}$ because $d_1=1$.\nSo for $n=2$, sum is $-2^{2-2}=-1$. This is correct.\n\nThe general formula should be:\nFor a fixed tree $G$ (with $n$ even):\n$\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = -2^{n-2} \\cdot \\left( \\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1) - \\mathbb{I}(d_1=1 \\text{ and } d_n=1 \\text{ and } n=2) \\right)$.\nThe last term $\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1 \\text{ and } d_n=1 \\text{ and } n=2)$ is to avoid double counting for $n=2$.\nIf $n=2$, $d_1=1, d_2=1$. The formula becomes $-2^{n-2} \\cdot (1+1-1) = -2^{n-2}$. Correct.\nIf $n>2$:\n$\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = -2^{n-2} \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1))$.\n\nNow sum this over all tree structures $G$.\nTotal sum $= \\sum_G (-2^{n-2} \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1)))$. (This is for $n>2$ and even).\nTotal sum $= (-2^{n-2}) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_G \\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\sum_G \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1) \\right)$.\nBy symmetry, $\\sum_G \\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) = \\sum_G \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1)$.\nLet $N_L = \\sum_G \\mathbb{I}(d_1=1)$ be the number of trees where vertex $1$ is a leaf.\nAs discussed before, for $n \\ge 3$, $N_L = (n-1)^{n-2}$.\nSo for $n \\ge 4$ (and even), the total sum is $(-2^{n-2}) \\cdot (2 \\cdot (n-1)^{n-2})$.\nThis is $-2^{n-1} (n-1)^{n-2}$.\n\nLet's recheck $n=4$:\nTotal sum $= -2^{4-1} (4-1)^{4-2} = -2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = -8 \\cdot 9 = -72$.\nStill not $-10$.\n\nThe issue must be in the \"good tree\" condition.\nMy initial argument that $n$ must be even is correct.\nMy initial argument that for a given tree, there are $2^{n-2}$ good assignments is correct.\n\nWhat if $d_u=1$ AND $d_v=1$? This happens for $n=2$. $e=(1,2)$. $d_1=1, d_2=1$.\n$S_e = -2^{n-2}$. This is consistent.\nWhat if $n>2$ and $d_1=1$ and $d_n=1$?\nThen $1$ and $n$ are leaves. The path $1 \\leadsto n$ has $L$ edges.\nThe edge $(1,v_1)$ is incident to leaf $1$. $S_{(1,v_1)} = -2^{n-2}$.\nThe edge $(v_{L-1},n)$ is incident to leaf $n$. $S_{(v_{L-1},n)} = -2^{n-2}$.\nAll other edges $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for $0<i<L-1$ have $d_{v_i} \\ge 2$ and $d_{v_{i+1}} \\ge 2$. So $S_{(v_i,v_{i+1})}=0$.\nSo $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = -2^{n-2} \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_n=1))$. This is correct for $n>2$.\n\nLet's consider the $n=4$ example again.\nThe path $1 \\leadsto 4$.\nStar graph centered at $1$: $1-(2,3,4)$. $d_1=3, d_2=1, d_3=1, d_4=1$.\n$d_1>1$. $d_4=1$.\nSo $\\sum d(1,4) = -2^{4-2} \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_4=1)) = -2^2 \\cdot (0+1) = -4$.\nThe example says $-1$.\nMy calculation was $L_{1,4}=1$. $-L_{1,4}=-1$.\n\nStar graph centered at $2$: $2-(1,3,4)$. $d_1=1, d_2=3, d_3=1, d_4=1$.\n$d_1=1$. $d_4=1$.\nSo $\\sum d(1,4) = -2^{4-2} \\cdot (\\mathbb{I}(d_1=1) + \\mathbb{I}(d_4=1)) = -2^2 \\cdot (1+1) = -8$.\nThe example says $-2$.\nMy calculation was $L_{1,4}=2$. $-L_{1,4}=-2$.\n\nThis implies that the sum $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n)$ is not always $0$ or $-2^{n-2}$.\nIt seems the sum $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$ is not always $0$ or $-2^{n-2}$.\n\nLet's carefully re-evaluate $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} w(e)$ for an edge $e=(u,v)$.\nWe have $n-1$ edges. $n$ conditions $P_i=-1$. $n$ is even.\nThe conditions are not independent. If $n-1$ conditions are met, the $n$-th is met.\nPick $n-1$ conditions, say $P_1, \\dots, P_{n-1}$.\nWe can assign weights to $n-1$ edges.\nLet's fix a tree $G$.\nLet $e=(u,v)$ be an edge.\nLet's consider the number of good assignments $N_+(e)$ where $w(e)=1$ and $N_-(e)$ where $w(e)=-1$.\nTotal number of good assignments is $2^{n-2}$. So $N_+(e) + N_-(e) = 2^{n-2}$.\nWe want $S_e = N_+(e) - N_-(e)$.\n\nConsider the effect of flipping the weight of a single edge $w(x,y)$.\nIf we flip $w(x,y)$, then $P_x$ flips sign and $P_y$ flips sign. All other $P_i$ remain unchanged.\nSo if we have a good assignment $(w_1, \\dots, w_{n-1})$, and we flip $w(x,y)$, we get $(w'_1, \\dots, w'_{n-1})$.\nThen $P_x$ becomes $1$, $P_y$ becomes $1$, and $P_i=-1$ for $i \\neq x,y$.\nThis is not a good tree.\n\nWhat if we flip all edge weights? Let $w'(e) = -w(e)$ for all $e$.\nThen $P'_i = \\prod w'(e) = \\prod (-w(e)) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} \\prod w(e) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} P_i$.\nIf $P_i=-1$ for all $i$, then $P'_i = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} (-1) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)+1}$.\nFor $P'_i$ to be $-1$, we need $\\text{deg}(i)+1$ to be odd, meaning $\\text{deg}(i)$ must be even.\nSo if $G$ is a good tree, then $G'$ (all weights flipped) is a good tree if and only if all vertices in $G$ have even degree.\nBut we know that the sum of degrees is $2(n-1)$, which is even. The number of odd degree vertices must be even.\nIf all degrees are even, $n$ must be even.\n\nThis implies that if there is a good tree where all degrees are even, there are two such weight assignments (original and all flipped) that are good.\nIf a tree has some odd degrees and some even degrees, then flipping all weights doesn't lead to a good tree.\n\nLet $G$ be a tree structure.\nLet $W$ be a good assignment of weights.\nLet $W'$ be the assignment where all weights are flipped, $w'(e) = -w(e)$.\n$W'$ is good iff all degrees in $G$ are even.\nIf all degrees are even:\n  For any $e=(u,v)$, $w'(e)=-w(e)$.\n  So $d'(1,n) = \\sum w'(e) = \\sum (-w(e)) = -d(1,n)$.\n  In this case, for each $G$ with all even degrees, we have two good assignments $W$ and $W'$.\n  Their contribution to the sum is $d(1,n) + (-d(1,n)) = 0$.\n  So if all degrees are even, the contribution of that tree structure to the total sum is $0$.\n\nIf $G$ has at least one odd degree vertex (and $n$ is even, so at least two odd degree vertices):\n  Then $W'$ is not good. So for this $G$, there is no $W'$ related to $W$.\n  In this case, the sum $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n)$ for this tree $G$ is not necessarily $0$.\n\nThis means we only need to consider trees where not all degrees are even.\nThe number of odd degree vertices must be even. So if not all degrees are even, there are at least two odd degree vertices.\nThis is always true for $n \\ge 2$.\nIf $n$ is even, then it's possible to have all even degrees (e.g. cycle graphs, but we have trees).\nA tree on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges. Sum of degrees is $2(n-1)$.\nIf all degrees are even, then $n$ must be even.\nFor example, for $n=4$:\nDegree sequences: $(1,1,1,3)$ - 4 trees (star graphs). These have odd degrees.\n$(2,2,1,1)$ - 1 tree (path $1-2-3-4$). This has some even degrees.\n$(2,2,2,0)$ is not possible.\nSo for $n=4$, the path graph $1-2-3-4$ has degrees $(1,2,2,1)$. It has odd degrees $1,4$.\nSo flipping all weights does not yield a good tree.\nThe sum for the path $1-2-3-4$ should not be $0$.\n\nLet's fix an edge $e=(u,v)$.\nThe number of assignments for $E \\setminus \\{e\\}$ is $2^{n-2}$.\nFor each such assignment, the values of $Q_u$ and $Q_v$ are determined.\n$w(e)$ must satisfy $w(e)Q_u=-1$ and $w(e)Q_v=-1$.\nSo $Q_u$ must equal $Q_v$.\nIf $Q_u \\neq Q_v$ for a particular assignment of weights to $E \\setminus \\{e\\}$, then there is no $w(e)$ that can satisfy both conditions.\nSo such an assignment does not lead to a good tree.\nThis means that for a tree $G$, the $2^{n-2}$ assignments for $E \\setminus \\{e\\}$ are not all valid.\nOnly those where $Q_u=Q_v$ are valid.\n\nLet $f(G)$ be the number of good weight assignments for a tree $G$.\nWe established $f(G)=2^{n-2}$ earlier. That argument must be wrong.\nThe argument: \"Pick $n-1$ conditions, say $P_1, \\dots, P_{n-1}$. We can assign weights to $n-1$ edges.\"\nThis assumes that the $n-1$ equations are independent and determine the weights.\nLet's consider the system of equations.\nLet $A$ be the incidence matrix of the tree. $A_{ij}=1$ if $j$ is incident to $i$, $0$ otherwise.\nLet $x_e$ be $\\log_2 w(e) \\in \\{0,1\\}$. $w(e) = (-1)^{x_e}$.\nThen $P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} (-1)^{x_{(i,j)}} = (-1)^{\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} x_{(i,j)}}$.\nSo the condition $P_i=-1$ becomes $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} x_{(i,j)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nLet $B$ be the incidence matrix, $B_{ie}=1$ if vertex $i$ is incident to edge $e$, $0$ otherwise.\n$B x = \\mathbf{1}$, where $x$ is vector of $x_e$ and $\\mathbf{1}$ is vector of all $1$s.\nThe rank of $B$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is $n$ if the graph is bipartite and $n-1$ if it is not.\nA tree is bipartite. So the rank of $B$ is $n-1$.\nThe sum of all equations is $\\sum_i \\sum_e B_{ie} x_e = \\sum_e (\\sum_i B_{ie}) x_e = \\sum_e 2 x_e \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe sum of the RHS is $\\sum_i 1 = n \\pmod 2$.\nSo we must have $0 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. This implies $n$ must be even. (Consistent)\nSince the rank is $n-1$, there are $n-(n-1)=1$ linear dependency among the equations.\nThis implies there are $n-1$ independent equations.\nThe number of variables is $n-1$ (edges).\nSo there is a unique solution for $x_e$ if the system is consistent.\nThis means for any tree structure $G$ with $n$ even, there is exactly one good assignment of weights. $f(G)=1$.\n\nIf $f(G)=1$ for any tree $G$ (with $n$ even).\nThen $\\sum_{W \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = d(1,n; (G,W_G))$, where $W_G$ is the unique good assignment for $G$.\nSo we need to calculate $\\sum_G d(1,n; (G,W_G))$.\nLet $w_G(e)$ be the weight of edge $e$ in the unique good assignment for $G$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_G \\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} w_G(e)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{G: e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} w_G(e)$.\n\nLet's try to determine $w_G(e)$ for a fixed edge $e=(u,v)$.\nThe system $B x = \\mathbf{1}$ has a unique solution.\nLet's find it.\nRoot the tree at vertex $1$.\nFor any vertex $i$, let $d(i)$ be its depth (distance from root $1$).\nConsider any edge $(u,v)$. Let $d(u) < d(v)$. So $u$ is parent of $v$.\n$P_v = w(u,v) \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } v} w(v,c) = -1$.\n$P_u = w(u,p(u)) \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } u} w(u,c) = -1$.\nThe unique solution can be found by fixing $w(1,k)$ for one child $k$ of $1$.\nNo, it's not arbitrary.\n\nLet's define a potential function $\\phi(i)$ for each vertex $i$.\nLet $w(u,v) = \\phi(u) \\phi(v)$.\nThen $P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} \\phi(i) \\phi(j) = \\phi(i)^{\\text{deg}(i)} \\prod_{j \\sim i} \\phi(j)$.\nThis does not seem to simplify to $-1$.\n\nWhat if $w(u,v) = -1$ if $u$ and $v$ have different parity depths from root, and $1$ otherwise?\nLet $d(i)$ be the depth of $i$ from root $1$.\nLet $w(u,v) = (-1)^{d(u)+d(v)+1}$.\nThen $P_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} (-1)^{d(i)+d(j)+1} = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i) (d(i)+1)} (-1)^{\\sum_{j \\sim i} d(j)}$.\nThis is messy.\n\nLet's use the property that $B x = \\mathbf{1}$ has a unique solution.\nThis means $x_e$ is uniquely determined for each edge $e$.\nWhat is $x_e$?\nConsider $x_e = \\mathbb{I}(\\text{edge } e \\text{ has weight } -1)$.\nLet $e=(u,v)$. Remove $e$. The tree splits into two components $T_u$ (containing $u$) and $T_v$ (containing $v$).\nLet $S_u = \\sum_{i \\in T_u} P_i = \\sum_{i \\in T_u} 1 = |T_u| \\pmod 2$.\n$S_u = \\sum_{i \\in T_u} (\\sum_{e' \\sim i} x_{e'}) \\pmod 2$.\nIn $S_u$, edges within $T_u$ are counted twice. Edge $e=(u,v)$ is counted once (for $u$).\nSo $S_u = x_e + \\sum_{e' \\in E(T_u)} 2 x_{e'} \\equiv x_e \\pmod 2$.\nTherefore $x_e \\equiv |T_u| \\pmod 2$.\nSimilarly $x_e \\equiv |T_v| \\pmod 2$.\nSince $|T_u|+|T_v|=n$, and $n$ is even, $|T_u| \\equiv |T_v| \\pmod 2$. This is consistent.\nSo $w(u,v) = -1$ if $|T_u|$ is odd, and $w(u,v)=1$ if $|T_u|$ is even.\n(Where $T_u$ is the component containing $u$ when $(u,v)$ is removed).\nThis determines the unique weight for each edge!\n\nNow we need to sum $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} w(e)$ over all trees $G$.\n$w(e) = (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nSo for each tree $G$, $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} (-1)^{|T_u|}$ (assuming $u$ is \"closer\" to $1$ or root of $T_u$).\nLet $e=(u,v)$ be an edge on the path $1 \\leadsto n$.\nRemoving $e$ splits the tree into $T_u$ (containing $1$) and $T_v$ (containing $n$).\nSo $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_G \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nHere $T_u$ is the component containing $1$ when $e$ is removed.\n\nThis is exactly what the problem \"Sum of distances in a tree\" usually asks for.\nThe sum can be written as $\\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{G: e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThe sum over $G$ is $\\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\mathbb{I}(|T_u|=k \\text{ and } e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)) (-1)^k \\cdot (\\text{number of trees where this holds})$.\nFor a fixed edge $(u,v)$ and a fixed size $k$ for the component containing $u$:\nThe number of trees where removing $(u,v)$ splits the tree into two components of size $k$ and $n-k$ is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$ for $n \\ge 2$. (This is a known result. It's $n^{n-2}$ total trees. Number of trees where $e=(u,v)$ is a bridge, and removing it creates components of size $k$ and $n-k$: $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$.)\nThis formula is for specific $u,v$.\nThe number of trees where a specific edge $(u,v)$ exists is $n^{n-3}$. (Cayley's formula for $n$ vertices is $n^{n-2}$. For $n-1$ edges, if we fix one edge, there are $n^{n-3}$ ways to form a tree.)\n\nLet's use the result from \"Expected value of distance between two random nodes in a random tree\".\nThe sum of $d(u,v)$ over all trees on $n$ labeled vertices is $n^{n-2} \\cdot \\binom{n}{2} \\cdot \\text{average distance}$.\nAverage distance is $\\frac{1}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{u \\neq v} d(u,v)$.\nThe sum of $d(u,v)$ over all trees is $\\sum_T \\sum_{e \\in \\text{path}(u,v)} w(e)$.\nIt's easier to sum over edges.\n$\\sum_T \\sum_{e=(x,y)} \\mathbb{I}(e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)) w_T(e) = \\sum_{e=(x,y)} \\sum_T \\mathbb{I}(e \\in \\text{path}(1,n)) w_T(e)$.\nLet $e=(x,y)$.\n$w_T(e) = (-1)^{|T_x|}$, where $T_x$ is the component containing $1$ if $e$ is removed.\nFor a fixed edge $e=(x,y)$, how many trees $T$ have $e$ on the path $1 \\leadsto n$?\nThis means $1$ and $n$ are in different components when $e$ is removed.\nLet $T_x$ be the component containing $x$ (and $1$). $T_y$ be the component containing $y$ (and $n$).\nNumber of trees where $e=(x,y)$ is an edge, and $1$ is in $T_x$ and $n$ is in $T_y$:\nThis is $n^{n-3}$ ways to choose a tree with edge $(x,y)$.\nFor each such tree, $e=(x,y)$ is on the path $1 \\leadsto n$ if $1$ and $n$ are separated by $e$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices such that a specified edge $(x,y)$ is on the path between $1$ and $n$ is $n^{n-3}$. This is true if $x=1, y=n$.\nNo, this is not correct.\nThe number of trees such that $1$ and $n$ are in different components when $e=(x,y)$ is removed.\nThis is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$ trees where $(x,y)$ connects component of size $k$ (containing $1$) and $n-k$ (containing $n$).\nNumber of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ when $e=(x,y)$ is removed.\nFix $x,y$. The number of trees on $n$ vertices where $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge and removing this edge splits the tree into two components of sizes $k$ and $n-k$ (with $x$ in the $k$-component and $y$ in the $(n-k)$-component) is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is for specific $x,y$.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ (when $e=(x,y)$ is removed) is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$. This is the number of ways to pick $k-1$ other vertices for $T_x$.\nThe edge $(x,y)$ is fixed. $1 \\in T_x, n \\in T_y$.\nSo $w(e) = (-1)^k$.\nTotal sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is the sum for a fixed edge $(x,y)$ when $1$ is in $T_x$ and $n$ in $T_y$.\nBut we need to sum over all edges $(x,y)$ that are on path $1 \\leadsto n$.\n\nLet's use a standard result: the sum of $d(u,v)$ over all $n^{n-2}$ trees.\n$\\sum_T d(u,v; T) = n^{n-3} (2n-2 - d(u) - d(v))$. No, this is for $u,v$ fixed.\nThe sum of path lengths $d(u,v)$ over all $n^{n-2}$ trees is $(n-1)n^{n-2}$.\nThe sum of $d(u,v)$ for a fixed pair $(u,v)$ over all trees is $n^{n-3}(2(n-1)-(d_u+d_v))$\nNo, this is for $u,v$ fixed.\n\nLet's use the formula $x_e \\equiv |T_u| \\pmod 2$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_G \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in \\text{path}(1,n)} (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nLet's consider an arbitrary edge $e=(u,v)$.\nThe number of trees where $e$ is an edge and $u$ is in a component of size $k$ (containing $1$) and $v$ is in a component of size $n-k$ (containing $n$) is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is for fixed $u,v$.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in component of size $k$ and $n$ is in component of size $n-k$ when $e=(u,v)$ is removed is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$. No, this is for fixed $e$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ vertices such that $1$ and $n$ are in different components when $e=(u,v)$ is removed is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1}\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ if $u$ is in $1$'s component and $v$ is in $n$'s component.\nThe value of $w_G(e)$ is $(-1)^k$.\nSo for a specific edge $(u,v)$, the contribution to the total sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis sum is independent of the choice of $(u,v)$.\nThe sum is $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe number of edges on the path from $1$ to $n$ is $L_{1,n}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_G L_{1,n}(G) \\cdot S$.
