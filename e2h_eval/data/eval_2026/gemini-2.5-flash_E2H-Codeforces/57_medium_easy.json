His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vasya Olympiad Ranking**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this problem: determine the best and worst possible rank for Vasya in this Olympiad.  We're given the number of participants (`n`), the minimum points Vasya got (`x`), and the scores from two tours (`a` and `b`).  Crucially, we only have point totals, not individual names, so it's all about strategic score assignments.\n\nMy initial thought is that since we don't know who scored what in which round, this is really a problem of finding the best and worst-case scenarios for Vasya, given the constraint of scoring at least `x` points total.  Essentially, I need to figure out how to arrange the scores to maximize/minimize Vasya's perceived standing relative to everyone else.\n\nThe core idea here is that each participant, including Vasya, gets a score which is a sum of a value from tour 1 and a value from tour 2, such that each score is used exactly once. This sounds a bit like a matching problem, but I don't need a complete solution, just the implications for Vasya. The problem specifies that the jury can arbitrarily rank people with the same score, which plays a critical role in my calculations.\n\n**Best Rank: Always Rank 1**\n\nTo get the best possible rank, the goal is to make Vasya's total score as high as possible. Since no one can score higher than the absolute maximum score, it becomes clear that if Vasya can achieve that maximum, he's guaranteed rank 1. Now, there is a catch: Vasya needs to score at least `x`.\n\nSince there are scores from two independent tours, the highest possible score is `max(A) + max(B)`, assuming that Vasya can get these exact scores. The problem guarantees that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This ensures that Vasya *can* score at least `x`. In order to get the highest possible ranking for Vasya, I need to focus on achieving his top score. The fact that the jury can arbitrarily rank anyone tied at the top is crucial. If Vasya gets the absolute highest score possible (as determined by considering his constraint on minimum points) and possibly tying with other contestants who have not scored over his score, the jury could put him in first due to their arbitrariness. Thus, the best rank will always be 1.\n\n**Worst Rank: Minimizing Vasya's Score, Maximizing Others**\n\nFor the worst possible rank, the objective is to make Vasya's total score as low as it can be while still respecting the constraint (`>= x`), and make sure that all other contestants score as high as possible so that the maximum number of contestants will be equal or have a larger score to Vasya's score.\n\nI now need to figure out what that *minimum* score is.  This requires careful consideration: to hit the absolute lowest score satisfying the condition, I need to find the absolute smallest `a_i` and `b_j` such that their sum equals or exceeds `x`. The solution is to sort both the arrays and then find the lowest possible. Then, I need to compute the worst possible by counting those with scores at or above the minimum Vasya score, with the assumption that the jury will rank Vasya as low as possible amongst them.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with scores greater than or equal to Vasya's worst possible score.\n\nI will have to sort both the input arrays. After the minimum total is calculated, a two-pointer approach will be useful: I'll sort `A` and `B` again, using an ascending sort for `A` and descending sort for `B` so the maximum number of people will get a score equal to or higher than the minimal score. If `A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] >= S_V_worst`, then a match occurs. Otherwise, the pointer on `a` is incremented.\n\nThis algorithm should work. The complexities will all depend on efficient sorting algorithms and the number of iterations on the loop. The approach for minimum score needs a binary search (`bisect`) for efficiency in searching the sorted array.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad, given the scores from two tours and a minimum total score `x` Vasya obtained. The key challenge is that we don't know which scores belong to Vasya or to any other specific participant; we only have two lists of `n` scores each, one for the first tour and one for the second. Each participant takes one score from `A` and one from `B`, with each score used exactly once.\n\n### Best Possible Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to maximize his total score. The problem states that if two or more participants have the same number of points, the jury can assign places according to their choice. This means if Vasya achieves the highest possible score among all participants, he can be assigned the 1st place.\n\nThe maximum possible score any participant can achieve is `max(A) + max(B)`. The problem guarantees that Vasya got at least `x` points, meaning there exist `a_i \\in A` and `b_j \\in B` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge x`.\nIf `max(A) + max(B) \\ge x`, Vasya can choose to be the participant who scored `max(A)` in the first tour and `max(B)` in the second tour. His total score would be `max(A) + max(B)`. Since no other participant can score higher than this, and the jury can assign places arbitrarily for ties, Vasya can always be ranked 1st.\nThe problem statement implies that Vasya *was* one of the participants, and his score satisfied the `x` points condition. Therefore, it's always possible for Vasya to achieve the maximum possible sum `max(A) + max(B)` if that sum is at least `x`. Since the problem guarantees that *some* pair `(a_i, b_j)` sums to at least `x`, it must be possible for Vasya to achieve a score of at least `x`.\nThus, Vasya can always achieve the highest possible score, and therefore, his best possible rank is **1**.\n\n### Worst Possible Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, we need to consider two aspects:\n1. Vasya should achieve the minimum possible total score `S_V_worst` that is still at least `x`.\n2. Given this `S_V_worst`, we assume the most unfavorable pairing for Vasya, meaning as many other participants as possible also score `S_V_worst` or more, and the jury places Vasya last among them.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate `S_V_worst` (minimum score Vasya can get $\\ge x$)**\nTo find the minimum `a_i + b_j` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge x`:\nFirst, sort both lists `A` and `B` in ascending order.\nIterate through each score `a_val` in `A`. For each `a_val`, we need to find the smallest `b_val` in `B` such that `a_val + b_val \\ge x`, which means `b_val \\ge x - a_val`.\nSince `B` is sorted, we can use binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the smallest `b_val` that satisfies this condition. If such a `b_val` exists, then `a_val + b_val` is a candidate for Vasya's score. We take the minimum of all such candidate scores found.\nLet this minimum possible score for Vasya be `S_V_worst`.\n\n**Step 2: Count participants who can score `S_V_worst` or more**\nOnce we have `S_V_worst`, we need to find the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who can achieve a total score of at least `S_V_worst`. This count will represent Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge S_V_worst`:\n1. Sort `A` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `B` in ascending order.\n3. Use a two-pointer approach:\n   Initialize `count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = n - 1`.\n   While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b \\ge 0`:\n     If `A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] \\ge S_V_worst`:\n       We can form a valid pair. To maximize the total number of pairs, we greedily pair the smallest available `A` score (`A[ptr_a]`) with the largest available `B` score (`B[ptr_b]`). This leaves larger `A` scores and smaller `B` scores for future pairings, which is optimal.\n       Increment `count`.\n       Move both pointers: `ptr_a += 1`, `ptr_b -= 1`.\n     Else (`A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] < S_V_worst`):\n       The current smallest `A` score (`A[ptr_a]`) is too small to form a pair with the current largest `B` score (`B[ptr_b]`) to meet `S_V_worst`. Since `B` is sorted ascending, `B[ptr_b]` is the largest available `B` score. If `A[ptr_a]` cannot form a pair with `B[ptr_b]`, it cannot form a pair with any smaller `B` score either. Therefore, `A[ptr_a]` cannot be used to form a pair that meets the `S_V_worst` threshold. We must discard `A[ptr_a]` and try the next smallest `A` score.\n       Move `ptr_a += 1`.\n\nThe final `count` will be the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `S_V_worst`. This `count` is Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 6, x = 7`\n`A = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`B = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n**Best Rank:** 1 (as explained above).\n\n**Worst Rank:**\n**Step 1: Calculate `S_V_worst`**\nSorted `A` (asc): `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `B` (asc): `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n`min_vasya_score = infinity`\n\n- For `a_val = 3`: `target_b = 7 - 3 = 4`. Smallest `b \\ge 4` in `B` is `4`. Candidate score: `3 + 4 = 7`. `min_vasya_score = 7`.\n- For `a_val = 4`: `target_b = 7 - 4 = 3`. Smallest `b \\ge 3` in `B` is `3`. Candidate score: `4 + 3 = 7`. `min_vasya_score = 7`.\n- ... (and so on for other `a_val`s, candidates `4+3=7`, `4+3=7`, `5+3=8`, `6+3=9`)\n`S_V_worst = 7`.\n\n**Step 2: Count participants $\\ge S_V_worst` (i.e., $\\ge 7$)**\n`A` (asc): `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B` (asc): `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n`count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 5` (`n-1`)\n\n1. `A[0]=3, B[5]=8`. `3+8=11 \\ge 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a=1, ptr_b=4`.\n2. `A[1]=4, B[4]=6`. `4+6=10 \\ge 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a=2, ptr_b=3`.\n3. `A[2]=4, B[3]=4`. `4+4=8 \\ge 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a=3, ptr_b=2`.\n4. `A[3]=4, B[2]=4`. `4+4=8 \\ge 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a=4, ptr_b=1`.\n5. `A[4]=5, B[1]=3`. `5+3=8 \\ge 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a=5, ptr_b=0`.\n6. `A[5]=6, B[0]=0`. `6+0=6 < 7`. `ptr_a=6`.\nLoop ends (`ptr_a = 6`).\nThe `count` is 5. So, the worst rank is 5.\n\nFinal output: `1 5`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Sorting `A` and `B`: `O(N log N)`.\n- Calculating `S_V_worst`: `N` binary searches on `B`, each `O(log N)`.
