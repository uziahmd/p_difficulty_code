Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving \"Flawed Flow\" - My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Flawed Flow\" problem. It's an undirected graph with capacities on the edges, and I need to direct those edges to create a valid flow. The source is 1, the sink is *n*, and I need to ensure flow conservation at all internal nodes, no incoming edges at the source, and no cycles.  The crucial part here is the no-cycles constraint – that screams \"DAG\" to me.\n\nMy initial analysis focused on flow conservation. For every internal vertex, the incoming flow *must* equal the outgoing flow. This means `sum(in) - sum(out) = 0` for all `v` between 1 and *n*. The source only has outgoing edges, so `sum(out) > 0`, and the sink only has incoming edges, so `sum(in) > 0`.  Essentially, the total flow leaving the source *must* equal the total flow entering the sink.\n\nThe cycle restriction and flow conservation are a tight constraint. This points towards a topological ordering or a tree-like structure.  If I can find a topological sort, I'm likely on the right track. I'll need to think about a way to orient the edges.\n\nI'm thinking about maintaining a \"balance\" for each vertex. Initially, every balance is zero. When I direct an edge *u* -> *v* with flow *c*, the balance of *u* decreases by *c*, and the balance of *v* increases by *c*. For vertices 1 and *n*, the balances will be nonzero, but all other vertices should have a balance of zero due to flow conservation. It seems a good approach. The total flow will be the sum of capacities of edges connected to the source.\n",
