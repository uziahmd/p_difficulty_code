His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing My Olympiad Rank**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best and worst possible ranks I could get in this Olympiad. I've got the number of participants (`n`), the minimum points I need (`x`), and the scores from the first tour (`a`) and second tour (`b`). The ranking is based on total points, and ties are broken by... well, we don't know the exact tiebreaker.\n\nThe key is that I don't know which score from the first tour corresponds to which score from the second. I have to strategically pair those scores to get the best and worst possible outcomes. My target is to have a total score of at least `x` from both tours.\n\nLet's start with the best rank. I want to *minimize* my rank. That means I need to maximize my total score and minimize the number of people who score *more* than I do. If others get the same score, I want to be ranked above them.\n\nTo get the highest possible total score, I'm going to sort both lists (`a` and `b`) in ascending order. Then, I'll pair the highest score from `a` with the highest score from `b`, as long as their sum is at least `x`. In this case, I'll essentially get the maximum possible score across all the participants.\n\nIn doing so, I'm going to place myself at the top of the leader board by getting the largest sum of scores. This would allow me to get the highest possible rank, as anyone who has the same score can get ranked after me.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given the scores from two tours and a minimum total score `x` Vasya achieved. The ranks are determined by the sum of points from both tours. If participants have the same total points, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n\nLet `n` be the number of participants and `x` be the minimum total points Vasya earned.\nLet `a` be the list of points from the first tour and `b` be the list of points from the second tour.\n\n**1. Finding the Best Rank**\n\nTo find Vasya's best rank, we want to:\na. Maximize Vasya's total score.\nb. Minimize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\nc. If other participants score the same as Vasya, Vasya should be placed ahead of them.\n\nThe best possible scenario for Vasya is to achieve the highest possible total score among all participants, provided this score is at least `x`.\nThe maximum possible score any participant can get is by pairing the largest score from `a` with the largest score from `b`.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order. The largest score in `a` is `a[n-1]` and in `b` is `b[n-1]`.\nIf Vasya takes `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, his score would be `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`.\nSince it's guaranteed that Vasya was present and achieved at least `x` points, and `a[n-1] + b[n-1]` is the maximum possible sum, if `a[n-1] + b[n-1] >= x`, then Vasya *can* achieve this score.\nIn this case, Vasya has the highest possible score. No one can score more than him. Therefore, his best rank is **1**.\n\n**2. Finding the Worst Rank**\n\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we want to:\na. Minimize Vasya's total score, subject to it being at least `x`.\nb. Maximize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\nc. If other participants score the same as Vasya, Vasya should be placed behind them.\n\nThis is a matching problem. We need to pair `n` scores from `a` with `n` scores from `b` to form `n` total scores. One of these pairs is Vasya's. We want to construct these pairs such that Vasya's rank is maximized (i.e., numerically largest).\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nTo maximize the number of people scoring higher than Vasya, and to make Vasya's score as low as possible (but at least `x`), we can try to pair the highest `a` scores with the highest `b` scores for other participants, and pair Vasya's `a` score with a `b` score such that their sum is `x` or slightly above `x`.\n\nConsider sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a_sorted = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]` (ascending)\n`b_sorted_desc = [b'_{n-1}, b'_{n-2}, ..., b'_0]` (descending) where `b'` is `b` sorted.\n\nWe can try to pair `a_i` with `b'_{n-1-i}`. This pairing strategy (smallest `a` with largest `b`, second smallest `a` with second largest `b`, etc.) is often used to minimize/maximize sums of products, but here we are summing. This specific pairing strategy (smallest with largest) tends to make sums more \"even\" or \"spread out\" if we consider `a_i + b'_{n-1-i}`.\n\nLet's re-examine the pairing strategy for the worst rank. We want to pair `a_i` with `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j` is Vasya's score, and this score is as low as possible (at least `x`). For all other `n-1` participants, we want to pair their remaining `a` and `b` scores such that as many as possible have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's total score.\n\nConsider `a` sorted in ascending order. For each `a_i`, we want to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To make Vasya's score `a_i + b_j` as small as possible, we should pick the smallest `b_j` that satisfies `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nFor each `a_i` from `a`, we are looking for a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of people who score *at least* Vasya's score, we can use a two-pointer approach or a greedy strategy.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's `a_V` and `b_V`. His score is `S_V = a_V + b_V`.\nThe remaining `n-1` participants need to be paired up from `a \\setminus \\{a_V\\}` and `b \\setminus \\{b_V\\}`.\nWe want to maximize the count of participants `k` such that `S_k >= S_V`.\n\nA more effective approach for the worst case:\nSort `a` in ascending order. Sort `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that for a certain pair `(a_V, b_V)` where `a_V + b_V >= x`, the number of other pairs `(a_k, b_l)` with `a_k + b_l >= a_V + b_V` is maximized.\n\nLet's count how many pairs `(a_i, b_j)` can be formed such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach for this:\nSort `a` in ascending order. Sort `b` in ascending order.\nInitialize `count = 0`.\nInitialize `left_a = 0` (pointer for `a`) and `right_b = n-1` (pointer for `b`).\nWhile `left_a < n` and `right_b >= 0`:\n  If `a[left_a] + b[right_b] >= x`:\n    This `a[left_a]` can be paired with `b[right_b]` to form a sum `S >= x`. This pair can be Vasya's, or it can be another participant's pair. We can form `count` such pairs.\n    Increment `count`.\n    Move `left_a` pointer to `left_a + 1`.\n    Move `right_b` pointer to `right_b - 1`.\n  Else (`a[left_a] + b[right_b] < x`):\n    The current `a[left_a]` is too small to reach `x` even with the largest available `b[right_b]`. To potentially reach `x` with `a[left_a]`, we would need an even larger `b` (which is not available or already used). So, `a[left_a]` cannot form a pair `S >= x` with any of the remaining `b` values from `b[0]` to `b[right_b]`.\n    We must use `a[left_a]` with a smaller `b` value (if `b[right_b]` is used by someone else, or if we are trying to make a pair for someone else).\n    Since we are trying to maximize the number of people with `S >= x`, we should consider using `a[left_a]` with some `b_k` (where `k < right_b`) to form a sum less than `x` (or use it in a way that doesn't contribute to `S >= x`).\n    The critical observation is: if `a[left_a] + b[right_b] < x`, then `a[left_a]` cannot form a sum `>= x` with any `b_k` where `k <= right_b`. Thus, `a[left_a]` cannot contribute to `count`. We should move `left_a` to consider the next `a` value.\n    Move `left_a` pointer to `left_a + 1`.\n\nThe `count` obtained from this two-pointer approach represents the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who *could* achieve a total score of at least `x`.\nIf Vasya is one of these `count` participants, and all `count-1` other participants also achieve `S >= x`, and the jury decides to place Vasya last among them, his rank would be `count`.\nThe remaining `n - count` participants will necessarily have scores less than `x` (because if they could make `x`, they would have been counted). These `n - count` participants will be ranked after the `count` participants.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank is `count`.\n\nLet's test this logic with the example:\n`n = 6, x = 7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nSorted `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nTwo-pointer for worst rank:\n`left_a = 0`, `right_b = 5`, `count = 0`\n\n1. `a[0] = 3`, `b[5] = 8`. `3 + 8 = 11 >= 7`. `count = 1`. `left_a = 1`, `right_b = 4`.\n2. `a[1] = 4`, `b[4] = 6`. `4 + 6 = 10 >= 7`. `count = 2`. `left_a = 2`, `right_b = 3`.\n3. `a[2] = 4`, `b[3] = 4`. `4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 3`. `left_a = 3`, `right_b = 2`.\n4. `a[3] = 4`, `b[2] = 4`. `4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 4`. `left_a = 4`, `right_b = 1`.\n5. `a[4] = 5`, `b[1] = 3`. `5 + 3 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 5`. `left_a = 5`, `right_b = 0`.\n6. `a[5] = 6`, `b[0] = 0`. `6 + 0 = 6 < 7`. `left_a = 6`. `right_b = 0`.\nLoop terminates because `left_a = 6` is no longer `< n`.\n\nThe `count` is 5. So, the worst rank is 5.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy works because we are trying to maximize the number of pairs that sum to at least `x`. By pairing the smallest available `a_i` with the largest available `b_j`, if their sum is `>= x`, we successfully form one such pair and remove both `a_i` and `b_j` from consideration. If `a_i + b_j < x`, then `a_i` cannot form a sum `>= x` with any of the remaining `b`'s (since `b_j` is the largest remaining). So, `a_i` must be paired with some `b_k` to form a sum `< x`. We effectively discard `a_i` for the purpose of forming sums `>= x` and move to `a_{i+1}`.\n\nFinal Answer Structure:\nBest rank: 1\nWorst rank: `count` from the two-pointer approach.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can always achieve the maximum possible score (max(a) + max(b))\n    # if that sum is >= x.
