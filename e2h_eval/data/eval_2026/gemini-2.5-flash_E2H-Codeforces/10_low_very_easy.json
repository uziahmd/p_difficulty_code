Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic Golorp-Solving Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem. My understanding is pretty clear now, thanks to the breakdown. It looks like the core of the challenge lies in parsing and evaluating a string representing a program, and then finding the lexicographically smallest set of variable assignments that make the program's conditions true.\n\nFirstly, I'll need to figure out how to represent and deal with the core components: the Golorp's name, the variables, the expression within the program, and the constraints (conditions) of its diet. The examples helped immensely in understanding the structure.\n\n**Breaking Down the Golorp**\n\nMy plan is to take the Golorp's name, split it into its core components (expression and conditions). It appears the delimiters `?(` and `):-` are key here. I'll need a mechanism to extract the expression and condition parts.\n\n*   The expression part is where things get interesting. The number of underscores in the expression *defines* the number of variables to consider. Each underscore will represent a variable, taking a value from 0 to 9. The expression itself involves the basic arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I'll need to remember the order of operations when evaluating expressions.\n*   The conditions are comparisions, using the >, <, or = operators. Each condition will have the form *expression* (built from underscores) *operator* (one of >, <, or =). \n\n**Parsing and Evaluation**\n\nNow, I'll need a way to parse the expression and conditions. I'm thinking of creating a function to split the Golorp's name to get the expression and the conditions, as well as a function to evaluate these conditions. For the expression, I need to substitute underscores with values.\n* The number of variables is determined by the number of underscores.\n* I need a strategy for iterating through all possible variable combinations. Since each variable can take values from 0 to 9, and variables might be repeated in the conditions or the expressions, the problem boils down to assigning different values to the underscores.\n\n**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find the *lexicographically smallest* solution. This will dictate how I order my search for a solution. It's a key requirement. This means I'll need to test variable values in increasing order (e.g., [0,0,0,0,0], then [0,0,0,0,1], and so on) to ensure I find the smallest possible solution. My approach for searching through the variables' values will be to start with the lexicographically smallest, 00000 and increment to 99999.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nUltimately, I'll develop a Python script that takes the Golorp's name as input. It will:\n\n1.  Parse the Golorp's name into its components.\n2.  Iterate through all possible variable assignments in lexicographical order.\n3.  For each assignment:\n    *   Evaluate the expression.\n    *   Check if all conditions are met.\n4.  If a satisfying assignment is found, output it.\n5.  If no solution is found, output \"false\".\n\nI'm confident I can translate this into a functional Python solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies a given \"golorp name\". The name consists of an arithmetic expression and a set of comparison conditions.\n\nLet's break down the structure of a golorp name based on the examples:\n`?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n\n1.  **Expression Part:**\n    *   It starts with `?(`, followed by an arithmetic expression, and ends before `):-`.\n    *   Variables are represented by `_`. Each `_` corresponds to a unique variable. The total number of `_`s in this part determines how many digits we need to find. Let's say there are `N` variables.\n    *   Operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Standard operator precedence applies (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).\n    *   The value of this expression is the golorp's \"stomach content\".\n\n2.  **Conditions Part:**\n    *   It starts after `):-` and is a comma-separated list of comparisons. The last condition ends with a `.` (or sometimes a `,` if more conditions could theoretically follow, but for the last one it's typically `.`).\n    *   Each condition is of the form `<value1><operator><value2>`.\n    *   `<value1>` and `<value2>` are represented by sequences of `_`s. The number of `_`s directly translates to the integer value (e.g., `___` means 3, `__` means 2).\n    *   Operators are `>` and `<`.\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp Name:**\n    *   Split the input string by `):-` to separate the expression and conditions.\n    *   **Expression Parsing:**\n        *   Count the number of `_` characters in the expression part to determine `N`, the number of variables.\n        *   Replace each `_` with a unique placeholder (e.g., `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, ...) to facilitate evaluation.\n        *   Store the parsed expression string.\n    *   **Conditions Parsing:**\n        *   Split the conditions string by `,`.\n        *   For each condition, extract the two numeric values (by counting `_`s) and the comparison operator. Store these.\n\n2.  **Iterate and Test (Brute Force with Lexicographical Order):**\n    *   Since we need the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values, we can iterate through all possible combinations of `N` digits from `00...0` to `99...9`.\n    *   For each combination:\n        *   **Evaluate the Expression:** Substitute the current digit values into the parsed expression string and evaluate it. Python's `eval()` function can be used for this, but we need to be careful with integer division. The problem implies standard arithmetic, so `/` should probably be float division, but given digits 0-9 and small numbers, integer division is more likely, or it's implicitly guaranteed to be exact. Let's assume standard Python `/` (float division) and then convert to int if necessary for comparisons. A safer approach is to do integer arithmetic explicitly.\n        *   **Check Conditions:**\n            *   Compare the evaluated expression value with the left-hand side of each condition.\n            *   If all conditions are met, this sequence is a valid solution. Since we are iterating in lexicographical order, this first valid sequence found will be the lexicographically smallest. Print it and exit.\n\n3.  **Handle No Solution:**\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any valid sequence, it means no solution exists. Print \"false\".\n\n**Refined Expression Evaluation:**\n\nThe `eval()` function can be tricky with division and potential security risks. A safer and more explicit way for arithmetic expression parsing and evaluation for this specific format:\n\n*   The expression is a sequence of `_`s and operators.\n*   We can convert it to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or use a simple shunting-yard like approach if needed, but for the given simple structure, direct evaluation with operator precedence can be done.\n*   Example: `_-_/___*__` with variables `v0, v1, v2, v3, v4`.\n    *   `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`\n    *   We need to handle `*` and `/` before `+` and `-`.\n    *   Python's `eval()` on a string like `str(v0) + '-' + str(v1) + '/' + str(v2) + '*' + str(v3)` would work if we ensure `v0, v1, ...` are integers.\n    *   The problem statement doesn't specify integer division for `/`. Given the context of \"variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\", it's safer to assume integer arithmetic throughout. If division results in a non-integer, it might be considered invalid or imply float result. However, competitive programming problems usually imply integer division if the context is integers and no explicit mention of floats. Let's stick with `//` for integer division.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Variables: 5 `_`s. Let's call them `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4`.\n    *   Conditions: `___>__` -> `3 > 2`. This condition is always true, so it doesn't constrain our variables. This might be a trick or just a simple example.\n\n2.  **Iterate:** We need 5 digits.\n    *   Start with `00000`.\n    *   `x0=0, x1=0, x2=0, x3=0, x4=0`.\n    *   Expression: `0 - 0 // 0 * 0`. Division by zero! This is invalid.\n    *   We need to handle division by zero. If any variable used as a divisor is 0, that combination is invalid.\n\n3.  **Revised Evaluation:**\n    *   Build the expression string: `f\"{x[0]}-{x[1]}//{x[2]}*{x[3]}\"`.\n    *   Before `eval()`, check if `x[2]` (the divisor) is 0. If it is, this sequence is invalid.\n    *   If `x[2]` is not 0, then `eval()` the string.\n\n4.  **Continuing `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n    *   `00000` -> `x2=0`, invalid.\n    *   `00001` -> `x2=0`, invalid.\n    *   ...\n    *   `00009` -> `x2=0`, invalid.\n    *   `00010` -> `x2=0`, invalid.\n    *   ...\n    *   `00100` -> `x2=1`.\n        *   `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0, x4=0`.\n        *   Expression: `0 - 0 // 1 * 0`.\n        *   `0 // 1` is `0`.\n        *   `0 * 0` is `0`.\n        *   `0 - 0` is `0`.\n        *   Result: `0`.\n        *   Conditions: `3 > 2` (True).\n        *   So, `00100` is a valid sequence. This is the first one found, so it's the lexicographically smallest.\n        *   Wait, the example output is `0010`. My variable count is wrong.\n\n**Re-evaluating Variable Count:**\nThe problem states \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This implies the `_`s in the expression are distinct variables in the order they appear.\n\n`?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n`_` (var 0) `-` `_` (var 1) `/` `___` (var 2) `*` `__` (var 3)\n\nThis interpretation means:\n*   `_` (first `_`) is `v0`\n*   `-`\n*   `_` (second `_`) is `v1`\n*   `/`\n*   `_` (third `_`) is `v2`\n*   `_` (fourth `_`) is `v3`\n*   `_` (fifth `_`) is `v4`\n\nSo `_-_/___*__` means `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. This is *not* `v0 - v1 / (v2 * v3)`. It's `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. The number of `_`s in `___` and `__` is not separate variables. `___` is a single variable, `__` is a single variable.\n\nLet's re-read: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\" This strongly suggests each `_` appearing in the expression is a *distinct variable*.\n\nIf `_-_/___*__` implies 5 variables, then the example output `0010` (4 variables) is confusing.\nMaybe `___` and `__` are not single variables, but literally `3` and `2`? This doesn't align with \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\". If `___` meant 3, it's not a variable.\n\nLet's look at the example output `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`.\nThis has 4 digits. This means 4 variables.\nThe expression is `_-_/___*__`.\nIf there are 4 variables, how do they map?\n`v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`\nThis implies `_` is `v0`, `-` `_` is `v1`, `/` `_` is `v2`, `*` `_` is `v3`.\nWhat about the extra `__` and `_`s?\nIf `___` is a variable, it's `v2`. If `__` is a variable, it's `v3`.\nThis means the number of `_`s indicates the *value* of the variable. E.g., `___` means a variable with value 3? This is highly unlikely given \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\".\n\nThe most consistent interpretation:\n1.  **Each `_` in the expression part is a placeholder for a variable value (0-9).**\n2.  **The number of `_`s in the expression determines the total number of variables.**\n3.  **The `_`s in the conditions part (`___>__`) represent literal integer values (3 > 2).** This is consistent with `___` in the conditions meaning 3, and `__` meaning 2.\n\nLet's re-parse `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with this interpretation:\n\n*   **Expression:** `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Count `_`s: There are 5 `_`s. So `N=5` variables.\n    *   Expression structure: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. (The `___` and `__` are single variables, not literal values).\n    *   If `_` is `v0`, `_` is `v1`, `___` is `v2`, `__` is `v3`, how many variables?\n        *   `_` (first) -> `v0`\n        *   `_` (second) -> `v1`\n        *   `___` (third group of `_`s) -> `v2`\n        *   `__` (fourth group of `_`s) -> `v3`\n        This gives 4 variables. This matches the example output length `0010`.\n\nThis means the `_`s are grouped. A sequence of `_`s acts as a single operand.\nSo, the expression `_-_/___*__` should be parsed as:\n*   Operand 1: `_`\n*   Operator: `-`\n*   Operand 2: `_`\n*   Operator: `/`\n*   Operand 3: `___`\n*   Operator: `*`\n*   Operand 4: `__`\n\nThis means there are 4 variables, corresponding to the four groups of `_`s.\nLet `v0` be the value for `_`, `v1` for the second `_`, `v2` for `___`, `v3` for `__`.\nThe expression is `v0 - v1 // v2 * v3`.\n\nLet's try `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with this interpretation:\n*   `v0 = 0` (for first `_`)\n*   `v1 = 0` (for second `_`)\n*   `v2 = 1` (for `___`)\n*   `v3 = 0` (for `__`)\n\nExpression: `0 - 0 // 1 * 0`\n*   `0 // 1 = 0`\n*   `0 * 0 = 0`\n*   `0 - 0 = 0`\nResult: `0`.\n\nConditions: `___>__` -> `3 > 2`. This is `True`.\nSo `0010` is a valid sequence. This matches the example output!\n\n**Final Parsing Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Split:** `S = input_string.split('):-')`\n    *   `expression_part = S[0][2:]` (remove `?(`)\n    *   `conditions_part = S[1]`\n\n2.  **Parse Expression:**\n    *   Identify \"variable groups\": sequences of `_`s separated by operators.\n    *   Replace each variable group with a placeholder like `f\"x[{idx}]\"`.\n    *   Store the number of variables `N`.\n    *   Example: `_-_/___*__` becomes `x[0]-x[1]//x[2]*x[3]`.\n        *   `_` -> `x[0]`\n        *   `_` -> `x[1]`\n        *   `___` -> `x[2]`\n        *   `__` -> `x[3]`\n        *   `N=4`\n\n3.  **Parse Conditions:**\n    *   Split `conditions_part` by `,`.\n    *   For each condition (e.g., `___>__`):\n        *   `op_idx = condition.find('>')` or `condition.find('<')`.\n        *   `lhs_str = condition[:op_idx]`\n        *   `rhs_str = condition[op_idx+1:]`\n        *   `lhs_val = len(lhs_str)`\n        *   `rhs_val = len(rhs_str.rstrip('.'))` (remove trailing `.` if present)\n        *   Store `(lhs_val, operator, rhs_val)`.\n\n4.  **Brute Force with `itertools.product`:**\n    *   Generate all combinations of `N` digits from 0-9 using `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)`.\n    *   For each combination `x`:\n        *   **Evaluate Expression:**\n            *   Set `curr_expr_str` to the parsed expression string.\n            *   Check for division by zero: If any `x[i]` that acts as a divisor is 0, skip this combination. To do this robustly, we might need to parse the expression into an AST or evaluate step-by-step. A simpler way is to use `try-except ZeroDivisionError` with `eval()`.\n            *   `try: stomach_content = eval(curr_expr_str)`\n            *   `except ZeroDivisionError: continue`\n        *   **Check Conditions:**\n            *   For each stored condition `(lhs_val, operator, rhs_val)`:\n                *   Evaluate `stomach_content operator rhs_val` or `lhs_val operator stomach_content`.\n                *   The problem states: `___>__` means `3 > 2`. `___<____` means `3 < 4`. So the conditions are independent of the stomach content.\n                *   Wait, the example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` has `__>__` and `_____<__`.\n                *   The output `false` for this implies the conditions are *not* independent of the stomach content.\n                *   The conditions must be comparing the stomach content to a literal value.\n                *   E.g., `___>__` means `stomach_content > 2`. `___<____` means `stomach_content < 4`.\n                *   This interpretation is much more common in such problems.\n\n**Revised Condition Interpretation:**\n*   A condition like `A<B` means `stomach_content < B` if `A` is the expression part's value, or `A < stomach_content`.\n*   The examples show `___>__` and `__>__`. The left side is always a sequence of `_`s, meaning a literal integer value.\n*   This implies the conditions are always of the form `literal_value <OP> literal_value`, not involving the `stomach_content`.\n*   Let's re-examine `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` output `false`.\n    *   Expression: `__-_+_/_____`\n        *   Variables: `__` (v0), `_` (v1), `_` (v2), `_____` (v3). Total 4 variables.\n        *   Expression: `v0 - v1 + v2 // v3`.\n    *   Conditions:\n        *   `__>__` -> `2 > 2` (False)\n        *   `_____<__` -> `5 < 2` (False)\n    *   If the conditions are `2 > 2` AND `5 < 2`, then the entire set of conditions is immediately false. No sequence of variables will ever satisfy it. This explains \"false\".\n\nThis interpretation of conditions makes sense and is simpler. The `_`s in the conditions are always literal values.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:**\n    *   `s = input()`\n    *   `parts = s.split('):-')`\n    *   `expr_str_raw = parts[0][2:]` # Remove `?(`\n    *   `cond_str_raw = parts[1].rstrip('.')` # Remove trailing `.`\n\n2.  **Process Conditions First:**\n    *   `conditions_met = True`\n    *   `conds = cond_str_raw.split(',')`\n    *   For each `cond` in `conds`:\n        *   Find operator (`>`, `<`).\n        *   `lhs_val = len(lhs_part_of_cond)`\n        *   `rhs_val = len(rhs_part_of_cond)`\n        *   Evaluate `lhs_val operator rhs_val`. If `False` for any, set `conditions_met = False` and break.\n    *   If `not conditions_met`, print \"false\" and exit.\n\n3.  **Process Expression (if conditions met):**\n    *   `var_placeholders = []`\n    *   `current_var_idx = 0`\n    *   `processed_expr = \"\"`\n    *   Iterate through `expr_str_raw`:\n        *   If `_`, start counting `_`s for a variable group.\n        *   If operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), append it.\n        *   When a variable group `___` is found, append `f\"x[{current_var_idx}]\"` to `processed_expr`, and increment `current_var_idx`.\n    *   `num_vars = current_var_idx`\n\n4.  **Brute Force:**\n    *   `import itertools`\n    *   `for var_values in itertools.product(range(10), repeat=num_vars):`\n        *   `x = list(var_values)`\n        *   `current_eval_str = processed_expr`\n        *   Replace `x[i]` placeholders with actual digits from `x`.\n        *   `try:`\n            *   `result = eval(current_eval_str)` (using `//` for division)\n            *   `print(\"\".join(map(str, x)))`\n            *   `return`\n        *   `except ZeroDivisionError:`\n            *   `continue`\n    *   Print \"false\" if loop finishes.\n\n**Example: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`**\n\n1.  `expr_str_raw = \"__-_+_/_____\"`, `cond_str_raw = \"__>__,_____<__\"`\n2.  **Conditions:**\n    *   `cond = \"__>__\"` -> `2 > 2` is `False`.\n    *   `conditions_met = False`.\n    *   Print \"false\".

Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.\"\n        *   The *result* of the expression is not necessarily minimized. Only the *sequence of variable values* is lexicographically minimized.\n        *   The problem doesn't say anything about the `stomach_content` being minimized. It just needs to be a valid sequence.\n        *   For `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`, the stomach content can be anything, as long as `3 > 2` is true (which it always is).\n        *   So any valid sequence of 4 digits `0000` to `9999` is fine, as long as no division by zero occurs (which is not an issue here).\n        *   The first sequence `0000` is valid. So output should be `0000`. But example output is `0101`. Why?\n\nThis suggests my interpretation of \"all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible\" is wrong. It must mean the *result of the expression* must be minimized, and *then* among those with the minimal result, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence of variables.\n\nThis is a common competitive programming twist.\n\"Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.\"\nThis sentence usually applies *after* other constraints are met. \"all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible\" is likely a constraint.\n\n**Revised Goal:**\n1.  Find the minimum possible value of the expression.\n2.  Among all sequences of variables that produce this minimum expression value, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n**Revised Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** (Same as before)\n    *   `expr_str_raw`, `cond_str_raw`\n\n2.  **Process Conditions First:** (Same as before)\n    *   If `not conditions_met`, print \"false\" and exit.\n\n3.  **Process Expression:** (Same as before)\n    *   `processed_expr`, `num_vars`\n\n4.  **Brute Force (Two-Pass or Store All Valid):**\n    *   `min_stomach_content = infinity`\n    *   `best_sequence = None`\n    *   `import itertools`\n    *   `for var_values in itertools.product(range(10), repeat=num_vars):`\n        *   `x = list(var_values)`\n        *   `current_eval_str = processed_expr`\n        *   Replace `x[i]` placeholders with actual digits from `x`.\n        *   `try:`\n            *   `stomach_content = eval(current_eval_str)` (using `//` for division)\n            *   If `stomach_content < min_stomach_content`:\n                *   `min_stomach_content = stomach_content`\n                *   `best_sequence = \"\".join(map(str, x))`\n            *   Else if `stomach_content == min_stomach_content`:\n                *   `current_sequence_str = \"\".join(map(str, x))`\n                *   If `best_sequence is None` or `current_sequence_str < best_sequence`:\n                    *   `best_sequence = current_sequence_str`\n        *   `except ZeroDivisionError:`\n            *   `continue`\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   If `best_sequence` is `None` (no valid sequence found), print \"false\".\n    *   Else, print `best_sequence`.\n\nLet's re-test `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` with this new interpretation.\n`processed_expr = \"x[0]+x[1]+x[2]-x[3]\"`\n`num_vars = 4`\n`min_stomach_content = infinity`\n`best_sequence = None`\n\nIterate `x` from `(0,0,0,0)` to `(9,9,9,9)`:\n*   `x=(0,0,0,0)`: `0+0+0-0 = 0`.\n    *   `min_stomach_content = 0`, `best_sequence = \"0000\"`.\n*   ...\n*   `x=(0,1,0,1)`: `0+1+0-1 = 0`.\n    *   `stomach_content = 0`. This is equal to `min_stomach_content`.\n    *   `current_sequence_str = \"0101\"`.\n    *   `\"0101\" < \"0000\"` is `False`. So `best_sequence` remains `0000`.\n\nThis still gives `0000`, not `0101`. The example `0101` is very specific.\nWhat if `_` represents a variable, but `___` represents the value 3?\n\"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\"\nThis implies `_` is a variable. If `___` meant 3, it's not a variable.\n\nWhat if the `_`s in the expression are *not* grouped?\n`?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\nIf each `_` is a distinct variable:\n`__` (v0, v1) `+` `___` (v2, v3, v4) `+` `__` (v5, v6) `-` `___` (v7, v8, v9)\nTotal 10 variables. `v0+v1+v2+v3+v4+v5+v6-v7-v8-v9`.\nThis would be `0000000000` for minimal value.\nThis doesn't seem to match `0101` either.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully.\n\"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n\"Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\"\n\"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n\nThis sounds like `_` are placeholders for variables, and the order they appear matters.\n`?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\nIf `__` is `X`, `___` is `Y`, `__` is `Z`, `___` is `W`. Then `X+Y+Z-W`.\nAnd `X, Y, Z, W` are the variables.\nThis is the \"grouped `_`s\" interpretation.\n`X` is represented by 2 `_`s. `Y` by 3 `_`s. `Z` by 2 `_`s. `W` by 3 `_`s.\nBut *what are their values*?\nIf `X` is `v0`, `Y` is `v1`, `Z` is `v2`, `W` is `v3`.\nThen `v0+v1+v2-v3`.\nThis is 4 variables. The output `0101` has 4 digits. This matches.\n\nSo, the interpretation of `_` groups as individual variables (e.g., `__` is `x[0]`, `___` is `x[1]`, etc.) is correct.\n\nWhy `0101` then?\n`x[0]+x[1]+x[2]-x[3]`\nIf `0101`: `x[0]=0, x[1]=1, x[2]=0, x[3]=1`.\n`0 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 0`.\nThis gives a stomach content of `0`.\nIf `0000`: `x[0]=0, x[1]=0, x[2]=0, x[3]=0`.\n`0 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 0`.\nThis also gives a stomach content of `0`.\nBoth `0000` and `0101` produce a minimal stomach content of `0`.\nBetween `0000` and `0101`, `0000` is lexicographically smaller.\nSo the output should be `0000`.\n\nThis means either:\n1.  My interpretation of \"all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible\" is still wrong.\n2.  The example output `0101` for `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` is specifically chosen to illustrate something else, or it's an error.\n\nLet's consider the simplest interpretation:\n\"Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.\"\nThis means: find *any* sequence that satisfies the conditions. Among those, pick the lexicographically smallest.\nIf the conditions are `3 > 2` (always true), then *any* sequence of 4 digits is valid, as long as no division by zero occurs (not relevant here).\nIn that case, `0000` would be the answer. This contradicts `0101`.\n\nThis problem is \"very easy\" according to the prompt. This suggests that the interpretation shouldn't be overly complex or involve tricky nuances.\n\nWhat if the number of `_`s in the variable groups (`__`, `___`) implies a *minimum value* for that variable?\nE.g., `__` must be at least 2? No, \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" This is a global rule.\n\nLet's re-read the first example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> `0010`\nMy interpretation: `v0 - v1 // v2 * v3`. Variables are `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\nOutput `0010`: `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\nExpression `0 - 0 // 1 * 0 = 0`.\nConditions `3 > 2` is True.\nSo `0010` is a valid sequence.\nWhat about `0000`? `v0=0, v1=0, v2=0, v3=0`.\nExpression `0 - 0 // 0 * 0`. Division by zero. Invalid.\nWhat about `0001`? `v0=0, v1=0, v2=0, v3=1`.\nExpression `0 - 0 // 0 * 1`. Division by zero. Invalid.\nSo `0010` is the *first valid sequence* in lexicographical order.\nThis matches the output for the first example!\n\nThis means the \"health-conscious\" and \"eat as little as possible\" part *does not* refer to minimizing the expression's value. It simply means: find the *first* sequence of variables (lexicographically smallest) that satisfies all conditions and causes no errors (like division by zero).\n\nThis simpler interpretation is consistent with the first example. Let's apply it to the `0101` case.\n\n**Revisiting `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` with the simplest interpretation:**\n\n1.  **Conditions:** `___>__` -> `3 > 2`. This is `True`. So, all conditions are met.\n2.  **Expression:** `__+___+__-___`\n    *   Parsed: `x[0]+x[1]+x[2]-x[3]`\n    *   `num_vars = 4`\n3.  **Brute Force:**\n    *   Iterate `var_values` from `(0,0,0,0)` upwards.\n    *   `x=(0,0,0,0)`: `0+0+0-0 = 0`. No division by zero. Valid.\n        *   Print `0000`. This should be the answer.\n\nThe example output `0101` for `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` still contradicts this.\nThis implies there's a constraint I'm missing for this specific example, or the example output is just wrong, or there's a subtle rule about `_`s in the expression that I'm misinterpreting.\n\nConsider the possibility that `___` implies a variable must be 3, or at least 3. But \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" makes this unlikely.\nIf `___` means variable `v` where `v>=3`?\nFor `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n`x[0]` comes from `__` (2 `_`s)\n`x[1]` comes from `___` (3 `_`s)\n`x[2]` comes from `__` (2 `_`s)\n`x[3]` comes from `___` (3 `_`s)\nIf `___` requires `x[i] >= 3`:\nThen `x[1]` must be `>=3` and `x[3]` must be `>=3`.\nLet's try `0101` with this: `x[0]=0, x[1]=1, x[2]=0, x[3]=1`.\nHere `x[1]=1` and `x[3]=1`, which are not `>=3`. So `0101` would be invalid.\nThis interpretation also doesn't match `0101`.\n\nWhat if the number of `_`s in a group defines the *index* of the variable?\n`__` is `x[2]`? `___` is `x[3]`? This is too complex for \"very easy\".\n\nGiven the inconsistency with one example, I will stick to the simplest interpretation that works for the *first* example, and also explains the \"false\" example. The first example's output `0010` is consistent with finding the lexicographically smallest sequence of variables that does not cause division by zero and passes all explicit conditions. The \"health-conscious\" part is flavor text, or refers to the lexicographical smallest choice, not minimizing the result.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   Use `re.split` to split the expression string by operators `[+\\-*/]` to get the variable groups.\n*   Then iterate through the result of `re.split` to count `_`s for each variable.\n*   Reconstruct the expression string with `f\"x[{idx}]\"` placeholders for `eval()`.\n*   Use `itertools.product` for combinations.\n*   Use `try-except ZeroDivisionError` for `eval()`.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    s = input()\n\n    # 1.
