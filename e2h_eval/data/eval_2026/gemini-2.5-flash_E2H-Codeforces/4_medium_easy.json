The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nMy task is to write a Python script for the Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. I realize the key is to avoid brute-force simulation for a large number of rounds (`n`).  The moves repeat cyclically, so the least common multiple (`lcm`) of the lengths of the two players' move sequences (`m` and `k`) gives the length of the repeating cycle.\n\nFirst, I need to define the game rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, with draws resulting in no change.  I'll use a helper function to encapsulate this logic, `get_result()`.\n\nI'll calculate the `lcm(m, k)` using the formula `(m * k) // gcd(m, k)`. The `math.gcd` function in Python is handy for this.  Then, I simulate a single cycle of length `lcm(m, k)`, tracking the losses for both players within this cycle.\n\nAfter the single cycle simulation, I divide the total number of rounds (`n`) by the cycle length to find the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. I multiply the losses from the single cycle by the number of full cycles to get the base number of losses. I handle any remaining rounds by simulating those separately, adding the losses to the totals. The results are printed to stdout. I'll make sure to read the input (n, sequences A and B) and output the results as specified by the problem.\n",
