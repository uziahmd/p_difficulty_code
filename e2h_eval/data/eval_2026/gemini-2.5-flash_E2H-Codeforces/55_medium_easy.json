    "thought": "**The Quest for the Lexicographically Smallest String**\n\nI'm tackling a fascinating string manipulation problem where I need to rearrange a string of '0's, '1's, and '2's to find the lexicographically smallest possible outcome.  The core challenge is the swapping rules:  '0' and '1' can trade places, and '1' and '2' can also swap, but crucially, '0' and '2' cannot swap directly.\n\nMy brain is immediately working on what these rules imply. The fact that '0' and '2' are fixed relative to each other is the key!  I can see that the sequence formed by extracting all '0's and '2's from the original string (let's call it `s_02`) will remain unchanged throughout any series of valid swaps.  This sequence `s_02` becomes a crucial constraint.\n\nThe '1's, on the other hand, are remarkably free-spirited. They can freely move past any '0' or '2', almost like they are a separate block of elements within the overall sequence.  This leads me to the idea of treating all '1's as a single, mobile unit.\n\nTo achieve lexicographical minimality, I need to arrange the string in the order: '0's first, then '1's, and finally '2's.  Since the '0' and '2' sequence is fixed by `s_02`, the main strategy comes down to: extracting `s_02`, counting the number of '1's, and then figuring out where to insert this block of '1's into `s_02`.\n\nThe optimal insertion point for the '1's is directly after the last '0' in s_02, before any '2's appear. That is, I'm identifying the first '2' in the `s_02` string and putting the '1's right before it.\n\nMy algorithm then becomes very straightforward: iterate the original string, extract `s_02` and count the '1's, then insert them. This will always give me the lexicographically smallest string. It is not complex at all!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly applying two types of swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' (e.g., \"01\" <-> \"10\")\n2. '1' and '2' (e.g., \"12\" <-> \"21\")\n\nThe key constraint is that '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of the allowed swaps:\n- A '0' can swap with an adjacent '1'. This means a '0' can effectively move past any '1' (to its left or right).\n- A '1' can swap with an adjacent '0' or '2'. This means a '1' is completely mobile; it can move past any '0' or any '2' (to its left or right).\n- A '2' can swap with an adjacent '1'. This means a '2' can effectively move past any '1' (to its left or right).\n\nThe crucial observation is about '0's and '2's: they cannot swap with each other. This means their relative order is fixed. If an original string has a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` with `i < j`, then in any reachable string, that specific '0' must still appear before that specific '2'. The same applies if a '2' appears before a '0'.\n\nThis implies that if we remove all '1's from the original string `s`, the resulting subsequence of '0's and '2's must remain invariant. Let's call this subsequence `s_02_chars`.\n\nSince '1's are completely mobile, all '1's in the string can be gathered into a contiguous block. This block of '1's can then be inserted at any position within the `s_02_chars` sequence.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\nGiven `s_02_chars` and the count of '1's (`count_1`), we need to find the optimal insertion point for the block of '1's.\n\nConsider `s_02_chars`. We want to have as many '0's as possible at the beginning of the final string.\n- Any '0' in `s_02_chars` that appears *before* any '2' in `s_02_chars` can be freely moved to the very beginning of the string (since it can move past any '1' and is not blocked by a '2').\n- Any '2' in `s_02_chars` will appear after any '0's that come before it in `s_02_chars`.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to:\n1. Collect all '0's from `s_02_chars` that appear *before* the first '2' in `s_02_chars`. These will form the initial part of our result string.\n2. After these initial '0's, append all `count_1` ones.\n3. Finally, append the rest of `s_02_chars`, starting from the first '2' (if any) and including any '0's that appear after that first '2'.\n\nLet's walk through the steps:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_parts` to store characters of the final string.\n2. Initialize `count_1 = 0`.\n3. Initialize `s_02_chars = []`.\n4. Iterate through the input string `s`:\n   - If `s_char` is '0', append it to `s_02_chars`.\n   - If `s_char` is '1', increment `count_1`.\n   - If `s_char` is '2', append it to `s_02_chars`.\n5. Find the index of the first '2' in `s_02_chars`. Let this be `first_2_idx`. If no '2' exists, `first_2_idx` can be considered `len(s_02_chars)`.\n6. Append characters from `s_02_chars[0]` to `s_02_chars[first_2_idx - 1]` to `result_parts`. These are all '0's.\n7. Append `count_1` '1's to `result_parts`.\n8. Append characters from `s_02_chars[first_2_idx]` to the end of `s_02_chars` to `result_parts`.\n9. Join `result_parts` to form the final string.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `count_1 = 0`, `s_02_chars = []`\n2. Iterate:\n   - '1': `count_1 = 1`\n   - '0': `s_02_chars = ['0']`\n   - '0': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0']`\n   - '2': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n   - '1': `count_1 = 2`\n   - '0': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3. After iteration: `count_1 = 2`, `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n4. `first_2_idx` in `s_02_chars` is 2 (the '2' at `s_02_chars[2]`).\n5. Append `s_02_chars[0]` and `s_02_chars[1]` ('0', '0') to `result_parts`. `result_parts = ['0', '0']`.\n6. Append `count_1` (2) '1's to `result_parts`. `result_parts = ['0', '0', '1', '1']`.\n7. Append `s_02_chars[2]` and `s_02_chars[3]` ('2', '0') to `result_parts`. `result_parts = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`.\n8. Join: `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis logic correctly handles all examples and edge cases (strings with no '1's, no '0's, or no '2's).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_1 = 0\n    s_02_chars = [] # This will store '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_1 += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # All '1's should be placed after the last '0' that appears before any '2',\n    # and before the first '2'.\n    \n    first_two_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_02_chars)):\n        if s_02_chars[i] == '2':\n            first_two_index = i\n            break\n    \n    result_list = []\n    if first_two_index == -1:\n        # No '2's in s_02_chars, so all are '0's.\n        # Place all '0's first, then all '1's.\n        result_list.extend(s_02_chars)\n        result_list.extend(['1'] * count_1)\n    else:\n        # Place '0's before the first '2'\n        result_list.extend(s_02_chars[:first_two_index])\n        # Place all '1's\n        result_list.extend(['1'] * count_1)\n        # Place the rest of '0's and '2's (from the first '2' onwards)\n        result_list.extend(s_02_chars[first_two_index:])\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_list) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
