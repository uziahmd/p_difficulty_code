The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design and Implementation for the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so the task is to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down. We have `n` houses in a ring, numbered 1 to `n`. Xenia starts at house 1, and needs to complete `m` tasks, each at a specific house `a[i]`. Movement is clockwise, one house at a time, taking one unit of time. The goal is to minimize the total time.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the problem. I'll use `current_house` to track Xenia's current location (initially 1) and `total_time` to accumulate the time (initially 0). The core of the solution is how to calculate the time to move from `current_house` to a `target_house = a[i]`. Since it's a ring, clockwise movement is key. If `target_house >= current_house`, the time is simply `target_house - current_house`. If `target_house < current_house`, it means Xenia needs to go all the way around the ring. The time in this case is `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n\nI'll use a loop to iterate through each task. Inside the loop, I'll calculate `time_taken` based on the logic described above, add it to `total_time`, and update `current_house` to `target_house`. Finally, I'll print `total_time`.\n\nNow for the Python code. I'll read `n` and `m` using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`, and the task houses `a` using `list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))`. No need for special data structures, just a simple list. Initializing `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`.  Then the main loop: for each `target_house`, calculate `time_taken` using that conditional logic (`if target_house >= current_house else ...`), add `time_taken` to `total_time` and update `current_house`. Finally, `print(total_time)`.\n\nI need to make sure this handles edge cases. If `target_house` is equal to `current_house`, then `time_taken` should be 0.  I've checked different combinations of inputs: houses at consecutive numbers, house at the same number, houses where you need to go around the ring, etc. That logic seems solid now. Also, I need to make sure about the time complexity. The loop goes through each task `m` times. All other operations inside the loop are constant. The read input is `O(m)`. This results in an overall time complexity of `O(m)`. The space complexity is `O(m)` for the list of tasks.  I am assuming the input fits within memory.\n\nI've tested the logic with multiple examples and made sure that it aligns with the expected output, I'm confident about my solution. Let's finalize this and submit!\n",
