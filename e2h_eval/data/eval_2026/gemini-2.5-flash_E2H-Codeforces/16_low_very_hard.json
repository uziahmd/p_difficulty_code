Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Crazy Town Problem: A Pathfinding Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem to tackle. It's about finding the shortest path between a home and a university within a city crisscrossed by roads. My understanding is that the roads are represented by linear equations, and moving from one \"block\" (region) to another means crossing a road. The core of this problem seems to be the minimal number of road crossings required.\n\nI'm given the home coordinates (x1, y1), the university coordinates (x2, y2), and the number of roads, 'n'. Each road is defined by an equation of the form ax + by + c = 0.\n\nThe key insight is recognizing how a road divides the plane. The sign of the expression ax + by + c, when evaluated for a given point (x, y), tells me which side of the line that point is on. If the home and the university are on opposite sides of a road, I *have* to cross that road to reach the university. If they are on the same side, I *don't necessarily* have to cross it.\n\nThis leads me to the algorithm: For each road, I need to check the signs of the expression ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci (for the home) and ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci (for the university). If the signs are different (their product is negative), then I *must* cross that road, and I'll increment my `steps` counter.  If the product is positive, the road does not separate the two points.  This means the solution is simply counting the number of roads that separate the home from the university. I just need to iterate through the roads, perform the sign checks, and tally up the crossings. It's a fairly elegant problem. Now, I should write the code!\n",
