They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on \"Mushroom Strife\"**\n\nOkay, this problem looks like a fun one.  I need a Python script to tackle this \"Mushroom Strife\" challenge. The core is assigning mushroom counts (positive integers) to a bunch of lawns (vertices) connected by roads (edges).  Each road has a GCD and LCM constraint that those mushroom counts *must* satisfy.\n\n**Breaking it Down**\n\nThe input gives me the number of lawns (`n`) and roads (`m`), along with the connection details:  `u`, `v`, `g`, `l` (lawns connected, GCD, LCM). The output needs to be \"YES\" followed by the mushroom counts if a solution exists, or \"NO\" otherwise.  I'm limited by `1 <= n, m <= 100000`, and `1 <= g, l <= 10^6`.\n\nThe key is that for any two numbers `a` and `b`, `gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b`.  This will be crucial.  Also, `g` must divide both `a` and `b`, while both `a` and `b` must divide `l`.  Furthermore, `l` has to be divisible by `g`; if that's not true, it's immediately \"NO\".\n\n**The Graph and Number Theory**\n\nThis screams graph theory! Lawns are vertices, roads are edges. I need to assign mushroom counts `x_i` to each vertex `i`. For an edge `(u, v)` with `g` and `l`, `gcd(x_u, x_v)` must be `g`, and `lcm(x_u, x_v)` must be `l`.  Since  `x_u * x_v = g * l` and  `g` divides both `x_u` and `x_v`, I can write `x_u = g * a'` and `x_v = g * b'`.  This forces `a'` and `b'` to be coprime, meaning their GCD is 1. Substituting gives us `l / g = a' * b'`.\n\nHere's the problem:  I need to find coprime factors `a'` and `b'` of `P = l / g`. This means the prime factors of `P` will decide this.  If `P = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ...`, then the prime powers are completely distributed to either `a'` or `b'`, in some order. For each prime, the full power must go to one or the other.  This implies `a'` must be a factor of `P`.\n\n**Finding the Strategy**\n\nLet's maintain mushroom counts `x_i` for each lawn.  I'll initialize them to some unassigned value (like 0). I can use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to group connected components of the graph.  If I can determine the value of one node in a connected component, the others become constrained. If `x_i` is assigned, then for any neighbor `j`,  `x_j = (g * l) / x_i` . The value of `x_j` is uniquely determined, and I can check consistency with `gcd(x_i, x_j)`.\n\nWith DSU, for an edge `(u, v, g, l)` within the same set,  I have to ensure `gcd(x_u, x_v)` is `g`.  If they are in different sets, I merge them and relate the values. Each node in a DSU set will have a `factor_val` to relate to the root. But with GCD/LCM constraints, that won't directly work. It turns out working with the prime factor exponents is the key.\n\nFor each edge and prime number, I have `min` and `max` constraints on the prime exponents of the assigned values of the two vertices. Specifically, for each prime dividing `P = l/g`, either the prime is with power `l` or with power `g`. For those not dividing `P`, the exponent is fixed.\n\n**Developing the Algorithm**\n\nI think a BFS or DFS will work well here for each connected component. Let's start with precomputing. I'll need a sieve to get the prime factors for all numbers up to `10^6` so I can factorize `l/g`. The number of coprime factor choices for a connected component will be `2^k` where `k` is the number of *distinct* prime factors of `l/g`.\n\n1.  **Precompute**: Sieve to get primes.
