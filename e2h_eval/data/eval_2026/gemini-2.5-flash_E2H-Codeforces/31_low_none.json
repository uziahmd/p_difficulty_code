Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The Core Logic - Minimizing the Card Count**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem and I need a Python script to crack it. The gist is, Vanya needs to get the total sum of his cards to zero. I've got the constraints locked in: `n` cards, values from `-x` to `x`.\n\nThe input format is clear: number of cards and the maximum value, then the cards themselves.  The objective is simple: find the *minimum* number of new cards needed.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the `current_sum` of the existing cards. If it's zero, great, no new cards are needed. If not, I need to figure out what sum I need to *get* to zero, that's my `target_sum_needed`. It will always be the negative of the `current_sum`.\n\nNow, the clever bit. Each new card can contribute anywhere from `-x` to `x`.  My strategy is clear: I want to use as *few* cards as possible. I should try to make each new card contribute as much as it *can* towards that `target_sum_needed`.  \n\nThink of it this way: to get to zero, each new card should reduce the *absolute value* of the remaining sum I need to get to zero. The maximum reduction per card is `x`. Therefore, I simply divide the absolute value of the `current_sum` by `x` and take the ceiling of that result to get the minimum cards. If `current_sum` is already 0, the answer is 0. That's the core of the solution. Let's get that code going.\n",
