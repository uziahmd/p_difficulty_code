Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of it is pretty straightforward: we've got a street of length *l*, and *n* lanterns scattered along it. Each lantern illuminates a certain radius *d*. The goal is to figure out the *minimum* value of *d* needed to light up the entire street, from 0 to *l*.\n\nMy first instinct is to think about the *critical* points - where the street *isn't* lit, or where we need the *most* light coverage.\n\n1.  **Sorting is key.**  Before anything else, I'm definitely going to sort the lantern positions.  The order is going to be crucial for identifying gaps and the distances that matter.  Let's call these sorted positions `a_0, a_1, ... a_{n-1}`.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Gaps:**  Now, let's break down the areas that *could* be unlit.\n    *   **The beginning:**  The segment from 0 to the first lantern's position, `a_0`.  The distance `a_0` determines how much light we need from the first lantern, so `d >= a_0`.\n    *   **The end:**  Similarly, from the last lantern's position, `a_{n-1}`, to the end of the street *l*. We need the last lantern to cover the difference `l - a_{n-1}`, so `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n    *   **Between Lanterns:**  The trickier part is the space between consecutive lanterns.  For any two lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the middle point, `(a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`, represents the *worst case* scenario.  Each lantern has to cover half of the gap. The minimum *d* here is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum `d`:** So, what we're looking for is the biggest of these critical distances.  We have three values: `d_1 = a_0`, `d_2 = l - a_{n-1}`, and `d_3 = max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)` across all pairs of adjacent lanterns. The final answer `d` is the maximum value from the calculations: `d = max(d_1, d_2, d_3)`.\n\nEffectively, this means finding the biggest gap and making sure that our minimum `d` value can cover that particular gap.\n\nIn the second sample, with `n=2`, `l=5`, and `a=[2,5]`, this strategy will find the correct solution. It's a problem of carefully analyzing and covering the potential \"blind spots\" on the street. It's all about gap analysis.\n",
