Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing \"Crazy Town\" - A Pathfinding Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's essentially a pathfinding exercise. The goal is clear: figure out the fewest steps to get from home to university, navigating this grid-like structure created by these infinite roads.  Thinking about it, each step is defined by crossing a single road.  That's the key constraint.  The core of this has to be about *which* roads we *must* cross.\n\nThe problem smartly guarantees that neither starting point is *on* a road, which simplifies things.  I can treat each road as a separator.  A given road divides the plane into two distinct regions.  The crucial question becomes: are home and the university on the *same* side of a road, or on *opposite* sides?\n\nThat's when the math comes in. I can define each road with the standard linear equation, and then use the sign of the result when plugging in the coordinates of home and university.  If the signs are the same, they're on the same side.  Different signs, and they're separated by the road.\n\nNow, it's becoming crystal clear. The minimum number of steps is directly related to the number of roads that separate them! If home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road *must* be crossed.  If they're on the same side, that road is irrelevant in *the minimum* number of steps.  This means the solution is just the count of roads that have different signs for home and university. So it's a simple counting problem once I define the math. That's the core logic I'm going to implement.\n",
