The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Xenia and Ringroad Problem: My Pythonic Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with crafting a Python script to tackle the Xenia and Ringroad problem. My initial thought process involves a methodical decomposition of the problem's core elements. Let's start with the givens:  we have `n` houses in a ring, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks to complete. We're given an array `a_i`, which indicates the house where each task `i` needs to be done. Xenia, our protagonist, begins at house 1 and must complete the tasks sequentially in the order given by the `a` array. Movement is clockwise only.\n\nThe crux of the matter is minimizing the total time, so I'll need to figure out an efficient way to calculate the movement time between each task location. My instinct is to calculate each leg of her journey individually and sum them.\n\nThe first step is determining the time taken to complete the very first task. Xenia is at house 1 and needs to go to `a_1`. I can express this time calculation as  `(a_1 - current_house + n) % n`, where `current_house` is initialized as 1.\n\nI'm making sure this covers all cases.  If `a_1` is greater or equal to `current_house`, then it directly translates to `a_1 - current_house`. If `a_1` is smaller, Xenia needs to go all the way around the ring, adding `n - current_house` plus `a_1`. This expression generalizes all cases, and the modulus ensures we're calculating clockwise distance within the ring.\n\nThis logic extends to subsequent tasks. For any given task `i > 1`, Xenia starts from house `a_{i-1}` (where the previous task was completed) and needs to move to `a_i`. The time taken for this move is again, `(a_i - current_house + n) % n`. After each task, `current_house` is updated to the location where the task was completed.\n\nTo be precise, I can refine the time calculation even further, using an `if-else` statement: if the `target_house >= current_house`, the travel time is simply the difference. Otherwise, it is the `n - current_house` plus the `target_house`.\n\nI'm thinking I'll initialize a `total_time` variable to accumulate the time from each task. Now, let's test my approach with the sample given: `n=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3]`. This will validate the implementation. I'm ready to write some Python!\n",
