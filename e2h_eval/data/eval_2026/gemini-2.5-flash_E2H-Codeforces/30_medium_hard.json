Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**TV Game Dynamic Programming Solution**\n\nAlright, so here's the deal. We've got this \"TV Game\" problem, and it's screaming dynamic programming. We're given a 2n-digit number, `A`, and two players, Homer and Marge, have to each take *n* digits.  The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers they form.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in the fact that the *order* in which a player takes the digits matters.  Each digit's contribution depends on its position within their number, and that position, in turn, depends on how many other digits they've already taken.\n\nI realized the key is this: for each digit, we have to decide if Homer or Marge takes it.  That decision influences two things: which number the digit gets added to *and* the multiplier (power of 10) applied to that digit. This setup screams DP, so that's the approach I've designed.\n\nHere's my DP state: `dp[i][h_moves][m_moves]`. This represents the *maximum* value achievable from the digits starting at index `i` of `A`, given that Homer has already taken `h_moves` digits, and Marge has taken `m_moves` digits.\n\nThe base case is when we've processed all the digits (`i == 2n`). If both players have taken their *n* moves (h_moves and m_moves are each n), we get a valid solution so we return 0. If not, return negative infinity (or a tiny number), representing an invalid solution.\n\nThe recursive step is the core. For the current digit `A[i]`, we have two options: either Homer takes it or Marge takes it. If `h_moves < n` we consider the option of Homer taking the digit and the contribution to their number is the digit value times 10 to the power of `n-1-h_moves` and calling the next step. If `m_moves < n`, Marge can take it. We compute the values for both options and then *take the maximum* of those, and store it in the dp table. I'm also storing who made the optimal choice ('H' or 'M') to later reconstruct the solution. I'm using an extra matrix called `choice[i][h_moves][m_moves]` to hold the choice for each state for path reconstruction.\n\nThe state dimensions are `2n` for `i`, `n+1` for `h_moves`, and `n+1` for `m_moves`. That's a total of `2n * (n+1) * (n+1)` states, which is totally manageable, even for the largest *n* given. I precompute powers of 10 to speed up calculations. The main function is where this DP calculation takes place and the best path is constructed.\n\nSo, in the end, by building this DP table and backtracking through it, I can find the optimal move sequence and calculate the maximum total value of Homer and Marge's numbers!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer (H) and Marge (M) to maximize their total prize, given a 2n-digit number A. Each player must make exactly n moves. When a player takes a digit, it's appended to their number. The value of a player's number is formed by concatenating the digits they collected.\n\nLet S1 be Homer's number and S2 be Marge's number. We want to maximize S1 + S2.\nConsider the digits of A as `d_0, d_1, ..., d_{2n-1}`.\nWhen a player takes a digit `d_i`, its position in their final n-digit number determines its contribution to the total value. If `d_i` is the `k`-th digit (0-indexed) a player takes, it will contribute `d_i * 10^(n-1-k)` to that player's score.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\n\n**State Definition:**\nLet `dp[idx][h_count][m_count]` represent the maximum possible additional prize value from processing digits `A[idx]` through `A[2n-1]`, given that Homer has already made `h_count` moves and Marge has made `m_count` moves.\n\n**Base Case:**\n*   If `idx == 2*n` (all digits have been processed):\n    *   If `h_count == n` and `m_count == n`: This is a valid sequence of moves, so the additional prize is 0.\n    *   Otherwise: This is an invalid sequence (one or both players didn't make `n` moves), so we return `-float('inf')` to indicate an impossible path.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\nFor `dp[idx][h_count][m_count]`:\nThe current digit to consider is `A[idx]`. Let `current_digit_val = int(A[idx])`.\n\n1.  **Homer takes `A[idx]`:**\n    *   This move is possible only if `h_count < n`.\n    *   The contribution of `current_digit_val` to Homer's score will be `current_digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - h_count)`.\n    *   The total value for this option is `current_digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - h_count) + solve(idx + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `A[idx]`:**\n    *   This move is possible only if `m_count < n`.\n    *   The contribution of `current_digit_val` to Marge's score will be `current_digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - m_count)`.\n    *   The total value for this option is `current_digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - m_count) + solve(idx + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)`.\n\n`dp[idx][h_count][m_count]` will be the maximum of the values from the possible options. We also store the choice ('H' or 'M') that led to this maximum value in a separate `choice` table to reconstruct the path later. If both options yield the same maximum value, either choice is acceptable (the problem states \"output any of them\").\n\n**Dimensions of DP tables:**\n*   `idx`: `0` to `2n` (size `2n + 1`)\n*   `h_count`: `0` to `n` (size `n + 1`)\n*   `m_count`: `0` to `n` (size `n + 1`)\nFor `n=18`, `2n=36`. The DP table size is roughly `37 * 19 * 19`, which is about 13,000 states. Each state involves a few arithmetic operations and two recursive calls. This is efficient enough.\n\n**Precomputation:**\nTo quickly calculate `10^k`, we can precompute powers of 10 up to `10^(n-1)`. An array `powers_of_10[k]` will store `10^k`.\n\n**Reconstruction:**\nAfter computing the `dp` table, we start from `(0, 0, 0)` and follow the choices stored in the `choice` table until `idx` reaches `2n`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit to accommodate the maximum recursion depth (2*n, which is 36 for n=18).\n# Default is 1000, which is already sufficient, but it's good practice for DP problems.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Global variables to store problem parameters and DP tables\nn = 0\nA = \"\"\npowers_of_10 = []\ndp = []\nchoice = []\n\ndef solve(idx, h_count, m_count):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum total prize from digits A[idx:] given current counts of moves.\n\n    Args:\n        idx (int): Current index in the number A.\n        h_count (int): Number of moves Homer has made so far.\n        m_count (int): Number of moves Marge has made so far.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum additional prize value, or -float('inf') if the path is invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: All digits processed\n    if idx == 2 * n:\n        # If both players made exactly n moves, this is a valid path, contributes 0 to future prize.\n        if h_count == n and m_count == n:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            # If move counts don't match n, this path is invalid.\n            return -float('inf')\n\n    # Memoization: If the result for this state is already computed, return it.\n    if dp[idx][h_count][m_count] != -1:\n        return dp[idx][h_count][m_count]\n\n    current_digit_val = int(A[idx])\n    max_val = -float('inf')\n    best_player_choice = ''\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n    if h_count < n:\n        # Calculate contribution: current_digit_val * 10^(position_in_Homer's_number)\n        # position_in_Homer's_number is h_count (0-indexed)\n        # The multiplier is 10^(n - 1 - h_count)\n        val_H = current_digit_val * powers_of_10[n - 1 - h_count] + solve(idx + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)\n        if val_H > max_val:\n            max_val = val_H\n            best_player_choice = 'H'\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n    if m_count < n:\n        # Calculate contribution: current_digit_val * 10^(position_in_Marge's_number)\n        # position_in_Marge's_number is m_count (0-indexed)\n        # The multiplier is 10^(n - 1 - m_count)\n        val_M = current_digit_val * powers_of_10[n - 1 - m_count] + solve(idx + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)\n        # If Marge's choice yields a strictly better value, update.\n        # If it's equal to max_val, we keep the previous choice (Homer's if it was set),\n        # as the problem allows any valid solution in case of ties.\n        if val_M > max_val:\n            max_val = val_M\n            best_player_choice = 'M'\n\n    # Store the computed max_val and the choice that led to it.\n    dp[idx][h_count][m_count] = max_val\n    choice[idx][h_count][m_count] = best_player_choice\n    return max_val\n\ndef main():\n    global n, A, powers_of_10, dp, choice\n\n    # Read input\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Precompute powers of 10. powers_of_10[k] stores 10^k.\n    powers_of_10 = [1] * n\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        powers_of_10[k] = powers_of_10[k-1] * 10\n\n    # Initialize DP table with -1 (indicating not computed)\n    # Dimensions: (2*n + 1) for idx, (n + 1) for h_count, (n + 1) for m_count\n    dp = [[[-1 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(2 * n + 1)]\n    # Initialize choice table with empty strings\n    choice = [[['' for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(2 * n + 1)]\n\n    # Start the DP calculation from the initial state (index 0, 0 moves for both players)\n    solve(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the sequence of moves\n    result_moves = []\n    current_idx = 0\n    current_h_count = 0\n    current_m_count = 0\n\n    while current_idx < 2 * n:\n        player_move = choice[current_idx][current_h_count][current_m_count]\n        result_moves.append(player_move)\n\n        # Update counts based on the chosen move\n        if player_move == 'H':\n            current_h_count += 1\n        else: # player_move == 'M'\n            current_m_count += 1\n        current_idx += 1\n\n    # Print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_moves) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```",
