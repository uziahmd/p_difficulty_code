Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**X-Pattern Grid Validation Algorithm**\n\nAlright, I need to devise a Python script to analyze a square grid and determine if it represents an 'X' pattern based on a specific set of rules.  The grid dimensions will be `n x n`, where `n` is an odd number between 3 and 299.  Essentially, I'm going to receive a list of strings, each representing a row of characters in the grid, and I need to process them.\n\nThe crucial rules are crystal clear:  Characters along the two main diagonals must all be identical, and these characters must be *different* from all other characters in the grid.  All characters not on the diagonals must also be identical.  This is a classic pattern recognition problem.\n\nMy plan involves first reading the input, likely using `input()` to get `n`, and then a loop or list comprehension to build the 2D grid structure, `paper[row][col]`.  I'll store the characters from the grid as strings. Then, I'll initiate two variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I'll also start with a boolean flag, `is_x_form` set to `True`, assuming the grid is an X until proven otherwise.\n\nI'll then iterate through each cell of the grid (row `r`, column `c`). I'll use `if` conditions to check if a cell is on a diagonal (`r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`).\n\nIf a cell *is* on a diagonal, and `diag_char` hasn't been set, I'll assign the cell's character to `diag_char`. If `diag_char` is already set, I'll compare the cell's character to `diag_char`.  A mismatch means it's not an X, so I'll set `is_x_form` to `False` and break out of both loops immediately.\n\nIf a cell *isn't* on a diagonal, I'll do the same for `other_char`.  Check if the current character matches other_char, and if not, flip `is_x_form` and break the loops.\n\nAfter completing the iteration, or if I break early, I will check the `is_x_form` flag.  If it's still `True`, I need one final check: I have to ensure that `diag_char` and `other_char` are different. If they are the same, it's not an X, so I'll set `is_x_form` to False.  Finally, I will output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nThe fact that `n` is odd and >= 3 simplifies things significantly. The center cell will always be on both diagonals, so I can use that to my advantage during the validation checks. The input constraints are clean (small English letters).\n\nI'll make sure to handle standard input correctly, assuming the first line is `n` and the following `n` lines are the grid rows.  This should be a straightforward implementation, and I'll make it as efficient as possible.\n",
