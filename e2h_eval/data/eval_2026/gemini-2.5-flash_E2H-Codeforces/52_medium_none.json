Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Plan for Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, Vasily starts with some candles, they burn for an hour, and then you can recycle burned-out candles into new ones. The goal is to figure out the total number of hours Vasily can keep the lights on.\n\nMy strategy is to simulate this candle-burning process step-by-step.  I'll keep track of a few key variables:  `total_hours` (the total light time), `current_new_candles` (how many candles Vasily has at the beginning of an iteration), and `burned_out_candles` (the number of used candles that can be recycled).\n\nHere's how it'll work in a loop: I'll use the current new candles to light up the room, adding to `total_hours`.  Then, I'll update the `burned_out_candles` count. I'll recycle as many burned candles as possible to get new ones. I'll update the count of burned out candles.  Then, I'll repeat this until Vasily has no more new candles.\n\nTo handle the input, I'll read from `sys.stdin`, assuming a single line of input for each test case. Each line will contain two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (candles needed to make a new one).  I'll parse these numbers, run the simulation, and print the resulting `total_hours`.\n\nI'm confident this iterative approach will be efficient enough given the constraints. I've walked through the logic with a couple of examples to make sure it's correct.  I've double-checked edge cases, like when `a=1` and `b=2`. I also considered that the example in the problem description is a list of test cases, which makes me think that the submission environment will probably provide input as separate lines through `sys.stdin`. The main loop will handle multiple test cases efficiently. I'll make sure to remove any comments and make it as concise as possible. The imports needed are just `sys`, no need for helper functions.\n",
