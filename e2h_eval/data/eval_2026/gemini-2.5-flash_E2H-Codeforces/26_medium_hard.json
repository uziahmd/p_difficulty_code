Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to efficiently count the number of non-degenerate triangles possible given integer sides with specific ranges. The key here is the non-degeneracy condition: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. I see that with the given constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, the triangle inequalities simplify considerably because `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` will always hold true. The only crucial condition becomes `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought is to iterate through all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and check the condition. But the input ranges, especially `D`, can be quite large (up to 500,000). A naive triple loop would be too slow.  I need to find a more clever way to avoid excessive iteration.\n\nLet's focus on the `x + y > z` inequality. For fixed values of `x` and `y`, the valid values of `z` are those between `C` and `D`, but also strictly less than `x + y`. So, `z` needs to be in the range `C <= z < x + y`.  This immediately suggests that for fixed `x` and `y`, I can quickly count valid `z` values. The number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe crucial thing is that this count depends on the sum `x + y`. So, instead of looping over all `x` and `y`, I can iterate through possible values of the sum `S = x + y`.  The smallest value for `S` is `A + B`, and the largest is `B + C`. So `S` can range from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each sum `S`, I need to count how many pairs `(x, y)` from the given ranges add up to `S`, say this count as `g(S)`. Then, I need to know how many z values works for that fixed sum, say this count as `f(S)`. Finally, the solution is the sum of products of g(S) and f(S) for all possible values of S.\n\nTo find `g(S)`, I recognize it involves finding the number of pairs `x` and `y` that fulfill `x + y = S` while also satisfying the bounds `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`. I can express `y` as `S - x`, and then I can write the constraints as `A <= x <= B` and `B <= S - x <= C`. This can be rearranged to give me a valid range of `x`: `max(A, S - C) <= x <= min(B, S - B)`. The number of `x` values within this range, if any, is my `g(S)`. If the range is empty there is no valid pairs, thus `g(S)=0`.\n\nTo find `f(S)`, I use the previous insight that valid z values fall in the range `[C, min(D, S-1)]`. I just take the size of this range: `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)` which effectively means no triangle is possible, or a non-negative count.\n\nNow I have two functions, `f(S)` and `g(S)`, which are relatively easy to compute. I need to multiply these functions for each possible value of `S`. By doing this carefully, I avoid the cubic time complexity of triple loops and get a linear time solution with respect to the magnitude of the largest number. This is a very efficient way to handle this calculation. This is the logic I will implement in code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the given conditions: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we can derive some useful inequalities:\n- Since `x >= A >= 1` and `z >= C >= y`, it implies `x + z > y` is always true. (`z >= y` and `x >= 1` means `z + x >= y + 1 > y`).\n- Similarly, since `y >= B >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`, it implies `y + z > x` is always true. (`y >= x` and `z >= 1` means `y + z >= x + 1 > x`).\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet's rephrase the problem using a summation. We need to sum over all valid `x` and `y` values, and for each `(x, y)` pair, count the number of valid `z` values.\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, the conditions for `z` are:\n- `C <= z <= D` (from the input constraints)\n- `z < x + y` (from the triangle inequality)\n\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values for a given `(x, y)` pair is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`. Let's call this `count_z(x, y)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x` from `A` to `B`, `y` from `B` to `C`, and for each `(x, y)` pair, calculate `count_z(x, y)`. The number of `(x, y)` pairs can be up to `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1)`, which in the worst case could be `(5 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}`, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Notice that `count_z(x, y)` only depends on the sum `S = x + y`. Let `f(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThen the total count of triangles is `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} f(x + y)`.\n\nWe can reorder the summation by grouping pairs `(x, y)` that have the same sum `S`:\n`TotalTriangles = sum_{S} (number of pairs (x, y) such that A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x + y = S) * f(S)`\n\nLet `g(S)` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\nThe range for `x` is `[A, B]`.\nThe range for `y` is `[B, C]`.\nSince `y = S - x`, the conditions for `y` become `B <= S - x <= C`.\nThis implies `S - C <= x <= S - B`.\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`, the valid range for `x` is `[max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)]`.\nSo, `g(S) = max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\n\nThe possible values for `S = x + y` range from `A + B` (minimum `x` + minimum `y`) to `B + C` (maximum `x` + maximum `y`).\nThe maximum value for `A, B, C, D` is `5 \\cdot 10^5`.\nSo, `S` can range from `1 + 1 = 2` up to `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nIterating `S` from `A + B` to `B + C` involves at most `(B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1` iterations. In the worst case, this is `5 \\cdot 10^5 - 1 + 1 = 5 \\cdot 10^5` iterations. This is efficient enough.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `S` from `A + B` to `B + C` (inclusive).\n3. For each `S`:\n   a. Calculate `x_min_for_S = max(A, S - C)`.\n   b. Calculate `x_max_for_S = min(B, S - B)`.\n   c. If `x_min_for_S > x_max_for_S`, then `g(S) = 0` (no valid `(x, y)` pairs for this `S`), so continue to the next `S`.\n   d. Otherwise, `g(S) = x_max_for_S - x_min_for_S + 1`.\n   e. Calculate `z_min_for_S = C`.\n   f. Calculate `z_max_for_S = min(D, S - 1)`.\n   g. If `z_min_for_S > z_max_for_S`, then `f(S) = 0` (no valid `z` values for this `S`).\n   h. Otherwise, `f(S) = z_max_for_S - z_min_for_S + 1`.\n   i. Add `g(S) * f(S)` to `total_triangles`.\n4. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nThe maximum value of `total_triangles` can be large (up to `~2.5 \\cdot 10^{17}`), so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable. The time complexity is `O(C - A)` which is `O(MAX_VAL)`, and space complexity is `O(1)`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`S` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n\n- For `S = 3`:\n  - `x_min = max(1, 3-3) = 1`, `x_max = min(2, 3-2) = 1`. `g(3) = 1-1+1 = 1`. (Pair: `x=1, y=2`)\n  - `z_min = 3`, `z_max = min(4, 3-1) = min(4, 2) = 2`. `z_min > z_max`, so `f(3) = 0`.\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n- For `S = 4`:\n  - `x_min = max(1, 4-3) = 1`, `x_max = min(2, 4-2) = 2`. `g(4) = 2-1+1 = 2`. (Pairs: `x=1, y=3` and `x=2, y=2`)\n  - `z_min = 3`, `z_max = min(4, 4-1) = min(4, 3) = 3`. `f(4) = 3-3+1 = 1`. (Valid `z`: `3`)\n  - `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n- For `S = 5`:\n  - `x_min = max(1, 5-3) = 2`, `x_max = min(2, 5-2) = 2`. `g(5) = 2-2+1 = 1`. (Pair: `x=2, y=3`)\n  - `z_min = 3`, `z_max = min(4, 5-1) = min(4, 4) = 4`. `f(5) = 4-3+1 = 2`. (Valid `z`: `3, 4`)\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
