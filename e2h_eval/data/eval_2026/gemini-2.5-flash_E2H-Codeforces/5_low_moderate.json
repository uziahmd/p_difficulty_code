Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Colored Boots\" Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The goal is to maximize compatible pairs of left and right boots and output them. The input's straightforward: `n` boots on each side, color strings `l` and `r`.  Compatibility is defined by exact color matches or the wild card '?' matching anything.  The trick here is the constraint: `n` can go up to 150,000, which knocks out a straightforward max-flow approach. We're definitely looking at a greedy strategy.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize the boots by color.  26 letters, so let's use lists or queues to store the indices for each color and keep track of those '?' boots separately.  `left_boots[color_char]` and `right_boots[color_char]` for the specifics, and `left_q` and `right_q` for the question marks.\n\nThe core of this has to be a greedy approach.  The challenge is figuring out the *right* greedy strategy.  What's the most restrictive match? Exact matches are obviously most valuable, followed by one-sided '?' matches, and finally '?' pairs.  So, the intuitive move is to *prioritize* the most restrictive matches first to avoid boxing ourselves in later.\n\nBut does that *always* work?  It's that question mark that's making me pause.  Consider the scenario:\n`Left: a, ?`\n`Right: a, ?`\n\nShould I go for the exact match (a, a) first, or the ( ?, ?) match?  In this example, it doesn't seem to matter. Both lead to two pairs.\n\nLet's up the ante:\n`Left: a, b, ?`\n`Right: a, c, ?`\n\nIf I prioritize the `(a,a)` match, I'm left with `b, ?` on the left and `c, ?` on the right. Then, I can pair a `?` and `b`. The remaining boots can't make a pair and my total count will be 2.\nWhat if I had prioritized differently? What's the optimal strategy here? It looks like prioritizing the exact matches first *is* the way to go.\nI think I have the general plan. Sort by the priority, matching the most restrictive combinations first.\n1. Exact matches.\n2. One question mark.\n3. Both question marks.\n\nTime to code and see what happens.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs and list them. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors represented by strings `l` and `r`. A color can be a specific lowercase Latin letter or an indefinite question mark '?'. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as they have fewer options.\n\nLet's organize the boots by their colors. We can use lists of indices for each specific color and for the '?' color.\n- `left_color_indices[char_code]`: Stores 0-based indices of left boots with color `char_code`. (e.g., `left_color_indices[ord('a') - ord('a')]` for color 'a')\n- `right_color_indices[char_code]`: Stores 0-based indices of right boots with color `char_code`.\n- `left_q_indices`: Stores 0-based indices of left boots with color '?'.\n- `right_q_indices`: Stores 0-based indices of right boots with color '?'.\n\nWe iterate through all possible specific colors ('a' through 'z'). For each color `c`:\n1. **Match specific color `c` with specific color `c`**: We try to pair as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible. The number of such pairs is `min(len(left_color_indices[c]), len(right_color_indices[c]))`. We add these pairs to our result list and remove the used boots from their respective lists.\n\nAfter matching all specific-specific pairs, we are left with some specific-colored boots and all the '?' boots. Now, we proceed with matching specific-colored boots with '?' boots.\n\n2. **Match specific color `c` with '?'**: For each specific color `c` (from 'a' to 'z'):\n   - We match any remaining left boots of color `c` with available right '?' boots. The number of such pairs is `min(len(left_color_indices[c]), len(right_q_indices))`. We add these pairs and remove used boots.\n   - We match any remaining right boots of color `c` with available left '?' boots. The number of such pairs is `min(len(right_color_indices[c]), len(left_q_indices))`. We add these pairs and remove used boots.\n\nFinally, after all specific-specific and specific-question mark matches, the only boots remaining are '?' boots.\n\n3. **Match '?' with '?'**: We pair any remaining left '?' boots with remaining right '?' boots. The number of such pairs is `min(len(left_q_indices), len(right_q_indices))`. We add these pairs.\n\nBy following this greedy strategy, we ensure that specific-specific matches are prioritized, which is optimal because these matches are the most restrictive. Then, specific-question mark matches are prioritized over question mark-question mark matches, which is also optimal because using a '?' boot with a specific color leaves fewer options for that specific color.\n\nLet's trace the logic with an example:\nLeft: `a, b, ?` (indices 0, 1, 2)\nRight: `a, c, ?` (indices 0, 1, 2)\n\nInitialization:\n`left_color_indices['a'] = [0]`, `left_color_indices['b'] = [1]`\n`right_color_indices['a'] = [0]`, `right_color_indices['c'] = [1]`\n`left_q_indices = [2]`\n`right_q_indices = [2]`\n`pairs = []`\n\n1. **Specific-specific matches:**\n   - For 'a': `min(len(left_color_indices['a']), len(right_color_indices['a'])) = min(1, 1) = 1`.\n     Pair `(0, 0)`. `pairs = [(1, 1)]`.\n     `left_color_indices['a'] = []`, `right_color_indices['a'] = []`.\n   - For 'b', 'c', ... 'z': No specific-specific matches.\n\n   Remaining:\n   `left_color_indices['b'] = [1]`\n   `right_color_indices['c'] = [1]`\n   `left_q_indices = [2]`\n   `right_q_indices = [2]`\n\n2. **Specific-question mark matches:**\n   - For 'a': No remaining specific 'a' boots.\n   - For 'b': `left_color_indices['b'] = [1]`\n     `min(len(left_color_indices['b']), len(right_q_indices)) = min(1, 1) = 1`.\n     Pair `(1, 2)` (left 'b' index 1 with right '?' index 2). `pairs = [(1, 1), (2, 3)]`.\n     `left_color_indices['b'] = []`, `right_q_indices = []`.\n   - For 'c': `right_color_indices['c'] = [1]`\n     `min(len(right_color_indices['c']), len(left_q_indices)) = min(1, 1) = 1`.\n     Pair `(2, 1)` (left '?' index 2 with right 'c' index 1). `pairs = [(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)]`.\n     `right_color_indices['c'] = []`, `left_q_indices = []`.\n\n   Remaining: All lists are empty.\n\n3. **Question mark-question mark matches:**\n   `min(len(left_q_indices), len(right_q_indices)) = min(0, 0) = 0`. No more pairs.\n\nTotal pairs: 3.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Use `collections.defaultdict(list)` to store indices for each specific color.\n- Iterate through `ord('a')` to `ord('z')` for colors.\n- Remember to convert 0-based indices to 1-based indices for output.\n\nThe time complexity will be:\n- Populating the lists: O(N)\n- Specific-specific matches: O(26 * N_max_per_color) which is O(N) in total, as each boot is processed at most once.\n- Specific-question mark matches: O(26 * N_max_per_color) which is O(N) in total.\n- Question mark-question mark matches: O(N)\nOverall, the time complexity is O(N).\nThe space complexity is O(N) to store the indices.\nGiven `N <= 150000`, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 0-based indices of boots for each color\n    # Using a list of lists for specific colors (index 0-25 for 'a'-'z')\n    # and separate lists for '?'\n    left_color_indices = [[] for _ in range(26)]\n    right_color_indices = [[] for _ in range(26)]\n    left_q_indices = []\n    right_q_indices = []\n\n    # Populate the lists\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_q_indices.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_color_indices[ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_q_indices.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_color_indices[ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
