Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan for finding those three vertices.**  The goal is to get an angle that's as close as possible to the target angle, all within the geometry of a regular *n*-gon. Since I'm working with inscribed angles, I know that the angle subtended by an arc is directly related to the number of edges on that arc.\n\nThe core idea is to fix the vertex of the angle (let's call it vertex 2, no real loss of generality here), and then figure out the best position for the other two vertices.  I can express all possible angles formed by vertices as multiples of `180/n`, where the multiple `k` represents the number of edges separating the two outer vertices (on the arc that *doesn't* include vertex 2).  This `k` can range from 1 to `n-2`.\n\nMy strategy will involve going through all valid `k` values, calculate the angle it produces (by using the relation `k * (180/n)`), and find the one that gives me an angle closest to the target angle *a*. To keep things precise and avoid float math if possible, I'll work with the integer `k*180` and `a*n`, and compare absolute differences between these.\n\nFinally, once I have the best `k`, I just need to determine the vertices. The logic for this is simple, just set `v1=1, v2=2, v3=k+2`. This way I make sure that the arc between vertices 1 and 3 that does not contain vertex 2 has `k` edges as required to achieve the `k`th angle.  This is a nice, straightforward way to ensure the angle calculation will work!",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertex indices.\n\n**Geometric Properties of a Regular N-gon:**\n1.  All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  An angle inscribed in a circle (like `v1-v2-v3`) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n3.  For a regular `n`-gon, the angle subtended by each edge at the center of the circumcircle is `360/n` degrees.\n4.  Therefore, the angle subtended by each edge at any other vertex on the circumcircle (not an endpoint of the edge) is `(1/2) * (360/n) = 180/n` degrees.\n\n**Possible Angles:**\nLet `v2` be the vertex of the angle. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1-v3` (the arc that does not contain `v2`).\nIf this arc `v1-v3` consists of `k` edges of the regular `n`-gon, then the angle `v1-v2-v3` will be `k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nWhat are the possible values for `k`?\n*   `k` must be at least 1, because `v1` and `v3` must be distinct vertices. If `k=1`, `v1` and `v3` are adjacent on the arc not containing `v2`.\n*   `k` must be at most `n-2`. This is because `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` must be distinct. If `v1` and `v3` are chosen, there are `n-2` other vertices. `v2` must be one of these `n-2` vertices. The arc `v1-v3` not containing `v2` can have at most `n-2` edges. For example, if `v1` and `v3` are chosen such that the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) has `n-2` edges, then `v2` must be the only remaining vertex, and the angle `v1-v2-v3` would be the internal angle of the regular `n`-gon.\n\nSo, the possible angles that can be formed are `k * (180/n)` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`:**\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nTo avoid potential floating-point precision issues, we can transform the expression. Since `n` is positive, minimizing `|k * (180/n) - a|` is equivalent to minimizing `|n * (k * (180/n) - a)|`, which simplifies to minimizing `|k * 180 - a * n|`.\n\nLet `target_product = a * n`. We will iterate `k` from `1` to `n-2` and find the `k` that minimizes `abs(k * 180 - target_product)`.\n\n**Constructing the Output Vertices:**\nOnce we find the `optimal_k`, we need to choose three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` that form an angle of `optimal_k * (180/n)` degrees.\nA simple and consistent choice is:\n*   `v1 = 1`\n*   `v2 = 2`\n*   `v3 = optimal_k + 2`\n\nLet's verify this choice:\n1.  **Distinct vertices:**\n    *   `v1 = 1` and `v2 = 2` are distinct.\n    *   Since `optimal_k >= 1`, `v3 = optimal_k + 2 >= 3`. Thus, `v3` is distinct from `v1` and `v2`.\n2.  **Valid vertex indices:**\n    *   `v1=1` and `v2=2` are valid.\n    *   Since `optimal_k <= n-2`, `v3 = optimal_k + 2 <= (n-2) + 2 = n`. Thus, `v3` is a valid vertex index (from 1 to `n`).\n3.  **Correct angle:** With `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3=optimal_k+2`, the arc `v1-v3` (the one not containing `v2`) starts at vertex 1 and goes clockwise to vertex `optimal_k+2`. The vertices on this arc are `1, 3, 4, ..., optimal_k+2`. The number of edges on this arc is `(optimal_k+2) - 1 - 1 = optimal_k`. (For example, if `optimal_k=1`, `v3=3`, the arc is `1-3` which has 1 edge. If `optimal_k=2`, `v3=4`, the arc is `1-3-4` which has 2 edges). This confirms the angle `v1-v2-v3` will be `optimal_k * (180/n)`.\n\nThis approach guarantees a valid set of vertices for any `n >= 3`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=4, a=68`):**\n1.  `n=4, a=68`.\n2.  `target_product = a * n = 68 * 4 = 272`.\n3.  Initialize `min_abs_diff_product = infinity`, `optimal_k = -1`.\n4.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-2 = 4-2 = 2`:\n    *   **`k=1`**:\n        *   `current_product = 1 * 180 = 180`.\n        *   `abs_diff_product = abs(180 - 272) = 92`.\n        *   `min_abs_diff_product = 92`, `optimal_k = 1`.\n    *   **`k=2`**:\n        *   `current_product = 2 * 180 = 360`.\n        *   `abs_diff_product = abs(360 - 272) = 88`.\n        *   Since `88 < 92`, update: `min_abs_diff_product = 88`, `optimal_k = 2`.\n5.  After loop, `optimal_k = 2`.\n6.  Output vertices: `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3=optimal_k+2 = 2+2 = 4`.\n    Result: `1 2 4`.\n    This corresponds to an angle of `2 * (180/4) = 90` degrees. `abs(90-68) = 22`.\n    The sample output is `4 1 2`, which also gives an angle of 90 degrees. Both are valid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The possible angles that can be formed by three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\n    # (where v2 is the vertex of the angle) in a regular n-gon are of the form\n    # k * (180 / n) degrees.\n    # Here, 'k' represents the number of edges on the arc connecting v1 and v3\n    # that does NOT contain v2.\n    # The value of k can range from 1 to n-2, inclusive.\n\n    # To avoid floating-point precision issues, we want to minimize |k * (180/n) - a|.\n    # Multiplying by n (which is positive) transforms this into minimizing\n    # |k * 180 - a * n|.\n\n    target_product = a * n\n    \n    min_abs_diff_product = float('inf')\n    optimal_k = -1\n\n    # Iterate through all possible values of k\n    # k ranges from 1 up to n-2.
