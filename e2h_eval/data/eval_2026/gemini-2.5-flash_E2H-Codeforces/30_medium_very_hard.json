Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Dynamic Programming Approach to the TV Game Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core challenge is maximizing the sum of two numbers formed by strategically assigning digits from a given number `A` to two players, Homer and Marge.  My initial thought was to use dynamic programming, which seems like the right tool for the job given the bounded input size (n <= 18) and the need to make optimal choices at each step.\n\nI started by clearly understanding the rules: each player takes `n` digits, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their resulting numbers. The twist is that the *order* in which digits are taken significantly impacts the value of each player's number due to the base-10 representation.  This led me to the concept of place value and its relevance in the computation.\n\nInitially, I considered a state that might represent the current sum and the sequence of moves. But quickly, I realized that storing the exact numbers `S1` and `S2` would be computationally expensive. The numbers could become massive! So, I shifted my focus towards storing partial sums and the decisions (H or M) that led to them.\n\nI decided to represent the problem using a DP table where each cell `dp[h][m]` stores the maximum possible sum of `S1 + S2` after Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits. The key is to keep track of the decisions (H or M) using the number of moves `h` and `m` so that when a digit is assigned to a player, it's multiplied by the correct power of 10. The state includes the maximum sum and a string representing the sequence of moves that achieve this sum.\n\nThis led me to the iterative approach: I'll loop through all possible combinations of moves for Homer and Marge, considering each digit from `A` in order.  For each digit, I'll evaluate the outcomes of Homer or Marge taking it. The multiplier for each digit is calculated based on its position within the players' numbers. This is where `10^(n - current position)` comes into play. For each possible digit assignment, I'll update the `dp` table if the resulting sum is greater than the current maximum sum for that state.\n\nUltimately, by the time I reach the state where both players have taken their `n` digits, `dp[n][n]` will contain the maximum possible sum and the corresponding optimal move sequence, which is what I'm after. I'll need to work through the base cases and the transitions carefully to ensure I'm getting the right values to build this table. It's really the crucial decision process at each step that requires thorough analysis to build the `dp` table correctly.  And I'll need to be mindful of tie-breaking scenarios as I'm sure there could be multiple solutions that yield the same sum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of `2n` moves (Homer 'H' or Marge 'M') such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and the total sum of their resulting numbers, `S1 + S2`, is maximized. The number `A` consists of `2n` digits. In each turn, the leftmost digit of `A` is taken and appended to the current player's number.\n\nLet's analyze how `S1` and `S2` are formed. If Homer takes `n` digits, say `d_{i_1}, d_{i_2}, ..., d_{i_n}` in that order, his number `S1` will be formed by these digits. The first digit he takes, `d_{i_1}`, will be in the `10^{n-1}` place, the second digit `d_{i_2}` in the `10^{n-2}` place, and so on, until the `n`-th digit `d_{i_n}` in the `10^0` place.\nSo, `S1 = d_{i_1} \\cdot 10^{n-1} + d_{i_2} \\cdot 10^{n-2} + \\dots + d_{i_n} \\cdot 10^0`.\nSimilarly for `S2`.\n\nThe key insight for a dynamic programming approach is to realize that the contribution of a digit `d_k` (the `k`-th digit of `A`, 0-indexed) to `S1` or `S2` depends on two things:\n1. Its value `int(A[k])`.\n2. Its place value, which in turn depends on *how many digits the player has already taken* when they take `d_k`.\n\nLet `h` be the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and `m` be the number of digits Marge has taken so far. The current digit being considered from `A` is `A[h+m]` (since `h+m` digits have already been processed).\n\nIf Homer takes `A[h+m]`: This will be his `(h+1)`-th digit. Its contribution to `S1` will be `int(A[h+m]) \\cdot 10^{n-(h+1)}`.\nIf Marge takes `A[h+m]`: This will be her `(m+1)`-th digit. Its contribution to `S2` will be `int(A[h+m]) \\cdot 10^{n-(m+1)}`.\n\nWe can define a DP state `dp[h][m]` as a tuple `(max_total_prize, path_string)`.\n`max_total_prize`: The maximum sum `S1 + S2` accumulated so far by assigning `h` digits to Homer and `m` digits to Marge from the first `h+m` digits of `A`.\n`path_string`: The sequence of 'H' and 'M' moves that achieves this `max_total_prize`.\n\n**DP State Definition:**\n`dp[h][m]` stores the maximum possible `(S1_partial + S2_partial)` value and the corresponding move sequence, where `S1_partial` is the sum of contributions of `h` digits assigned to Homer and `S2_partial` is for `m` digits assigned to Marge.\n\n**Base Case:**\n`dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")` (Initially, no digits taken, total prize is 0, path is empty).\nAll other `dp[h][m]` are initialized to `(float('-inf'), \"\")` to indicate they are unreachable or have a very low value.\n\n**Transitions:**\nWe iterate through the total number of moves `k` from `0` to `2n-1`. For each `k`, we iterate through possible values of `h` (number of moves Homer has made) from `0` to `min(k, n)`. The number of moves Marge has made `m` will be `k - h`.\n\nFor each state `(h, m)` that is reachable (i.e., `dp[h][m][0]` is not `float('-inf')`):\nLet `current_digit_val = int(A[k])`.\n1. **Homer takes `A[k]`:**\n   If `h < n` (Homer can still make a move):\n     `h_new = h + 1`\n     `m_new = m`\n     `value_added_by_homer = current_digit_val * (10**(n - h_new))`\n     `new_total_value = dp[h][m][0] + value_added_by_homer`\n     `new_path = dp[h][m][1] + 'H'`\n     If `new_total_value > dp[h_new][m_new][0]`:\n       `dp[h_new][m_new] = (new_total_value, new_path)`\n     Else if `new_total_value == dp[h_new][m_new][0]`:\n       (The problem states \"If there are several solutions, output any of them\", so we can just keep the existing path or update with `new_path`. A common tie-breaking rule in competitive programming is to choose the lexicographically smallest path, which is `new_path` if `new_path < dp[h_new][m_new][1]`. We'll implement this for consistency, though it's not strictly required.)\n       `if new_path < dp[h_new][m_new][1]:`\n         `dp[h_new][m_new] = (new_total_value, new_path)`\n\n2. **Marge takes `A[k]`:**\n   If `m < n` (Marge can still make a move):\n     `h_new = h`\n     `m_new = m + 1`\n     `value_added_by_marge = current_digit_val * (10**(n - m_new))`\n     `new_total_value = dp[h][m][0] + value_added_by_marge`\n     `new_path = dp[h][m][1] + 'M'`\n     If `new_total_value > dp[h_new][m_new][0]`:\n       `dp[h_new][m_new] = (new_total_value, new_path)`\n     Else if `new_total_value == dp[h_new][m_new][0]`:\n       `if new_path < dp[h_new][m_new][1]:`\n         `dp[h_new][m_new] = (new_total_value, new_path)`\n\n**Final Result:**\nAfter iterating through all `k` up to `2n-1`, the maximum total prize and the corresponding path will be stored in `dp[n][n]`. We output `dp[n][n][1]`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n* **Time Complexity:** The DP table has `(n+1) * (n+1)` states. Each state `(h, m)` is processed once. For each state, we perform constant time operations (arithmetic, string concatenation). The loop for `k` runs `2n` times, and inside it, `h` runs `n` times. So, total operations are roughly `O(n^2 * 2)` transitions. String concatenation `dp[h][m][1] + 'H'` takes `O(k)` time, where `k` is the length of the string (up to `2n`). So, the total time complexity is `O(n^2 * 2n) = O(n^3)`. Given `n <= 18`, `18^3 = 5832`, which is very fast.\n* **Space Complexity:** The DP table stores `(n+1) * (n+1)` states. Each state stores a large integer and a string of length up to `2n`. So, `O(n^2 * 2n) = O(n^3)` for strings, or `O(n^2)` if we reconstruct the path using parent pointers. Using `O(n^3)` for strings is fine for `n=18` as `18^3` is small.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=2, A=1234):**\n`A = \"1234\"`\n`n = 2`\n`dp` table initialized with `(float('-inf'), \"\")`.\n`dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n\n`k=0` (digit `A[0]=1`):\n  `h=0, m=0`: `dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=1, m_new=0`. `val_add = 1 * 10^(2-1) = 10`. `new_total = 10`. `new_path = \"H\"`.\n      `dp[1][0] = (10, \"H\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=0, m_new=1`. `val_add = 1 * 10^(2-1) = 10`. `new_total = 10`. `new_path = \"M\"`.\n      `dp[0][1] = (10, \"M\")`\n\n`k=1` (digit `A[1]=2`):\n  `h=0, m=1`: `dp[0][1] = (10, \"M\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=1, m_new=1`. `val_add = 2 * 10^(2-1) = 20`. `new_total = 10 + 20 = 30`. `new_path = \"MH\"`.\n      `dp[1][1] = (30, \"MH\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=0, m_new=2`. `val_add = 2 * 10^(2-2) = 2`. `new_total = 10 + 2 = 12`. `new_path = \"MM\"`.\n      `dp[0][2] = (12, \"MM\")`\n  `h=1, m=0`: `dp[1][0] = (10, \"H\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=2, m_new=0`. `val_add = 2 * 10^(2-2) = 2`. `new_total = 10 + 2 = 12`. `new_path = \"HH\"`.\n      `dp[2][0] = (12, \"HH\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=1, m_new=1`. `val_add = 2 * 10^(2-1) = 20`. `new_total = 10 + 20 = 30`. `new_path = \"HM\"`.\n      `dp[1][1]` is `(30, \"MH\")`. `new_total` is `30`. `new_path=\"HM\"` is lexicographically smaller than `\"MH\"`.\n      `dp[1][1] = (30, \"HM\")`\n\n`k=2` (digit `A[2]=3`):\n  `h=0, m=2`: `dp[0][2] = (12, \"MM\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=1, m_new=2`. `val_add = 3 * 10^(2-1) = 30`. `new_total = 12 + 30 = 42`. `new_path = \"MMH\"`.\n      `dp[1][2] = (42, \"MMH\")`\n    Marge: `m=2`, so `m < n` is false.

Let's recheck `dp[2][2]` update from `(2,1)` state:\n`k=3`, `h=2, m=1`, `dp[2][1] = (42, \"HHM\")`. Digit `A[3]=4`.\n  Marge takes `A[3]`: `h_new=2, m_new=2`. `val_add = 4 * 10^(2-2) = 4`.\n  `new_total = 42 + 4 = 46`. `new_path = \"HHMM\"`.\n  `dp[2][2]` is currently `(float('-inf'), \"\")`.\n  So `dp[2][2]` becomes `(46, \"HHMM\")`.\n\nThis means `HMMH` with value `64` comes from `(1,2)` state:\n`k=3`, `h=1, m=2`, `dp[1][2] = (60, \"HMM\")`. Digit `A[3]=4`.\n  Homer takes `A[3]`: `h_new=2, m_new=2`. `val_add = 4 * 10^(2-2) = 4`.\n  `new_total = 60 + 4 = 64`. `new_path = \"HMMH\"`.\n  This updates `dp[2][2]` to `(64, \"HMMH\")`.\nThis is the issue. My manual trace was correct. The example output is `HHMM` (sum 46), but `HMMH` gives sum 64. This implies that the example output is not necessarily the optimal solution, or my interpretation of the problem or calculation is wrong.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"maximizes their total prize\".\n`S1` is number formed by Homer's digits, `S2` by Marge's.\n`n=2, A=1234`.\n`HHMM`: S1 = 12, S2 = 34.

Let's confirm:\nH takes `A[0]=1` (1st H move) -> `S1` is `1` (value `1 * 10^1 = 10`)\nM takes `A[1]=2` (1st M move) -> `S2` is `2` (value `2 * 10^1 = 20`)\nM takes `A[2]=3` (2nd M move) -> `S2` is `23` (value `3 * 10^0 = 3`)\nH takes `A[3]=4` (2nd H move) -> `S1` is `14` (value `4 * 10^0 = 4`)\nTotal sum = `(10+4) + (20+3) = 14 + 23 = 37`. My calculation for `HMMH` was 37.\nThe DP trace got `dp[1][2] = (60, \"HMM\")`. This means `S1_partial + S2_partial = 60` for `HMM`.\n`HMM`:\nH takes `A[0]=1` (1st H move) -> `10`\nM takes `A[1]=2` (1st M move) -> `20`\nM takes `A[2]=3` (2nd M move) -> `3`\nSum of contributions for `HMM` is `10+20+3 = 33`.\nThe DP state `(60, \"HMM\")` is wrong.\n\nThe error is in the `value_added` calculation.\n`value_added_by_homer = current_digit_val * (10**(n-h_new))`\nThis is correct. `h_new` is `h+1`.\n`n=2`.\nFor `HMM`:\n`k=0`: `A[0]=1`.

No update.\n\nFinal result: `dp[2][2] = (64, \"HMMH\")`.\nThis still gives `HMMH` with sum 64.\nLet's manually re-verify `HMMH` sum `S1+S2`:\nHomer takes `A[0]=1` (1st move for H, `10^{2-1}` place) -> `10`\nMarge takes `A[1]=2` (1st move for M, `10^{2-1}` place) -> `20`\nMarge takes `A[2]=3` (2nd move for M, `10^{2-2}` place) -> `3`\nHomer takes `A[3]=4` (2nd move for H, `10^{2-2}` place) -> `4`\nTotal sum = `10+20+3+4 = 37`.\n\nMy DP calculation of `new_total_value` is incorrect.\n`dp[h][m][0]` is the *partial sum* of contributions from digits `A[0]` to `A[h+m-1]`.\nWhen we add `A[h+m]`, its `value_added` is correctly calculated.\nSo `new_total_value = dp[h][m][0] + value_added`. This logic seems sound.\n\nLet's check the example `n=2, A=9911`. Output `HMHM`.\n`HMHM`:\nH takes `A[0]=9` (1st H move, `10^{2-1}=10` place) -> `90`\nM takes `A[1]=9` (1st M move, `10^{2-1}=10` place) -> `90`\nH takes `A[2]=1` (2nd H move, `10^{2-2}=1` place) -> `1`\nM takes `A[3]=1` (2nd M move, `10^{2-2}=1` place) -> `1`\nTotal sum = `90+90+1+1 = 182`.\nLet's try `HHMM`:\nH takes `A[0]=9` (1st H move, `10^{2-1}=10` place) -> `90`\nH takes `A[1]=9` (2nd H move, `10^{2-2}=1` place) -> `9`\nM takes `A[2]=1` (1st M move, `10^{2-1}=10` place) -> `10`\nM takes `A[3]=1` (2nd M move, `10^{2-2}=1` place) -> `1`\nTotal sum = `90+9+10+1 = 110`.\n`182` is clearly greater than `110`. So `HMHM` is better than `HHMM` for `A=9911`.\n\nThe DP logic and calculation of place values seem to be correct. The discrepancy with `A=1234` example output might be due to the example output not necessarily being optimal, or my re-calculation of `HMMH` sum for `A=1234` was wrong.\nLet's re-re-re-check `HMMH` for `A=1234`.\nHomer's digits: `A[0]=1`, `A[3]=4`. `S1 = 1 \\cdot 10^1 + 4 \\cdot 10^0 = 10 + 4 = 14`.\nMarge's digits: `A[1]=2`, `A[2]=3`. `S2 = 2 \\cdot 10^1 + 3 \\cdot 10^0 = 20 + 3 = 23`.\nTotal `S1+S2 = 14+23 = 37`. My DP trace value of `64` for `HMMH` is definitely wrong.\nThe `new_total_value = dp[h][m][0] + value_added_by_homer` is correct. The `dp[h][m][0]` itself must have been wrong.\nThe only way `HMMH` gets 64 is if `dp[1][2]` was `60` and `A[3]=4` adds `4`.\n`dp[1][2]` was `(60, \"HMM\")`. `HMM` sum is `10+20+3 = 33`. So `dp[1][2]` should be `(33, \"HMM\")`.\nThis means the `new_total = 30 + 30 = 60` for `HMM` at `k=2` step was wrong.\n`dp[1][1] = (30, \"HM\")`. Marge takes `A[2]=3`. `val_add = 3 * 10^(2-1) = 30`.\n`new_total = dp[1][1][0] + val_add = 30 + 30 = 60`. This is the error.\n`val_add` for Marge's `(m+1)`-th digit is `3 * 10^(n-(m+1))`.\nAt `k=2`, `h=1, m=1`. Marge takes `A[2]=3`. This is Marge's `(1+1)=2`-nd digit.\nSo `val_add = 3 * 10^(2-2) = 3 * 10^0 = 3`.\nThe previous calculation was `3 * 10^(2-1) = 30`. This was the mistake.\n\nLet's fix that one critical line:\n`value_added_by_marge = current_digit_val * (10**(n-(m_new)))`\nMy previous trace used `10**(n-1)` for Marge's second digit. It should be `10**(n-m_new)`.\n`m_new` is `m+1`. So `n-(m+1)`.\n\n**Corrected Corrected Trace (n=2, A=1234):**\n`dp` table initialized with `(float('-inf'), \"\")`.\n`dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n\n`k=0` (digit `A[0]=1`):\n  `h=0, m=0`: `dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=1, m_new=0`. `val_add = 1 * 10**(2-1) = 10`. `dp[1][0] = (10, \"H\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=0, m_new=1`. `val_add = 1 * 10**(2-1) = 10`. `dp[0][1] = (10, \"M\")`\n\n`k=1` (digit `A[1]=2`):\n  `h=0, m=1`: `dp[0][1] = (10, \"M\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=1, m_new=1`. `val_add = 2 * 10**(2-1) = 20`. `dp[1][1] = (10 + 20, \"MH\") = (30, \"MH\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=0, m_new=2`. `val_add = 2 * 10**(2-2) = 2`. `dp[0][2] = (10 + 2, \"MM\") = (12, \"MM\")`\n  `h=1, m=0`: `dp[1][0] = (10, \"H\")`\n    Homer: `h_new=2, m_new=0`. `val_add = 2 * 10**(2-2) = 2`. `dp[2][0] = (10 + 2, \"HH\") = (12, \"HH\")`\n    Marge: `h_new=1, m_new=1`. `val_add = 2 * 10**(2-1) = 20`. `new_total = 10 + 20 = 30`. `new_path = \"HM\"`.\n      `dp[1][1]` is `(30, \"MH\")`. \"HM\" < \"MH\".
