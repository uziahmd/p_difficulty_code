    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. We've got an array and need to remove just one element to minimize the instability, which is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array. My thinking went like this: to minimize this difference, we want the max to be as small as possible and the min to be as large as possible.\n\nThe first step, always, is to sort the array. This makes everything easier to identify. Now, the key insight is that removing any element *except* the absolute minimum or maximum of the original array won't do anything to reduce the instability. Why? Because the range will still span from the original minimum to the original maximum. So, we're left with two scenarios: remove the smallest element or remove the largest element.\n\nScenario one: Remove the smallest. The new range is then from the second smallest up to the original largest. Scenario two: Remove the largest. The new range is from the original smallest up to the second largest.  We calculate the instability for both, `a[n-1] - a[1]` (removing smallest) and `a[n-2] - a[0]` (removing largest), and take the smaller one.\n\nThis covers all the bases. I've considered edge cases, tested the logic with examples, and verified the time complexity (sorting dominates, O(n log n), which is fine for the given input size). We just read the input, sort the array, compute the instability of both scenarios, and print the minimum. The code is pretty straightforward, and I've double-checked my work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from a given array `a` of `n` integers such that the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements is minimized. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nLet's denote the maximum element of an array as `max_val` and the minimum as `min_val`. The instability is `max_val - min_val`. To minimize this value, we want to make `max_val` as small as possible and `min_val` as large as possible.\n\nConsider the original array `a`. If we sort the array, let the sorted elements be `a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}`.\nHere, `a_0` is the smallest element, `a_1` is the second smallest, `a_{n-2}` is the second largest, and `a_{n-1}` is the largest element.\n\nWhen we remove an element, we have `n-1` elements remaining.\nIf we remove an element `a_k` where `0 < k < n-1` (i.e., not the smallest and not the largest element), then the smallest element in the remaining array will still be `a_0` and the largest element will still be `a_{n-1}`. The instability would be `a_{n-1} - a_0`. This is the maximum possible instability for any `n-1` elements chosen from the original `n` elements, as `a_0` is the absolute minimum and `a_{n-1}` is the absolute maximum.\n\nTo reduce the instability, we must change either the minimum or the maximum element of the array. This implies we should remove either the original smallest element (`a_0`) or the original largest element (`a_{n-1}`).\n\nLet's analyze these two critical cases:\n\n1.  **Remove the smallest element (`a_0`):**\n    The remaining elements are `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}`.\n    The new minimum element is `a_1`.\n    The new maximum element is `a_{n-1}`.\n    The instability in this case is `a_{n-1} - a_1`.\n\n2.  **Remove the largest element (`a_{n-1}`):**\n    The remaining elements are `a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-2}`.\n    The new minimum element is `a_0`.\n    The new maximum element is `a_{n-2}`.\n    The instability in this case is `a_{n-2} - a_0`.\n\nThe minimum possible instability will be the smaller of these two values.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`.\n2.  Read the `n` integers into a list `a`.\n3.  Sort the list `a` in non-decreasing order.\n4.  Calculate the instability if the smallest element is removed: `instability1 = a[n-1] - a[1]`.\n5.  Calculate the instability if the largest element is removed: `instability2 = a[n-2] - a[0]`.\n6.  The minimum possible instability is `min(instability1, instability2)`.\n7.  Print this result.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 4`, `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n1. Sorted `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`.\n2. Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining array `[3, 3, 7]`. Instability `7 - 3 = 4`. (Calculated as `a[3] - a[1]`).\n3. Remove `a[3]` (which is `7`): Remaining array `[1, 3, 3]`. Instability `3 - 1 = 2`. (Calculated as `a[2] - a[0]`).\n4. Minimum instability is `min(4, 2) = 2`.\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 2`, `a = [1, 100000]`\n1. Sorted `a = [1, 100000]`.\n2. Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining array `[100000]`. Instability `100000 - 100000 = 0`. (Calculated as `a[1] - a[1]`).\n3. Remove `a[1]` (which is `100000`): Remaining array `[1]`. Instability `1 - 1 = 0`. (Calculated as `a[0] - a[0]`).\n4. Minimum instability is `min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting the array takes `O(N log N)` time.\n*   Accessing elements and calculating differences takes `O(1)` time.\n*   Overall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N)` for storing the array (or `O(log N)` or `O(1)` depending on sort implementation if done in-place, but Python's `list.sort()` is Timsort, which uses `O(N)` in worst case).\n\nGiven `N <= 10^5`, `O(N log N)` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the number of elements\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Read the array elements and convert them to integers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array.
