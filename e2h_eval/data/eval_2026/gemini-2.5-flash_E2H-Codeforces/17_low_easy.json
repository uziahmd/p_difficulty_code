He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Diving into the String Prefix/Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. The core of it seems to be deducing the structure of an unknown string, *s*, of length *n*, based on a set of its improper prefixes and suffixes. We're given *2n-2* strings, which is a key piece of information. Each length from 1 to *n-1* has a prefix and suffix represented in this set. My initial thought is to analyze the strings' lengths and relationships.\n\nSpecifically, I'm focusing on the longest strings, those of length *n-1*. There are only two of these, and one *must* be the prefix $P_{n-1} = s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$ and the other the suffix $S_{n-1} = s_2s_3...s_n$. My strategy now is to investigate the possibilities by assuming one to be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\nI'll start with the assumption that one of the length *n-1* strings, *L1*, is the prefix $P_{n-1}$, and the other, *L2*, is the suffix $S_{n-1}$. If this is valid, the original string, *s*, can be formed by concatenating *L1* with the last character of *L2*.  This means $s = L1 + L2[-1]$.\n\nI also immediately see a crucial consistency check: If this is correct, the internal segments $s_2...s_{n-1}$ must be identical. This portion of the string is a suffix of $L1$, which should be equal to the prefix of *L2*. Therefore, *L1* without the first character ($L1[1:]$) has to be equal to *L2* without the last character ($L2[:-1]$).\n\nIf this condition holds, I can reconstruct a candidate string, *s_cand1*, based on the initial assumption. The next steps will be to see how to use all given strings to verify whether the initial assumption is valid and determine the original string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given $2n-2$ strings are prefixes ('P') and which are suffixes ('S') of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are guaranteed that for each length $k$ from $1$ to $n-1$, there are exactly two strings of length $k$ in the input: one is the prefix $P_k$ and the other is the suffix $S_k$.\n\nLet the unknown string be $s = s_1s_2...s_n$.\nThe prefix of length $k$ is $P_k = s_1...s_k$.\nThe suffix of length $k$ is $S_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$.\n\nThe crucial observation is that there are exactly two strings of length $n-1$ in the input. These must be $P_{n-1}$ and $S_{n-1}$.\nLet these two strings be $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n$P_{n-1} = s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$\n$S_{n-1} = s_2s_3...s_n$\n\nWe can try two possibilities for assigning $L_1$ and $L_2$:\n1. Assume $L_1$ is $P_{n-1}$ and $L_2$ is $S_{n-1}$.\n2. Assume $L_1$ is $S_{n-1}$ and $L_2$ is $P_{n-1}$.\n\nLet's analyze Case 1: $P_{n-1} = L_1$ and $S_{n-1} = L_2$.\nIf this is true, then the original string $s$ must be $L_1$ followed by the last character of $L_2$.\nThat is, $s = L_1 + L_2[-1]$.\nFor this to be consistent, the suffix of $L_1$ of length $n-2$ ($L_1[1:]$) must be equal to the prefix of $L_2$ of length $n-2$ ($L_2[:-1]$). This is because $L_1 = s_1...s_{n-1}$ and $L_2 = s_2...s_n$, so $s_2...s_{n-1}$ must be common.\nIf $L_1[1:] == L_2[:-1]$, then we can form a candidate string $s_{cand1} = L_1 + L_2[-1]$.\nWe can then check if $s_{cand1}$ generates all the other input strings correctly.\nSpecifically, for each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$:\n- The prefix of $s_{cand1}$ of length $k$ should be $s_{cand1}[0:k]$.\n- The suffix of $s_{cand1}$ of length $k$ should be $s_{cand1}[n-k:n]$.\nWe need to verify that for every length $k$, the two strings of length $k$ from the input match exactly $s_{cand1}[0:k]$ and $s_{cand1}[n-k:n]$ (in some order).\n\nLet's analyze Case 2: $P_{n-1} = L_2$ and $S_{n-1} = L_1$.\nSimilarly, if this is true, then the original string $s$ must be $L_2$ followed by the last character of $L_1$.\nThat is, $s = L_2 + L_1[-1]$.\nFor this to be consistent, $L_2[1:]$ must be equal to $L_1[:-1]$.\nIf $L_2[1:] == L_1[:-1]$, then we can form a candidate string $s_{cand2} = L_2 + L_1[-1]$.\nWe then check if $s_{cand2}$ generates all the input strings in the same way as described for $s_{cand1}$.\n\nOne of these two cases must lead to a valid string $s$ because the problem guarantees that the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of *some* existing string. We can pick any valid answer.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read $n$.\n2.  Read all $2n-2$ input strings and store them, along with their original indices. A list of (string, original_index) tuples is suitable.\n3.  Identify the two strings of length $n-1$. Let's call them `long_str1` and `long_str2`, and store their original indices `idx1` and `idx2`.\n4.  Try Case 1: Assume `long_str1` is $P_{n-1}$ and `long_str2` is $S_{n-1}$.\n    *   Check if `long_str1[1:] == long_str2[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, form `candidate_s = long_str1 + long_str2[-1]`.\n    *   Construct the expected prefixes and suffixes from `candidate_s`:\n        *   `expected_prefixes = {candidate_s[0:k] for k in range(1, n)}`\n        *   `expected_suffixes = {candidate_s[n-k:n] for k in range(1, n)}`\n    *   Verify if the input strings match these expectations:\n        *   Create a copy of the input strings (e.g., a list of strings only).\n        *   Iterate through `expected_prefixes`. For each expected prefix `p`, find and remove it from the input strings copy. If not found, this candidate is invalid.\n        *   Do the same for `expected_suffixes`.\n        *   If all expected prefixes and suffixes are found and removed, then `candidate_s` is valid.\n        *   If valid, construct the result string: Initialize an answer array `ans` of length $2n-2$. Set `ans[idx1] = 'P'` and `ans[idx2] = 'S'`. For all other input strings, if they are prefixes of `candidate_s`, mark them 'P', otherwise 'S'. Since we know there are exactly two of each length, we can simply find the first occurrence of `s[0:k]` and mark it 'P', and the first occurrence of `s[n-k:n]` and mark it 'S', making sure to use each input string exactly once. A more robust way is to use counts for each string.\n        *   A simpler way to construct the result:\n            *   Initialize `ans = [''] * (2*n-2)`.\n            *   Create a list of tuples `(input_string, original_index)` for all strings.\n            *   Set `ans[idx1] = 'P'` and `ans[idx2] = 'S'`.\n            *   Iterate through the remaining strings (not `long_str1` or `long_str2`). For each string `(s_val, s_idx)`:\n                *   If `s_val` is a prefix of `candidate_s` (`s_val == candidate_s[0:len(s_val)]`) AND `ans[s_idx]` is still empty, then set `ans[s_idx] = 'P'`.\n                *   Else if `s_val` is a suffix of `candidate_s` (`s_val == candidate_s[n-len(s_val):n]`) AND `ans[s_idx]` is still empty, then set `ans[s_idx] = 'S'`.\n                *   This logic needs refinement for duplicates. A better approach is to count occurrences.\n            *   A robust way to assign P/S for all:\n                *   `ans = [''] * (2*n-2)`\n                *   `prefix_needed = {candidate_s[0:k] for k in range(1, n)}`\n                *   `suffix_needed = {candidate_s[n-k:n] for k in range(1, n)}`\n                *   For each `(s_val, s_idx)` in the original list of strings:\n                    *   If `s_val` is in `prefix_needed` and not yet assigned 'P' for this specific instance:\n                        *   `ans[s_idx] = 'P'`\n                        *   Remove `s_val` from `prefix_needed` (or decrement a counter if using a multiset/Counter).\n                    *   Else (it must be a suffix):\n                        *   `ans[s_idx] = 'S'`\n                        *   Remove `s_val` from `suffix_needed`.\n                *   This is tricky because `s_val` might be both a prefix and a suffix (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\").\n                *   The simplest approach that respects the \"exactly two strings of each length\" and \"one is P, one is S\" property:\n                    *   `ans = [''] * (2*n-2)`\n                    *   `ans[idx1] = 'P'`\n                    *   `ans[idx2] = 'S'`\n                    *   `used_indices = {idx1, idx2}`\n                    *   `temp_strings = []`\n                    *   For `(s_val, s_idx)` in the original list:\n                        *   If `s_idx` not in `used_indices`:\n                            *   `temp_strings.append((s_val, s_idx))`\n                    *   `p_count_for_len = collections.defaultdict(int)`\n                    *   `s_count_for_len = collections.defaultdict(int)`\n                    *   For `(s_val, s_idx)` in `temp_strings`:\n                        *   `length = len(s_val)`\n                        *   If `s_val == candidate_s[0:length]` and `p_count_for_len[length] == 0`:\n                            *   `ans[s_idx] = 'P'`\n                            *   `p_count_for_len[length] = 1`\n                        *   Else:\n                            *   `ans[s_idx] = 'S'`\n                            *   `s_count_for_len[length] = 1`\n                    *   Print `\"\".join(ans)` and exit.\n\n5.  If Case 1 did not yield a valid answer (or if we want to try Case 2 anyway, as multiple answers are allowed):\n    *   Try Case 2: Assume `long_str2` is $P_{n-1}$ and `long_str1` is $S_{n-1}$.\n    *   Check if `long_str2[1:] == long_str1[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, form `candidate_s = long_str2 + long_str1[-1]`.\n    *   Verify and construct the result string in the same manner as Case 1, but with `ans[idx2] = 'P'` and `ans[idx1] = 'S'`. Print and exit.\n\nSince it's guaranteed that at least one string is consistent, one of these approaches will work.\n\nLet's refine the result construction step (Step 4.4 and 5.3) for clarity and correctness.\nThe strategy is to find a valid `candidate_s`.
