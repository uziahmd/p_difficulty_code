A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition for \"Soft Drinking\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem, and my immediate thought is to break it down. I need a Python script to do this efficiently. Let's start with the givens: `n` friends, `k` bottles, `l` ml per bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices per lime, `p` grams of salt, and then the per-friend needs: `nl` ml of drink per toast and `np` grams of salt per toast. The goal is to maximize the number of toasts *per friend*, with everyone getting the same amount.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total resources available:  Total drink is `k * l` ml, total lime slices are `c * d`, and total salt is just `p` grams.\n\nNow comes the tricky part: calculating the number of toasts possible based on each resource. This is where I have to be careful about units.  Initially, I thought about  `n * nl` ml of drink needed *per toast event*, but the wording got me thinking.  It says \"each friend needs `nl` ml\", implying `nl` is the drink needed *per friend* for a toast, which would make the calculation: `(k * l) / nl`. But I need to be sure.\n\nI'm keying into the example provided: `n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3`. It says the available drink is `4 * 5 = 20` ml, and then it calculates `20 / 3 = 6` toasts can be made.  Hmm.  That makes `nl` the amount *per toast* that *one* friend consumes.  So, if I have 20 ml, and each friend needs 3 ml per toast, then `20 / 3 = 6` toasts are possible.  I think my initial interpretation was correct, just a bit muddled in the phrasing. I should just use the example. This calculation implies `nl` represents the drink needed for one toast *for one friend*, and the total number of toasts for the whole group is simply `(k * l) / nl`. Let's represent the total portions for drinks as `T_drink`. I'll think this through fully before writing any code.\n",
