Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Colored Boots\" to tackle. My initial thought is that it's a matching problem, specifically a maximum matching problem. I'm given two sets of boots, left and right, each with a color. Colors match if they're the same or if one or both are a wildcard ('?'). The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs.\n\nThe input is pretty straightforward: the number of boots, `n`, and two strings representing the colors of the left (`l`) and right (`r`) boots. The output will be the maximum number of pairs and the indices of those pairs. The constraint of `n` being up to 150,000 immediately rules out a general maximum matching algorithm like Hopcroft-Karp; it'll be too slow. I'll need to find a more specialized or greedy approach.\n\nLet's break down the compatibility rules: Specific colors match if they are the same. A specific color always matches with a '?'. And two '?'s are always compatible. This screams \"greedy\"! I should prioritize the most restrictive matches first to avoid potentially \"wasting\" boots.\n\nMy strategy is to categorize the boots based on their colors. It makes sense to handle exact matches first, where a left boot of color 'a' pairs with a right boot of color 'a'. These are the most restrictive because they can only be paired with their exact color or a '?'. I'm thinking of using data structures to efficiently track boots of specific colors.\n\nI'll create `left_boots` and `right_boots` maps. `left_boots[c]` will hold a list of indices for all left boots with color `c`, and similarly for `right_boots[c]`. I'll iterate through each specific color from 'a' to 'z'. While I have matching boots of a specific color on both the left and right sides, I'll pop the indices and add those pairs to a `pairs` list.\n\nThis seems efficient. By handling the exact matches first, I'm ensuring I'm maximizing the utilization of those restrictive boots, and I'll leave the more flexible '?' boots for later, using those to make pairs with any color that doesn't have an exact match.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe need to output the maximum number of pairs and the 1-indexed indices of the paired boots.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, thus leaving the more flexible '?' boots available for later, when they might be needed to form pairs that wouldn't otherwise be possible.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    First, we need an efficient way to access boots of a specific color. We can use lists (or deques for efficient popping) to store the 1-indexed indices of boots for each color.\n    -   `left_boots[char]`: A list of indices of left boots with color `char`.\n    -   `right_boots[char]`: A list of indices of right boots with color `char`.\n    We'll have 26 lists for specific colors ('a' through 'z') and one for '?' for both left and right boots.\n\n2.  **Phase 1: Exact Specific Color Matches (`char` with `char`)**\n    These are the most restrictive matches. A left boot of color 'x' and a right boot of color 'x' are a perfect match. If we don't match them, the 'x' boots would either remain unmatched or be matched with a '?' boot. Matching them with '?' boots would \"waste\" the flexibility of the '?' boots. So, it's best to match identical specific colors first.\n    -   Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    -   While `left_boots[c]` is not empty AND `right_boots[c]` is not empty:\n        -   Pop an index `li` from `left_boots[c]`.\n        -   Pop an index `ri` from `right_boots[c]`.\n        -   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n3.  **Phase 2: Specific Color with Indefinite Color (`char` with `?`)**\n    After forming all possible exact specific color matches, we'll have remaining specific color boots that don't have an exact specific color match. These can now be matched with '?' boots.\n    -   Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    -   While `left_boots[c]` is not empty AND `right_boots['?']` is not empty:\n        -   Pop an index `li` from `left_boots[c]`.\n        -   Pop an index `ri` from `right_boots['?']`.\n        -   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n    -   Similarly, for remaining right boots of specific colors:\n    -   While `right_boots[c]` is not empty AND `left_boots['?']` is not empty:\n        -   Pop an index `li` from `left_boots['?']`.\n        -   Pop an index `ri` from `right_boots[c]`.\n        -   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n4.  **Phase 3: Indefinite Color with Indefinite Color (`?` with `?`)**\n    Finally, any remaining '?' left boots can be matched with any remaining '?' right boots. These are the least restrictive matches, so they are handled last.\n    -   While `left_boots['?']` is not empty AND `right_boots['?']` is not empty:\n        -   Pop an index `li` from `left_boots['?']`.\n        -   Pop an index `ri` from `right_boots['?']`.\n        -   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n-   Phase 1 handles the most constrained matches. By using specific-color boots with their exact counterparts, we ensure that these boots are used optimally without consuming the flexibility of '?' boots.\n-   Phase 2 uses '?' boots to match specific-color boots that couldn't find an exact match. This is the next best use for '?' boots, as it allows us to pair specific colors that would otherwise remain unmatched.\n-   Phase 3 matches the remaining '?' boots with each other. This is the only remaining option for these boots and maximizes the total pairs.\n\nEach boot index is used at most once. The total number of pairs formed will be the maximum possible.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 7`\n`l = abaca?b`\n`r = zabbbcc`\n\n1.  **Initialize:**\n    `left_boots = {'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [], '?': [6], ...}`\n    `right_boots = {'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7], '?': [], 'z': [1], ...}`\n    `pairs = []`\n\n2.  **Phase 1 (char, char):**\n    -   `c = 'a'`: `left_boots['a'] = [1, 3, 5]`, `right_boots['a'] = [2]`\n        -   Pop `1` from `left_boots['a']`, `2` from `right_boots['a']`.

This avoids checking if a key exists before appending.\n-   Iterate through `string.ascii_lowercase` for specific colors.\n-   The maximum value of `n` is 150,000. Storing indices in lists and popping/appending is efficient enough. The total number of operations will be proportional to `n` (each boot index is processed a constant number of times).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\nimport string\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed boot indices for each color\n    # Using deque for O(1) pop from either end, though list.pop() (from end) is also O(1)\n    # and sufficient here as we only pop from the end.\n    left_boots = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Phase 1: Exact specific color matches (char, char)\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots[char]:\n            l_idx = left_boots[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Specific color with indefinite color (char, '?')\n    # Match remaining specific left boots with '?' right boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots['?']:\n            l_idx = left_boots[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n    \n    # Match remaining specific right boots with '?' left boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while right_boots[char] and left_boots['?']:\n            l_idx = left_boots['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: Indefinite color with indefinite color ('?', '?')\n    while left_boots['?'] and right_boots['?']:\n        l_idx = left_boots['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_boots['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
