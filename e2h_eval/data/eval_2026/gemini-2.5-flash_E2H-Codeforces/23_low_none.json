            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through This Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The objective is to determine the minimum number of tile draws needed for Tokitsukaze to form a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence) given three initial tiles.  The output will be either 0, 1, or 2.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. The input consists of three tile strings. I need to process these, understand the rules, and find an efficient solution.  The maximum number of draws will be 2 because, with 5 tiles, you can always form a mentsu.  I can approach this by checking the cases of zero draws, one draw, and then two draws.\n\nI'm considering how to represent the tiles.  Strings like \"1s\", \"9m\", and \"3p\" are fine for input, but internally, a more structured representation would be ideal. I'm leaning toward using tuples like `(number, suit)` to represent each tile. This will simplify sequence checking and sorting.  For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. This representation will also allow for easier comparisons.\n\nI plan to start by parsing the input strings and transforming them into these tuples. Sorting the tuples will be crucial. I need to sort first by suit and then by number to easily identify potential sequences. I should define a canonical order for the suits ('m', 'p', 's' for example).\n\nThen, I'll move to the core logic. First, I'll check if the given three tiles can already form a mentsu (zero draws).  This involves checking for identical tiles (koutsu) and sequential tiles of the same suit (shuntsu). I'll need to define functions for these checks.  If not, I'll move to checking if one draw will form a mentsu and then two draws.  The key is to minimize the computational effort at each step.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nThe minimum number of draws can be 0, 1, or 2. We will check these possibilities in increasing order:\n\n1.  **0 draws**: Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n2.  **1 draw**: Check if drawing one additional tile can form a mentsu with any two of the initial tiles.\n3.  **2 draws**: If neither of the above works, she will always need at most 2 draws. This is because with 3 initial tiles, drawing 2 more gives her 5 tiles. With 5 tiles, she can always form a mentsu. For example, she could draw two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles to form a koutsu, or draw two tiles to complete a sequence.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. This allows for easier numerical comparisons and sorting.\n\n**Step 1: Parse and prepare tiles**\nRead the three input strings. Convert them into `(int, char)` tuples.\nExample: `['3p', '9m', '2p']` becomes `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`.\n\n**Step 2: Check for 0 draws**\nTo form a mentsu with 0 draws, the three initial tiles `t1, t2, t3` must satisfy one of these conditions:\n*   **Koutsu**: All three tiles are identical. `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu**: All three tiles have the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive (e.g., `(n, s), (n+1, s), (n+2, s)`). To check this, sort the tiles by number (if they have the same suit).\n\nLet's sort the initial three tiles. A consistent sorting order helps. We can sort them first by suit, then by number.\nExample: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]` sorted becomes `[(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]` (assuming 'm' < 'p').\nFor sequence checking, it's more useful to group by suit first, then sort numbers within suits. Or simply iterate through all permutations/combinations.\nA simpler approach for 3 tiles:\n    1.  Count occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears 3 times, it's a koutsu.\n    2.  If all three tiles have the same suit, check if their numbers form a sequence. Get the numbers `n1, n2, n3`, sort them, and check if `n2 == n1 + 1` and `n3 == n2 + 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Check for 1 draw**\nTo form a mentsu with 1 draw, we need to pick two of the initial tiles `t_a, t_b` and find a third tile `t_x` (which we draw) such that `t_a, t_b, t_x` form a mentsu.\nWe iterate through all pairs of initial tiles: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`. For each pair:\n*   **Koutsu**: If `t_a == t_b`, we can draw `t_a` (or `t_b`) to form a koutsu `[t_a, t_a, t_a]`.\n*   **Shuntsu**: If `t_a` and `t_b` have the same suit, and their numbers are `n_a, n_b`:\n    *   If `|n_a - n_b| == 1` (e.g., `(2, 'p'), (3, 'p')`), we can draw `(n_a - 1, 'p')` (if `n_a > 1`) or `(n_b + 1, 'p')` (if `n_b < 9`) to complete a sequence.\n        Example: `(2, 'p'), (3, 'p')`. Draw `(1, 'p')` for `[1p, 2p, 3p]` or draw `(4, 'p')` for `[2p, 3p, 4p]`.\n    *   If `|n_a - n_b| == 2` (e.g., `(2, 'p'), (4, 'p')`), we can draw `(n_a + 1, 'p')` (which is `(n_b - 1, 'p')`) to complete a sequence.\n        Example: `(2, 'p'), (4, 'p')`. Draw `(3, 'p')` for `[2p, 3p, 4p]`.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n**Step 4: If neither 0 nor 1 draw works, the answer is 2**\nAs explained, with 3 initial tiles, drawing 2 more always allows forming a mentsu.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n*   Represent tiles as `(int(char), suit_char)`.\n*   A helper function `check_mentsu(tile_list)` can determine if a list of 3 tiles forms a mentsu.\n    *   Sort `tile_list` by number, then suit.\n    *   Check for koutsu: `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n    *   Check for shuntsu: `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit` AND `t1.num + 1 == t2.num` AND `t2.num + 1 == t3.num`.\n*   For 0 draws: call `check_mentsu` on the initial 3 tiles.\n*   For 1 draw:\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from the initial hand.\n    *   If `t_i == t_j`, we can form a koutsu by drawing `t_i`.\n    *   If `t_i.suit == t_j.suit`:\n        *   Let `n_i, n_j` be their numbers.\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 1`: We can draw `(min(n_i, n_j) - 1, suit)` (if valid number) or `(max(n_i, n_j) + 1, suit)` (if valid number).\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 2`: We can draw `(min(n_i, n_j) + 1, suit)`.\n    *   If any such draw is possible, return 1.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`**\n\n1.  **Parse**: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`. Let's use `t1=(3,'p'), t2=(9,'m'), t3=(2,'p')`.\n\n2.  **0 draws check**:\n    *   Are all three identical? No.\n    *   Do they form a shuntsu? Suits are mixed (`p`, `m`). No.\n    *   Result: Not 0 draws.\n\n3.  **1 draw check**:\n    *   **Pair `(t1, t2)` = `((3,'p'), (9,'m'))`**:\n        *   Not identical.\n        *   Different suits. No shuntsu possibility.\n    *   **Pair `(t1, t3)` = `((3,'p'), (2,'p'))`**:\n        *   Not identical.\n        *   Same suit (`p`). Numbers `3, 2`. `abs(3-2) == 1`.\n        *   Can draw `(2-1, 'p') = (1, 'p')` to form `[1p, 2p, 3p]`. (Valid, `1 <= 1 <= 9`)\n        *   Can draw `(3+1, 'p') = (4, 'p')` to form `[2p, 3p, 4p]`. (Valid, `1 <= 4 <= 9`)\n        *   Since we found a way to form a mentsu with 1 draw, the answer is 1.\n\nThe minimum number of draws is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert tile strings to (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for s_tile in s_tiles:\n        num = int(s_tile[0])\n        suit = s_tile[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for consistent checking, primarily by suit then by number\n    # This isn't strictly necessary for all checks but helps for sequence logic\n    # For this problem, we'll just use the raw list and sort subsets as needed.\n    \n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu can be formed if:\n    # 1.
