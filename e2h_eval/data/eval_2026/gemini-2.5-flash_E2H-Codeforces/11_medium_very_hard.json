A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Refinement for \"Soft Drinking\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem, and my first instinct is to break it down. I need a Python script, of course! Let's see... the input gives me *n* friends, *k* bottles, *l* drink per bottle, *c* limes, *d* slices per lime, *p* salt, *nl* drink needed per toast, and *np* salt needed per toast. The goal? Maximize the toasts everyone can make equally.\n\nMy initial approach was to calculate the \"limiting factor\" for each resource (drink, limes, salt) and then take the minimum. For drink, I thought *k* * *l* was total drink, so each friend can make *(k* * *l*) // (n * nl)* toasts. For limes, it was *(c* * *d*) // n*, and for salt *(p // np) // n*.  But the sample case threw me off a bit.\n\nThe sample explanation said \"20 / 3 = 6 toasts\" total, not per person. That triggered a re-evaluation! I realized I was trying to do too much in one step. What if I broke it down to *individual toast servings* first? For drink, it's *(k* * *l*) // *nl* total individual toasts. Divide that by *n* for toasts per friend.  Similarly, *(c* * *d*) gives total lime toasts and *p // np* is total salt toasts, and then divide by *n*. I then take the minimum of these for the final answer.\n\nI tested it on the given examples, and it finally clicked! The key is thinking about how many *individual* servings of each resource are available and then distributing those among the friends. The final code just calculates the individual toasts possible from each resource, takes the minimum, and divides it by the number of friends. I'm feeling confident this is the right approach now. Now, let's make it work!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given a set of resources and requirements per toast. All `n` friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nWe need to consider three resources: drink, limes, and salt. For each resource, we'll calculate the total number of *individual toasts* that can be made from it. Then, we find the minimum of these totals. Finally, since there are `n` friends and they all make an equal number of toasts, we divide this minimum total by `n` to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for each resource:\n\n1.  **Drink:**\n    *   Total milliliters of drink available: `k` bottles * `l` ml/bottle = `k * l` ml.\n    *   Each friend needs `nl` ml of drink per toast. This means each *individual toast* requires `nl` ml.\n    *   So, the total number of individual toasts that can be made from the drink is `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division since partial toasts are not allowed).\n\n2.  **Limes:**\n    *   Total slices of lime available: `c` limes * `d` slices/lime = `c * d` slices.\n    *   Each friend needs 1 slice of lime per toast. This means each *individual toast* requires 1 slice.\n    *   So, the total number of individual toasts that can be made from the limes is `(c * d) // 1 = c * d`.\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total grams of salt available: `p` grams.\n    *   Each friend needs `np` grams of salt per toast. This means each *individual toast* requires `np` grams.\n    *   So, the total number of individual toasts that can be made from the salt is `p // np`.\n\nAfter calculating the total individual toasts possible for each resource, we find the minimum of these three values. Let this minimum be `min_total_individual_toasts`.\n\nFinally, since there are `n` friends and they all must make the same number of toasts, we divide `min_total_individual_toasts` by `n` to find out how many toasts each friend can make: `min_total_individual_toasts // n`.\n\nThis approach directly follows the logic explained in the problem's example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the single line of input and parse the integers\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate the total number of individual toasts possible for each resource:\n\n    # 1.
