Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's get this Python script rolling!**\n\nThe problem is to simulate digit substitutions within a string, then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The key is that the string can blow up in size, so we can't build it explicitly. The solution hinges on processing the queries *backwards*.\n\nInitially, we have an array, `dp_val`, storing the final numeric value of each digit (0-9) and `dp_len` storing the length of the string each digit becomes after all substitutions (modulo 1000000006). Processing the queries in reverse allows us to calculate these `dp` values accurately.\n\nWhen we process a query `di -> ti`, we look at what each digit in `ti` ultimately becomes (from previous iterations, when we processed queries later in the list), calculate the new value and length for `di`, and update `dp_val[di]` and `dp_len[di]`.  Crucially, we maintain length modulo 1000000006 to handle those potentially huge string lengths. If `ti` is empty, then `di` becomes an empty string.\n\nAfter processing all queries, the `dp_val` and `dp_len` arrays tell us what each digit in the *original* string `s` represents after all the substitutions. We iterate through `s` right-to-left, multiply each digit's final value by the appropriate power of 10 and add to the result, while also updating the powers of 10 modulo 1000000007.\n\nThere are some edge cases like empty substitutions or empty final strings but these are naturally handled. The approach's time complexity is O((|s| + L_T) * log M), where L_T is the sum of lengths of t strings, which is perfectly feasible for the problem's constraints. We'll use modular exponentiation to keep everything manageable. The code should now be ready to submit!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit substitutions in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it.\n\nThe key insight for this type of problem is to process the queries in reverse order. Let's define `dp_val[d]` as the numerical value (modulo 1000000007) of the string that digit `d` ultimately becomes after all relevant substitutions. Similarly, let `dp_len[d]` be the length of that string (modulo 1000000006, which is `MOD-1`, for use in modular exponentiation based on Fermat's Little Theorem).\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, if no queries were performed, each digit `d` simply represents itself. So, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n*   `dp_val[d] = d`\n*   `dp_len[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries in Reverse:**\nWe iterate through the queries from the last one to the first one. For each query `di -> ti`:\nThis query means that any `di` that existed *before this query* will be replaced by `ti`. When processing in reverse, `dp_val[d]` and `dp_len[d]` already store the final value and length for digits `d` *as if they appeared in the string after this query*.\nNow, we need to determine what `di` itself becomes *before this query*. It becomes `ti`, and each digit `c` within `ti` will then undergo the transformations defined by `dp_val[c]` and `dp_len[c]`.\n\nTo update `dp_val[di]` and `dp_len[di]`:\n1.  Initialize `new_val = 0` and `new_len = 0`.\n2.  If `ti` is an empty string, `di` effectively disappears. So, `dp_val[di] = 0` and `dp_len[di] = 0`.\n3.  Otherwise, iterate through the digits `c` in `ti` from right to left:\n    *   Let `digit_c` be the integer value of `c`.\n    *   The value `dp_val[digit_c]` needs to be added to `new_val`, but shifted left by `new_len` positions (i.e., multiplied by `10^(new_len)`).\n        `new_val = (new_val + dp_val[digit_c] * pow(10, new_len, MOD)) % MOD`\n    *   The length `dp_len[digit_c]` needs to be added to `new_len`.\n        `new_len = (new_len + dp_len[digit_c]) % MOD_PHI`\n4.  After processing all digits in `ti`, set `dp_val[di] = new_val` and `dp_len[di] = new_len`.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter all queries are processed in reverse, `dp_val[d]` and `dp_len[d]` store the final value and length for each original digit `d` in the input string `s`.\nWe now calculate the total value of the original string `s`:\n1.  Initialize `final_ans = 0` and `current_power_of_10 = 1` (representing `10^0`).\n2.  Iterate through the digits `c` in the original string `s` from right to left:\n    *   Let `digit_c` be the integer value of `c`.\n    *   The value `dp_val[digit_c]` needs to be added to `final_ans`, shifted left by `current_power_of_10`.\n        `final_ans = (final_ans + dp_val[digit_c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`\n    *   Update `current_power_of_10` by multiplying it by `10^(dp_len[digit_c])`.\n        `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, dp_len[digit_c], MOD)) % MOD`\n3.  The final `final_ans` is the result.\n\n**Modulus:**\nThe modulus for values is `MOD = 1000000007`.\nThe modulus for exponents in `pow(base, exponent, MOD)` is `MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 = 1000000006` (since `MOD` is prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n\n**Example Trace (from problem description):**\n`s = \"123123\"`, `n = 1`, `query = \"2->00\"`\n`MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_PHI = 1000000006`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`dp_val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`dp_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Process query `0` (`2->00`) in reverse:**\n`d_to_replace = 2`, `t_str = \"00\"`\n1.  `new_val = 0`, `new_len = 0`\n2.
