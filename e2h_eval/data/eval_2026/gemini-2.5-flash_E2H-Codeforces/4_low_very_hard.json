The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in this Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and the twist is, the number of rounds, 'n', is huge. I can't just simulate every round, that would be insanely inefficient, so I need to find a way to take advantage of the patterns.\n\nHere's the problem: I've got a game with the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, and each player has a cyclic strategy, defined by the strings A and B, respectively. Nikes uses string A, Poly uses B, and each round goes through this cycle. I'm given the total number of rounds 'n', and the strategies A and B. I have to find the total losses (red spots). Draws don't matter.\n\nThe crux of this lies in the cyclic nature of their choices. Nikes always loops through A, and Poly loops through B, which means that the entire game's sequence will itself loop. I have to figure out the cycle length and calculate the wins/losses within this repeated section.\n\nSince the strategies are cyclic, the cycle length will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B, which are m and k. Calculating the least common multiple is crucial here. I'll need to use the formula: LCM(m,k) = (m*k) / GCD(m,k). I know the greatest common divisor and least common multiple calculations are cheap and don't contribute to the overall Big O of the algorithm.\n\nI should determine the LCM, which'll give me the repeatable cycle. Then I will simulate just ONE cycle. In the one cycle, I will keep track of each player's losses.\n\nNext, I'll calculate how many full cycles fit into 'n' and then figure out the remaining rounds outside those full cycles. Multiplying the losses within a cycle with the number of cycles will give me the total number of losses for all full cycles. Then I can just iterate through any remaining rounds and add up the additional losses.\n\nEssentially, I'll get an efficient way to determine the losses without having to iterate through 2*10^9 rounds. I like this approach.\n",
