    "thought": "**Algorithm for Solving the Directed Graph Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. I've got to find two things: the minimum number of nodes needed in a directed graph to make it \"p-reachable,\" and then, among all graphs with that minimum node count, the maximum number of \"unidirectional pairs.\"  A unidirectional pair is when there's a path from *u* to *v* but not from *v* back to *u*. And a graph is \"p-reachable\" if it has exactly *p* pairs (u, v) where *u* comes before *v*, and where *u* and *v* can reach each other.\n\nThe trick here is realizing that \"reachable from each other\" means *u* and *v* are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).  An SCC is a group of nodes where you can get from any node to any other node within the group.  So, the graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly *p* pairs, where both nodes in the pair are in the same SCC.\n\nNow, how many of those (u, v) pairs are there in an SCC of size *k*? If the SCC has *k* nodes, then within this SCC, you can find *k*(k-1)/2 such pairs where u < v, because any two nodes have a directed path between them.\n\nMy strategy is to first figure out the minimum node count. I want to minimize the total number of nodes *n*, and, to do that, I'm going to want to make the SCCs as big as possible. Why? Well, *k*(k-1)/2 grows much faster than *k* does.  It's more \"efficient\" to make a bigger SCC for my reachability pairs. I'm going to start with the largest possible SCC, given a value of p.\n\nI'll start by finding the largest *k* where *k*(k-1)/2 is less than or equal to p. If *k*(k-1)/2 equals *p* I am done because, by making a single SCC of size *k*, I satisfy the p-reachable condition and I use minimum *n=k* nodes. If *k*(k-1)/2 is slightly too small, I need a new, smaller SCC to take care of the remainder of pairs, reducing the node count. To minimize the node count, I should keep adding the largest possible SCC until I can completely satisfy *p*. This is a greedy approach.\n\nNow, I've got the minimum number of nodes.  I need to maximize those unidirectional pairs.  How do I do that?  I should form SCCs and then arrange them in a \"chain\" like this:  SCC1 -> SCC2 -> SCC3... . I add an edge from all nodes in one SCC to all nodes in the *next* SCC in the chain, but not in the opposite direction. Since they're in distinct SCCs, I can create these unidirectional pairs by creating a topological ordering. So all *u* in *C_i* will be able to reach any *v* in *C_j* for *i < j*, and because they are in different SCCs, *v* will never be able to reach *u* in the directed structure. This arrangement maximizes the total number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nI will have to pre-compute some values to efficiently perform this greedy strategy. I have to find the `k * (k - 1) / 2`  values up to a certain limit of k (I will have to examine this limit). Then, I will solve the problem by creating SCCs and minimizing the node number and then maximizing the unidirectional pairs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a directed graph that has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n2. Among all such graphs with the minimum `n`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable condition:**\n\"Ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\"\nTwo nodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC).\nConsider an SCC of size `k`. Any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of such ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. This is because we choose any two distinct nodes from `k`, and the `u < v` condition fixes the order, counting each pair exactly once.\n\nTo minimize the total number of nodes `n`, we need to find a set of SCC sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` such that their sum `sum(k_i)` is minimized, and `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2) = p`.\nThe function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`. To get a certain number of pairs `p` with the minimum total number of nodes, we should use SCCs that are as large as possible. This is a greedy approach:\n- Start with `min_n = 0` and `sum_k_squared = 0`.\n- While `p > 0`:\n    - Find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n    - Add `k` to `min_n`.\n    - Add `k * k` to `sum_k_squared`.\n    - Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\nThis strategy ensures that we are always picking the largest possible SCC to contribute to `p`, thus minimizing the total number of nodes.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 * 10^5`. We can estimate the maximum `k`: `k * (k - 1) / 2 approx 2 * 10^5 => k^2 approx 4 * 10^5 => k approx sqrt(4 * 10^5) approx 632`. So, we can precompute `f(k)` for `k` up to about 635.\n\n**2. Maximum unidirectional pairs:**\nOnce we have determined the sizes of the SCCs `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` that yield the minimum `n` and exactly `p` reachable pairs, we need to arrange them to maximize unidirectional pairs.\nAn ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and no path `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` must be in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC in the condensation graph (graph of SCCs).\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we can arrange the `m` SCCs in a linear chain (a topological order): `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_m`.\nWe can achieve this by adding edges from every node in `C_i` to every node in `C_{i+1}` for all `i` from `1` to `m-1`. More simply, adding a single edge from `C_i` to `C_{i+1}` for each `i` is sufficient to establish reachability.\nIn such a configuration, for any `i < j`, any node `u` in `C_i` can reach any node `v` in `C_j`. Since `i != j`, `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, so `v` cannot reach `u`. Therefore, all `k_i * k_j` pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is in `C_i` and `v` is in `C_j` (for `i < j`) are unidirectional.\n\nThe total number of such unidirectional pairs is the sum of `k_i * k_j` for all `1 <= i < j <= m`.\nThis sum can be calculated using the identity:\n`(sum_{i=1 to m} k_i)^2 = sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`\nRearranging this, we get:\n`sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j) = ( (sum_{i=1 to m} k_i)^2 - sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i^2) ) / 2`\nWe already calculated `sum k_i` (which is `min_n`) and `sum k_i^2` (which is `sum_k_squared`) during the first step.\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(min_n * min_n - sum_k_squared) // 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (p=4):**\n1. **Minimum nodes (`min_n`):**\n   - `p = 4`, `min_n = 0`, `sum_k_squared = 0`.\n   - Precomputed `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`: `f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3, f(4)=6, ...`\n   - **Iteration 1:**\n     - Largest `k` such that `f(k) <= 4` is `k=3` (`f(3)=3`).\n     - `min_n = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n     - `sum_k_squared = 0 + 3*3 = 9`.\n     - `p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n   - **Iteration 2:**\n     - Largest `k` such that `f(k) <= 1` is `k=2` (`f(2)=1`).\n     - `min_n = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n     - `sum_k_squared = 9 + 2*2 = 13`.\n     - `p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n   - `p` is now 0, loop terminates.\n   - Minimum number of nodes `min_n = 5`. The SCC sizes are `k_1=3` and `k_2=2`.\n\n2. **Maximum unidirectional pairs:**\n   - `min_n = 5`, `sum_k_squared = 13`.\n   - `max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_k_squared) // 2`\n   - `= (5 * 5 - 13) // 2`\n   - `= (25 - 13) // 2`\n   - `= 12 // 2 = 6`.\n\nThe output for `p=4` is `5 6`, which matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Precompute k * (k - 1) // 2 values.\n    # The maximum value for p is 2 * 10^5.\n    # k * (k - 1) / 2 approx 2 * 10^5 => k^2 approx 4 * 10^5 => k approx sqrt(400000) approx 632.\n    # So, k will not exceed 632.
