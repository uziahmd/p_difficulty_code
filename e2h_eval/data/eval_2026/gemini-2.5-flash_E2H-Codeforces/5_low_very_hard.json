Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Colored Boots Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The core is finding the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can only be in one pair. The compatibility rules are simple: same colors match directly (e.g., 'f' with 'f'), and a '?' matches anything. I need to output the indices of the pairs, which suggests I need to track those carefully.\n\nGiven the input size (`n` up to 150000), a brute-force `O(N^2)` approach is out of the question. I need an `O(N log N)` or `O(N)` solution, which means a smarter strategy.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize the boots based on their color. I'll create dictionaries (or maybe `defaultdict(list)`) to store the 1-indexed indices of left and right boots for each color ('a' to 'z' and '?'). For example, `left_boots['c']` will contain the indices of all left boots with the color 'c'. This makes it much easier to efficiently look for matches.\n\nThe matching strategy should prioritize direct color matches first. The '?' matches should be used as a fallback for any unmatched boots, because they have the flexibility to pair with anything left over after the specific color matches are done. I think this will get me to the optimal number of pairs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to output these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite) (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\nEach boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should use a greedy strategy. The key observation is that boots with specific colors are less flexible than boots with indefinite colors ('?'). Therefore, it's generally better to use specific-colored boots for specific matches first, reserving '?' boots for situations where no specific match is available or to fill gaps.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    First, we need to efficiently access boots of a certain color. We can use lists (or `collections.defaultdict(list)`) to store the 1-indexed original positions of boots for each color. We'll have `left_boots[char]` and `right_boots[char]` for `char` from 'a' to 'z' and for '?'.\n\n    ```python\n    left_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)] # 0-25 for 'a'-'z', 26 for '?'\n    right_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    # Helper to convert char to index: 'a'->0, 'b'->1, ..., 'z'->25, '?'->26\n    def char_to_idx(char):\n        if char == '?':\n            return 26\n        return ord(char) - ord('a')\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(l):\n        left_boots[char_to_idx(char)].append(i + 1)\n    for i, char in enumerate(r):\n        right_boots[char_to_idx(char)].append(i + 1)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a', 'b' with 'b', etc.):**\n    The most restrictive matches are between two specific, identical colors. We should prioritize these because they don't involve the flexible '?' boots.\n    Iterate through all specific colors 'a' through 'z'. For each color `c`, match as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible.\n\n    ```python\n    pairs = []\n    for i in range(26): # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[i] and right_boots[i]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[i].pop(), right_boots[i].pop()))\n    ```\n\n3.  **Match Left '?' with Specific Right Colors:**\n    After specific-to-specific matches, we have remaining boots. Now, consider left boots with '?' color. These can match any specific right boot that is still available. It's beneficial to use them now because they consume a specific right boot, which is less flexible than a '?' right boot.\n\n    ```python\n    # left_boots[26] holds '?' left boots\n    # Iterate through specific right colors 'a' through 'z'\n    for i in range(26):\n        while left_boots[26] and right_boots[i]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[26].pop(), right_boots[i].pop()))\n    ```\n\n4.  **Match Specific Left Colors with Right '?':**\n    Symmetrically, consider specific left boots that remain. These can match any right boot with '?' color. This step is similar to the previous one, prioritizing using the specific left boots.\n\n    ```python\n    # right_boots[26] holds '?' right boots\n    # Iterate through specific left colors 'a' through 'z'\n    for i in range(26):\n        while left_boots[i] and right_boots[26]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[i].pop(), right_boots[26].pop()))\n    ```\n\n5.  **Match Left '?' with Right '?':**\n    Finally, any remaining left '?' boots can be matched with any remaining right '?' boots. These are the least restrictive matches, so they are handled last.\n\n    ```python\n    while left_boots[26] and right_boots[26]:\n        pairs.append((left_boots[26].pop(), right_boots[26].pop()))\n    ```\n\nThis greedy strategy covers all possible compatible combinations in an order that maximizes the total number of pairs. Each boot index is used at most once because `pop()` removes it from its list.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n=10, l=\"codeforces\", r=\"dodivthree\"`\n\nInitial state (indices 1-based):\n`left_boots`:\n'c': [1, 8]\n'o': [2, 6]\n'd': [3]\n'e': [4, 9]\n'f': [5]\n'r': [7]\n's': [10]\n'?': []\n\n`right_boots`:\n'd': [1, 4]\n'o': [2]\n'i': [3]\n'v': [5]\n't': [6]\n'h': [7]\n'r': [8]\n'e': [9, 10]\n'?': []\n\n1.  **Specific-to-Specific Matches:**\n    - 'c': No 'c' in `right_boots`.\n    - 'd': `left_boots['d']=[3]`, `right_boots['d']=[1, 4]`. Match (3, 4).\n      `left_boots['d']=[], right_boots['d']=[1]`.\n    - 'e': `left_boots['e']=[4, 9]`, `right_boots['e']=[9, 10]`. Match (9, 10), then (4, 9).\n      `left_boots['e']=[], right_boots['e']=[]`.\n    - 'o': `left_boots['o']=[2, 6]`, `right_boots['o']=[2]`. Match (6, 2).\n      `left_boots['o']=[2], right_boots['o']=[]`.\n    - 'r': `left_boots['r']=[7]`, `right_boots['r']=[8]`. Match (7, 8).\n      `left_boots['r']=[], right_boots['r']=[]`.\n    - Other specific colors: No matches.\n\n    `pairs = [(3, 4), (9, 10), (4, 9), (6, 2), (7, 8)]` (Order might vary due to `pop()`)\n\n    Remaining:\n    `left_boots`: 'c': [1, 8], 'o': [2], 'f': [5], 's': [10], '?': []\n    `right_boots`: 'd': [1], 'i': [3], 'v': [5], 't': [6], 'h': [7], '?': []\n\n2.  **Left '?' with Specific Right Colors:**\n    `left_boots['?']` is empty. No matches.\n\n3.  **Specific Left Colors with Right '?':**\n    `right_boots['?']` is empty. No matches.\n\n4.  **Left '?' with Right '?':**\n    Both are empty. No matches.\n\nTotal pairs = 5. The example output is `5` and then `7 8, 4 9, 2 2, 9 10, 3 1`. The specific pairs can differ due to multiple choices or `pop()` order, but the count should be the same. My example output for `(3,4)` and `(9,10)` are correct. `(4,9)` is also correct. `(6,2)` is `(o,o)`. Example output has `(2,2)` (o,o). Indices for 'o' are `l_2, l_6` and `r_2`. If we pop `l_2` and `r_2`, we get `(2,2)`. My order was `(6,2)`. Both are valid. The example output has `(3,1)` for `(d,d)`. My order was `(3,4)`. Both are valid.\nThe example output `5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1` matches 5 pairs.\n\nThis approach is efficient:\n- Populating lists: O(N)\n- Specific-to-specific matches: O(26 * N_max_per_color) which is O(N) in total as each boot is processed once.\n- '?' matches: O(2 * 26 * N_max_per_color) which is O(N) in total.\nOverall time complexity: O(N).\nSpace complexity: O(N) to store boot indices and pairs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed boot positions for each color.\n    # We use a list of lists.
