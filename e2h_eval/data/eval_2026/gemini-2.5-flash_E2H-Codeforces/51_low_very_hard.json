Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Amusing Joke\" problem. Let's break this down. Basically, I'm given two names and a pile of letters, and I need to determine if I can construct the pile using the letters from the two names, potentially in a scrambled order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints.  The key here is that I must use *all* the letters from the names to form the pile, and no extra letters are allowed. So, conceptually, I have to perform two checks:\n\n1.  **Letter Count Equality:** The number of occurrences of *each* letter in the combined names *must* match the number of occurrences of that letter in the pile. If I have, say, two 'A's in the combined names, I *must* have exactly two 'A's in the pile. Zero mismatches are allowed.\n\n2.  **Total Length Equality:** The combined length of the two names needs to be equal to the length of the pile of letters. This seems redundant because if the letter counts match up, their overall length will also match up. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nTo verify this, I will manually check the example. The combined name is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". If I count the letter occurance of each, there should be no discrepancy.\n\nOkay, let's think about how I'd approach writing this script. I'll probably use dictionaries (or `Counter` objects) to efficiently count the characters in each string. I can merge the character counts for the two names, and then compare them directly against the character counts for the pile. If the dictionaries are identical, then the pile can be formed from the names. If not, then it can't.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given pile of letters (`pile_letters`) can be formed by combining the letters from a guest's name (`guest_name`) and a host's name (`host_name`), without any letters missing or being extra. This is essentially a check for anagrams, specifically if `pile_letters` is an anagram of the concatenation of `guest_name` and `host_name`.\n\nTo solve this, we can count the frequency of each character in both the combined names and the pile of letters. If the character counts match exactly for all characters, then the letters in the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, and vice-versa.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1.  Read the three input lines: `guest_name`, `host_name`, and `pile_letters`.\n2.  Concatenate `guest_name` and `host_name` to form a single string, let's call it `combined_names`.\n3.  Count the frequency of each character in `combined_names`. A dictionary or a `collections.Counter` object is suitable for this.\n4.  Count the frequency of each character in `pile_letters`.\n5.  Compare the two frequency counts. If they are identical (meaning every character has the same count in both strings), print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nAn alternative and simpler way to compare character frequencies (especially in Python) is to sort the characters of both strings and then compare the sorted strings directly. If two strings are anagrams of each other, their sorted versions will be identical.\n\nLet's use the sorting approach as it's concise and efficient for this problem's constraints (line length up to 100).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the guest's name from the first line of input\n    guest_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Read the host's name from the second line of input\n    host_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Read the pile of letters from the third line of input\n    pile_letters = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name\n    combined_names = guest_name + host_name\n\n    # Sort the characters of the combined names string\n    # This creates a list of characters, which is then joined back into a string\n    sorted_combined_names = \"\".join(sorted(combined_names))\n\n    # Sort the characters of the pile of letters string\n    sorted_pile_letters = \"\".join(sorted(pile_letters))\n\n    # Compare the sorted strings. If they are identical, it means\n    # the pile of letters contains exactly the same letters (with the same frequencies)\n    # as the combined names.\n    if sorted_combined_names == sorted_pile_letters:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
