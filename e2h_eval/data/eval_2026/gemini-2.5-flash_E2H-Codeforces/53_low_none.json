Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this competitive programming problem in my sights. The core is finding the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, which adds a bit of a wrinkle. I'm dealing with strings of lowercase Latin letters, and the length is capped at 100, which is useful.\n\nSince the input size is relatively small, I think a brute-force approach is perfectly acceptable. I'll need to generate all possible substrings and check their frequency.\n\nLet me break down my strategy. First, I have to consider all possible substrings. A substring is defined by its starting position and its length.  Given a string of length 'n', I can iterate through all possible starting positions, from 0 up to `n-1`, and for each starting position, I can generate substrings of lengths from 1 up to the remaining length.\n\nTo efficiently find the *longest* substring, I'll iterate through possible lengths in decreasing order, from `n-1` down to 1.  As soon as I find a substring length that occurs at least twice, I can immediately return that length because it will be the maximum possible length.  If no substring repeats, I'll return 0.\n\nSo, here's the algorithm:\n\n1.  I'll initialize `max_len` to 0.\n2.  I'll iterate through lengths `L` from `n-1` down to 1.\n3.  For each `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions `i` (from 0 to `n-L`).  I create a substring `sub = s[i : i+L]`.\n4.  Then, for that `sub`, I have to count how many times it appears in the original string `s`, allowing for overlaps.  I'll iterate through starting positions `j` (from 0 to `n-L`) and compare each `s[j : j+L]` with `sub`.\n5.  If a substring's count is 2 or more, I've found a valid substring. I return `L` immediately because this is the largest length encountered yet.\n6. If the loops complete without finding any substring that occurs at least twice, I return 0.\n\nI think I've got a good handle on this now. I'm ready to translate this into a Python script and get a correct solution.\n",
