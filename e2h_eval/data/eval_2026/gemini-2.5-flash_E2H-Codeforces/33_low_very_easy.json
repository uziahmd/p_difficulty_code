You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. Let's break down my thoughts. The core of it is this: I have a number `a` and a sequence of digits `s`. I can swap digits in `a` with those from `s`, but I have to use each digit in `s` at most once. The goal is to maximize the resulting number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem fully.  I realize the numbers are strings of digits.  The length of `a` remains constant. That's a key constraint.  To make a number the largest, the most important thing is to make the leftmost digits as large as possible.  It's a greedy approach.\n\nThe algorithm that pops into mind is this:\n\n1.  **Preparation:** Convert the strings `a` and `s` into lists of characters or integers. That makes manipulation easier.\n2.  **Sort the Replacements:** Sort the digits in `s` in descending order. This ensures I always consider the largest available digit first, enabling my greedy strategy.\n3.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right.\n4.  **Replacement Logic:** Maintain an index `j` to track my position in the sorted `s` list. For each digit in `a`:\n    *   Check if I still have digits in `s` to use (i.e., `j` is within bounds).\n    *   If the current largest digit in `s` (i.e., `s[j]`) is *greater* than the current digit in `a`, I replace `a[i]` with `s[j]`.  Then, I move to the next digit in `s`.\n    *   If the current digit in `s` is *not* greater, or if I've exhausted `s`, I keep the digit in `a` as is.  There's no point in looking for a smaller digit, or waiting, since the goal is maximizing from left to right.\n5.  **Output:** Finally, I join the modified list of digits back into a string and print it as the maximized number.\n\nLet me walk through that example they gave me.\n\n`a = \"1024\"`, `s = \"010\"`\n\n1.  `a_list = ['1', '0', '2', '4']`\n2.  `s_list = ['0', '1', '0']`\n3.  `s_sorted = ['1', '0', '0']`\n4.  `j = 0`\n\n*   For the first digit `1`: Can I replace it? `1 > 1` No. Keep the 1.\n*   Next digit `0`:  `1 > 0` Yes. Replace the 0 with 1. `s[j]` becomes `1`. Now `a` is `1124`. `j` goes up by one.\n*   The second and third remaining digits. Since there are no more larger digits, those in a stay the same.\n\nSo, the result is `1124`.  That sounds right. I'm going to implement this, and I feel confident I've got a solid plan.\n",
