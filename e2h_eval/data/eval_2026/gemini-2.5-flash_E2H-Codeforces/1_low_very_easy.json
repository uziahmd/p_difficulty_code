The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Gilded Cell Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The core of this problem seems pretty straightforward once I get the right formulas.\n\nI've got the plate dimensions, `w` (width) and `h` (height), and the number of rings, `k`. Each ring's a border around an inner rectangle, and I'm treating them as a sequence, with ring 1 being the outermost.\n\nThe critical bit is understanding how those inner rectangles shrink with each ring. For ring `i`, the effective width (`W_i`) is `w - 4 * (i - 1)`, and the height (`H_i`) is `h - 4 * (i - 1)`.  That \" - 4(i - 1)\" part is key: it accounts for the cells removed from each side as the rings move inwards.\n\nNow, how many cells are in a ring?  Thinking about it as the border of a rectangle, I can calculate the cells for an `W_i x H_i` rectangle as `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`. That formula should work since it accounts for the corners being counted twice and seems to be validated by the examples. Alternatively, I could express it as `2 * (W_i - 1) + 2 * (H_i - 1)`.\n\nSo, the plan is to iterate from 1 to `k`, calculating the ring size for each `i`, and sum them up. In each iteration: I calculate `current_w` and `current_h`, use that handy formula to find the number of cells in that ring, and then add that to a running total.\n\nThe constraints given, `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)`, should make sure that I always have a valid rectangle size for my rings. Maximum value of k ensures the innermost ring will have dimensions of at least 3x3. These constraints suggest the calculation shouldn't be too computationally intensive.\n",
