He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Check the String\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this \"Check the String\" problem, and my initial thought process is to break it down meticulously. I see the core challenge revolves around string manipulation and pattern recognition. I need to design a Python script to effectively validate the input string `S` against a specific set of rules, which seem straightforward enough.\n\nFirst, I need to clearly define the problem's constraints and conditions. The problem states that the string `S` must be constructed in a particular way: first a sequence of 'a's, then a sequence of 'b's, and finally a sequence of 'c's. There has to be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. There is also a constraint that the number of 'c's has to equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This structure immediately makes me think of using counters to track the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n\nThe constraints are pretty generous: the string length is capped at 5000 characters. That's good; it means I can use a straightforward, iterative approach. Now, let's nail down the essential conditions that make a string \"YES\":\n\n1.  **Character Order:** The characters MUST be in the correct `a...b...c` order. Any deviation from this pattern is a clear \"NO\". This order will be the first crucial check.\n2.  **Minimum Counts:** There must be at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. A string with only 'a's, or just 'a's and 'b's is not valid.\n3.  **C's Condition:**  The number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's. This condition is the core of the problem.\n\nBased on these rules, my initial plan involves an algorithm that:\n\n1.  Iterates through the input string `S` while keeping a count of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n2.  Ensures the character order rule is obeyed.\n3.  Validates the minimum counts of each character.\n4.  Finally, checks if the number of 'c's meets the required condition based on the counts of 'a's and 'b's.\n\nThat's the basic framework. I will proceed to write the Python code, with careful attention to edge cases and optimization.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` could have been formed according to a specific set of rules. Let's break down these rules and translate them into conditions for the string `S`.\n\n1.  **A's string:** Starts with some number of 'a's. This means the string must begin with 'a' and have at least one 'a'.\n2.  **B appends 'b's:** B appends some 'b's to A's string. At this point, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. It's guaranteed that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. This implies:\n    *   The string must contain at least one 'a'.\n    *   The string must contain at least one 'b'.\n    *   All 'a's must appear before all 'b's.\n3.  **C appends 'c's:** C appends some 'c's to the end. The string now has 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's OR equal to the number of 'b's. This implies:\n    *   All 'b's must appear before all 'c's.\n    *   Let `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` be the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's respectively. Then `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`.\n\nCombining these rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy the following:\n\n1.  **Character Order:** The string must consist of zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, followed by zero or more 'c's. Importantly, no 'a' can appear after a 'b' or 'c' has started, and no 'b' can appear after a 'c' has started. This means the string must be of the form `a...ab...bc...c`.\n2.  **Minimum Counts:** Based on the problem statement (\"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" after B's step), we must have:\n    *   `count_a >= 1`\n    *   `count_b >= 1`\n    *   The number of 'c's (`count_c`) must also be at least 1, because if `count_c` were 0, the condition `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b` would imply `count_a` or `count_b` is 0, which contradicts the minimum count requirement.\n3.  **C's Condition:** `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can iterate through the string `S` to count the characters and simultaneously check their order.\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a = 0`, `count_b = 0`, `count_c = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the string `S`:\n    *   If the current character is 'a', increment `count_a`.\n    *   If the current character is 'b':\n        *   If `count_a` is 0 (meaning a 'b' appeared before any 'a's), the order is incorrect. Return \"NO\".\n        *   Increment `count_b`.\n    *   If the current character is 'c':\n        *   If `count_a` is 0 or `count_b` is 0 (meaning a 'c' appeared before any 'a's or 'b's), the order is incorrect. Return \"NO\".\n        *   Increment `count_c`.\n3.  After iterating through the entire string, check the final conditions:\n    *   `count_a >= 1`\n    *   `count_b >= 1`\n    *   `count_c >= 1`\n    *   `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`\n\n    If all these conditions are met, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n**Edge Case Considerations:**\n*   String like \"aaabbbaaccc\": The iteration logic will catch 'a' after 'b' or 'c'.\n    A more robust way to check order is to use separate loops or state:\n    *   First, consume all 'a's, counting `count_a`.\n    *   Then, consume all 'b's, counting `count_b`.\n    *   Then, consume all 'c's, counting `count_c`.\n    *   If any other character is encountered at any stage, or if the string isn't fully consumed, it's invalid.\n\nLet's refine the order check:\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a = 0`, `count_b = 0`, `count_c = 0`.\n2.  Use an index `i` to traverse the string.\n3.  **Phase 1: Count 'a's**\n    While `i < len(S)` and `S[i] == 'a'`:\n        `count_a += 1`\n        `i += 1`\n4.  **Phase 2: Count 'b's**\n    While `i < len(S)` and `S[i] == 'b'`:\n        `count_b += 1`\n        `i += 1`\n5.  **Phase 3: Count 'c's**\n    While `i < len(S)` and `S[i] == 'c'`:\n        `count_c += 1`\n        `i += 1`\n6.  **Final Checks:**\n    *   If `i < len(S)` (meaning there are characters left that are not 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the correct sequence, like 'ba' or 'ac'), return \"NO\".\n    *   If `count_a == 0` or `count_b == 0` or `count_c == 0`, return \"NO\". (This covers the \"at least one a, b, c\" requirement).\n    *   If `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`, return \"YES\".\n    *   Otherwise (if C's condition is not met), return \"NO\".\n\nThis refined algorithm correctly handles all order and count conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    n = len(s)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n    \n    i = 0\n    \n    # Phase 1: Count 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Phase 2: Count 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Phase 3: Count 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Check if any characters are left (incorrect order)\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check minimum counts\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check C's condition\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
