Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. The core of it is this: I've got an array, and I need to figure out the least unstable version of it after I remove one element.  \"Instability\" is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.  So, I'm thinking,  given an array of size *n*, I need to find the minimum of `max(new_array) - min(new_array)` across all possible new arrays of size *n-1*.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out is that sorting the array is going to be crucial. If I sort it, let's call it `a_sorted`, I get a much clearer picture of what's happening. I have  `a_sorted = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]` where `s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n`. Now,  the initial instability is simply  `s_n - s_1`.\n\nLet's break down the impact of removing different elements. If I remove the smallest element, `s_1`, the new minimum is `s_2`, and the new maximum is still `s_n`. The instability becomes `s_n - s_2`.  If I remove the largest element, `s_n`, the new maximum is `s_{n-1}`, and the minimum remains `s_1`. That instability becomes `s_{n-1} - s_1`. If I remove *any* other element, the maximum and minimum *of the remaining elements* are always the original maximum and minimum. This is true because the removed element is neither the minimum nor the maximum.\n\nNow, comparing these, it's pretty clear that I can ignore removing elements that aren't the smallest or largest. Removing these other elements does not offer the potential to minimize the final instability, since the instability remains the same. The key is in choosing the better of the two cases: removing the smallest or the largest element.  I need to compare `s_n - s_2` and `s_{n-1} - s_1`.  Whichever is smaller is the answer.\n\nSo, here's my strategy:\n\n1.  Sort the array.\n2.  Calculate the two potential instability values: `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]` (remove the smallest element) and `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]` (remove the largest).\n3.  Return the minimum of these two.\n\nThat should be the solution.\n",
