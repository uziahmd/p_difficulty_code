The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tower Signal Power Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to determine the probability of successfully setting signal powers for a network of radio towers.  I need to figure out the right combination of tower locations and power levels to satisfy the given constraints.\n\nHere's the setup: I have `n+2` towns, numbered from 0 to `n+1`.  The radio towers are potentially built in towns 1 through `n`, with each tower's presence determined randomly with a 50% chance.  Each tower, if present, has a signal power `p` that determines its coverage radius.  The tricky part is setting the power levels to meet the specific requirements.\n\nThe core constraints are:\n\n1.  Towns 0 and `n+1` must *never* receive any signal. That's a hard boundary.\n2.  Each of the towns 1 through `n` must be covered by *exactly one* tower's signal.  This implies the coverage zones need to perfectly partition the central towns.\n\nThinking this through, if I have a tower at town `i` with power `p_i`, it will cover towns within the range `(i - p_i, i + p_i)`.  Importantly, I need to translate this to the actual town numbers, so I'll need to use `max(0, i - p_i + 1)` and `min(n + 1, i + p_i - 1)` to handle the boundaries.\n\nFor constraint 1, the powers must be limited.  A tower at town `i` cannot cover town 0 if `i < p_i`, nor can it cover `n+1` if `n + 1 - i < p_i`. So, for a valid power `p_i`, I have to have `p_i <= min(i, n+1-i)`.\n\nConstraint 2 is where the partitioning becomes crucial. For each town `k` between 1 and `n`, exactly one tower must be the source of its signal.  This is basically a disjoint set cover problem.  If `C(i, p_i)` represents the towns covered by tower `i` with power `p_i`, then the union of all the `C(i, p_i)` where a tower exists must be the set of towns from 1 to `n`, and the intersections between any two such coverage sets must be empty.\n\nI need to focus on what happens for a single town `i`. It must be covered by the range of another tower, so if `i-p_i+1` is less than 1, and the same if `i+p_i-1` is greater than `n`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random configuration of radio towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ (each built with probability $1/2$), we can assign signal powers $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to built towers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p$. This means $i-p < c < i+p$.\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built.\n\n**Constraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.**\nFor any tower at $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$:\n- Town $0$ is not covered: $|0-i| < p_i \\implies i < p_i$ must be false. So $p_i \\le i$.\n- Town $n+1$ is not covered: $|(n+1)-i| < p_i \\implies n+1-i < p_i$ must be false. So $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nCombining these, $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.**\nThis means the intervals covered by towers must form a partition of the towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ (considering only towns $1, \\dots, n$).\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ imply:\n- $L_i = i-p_i+1 \\ge i-(i)+1 = 1$. So $L_i \\ge 1$.\n- $R_i = i+p_i-1 \\le i+(n+1-i)-1 = n$. So $R_i \\le n$.\nThus, the covered interval $[L_i, R_i]$ is always within $[1, n]$.\nThe length of this interval is $R_i - L_i + 1 = (i+p_i-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = 2p_i-1$.\n\nFor the intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, they must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis implies that if we sort the intervals by their left endpoints, say $[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$ where $L_1 < L_2 < \\dots < L_k$, then we must have $L_1 = 1$, $R_k = n$, and $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis means $L_1=1$, $L_2=R_1+1$, $L_3=R_2+1$, etc., and $R_k=n$.\nThe towns $i \\in S$ are the centers of these intervals. For an interval $[L, R]$ centered at $i$, we have $i = (L+R)/2$. This implies $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity.\nAlso, $p_i = (R-L+1+1)/2 = (R-L+2)/2$.\n\nConsider the parity of town indices. If a town $k$ is covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, then $i-p_i < k < i+p_i$.\nThis implies $k \\equiv i-p_i+1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, all towns covered by a single tower must have the same parity as $i-p_i+1$.\nFor the intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and cover all towns $1, \\dots, n$, each interval $[L, R]$ must contain towns of both parities if $R-L+1 > 1$.\nSpecifically, if $L$ and $R$ have different parities, then the interval $[L, R]$ contains an equal number of odd and even towns (or one more of one parity if $R-L+1$ is odd).\nHowever, $i=(L+R)/2$ requires $L$ and $R$ to have the same parity.\nIf $L$ and $R$ have the same parity, then $R-L+1$ is odd. The interval $[L, R]$ contains $(R-L+1)/2 + 1$ towns of one parity and $(R-L+1)/2$ towns of the other parity.\nFor example, if $L=1, R=1$, then $i=1, p_1=1$. Covers town $1$.\nIf $L=1, R=3$, then $i=2, p_2=2$. Covers towns $1,2,3$.\nIf $L=1, R=5$, then $i=3, p_3=3$. Covers towns $1,2,3,4,5$.\n\nThe key observation is that $i$ and $p_i$ define $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe center $i$ and the endpoints $L_i, R_i$ must satisfy $L_i+R_i = 2i$.\nAlso $R_i-L_i+1 = 2p_i-1$.\nThis means $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\nIf we have a valid partition $[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$, then:\n$L_1=1, R_k=n$.\n$L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity for all $j$.\n$R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nThis implies $L_{j+1}$ must have parity opposite to $R_j$.\nBut $R_j$ and $L_j$ have the same parity, and $L_{j+1}$ and $R_{j+1}$ have the same parity.\nSo $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have opposite parities.\nThis means $1, L_2, L_3, \\dots, L_k$ must alternate parities.\nIf $L_1=1$ (odd), then $L_2$ must be even, $L_3$ must be odd, and so on.\nThis implies $L_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$.\nSimilarly, $R_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$.\nSince $R_k=n$, this implies $n$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2$.\n\nConsider the towns $i \\in S$. The value $i$ is the midpoint of its covered interval $[L_i, R_i]$.\nThe condition $L_j, R_j$ having the same parity means $L_j \\equiv R_j \\pmod 2$.\nThe condition $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ means $R_j \\not\\equiv L_{j+1} \\pmod 2$.\nSo $L_j \\equiv R_j \\not\\equiv L_{j+1} \\equiv R_{j+1} \\pmod 2$.\nThis means all $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\nBut $L_1=1$ (odd) and $L_2=R_1+1$ (even). This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the parity argument.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$.\nThe length of this interval is $2p_i-1$. This is always an odd number.\nAn interval of odd length $[L, R]$ means $R-L+1$ is odd, so $R$ and $L$ must have the same parity.\nThe center of the interval is $i = (L+R)/2$.\nSo, $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nWe have $L_1=1$. So $R_1$ must be odd.\nThen $L_2 = R_1+1$ must be even.\nThen $R_2$ must be even.\nThen $L_3 = R_2+1$ must be odd.\nAnd so on.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must be odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nFinally, $R_k=n$. So if $k$ is odd, $n$ must be odd. If $k$ is even, $n$ must be even.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe towns $i \\in S$ are the midpoints. $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nIf $j$ is odd, $L_j, R_j$ are odd. So $L_j+R_j$ is even. $i_j$ is an integer.\nIf $j$ is even, $L_j, R_j$ are even. So $L_j+R_j$ is even. $i_j$ is an integer.\nThis condition is always met.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the towers.\nThe set of towns $S$ must be such that we can choose powers $p_i$ to form a partition.\nThis means $S$ must be exactly the set of midpoints of the partition intervals.\nFor a partition $1=L_1 \\le R_1 < L_2 \\le R_2 < \\dots < L_k \\le R_k=n$, where $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$ and $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\nThe set of towers $S$ must be $\\{ (L_j+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k \\}$.\nNotice that $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $R_1$ must be odd.\n$L_2=R_1+1$ (even). So $R_2$ must be even.\n$L_3=R_2+1$ (odd). So $R_3$ must be odd.\nThis means $L_j, R_j$ are odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nConsequently, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$:\nIf $j$ is odd, $L_j, R_j$ are odd. $i_j$ is an integer.\nIf $j$ is even, $L_j, R_j$ are even. $i_j$ is an integer.\nThe requirement is that a tower must be built at $i_j$ for each $j$.\nAnd no tower can be built at any other town.\nSo, if a town $t \\notin S$, no tower is built there. If $t \\in S$, a tower is built there.\n\nThis implies that the set of towns where towers are built must be precisely the set of midpoints of a valid partition.\nA configuration of built towers is valid if and only if there exists a sequence $1=L_1, R_1, L_2, R_2, \\dots, L_k, R_k=n$ such that:\n1. $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\n2. $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n3. The set of towns where towers are built is exactly $\\{(L_j+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n4. The number of intervals $k$ must have the same parity as $n$.\n\nLet's call such a set of towns $S$ \"valid\".\nThe probability is the number of valid sets $S$ multiplied by $(1/2)^N$, where $N$ is the number of towns in $S$. No, this is wrong.\nThe total number of configurations is $2^n$. We need to count the number of valid configurations.\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, a tower is built with probability $1/2$.\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of ways to partition towns $1, \\dots, i$ into valid intervals, such that towers are built only at the midpoints of these intervals.\nThe last interval ends at $i$. Let it be $[L, i]$. Its midpoint is $(L+i)/2$.\nWe need a tower at $(L+i)/2$.\n$L$ and $i$ must have the same parity.\nIf $i$ is odd: $L$ must be odd.\nIf $i$ is even: $L$ must be even.\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of ways to form a valid partition for towns $1, \\dots, i$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty partition).\nFor $i \\ge 1$:\n$dp[i] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv i \\pmod 2}^{i} dp[L-1]$\nThis is because if the last interval is $[L, i]$, then towns $1, \\dots, L-1$ must form a valid partition.\nThe town $(L+i)/2$ must have a tower, and towns $L, \\dots, i$ are covered by it.\nAll towns $j < L$ must be covered by previous towers. All towns $j > i$ are not yet considered.\nAll towns $t$ such that $t \\ne (L+i)/2$ and $1 \\le t \\le i$ must not have a tower if they are not a midpoint of a previous interval.\nThe sum implies that we are counting the number of sequences of $L_j, R_j$.\nLet $f_n$ be the number of valid sets $S$ for towns $1, \\dots, n$.\n$f_0 = 1$ (empty set $S$).\n$f_1$: If $S=\\{1\\}$, $L_1=1, R_1=1$. $k=1$. $n=1, k=1$ (same parity). Valid.\n$f_2$: If $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $L_1=1, R_1=1$, $L_2=2, R_2=2$. $k=2$. $n=2, k=2$ (same parity). Valid.\nIf $S=\\{2\\}$, $L_1=1, R_1=3$ not possible for $n=2$. $L_1=1, R_1=2$ not possible ($L_1, R_1$ diff parity).\nIf $S=\\{2\\}$, $L_1=1, R_1=3$ is not possible as $R_1=3 > n=2$.\nIf $S=\\{2\\}$, $L_1=1, R_1=2$ is not possible as $L_1, R_1$ have different parities.\nThe only way to cover $1, \\dots, n$ is for $L_1, \\dots, R_k$ to be a partition.\n$f_n$ is the number of ways to partition $1, \\dots, n$ into such intervals.\n$f_0 = 1$.\n$f_n = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n f_{L-1}$.\nThis sum is equivalent to $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ if $n$ and $n-2$ have the same parity.\n$f_n = f_{n-1}$ (if $n$ is odd, $L=n$ is the only term $f_{n-1}$ for $L=n$)\n$f_n = f_{n-2}$ (if $n$ is even, $L=n$ is the only term $f_{n-1}$ for $L=n$)\nLet's list them:\n$f_0=1$\n$f_1$: $L=1$. $f_0=1$. So $f_1=1$. (Partition [1,1])\n$f_2$: $L=2$. $f_1=1$. So $f_2=1$. (Partition [1,2] is not valid. $L=1, R=2$ different parity. $L=2, R=2$ valid, but $L_1=1$ is missing)\nThe rule is that $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$L_1=1, R_1$ must be odd.\n$L_2=R_1+1, R_2$ must be even.\n$L_3=R_2+1, R_3$ must be odd.\n...\n$L_k=R_{k-1}+1, R_k=n$. $R_k$ must have the same parity as $L_k$.\nThis means $n$ must have the same parity as $L_k$.\nAnd $L_k$ has parity $k \\pmod 2$. So $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nLet $F_n$ be the number of ways to partition towns $1, \\dots, n$ into such intervals.\n$F_0 = 1$.\n$F_n = \\sum_{j=1, j \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n F_{j-1}$.\nThis is $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n$F_0=1$.\n$F_1$: $L=1$. $F_0=1$. So $F_1=1$.\n$F_2$: $L=2$. $F_1=1$. So $F_2=1$. (This is for partition $[1,2]$ not allowed. $L=2, R=2$ valid. $L_1=1$ must be covered.\nThe partition must cover $1, \\dots, n$.\nIf $n=2$, the last interval is $[L, 2]$. $L$ must be even. So $L=2$. The interval is $[2,2]$. The midpoint is $2$.\nFor $1, \\dots, L-1 = 1$, we need a partition. $F_1=1$. So we have partition $[1,1]$ for $1$.\nSo for $n=2$, we have partition $[1,1], [2,2]$. Midpoints $\\{1,2\\}$. This is a valid configuration. $F_2=1$.\n$F_3$: $L$ must be odd. $L=1$ or $L=3$.\nIf $L=1$, last interval is $[1,3]$. Midpoint $2$. Previous partition is $F_0=1$.\nIf $L=3$, last interval is $[3,3]$. Midpoint $3$. Previous partition is $F_2=1$.\nSo $F_3 = F_0 + F_2 = 1+1=2$.\nThe partitions are:\n1. $S=\\{2\\}$. Partition $[1,3]$.\n2. $S=\\{1,3\\}$. Partition $[1,1], [3,3]$.\n$F_4$: $L$ must be even. $L=2$ or $L=4$.\nIf $L=2$, last interval is $[2,4]$. Midpoint $3$. Previous partition is $F_1=1$.\nIf $L=4$, last interval is $[4,4]$. Midpoint $4$. Previous partition is $F_3=2$.\nSo $F_4 = F_1 + F_3 = 1+2=3$.\nThe partitions are:\n1. $S=\\{1,3\\}$. Partition $[1,1], [2,4]$.\n2. $S=\\{2,4\\}$. Partition $[1,3], [4,4]$.\n3. $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$. Partition $[1,1], [2,2], [4,4]$.\nThis sequence $F_n$ is the Fibonacci sequence shifted: $F_n = Fib(n+1)$ where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1$.\n$F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$ No, this is $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3$.\nThis sequence is $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nThis is $F_n = Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 2$, with $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\nOr, $F_n = Fib(n+1)$ for $n \\ge 1$ and $F_0=1$.\n$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ is the standard Fibonacci recurrence.\nWith $F_0=1, F_1=1$, we get $F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5$.\nThe recurrence $F_n = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n F_{L-1}$ is not $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\nLet's check the recurrence $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$:\n$F_0=1, F_1=1$.\n$F_2 = F_1+F_0 = 1+1=2$.\n$F_3 = F_2+F_1 = 2+1=3$.\n$F_4 = F_3+F_2 = 3+2=5$.\nThis sequence is $F_n = Fib(n+1)$ where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, \\dots$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $(n+1)$-th Fibonacci number.\n\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_n$.\nFor each valid configuration $S$, we need to calculate its probability.\nIf $S$ contains $k$ towns, its probability is $(1/2)^k$.\nThe total probability is $\\sum_{S \\text{ valid}} (1/2)^{|S|}$.\nFor a given partition $1=L_1 \\le R_1 < \\dots < L_k \\le R_k=n$, the set $S$ has size $k$.\nSo we need to sum $F_n$ terms, each of the form $(1/2)^k$.\nNo, this is wrong. $F_n$ is the number of ways to partition. Each way has a certain number of towers.\nWe need to sum $1/2^k$ for each partition with $k$ intervals.\nLet $G_n$ be the desired sum.\n$G_0 = 1$.\n$G_n = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n G_{L-1} \\cdot (1/2)$.\nThe $(1/2)$ factor comes from the tower at $(L+n)/2$.\n$G_0 = 1$.\n$G_1 = G_0 \\cdot (1/2) = 1/2$. (Partition [1,1], $k=1$)\n$G_2 = G_1 \\cdot (1/2) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4$. (Partition [1,1],[2,2], $k=2$)\n$G_3 = G_0 \\cdot (1/2) + G_2 \\cdot (1/2) = (1/2) + (1/4)(1/2) = 1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8$.\nThis is not correct.\nLet's re-read the example for $n=3$. Output is $1/4$. My $G_3=5/8$.\nMy $F_n$ counts the number of partitions.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$.\n1. Partition $[1,3]$. Midpoint $2$. $S=\\{2\\}$. Size $k=1$. Probability $(1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\n2. Partition $[1,1],[3,3]$. Midpoints $1,3$. $S=\\{1,3\\}$. Size $k=2$. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nThe set of towns where towers are built must be *exactly* the set of midpoints of the partition.\nThis means for a partition with $k$ intervals, there are $k$ towns where towers *must* be built.\nFor these $k$ towns, the probability is $(1/2)^k$.\nFor the remaining $n-k$ towns, towers *must not* be built. The probability for these is $(1/2)^{n-k}$.\nSo, for a specific partition with $k$ intervals, the probability of that exact configuration is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis means every valid configuration has probability $(1/2)^n$.\nSo the total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\nLet's check the examples with $F_n = Fib(n+1)$ where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1$.\n$F_0=1$.\n$F_1=Fib(2)=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\n$n=1$: Output $748683265$. This is $1/2 \\pmod{998244353}$. $998244353/2 = 499122176.5$.\n$499122177$ is $(1/2)$.\nMy $F_1=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$. This matches.\n\n$n=2$: Output $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$F_2=Fib(3)=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. This does not match.\nExample says $1/4$.\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThe definition of $F_n$ is the number of ways to partition towns $1, \\dots, n$ into valid intervals.\nFor $n=2$:\n$L$ must be even. $L=2$. Last interval $[2,2]$. Midpoint $2$. This covers town $2$.\nFor $1, \\dots, L-1=1$, we need a partition. $F_1=1$. This is the partition $[1,1]$. Midpoint $1$. This covers town $1$.\nSo the only partition for $n=2$ is $[1,1], [2,2]$.\nThe midpoints are $S=\\{1,2\\}$. Here $k=2$.\nThis configuration means towers are built at $1$ and $2$. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nAnd no towers are built elsewhere. There are no other towns to build towers.\nSo $F_2=1$. The probability is $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example!\n\nSo the sequence $F_n$ is:\n$F_0=1$\n$F_1=1$ (partition [1,1])\n$F_2=1$ (partition [1,1],[2,2])\n$F_3=2$ (partition [1,3] OR [1,1],[3,3])\n$F_4=3$ (partition [1,1],[2,4] OR [1,3],[4,4] OR [1,1],[2,2],[4,4])\nThis is $F_n = Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 1$, where $Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, \\dots$. (Standard $Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, \\dots$)\nAnd $F_0=1$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number, if $n \\ge 1$. $F_0$ is special.\n\nLet's verify $F_n = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n F_{L-1}$.\n$F_0=1$.\n$F_1 = F_{1-1} = F_0 = 1$. (Only $L=1$ is odd)\n$F_2 = F_{2-1} = F_1 = 1$. (Only $L=2$ is even)\n$F_3 = F_{3-1} + F_{3-3} = F_2 + F_0 = 1+1=2$. (Only $L=1, L=3$ are odd)\n$F_4 = F_{4-1} + F_{4-3} = F_3 + F_1 = 2+1=3$. (Only $L=2, L=4$ are even)\nThis sequence is correct: $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$.\nThis is $Fib(n-1)$ for $n \\ge 2$, if $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1$.\nOr $Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 1$ if $Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1$.\nLet's use $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, \\dots$\nThen $F_n = Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 1$, and $F_0=1$.\nThe problem asks for $n \\ge 1$. So we need $Fib(n)$.\n\nThe total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n$n=1: F_1=Fib(1)=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$. Matches example.\n$n=2: F_2=Fib(2)=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n$n=3: F_3=Fib(3)=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n$n=5: F_5=Fib(5)=5$. Probability $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. Matches example.\n\nSo the problem is to calculate $Fib(n) \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to compute $Fib(n)$ efficiently for $n$ up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThis can be done using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time, or iteratively in $O(n)$ time.\nSince $n$ is up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, $O(n)$ is perfectly fine.\nWe also need $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ and its modular inverse.\n$2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ can be computed using modular exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nIts inverse is $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem, also $O(\\log n)$.\n\nThe modulus is $M = 998244353$.\n$Fib(n)$ calculation:\n$f_0 = 0, f_1 = 1$. For $i=2 \\dots n$, $f_i = (f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}) \\pmod M$.\nFor $n=1$, $Fib(1)=1$.\nThen calculate $inv\\_pow2 = \\text{pow}(2, n \\cdot (M-2), M)$. This is wrong. It's $(2^n)^{-1}$.\n$inv\\_pow2 = \\text{pow}(2, n, M)$. Then $inv\\_pow2 = \\text{pow}(inv\\_pow2, M-2, M)$.\nOr directly $inv\\_pow2 = \\text{pow}(\\text{pow}(2, n, M), M-2, M)$.\nIt's better to compute $2^n$ and then its inverse.\n$pow2n = \\text{pow}(2, n, M)$.\n$inv\\_pow2n = \\text{pow}(pow2n, M-2, M)$.\nResult is $(Fib(n) \\cdot inv\\_pow2n) \\pmod M$.\n\nLet's double check $Fib(n)$ for $n=1$.\n$f_0=0, f_1=1$. So $Fib(1)=1$.\nThe code should handle $n=1$ correctly.\nThe problem statement says $1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n1.  The conditions on signal power $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ ensure towns $0$ and $n+1$ are not covered.\n2.  The condition that towns $1, \\dots, n$ are covered by *exactly one* tower implies a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into disjoint intervals $[L_j, R_j]$.\n3.  Each interval $[L_j, R_j]$ must be covered by a tower at its midpoint $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This requires $L_j, R_j$ to have the same parity.\n4.  The interval lengths $2p_j-1$ are odd, which means $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\n5.  If $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, then $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$ implies $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ have opposite parity.\n6.  Since $L_1=1$ (odd), $L_2$ must be even, $L_3$ must be odd, etc. $L_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$.\n7.  Similarly, $R_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$.\n8.  $R_k=n$ implies $n$ has parity $k \\pmod 2$.\n9.  A configuration of towers is valid if and only if the set of towns where towers are built is *exactly* the set of midpoints $\\{(L_j+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$ for some such partition.\n10. For such a configuration with $k$ towers (midpoints), there are $k$ towns where towers *must* be built, and $n-k$ towns where towers *must not* be built. The probability of this specific configuration occurring is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\n11. The total probability is the sum of probabilities of all valid configurations. Since each valid configuration has probability $(1/2)^n$, the total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$, where $F_n$ is the number of valid partitions.\n12. $F_n$ satisfies the recurrence $F_n = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv n \\pmod 2}^n F_{L-1}$ with $F_0=1$.\n13. This recurrence correctly generates $F_n = Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 1$ (using $Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, \\dots$).\n14. So the answer is $Fib(n) \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nThis logic seems sound and matches all examples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    # Calculate Fib(n)\n    # Using Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ...\n    # This corresponds to the sequence F_n where F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n    # F_n is the number of valid partitions for towns 1 to n.\n    # F_0=1 (empty partition for 0 towns)\n    # F_1=1 (partition [1,1], midpoint 1)\n    # F_2=1 (partition [1,1],[2,2], midpoints 1,2)\n    # F_3=2 (partitions [1,3] (midpoint 2) OR [1,1],[3,3] (midpoints 1,3))\n    # This sequence is Fib(n) for n >= 1 (standard definition Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1)\n    # and F_0=1.
