Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Efficiently Solving the Voucher Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem. The goal is to find the cheapest pair of non-overlapping vouchers that add up to a specific duration, `x`.  Each voucher has a start and end day, and a cost.  A naive, brute-force approach is way too slow, so I need something smarter.\n\nI'll iterate through each voucher, but for each one, I need to efficiently find a *compatible* partner. Compatibility means the vouchers don't overlap, and their durations sum to `x`. I'm thinking of sorting things somehow - maybe by start day or end day?  \n\nI realize I can fix one voucher and then search for another voucher that meets the criteria of duration and no overlap. Let's say I've got a voucher that ends at a particular day.  I need to efficiently find a voucher that starts *after* that and has the required duration.\n\nI can create a data structure (`min_cost_for_len`) keyed by duration. This structure stores the minimum cost of a voucher with a given duration that has been 'seen' (meaning it ends before the current voucher starts).  I'll process the vouchers chronologically. For each day, I consider vouchers ending on the previous day and update my `min_cost_for_len`. Then, for vouchers starting on the current day, I can use `min_cost_for_len` to quickly find a potential partner.\n\nI iterate through the days, and for each day:\n1. I look at all vouchers ending on the *previous* day.  I use their duration to update `min_cost_for_len` with the cheapest voucher seen so far for that duration.\n2. Then, I look at vouchers starting *on* the current day. I calculate the duration 'needed' to reach `x`.  If I have a valid duration to search for (positive and not too large), I check the `min_cost_for_len` for that duration.  If there's a match, I calculate the combined cost and keep track of the cheapest pair found so far.\n\nThis approach lets me quickly find a suitable partner voucher for each voucher I'm considering, while also ensuring the non-overlapping condition.  It avoids the O(N^2) brute-force. I'm using an array indexed by duration and efficiently updating the array with cheapest vouchers, sorted by end day. This makes the search faster, hopefully, O(N). If I didn't find any suitable pair, it's just -1. Otherwise, I output the minimum cost.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping travel vouchers `i` and `j` such that the sum of their durations `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1)` equals a given value `x`, and their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote the duration of a voucher `k` as `Dk = rk - lk + 1`. We need to find vouchers `i` and `j` such that `Di + Dj = x`. The non-overlapping condition means either `ri < lj` or `rj < li`. Without loss of generality, let's assume `ri < lj`.\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all pairs of vouchers would be `O(N^2)`, which is too slow for `N = 2 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach, likely `O(N log N)` or `O(N + MAX_COORD)` where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible day value (`2 * 10^5`).\n\nThe key idea is to iterate through time (days) and maintain information about vouchers that have already ended.\n\nWe can use a sweep-line algorithm or a similar day-by-day processing approach:\n1.  **Data Structures**:\n    *   `min_cost_for_len[duration]`: An array that stores the minimum cost of a voucher with a specific `duration` that has *already ended* by the current day `d-1`. Initialize all entries to `float('inf')`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_start[day]`: A list of vouchers that start on `day`. Each entry will be `(r, cost, duration)`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_end[day]`: A list of vouchers that end on `day`. Each entry will be `(l, cost, duration)`.\n    `MAX_COORD` will be `2 * 10^5` (the maximum possible `li` or `ri` value).\n    `MAX_DURATION` will also be `2 * 10^5` (the maximum possible `ri - li + 1`).\n\n2.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Read `n` and `x`.\n    *   Populate `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end` by iterating through the `n` input vouchers. For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`, calculate its `duration = r - l + 1`. Add `(r, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_start[l]` and `(l, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_end[r]`.\n\n3.  **Iterate through days**: Loop `d` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`. In each iteration `d`:\n    *   **Phase 1: Process vouchers starting on day `d`**: For each voucher `(r_curr, cost_curr, duration_curr)` in `vouchers_by_start[d]`:\n        *   Calculate the `duration_needed = x - duration_curr`.\n        *   If `1 <= duration_needed <= MAX_DURATION`, it means we need a valid duration for the second voucher.\n        *   Check `min_cost_for_len[duration_needed]`. If it's not `float('inf')`, it means there's at least one voucher with `duration_needed` that ended on or before day `d-1`. This voucher satisfies the non-overlapping condition (`r_prev < d = l_curr`).\n        *   Update the `overall_min_cost = min(overall_min_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_len[duration_needed])`.\n    *   **Phase 2: Update `min_cost_for_len` with vouchers ending on day `d`**: For each voucher `(l_curr, cost_curr, duration_curr)` in `vouchers_by_end[d]`:\n        *   This voucher has just ended on day `d`. It can now be considered as a \"previous\" voucher for any future voucher starting on `d+1` or later.\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_len[duration_curr] = min(min_cost_for_len[duration_curr], cost_curr)`.\n\n4.  **Result**: After iterating through all days, if `overall_min_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair was found, so print -1. Otherwise, print `overall_min_cost`.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n*   Initializing lists: `O(MAX_COORD + MAX_DURATION)`.\n*   Reading input and populating `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end`: `O(N)`. Each voucher is added to two lists.\n*   Main loop: `MAX_COORD` iterations.\n    *   Inside the loop, iterating through `vouchers_by_start[d]` and `vouchers_by_end[d]`: The total number of voucher entries across all `d` for both lists is `N`. So, these operations sum up to `O(N)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD + MAX_DURATION)`. Given `N, x, li, ri <= 2 * 10^5`, this is `O(2 * 10^5)`, which is efficient.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n*   `min_cost_for_len`: `O(MAX_DURATION)`.\n*   `vouchers_by_start` and `vouchers_by_end`: `O(N + MAX_COORD)` to store the lists and their contents.\nTotal space complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD + MAX_DURATION)`. This is also efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_COORD = 2 * 10**5 # Maximum possible value for l_i or r_i\n    MAX_DURATION = MAX_COORD # Maximum possible duration (2*10^5 - 1 + 1)\n\n    # min_cost_for_len[duration] stores the minimum cost of a voucher with that duration\n    # that has ended by the current day (d-1).\n    # Initialized with infinity to represent no such voucher found yet.\n    min_cost_for_len = [float('inf')] * (MAX_DURATION + 1)\n    \n    overall_min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Group vouchers by their start day and end day for efficient processing.\n    # vouchers_by_start[d] will contain a list of (r, cost, duration) for vouchers starting on day d.\n    # vouchers_by_end[d] will contain a list of (l, cost, duration) for vouchers ending on day d.\n    vouchers_by_start = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n    vouchers_by_end = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        \n        # Add voucher details to the respective lists\n        vouchers_by_start[l].append((r, cost, duration))\n        vouchers_by_end[r].append((l, cost, duration))\n\n    # Iterate through each day from 1 up to MAX_COORD\n    for d in range(1, MAX_COORD + 1):\n        # Phase 1: For all vouchers that *start* on the current day 'd',\n        # try to find a suitable *preceding* voucher that ended before 'd'.\n        for r_curr, cost_curr, duration_curr in vouchers_by_start[d]:\n            duration_needed = x - duration_curr\n            \n            # Check if the required duration for the second voucher is valid (positive and within bounds)\n            if 1 <= duration_needed <= MAX_DURATION:\n                # min_cost_for_len[duration_needed] holds the minimum cost of a voucher\n                # with 'duration_needed' that ended on or before day 'd-1'.\n                # This inherently satisfies the non-overlapping condition (r_prev < l_curr, where l_curr is d).\n                if min_cost_for_len[duration_needed] != float('inf'):\n                    # If a suitable preceding voucher is found, update the overall minimum cost.\n                    overall_min_cost = min(overall_min_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_len[duration_needed])\n\n        # Phase 2: For all vouchers that *end* on the current day 'd',\n        # update min_cost_for_len.
