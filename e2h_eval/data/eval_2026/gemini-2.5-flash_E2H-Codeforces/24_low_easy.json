She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach to Tab Closing**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the least amount of time to get only the tabs within a specified range `[l, r]` open. I'm given the total number of tabs `n`, my current cursor position `pos`, and the range `[l, r]`.\n\nI'm thinking about the possible operations: moving the cursor left or right (both take 1 second), and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also 1 second). Initially, the minimum and maximum indices of *unclosed* tabs, which I'll call `a` and `b`, are `1` and `n`, respectively. The critical thing here is that `a` and `b` always refer to the boundaries of *active* tabs after we perform a closing operation.\n\nBasically, I need to close everything outside `[l, r]`. This means closing `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). It seems like there are several cases to consider.\n\nFirst, the trivial case: if the desired range *is* the entire range, nothing to close. Time taken is 0. Easy.\n\nNext, I'm focusing on the scenario where I need to close only tabs to the left of `l`, which means `l > 1` and `r = n`. I need to get the cursor to either `l` or any tab to its right and then close everything to its left. My instinct tells me that the quickest way to close `[1, l-1]` is getting the cursor directly to `l` and then using the \"close left\" operation. I should probably handle two sub-cases here, based on where the cursor *currently* is. If the cursor is already at or to the right of `l`, I just need to move there. The time is the absolute difference between the positions plus one to close. If it's to the left of `l`, I need to move from the current position to `l`, plus one to close. Seems pretty simple so far.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the target segment `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n1.  **Move cursor:** Moving one step left or right takes 1 second.\n2.  **Close tabs:** Closing all tabs to the left of the cursor, or all tabs to the right of the cursor, each takes 1 second.\n\nThe goal is to remove tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nWe can categorize the scenarios:\n\n**1. No tabs need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r = n`)**\n   If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means all tabs are already within the desired range. No operations are needed.\n   Time = 0.\n\n**2. Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r = n`)**\n   We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab `i >= l`) and then perform the \"close left\" operation.\n   The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close.\n   -   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n   -   Time to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (by being at `l` and closing left): 1 second.\n   Total time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**3. Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`)**\n   We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab `i <= r`) and then perform the \"close right\" operation.\n   The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then close.\n   -   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n   -   Time to close tabs `[r+1, n]` (by being at `r` and closing right): 1 second.\n   Total time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**4. Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`)**\n   We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND `[r+1, n]`. This requires two closing operations.\n   The cursor must visit `l` (or a tab to its right) to close the left side, and `r` (or a tab to its left) to close the right side.\n   Since `l` is always to the left of `r`, the cursor must effectively traverse the segment `[l, r]`.\n   There are two main strategies:\n   *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n       1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Time: `abs(pos - l)`.\n       2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Time: 1. (Cursor is now at `l`).\n       3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Time: `r - l`.\n       4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Time: 1. (Cursor is now at `r`).\n       Total time = `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n   *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n       1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Time: `abs(pos - r)`.\n       2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Time: 1. (Cursor is now at `r`).\n       3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Time: `r - l`.\n       4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Time: 1. (Cursor is now at `l`).\n       Total time = `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n   We choose the minimum of these two strategies:\n   `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations into a single logic:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ntime = 0\n\n# Case 1: No tabs to close\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    time = 0\n# Case 2: Only left side needs to be closed\nelif l == 1: # implies r < n because if r == n it's Case 1\n    # Move to r, then close right\n    time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n# Case 3: Only right side needs to be closed\nelif r == n: # implies l > 1 because if l == 1 it's Case 1\n    # Move to l, then close left\n    time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n# Case 4: Both sides need to be closed\nelse: # l > 1 and r < n\n    # Option 1: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right\n    cost1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    # Option 2: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left\n    cost2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    time = min(cost1, cost2)\n\nprint(time)\n```",
