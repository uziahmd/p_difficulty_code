There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Building Houses for Maximum Profit**\n\nMy goal is to solve a competitive programming problem that involves maximizing profit from building houses, subject to zoning restrictions. I've broken down the problem: I have `n` spots to build on, each house can have a height between `0` and `h`, and the profit from a house is the square of its height. Restrictions come in the form of ranges `[l_i, r_i]` where the tallest house within that range can't exceed `x_i`.\n\nMy strategy is to determine, for each spot, the *maximum* allowed height it can have.  Since profit increases with height, I want to choose the largest possible height for each house. A spot's height is limited by the global maximum `h`, and also by *all* restrictions that include that spot. If multiple restrictions apply to a single spot, its maximum height is the minimum of those restrictions' `x_i` values.\n\nTo do this, I'll use an array `max_allowed_height` of size `n`. Initially, every element will be set to `h`. Then, for each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, I'll update the `max_allowed_height` of all spots within the range `[l_i, r_i]` to be the minimum of their current value and `x_i`. This gives me the tightest upper bound for each spot's height.\n\nOnce I have `max_allowed_height`, the total profit is simply the sum of the squares of the heights in that array. I'm confident in this approach because the profit function is monotonically increasing (profit increases as height does), and the restrictions are *only* about the maximum height within a range. The decision for each house is independent *once* the height limit is determined.\n\nI've carefully considered the time complexity, which is O(m * n), which is efficient given the problem constraints, and checked some edge cases. Finally, I ensured the code is efficient, correct, and properly formatted, and have written this summary to document my reasoning. I'm ready to submit my solution!\n",
