    "thought": "**Here's the plan to tackle this programming challenge:**\n\nI need to find two crucial values: the minimum number of nodes (let's call it 'n') needed for a specific graph type, and the maximum number of special pairs (unidirectional pairs) within that graph.  This involves working with directed graphs that have a property called \"p-reachability.\"\n\nFirst, a quick recap of the definitions. A unidirectional pair means two nodes have a path between them in one direction only. A \"p-reachable\" graph has exactly 'p' pairs of nodes (where the first is smaller than the second) that can reach each other in both directions.  This \"bidirectional reachability\" is equivalent to being within the same strongly connected component (SCC) in the graph.  So, 'p' is really about counting the pairs of nodes within SCCs.\n\nIf an SCC has 'k' nodes, there are k*(k-1)/2 pairs in that SCC that are bidirectionally reachable. So the total 'p' of the graph is just the sum of these values over each SCC. To minimize 'n', the number of nodes, I need to make the SCCs as large as possible.  Since the function that calculates the number of bidirectional pairs within an SCC is convex, splitting a large SCC into smaller SCCs always increases 'n'.  This tells me a greedy approach is best: repeatedly choose the largest possible SCC, add it to my count, and adjust the total amount remaining.\n\nI need to calculate how many SCCs are necessary, and how large they can be. I know that the number of pairs k*(k-1)/2 in an SCC needs to be less than or equal to 'p'.  So, I can find the biggest possible 'k' for the first SCC by finding the solution for a quadratic equation. Let `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`. Then repeat this process with the remaining p, iteratively calculating `k_max` each time. So, the smallest 'n' (total node count) is just the sum of the sizes of these SCCs.\n\nNow, for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.  This number is maximized by building the graph so that paths only go in one direction between different SCCs.  To make this happen, I'll need to arrange the SCCs in a line, so each SCC has a directed path into the next. The number of unidirectional pairs is given by (N^2 - sum of the squares of the SCC sizes) / 2.\n\nIn the end, I'll implement these steps. First the greedy algorithm for finding the SCC sizes to minimize 'n'. Second, calculate 'n' as the sum of all the sizes of those SCCs. And, finally compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs based on the values from the first step.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable graphs with `N` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. This means `u` and `v` must be in the same strongly connected component (SCC). If an SCC has `k` nodes, it contributes `k * (k - 1) / 2` such pairs, as any two distinct nodes within an SCC are mutually reachable.\n- An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`. This implies that `u` and `v` must belong to different SCCs, say `S_u` and `S_v` respectively, and there must be a path from `S_u` to `S_v` in the condensation graph (graph of SCCs), but no path from `S_v` to `S_u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum Number of Nodes (N)**\n\nLet the graph have `N` nodes, partitioned into `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_m`.\nThe total number of nodes is `N = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i`.\nThe total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `\\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{k_i(k_i - 1)}{2}`. This sum must equal `p`.\n\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we want to use as few SCCs as possible, and each SCC should be as large as possible. The function `f(k) = k(k-1)/2` is convex and grows quadratically. This means that to achieve a certain `p` value, it's more efficient (in terms of nodes) to use larger `k_i` values. For example, `k=4` gives `p=6` with `N=4` nodes. Two SCCs of `k=2` give `p=1+1=2` with `N=2+2=4` nodes. One SCC of `k=3` and one of `k=2` give `p=3+1=4` with `N=3+2=5` nodes.\n\nThe optimal strategy to minimize `N` is a greedy approach:\n1. Start with `N = 0` and `p_{rem} = p`.\n2. While `p_{rem} > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 \\le p_{rem}`. This `k` represents the size of the next SCC we add.\n   b. Add `k` to `N`.\n   c. Subtract `k(k-1)/2` from `p_{rem}`.\nThis `k` can be found by solving `k^2 - k - 2p_{rem} \\le 0`, which gives `k \\le \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p_{rem}}}{2}`. So, `k = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p_{rem}}}{2} \\rfloor`.\n\nLet's trace this for `p=4`:\n- Initially, `N=0`, `p_{rem}=4`.\n- For `p_{rem}=4`: `k = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 4}}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + 5.74}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3.37 \\rfloor = 3`.\n  - `N = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n  - `p_{rem} = 4 - \\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n- For `p_{rem}=1`: `k = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\cdot 1}}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{9}}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1 + 3}{2} \\rfloor = 2`.\n  - `N = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n  - `p_{rem} = 1 - \\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n- `p_{rem}=0`, stop. The minimum number of nodes is `N=5`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs with the minimum `N` nodes (which means using the SCC sizes `k_1, \\dots, k_m` found in Part 1), we need to arrange these SCCs such that there are as many directed paths between distinct SCCs as possible, but no paths in the reverse direction.\nThis is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear chain in the condensation graph: `S_1 \\to S_2 \\to \\dots \\to S_m`. We can achieve this by adding a single edge from an arbitrary node in `S_i` to an arbitrary node in `S_{i+1}` for all `i=1, \\dots, m-1`.\nIn this configuration:\n- For any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` where `i < j`, there is a path `u \\to v`.\n- For any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` where `i > j`, there is no path `u \\to v`.\n- For any `u, v \\in S_i`, they are mutually reachable, so `(u,v)` is not unidirectional.\n\nTherefore, all pairs `(u, v)` where `u \\in S_i`, `v \\in S_j`, and `i < j` are unidirectional. The total number of such pairs is `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i k_j`.\nThis sum can be computed using the identity: `(\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i k_j`.\nSo, `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i k_j = \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2}{2}`.\nSince `N = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `\\frac{N^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2}{2}`.\n\nLet's trace this for `p=4`:\n- The SCC sizes found were `k_1=3, k_2=2`.\n- `N = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n- `\\sum k_i^2 = k_1^2 + k_2^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n- Maximum unidirectional pairs = `\\frac{5^2 - 13}{2} = \\frac{25 - 13}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6`.\n\n**Example cases:**\n- `p=3`:\n  - `N=3`. SCC sizes: `[3]`.\n  - Unidirectional pairs: `(3^2 - 3^2) / 2 = 0`.\n- `p=4`:\n  - `N=5`. SCC sizes: `[3, 2]`.\n  - Unidirectional pairs: `(5^2 - (3^2 + 2^2)) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 6`.\n- `p=0`:\n  - `N=0`. SCC sizes: `[]`.\n  - Unidirectional pairs: `(0^2 - 0) / 2 = 0`.\n\nThe logic holds for the examples.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n1. Initialize `min_nodes = 0`, `sum_k_squared = 0`, `current_p = p`.\n2. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Calculate `k = int((1 + (1 + 8 * current_p)**0.5) / 2)`. Use `math.isqrt` or `int(math.sqrt)` for efficiency and correctness with floating point.\n   b. Add `k` to `min_nodes`.\n   c. Add `k*k` to `sum_k_squared`.\n   d. Subtract `k*(k-1)//2` from `current_p`.\n3. The maximum unidirectional pairs is `(min_nodes * min_nodes - sum_k_squared) // 2`.\n4. Print `min_nodes` and the calculated maximum unidirectional pairs.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    min_nodes = 0\n    sum_k_squared = 0\n    \n    current_p = p\n\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k*(k-1)/2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n        # k approx (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        \n        # Using integer square root for precision\n        # For p = 0, k will be 0, so the loop won't run, min_nodes=0, sum_k_squared=0.\n        # This is correct.\n        \n        # Calculate discriminant: D = 1 + 8 * current_p\n        discriminant = 1 + 8 * current_p\n        \n        # Calculate integer square root of discriminant\n        sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n        \n        # k = floor((1 + sqrt_discriminant) / 2)\n        k = (1 + sqrt_discriminant) // 2\n        \n        # Edge case: if k*(k-1)/2 > current_p, k might be slightly too large due to floor/ceiling effects\n        # For example, if sqrt_discriminant is slightly less than an integer, (1+sqrt_discriminant)/2 might be X.5\n        # and floor gives X.
