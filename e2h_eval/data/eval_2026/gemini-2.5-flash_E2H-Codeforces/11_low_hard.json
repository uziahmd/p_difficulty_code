A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Resource Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and need a Python script to find the solution.  Let's see, the core of it is figuring out how many toasts each friend can make, given a shared pool of resources. I've got `n` friends, and various ingredients: drink (`k` bottles, `l` ml/bottle), limes (`c` limes, `d` slices/lime), and salt (`p` grams). Each friend needs a specific amount of each per toast (`nl` ml drink, 1 lime slice, `np` grams salt).  \n\nThe key is that all the friends need to be able to make the *same* number of toasts. So, I need to figure out the bottleneck - which ingredient is the limiting factor.\n\nFirst, the drink:  I have a total of `k * l` milliliters.  Since each friend needs `nl` ml per toast, if they were all using it individually, the most one person could make is `(k * l) // nl`. Now, to give them all an equal number of toasts, I need to divide that number by the number of friends.  So, the number of toasts I can derive from drink is `(k * l) // (nl * n)`.\n\nNext, the limes: I have `c * d` lime slices in total. Each friend needs one slice per toast. To make sure all friends are limited equally, the number of toasts is `(c * d) // n`\n\nI haven't gone through with the salt calculation yet, but the principal is the same: calculate the total amount of salt available and divide by the amount of salt needed per friend per toast.\n\nUltimately, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is the minimum value across all resources for the group. This minimum value will be my answer.\n",
