She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tab-Closing Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem to tackle. The core idea is to close all the tabs on my browser *except* those within a specific range, let's call it `[l, r]`. I start with `n` tabs and my cursor at position `pos`. The challenge is to find the minimum time to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the allowed moves. I can:\n\n1.  Move the cursor left, stopping at the leftmost open tab (`current_a`).\n2.  Move the cursor right, stopping at the rightmost open tab (`current_b`).\n3.  Close all tabs to the left of the cursor, updating `current_a` to the cursor's position.\n4.  Close all tabs to the right of the cursor, updating `current_b` to the cursor's position.\n\nCrucially, after reading the problem statement, and after reading the example to clarify that `a` and `b` represent the current effective range of tabs, I realize that `a` and `b` (the effective range) dynamically change as tabs are closed. For moving the cursor, however, the range is always `[1, n]`.\n\nMy goal is to close tabs outside the range `[l, r]`, meaning I need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. Let's break this down into cases:\n\n**Case 1: `l = 1` and `r = n`**\nThe range is already correct. No action is needed. Time is 0.\n\n**Case 2: `l = 1` but `r < n`**\nI need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.  Since `l = 1`, no work needs to be done on the left side. I'll need to:\n1.  Move the cursor from `pos` to `r` (using moves 1 and 2). This takes `|pos - r|` seconds.\n2.  Close tabs to the right of the cursor (using move 4). This takes 1 second.\nTotal time for this scenario: `|pos - r| + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: `l > 1` but `r = n`**\nI need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Since `r = n`, no work needs to be done on the right side. I'll need to:\n1.  Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (using moves 1 and 2). This takes `|pos - l|` seconds.\n2.  Close tabs to the left of the cursor (using move 3). This takes 1 second.\nTotal time for this scenario: `|pos - l| + 1`.\n\nNow that I've mapped out the cases and deduced the minimum time for each one, I'm ready to write some code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, cursor at `pos`.\n\nThere are four types of operations, each taking one second:\n1. Move cursor left: `pos -> pos - 1` (if `pos > current_min_tab_index`)\n2. Move cursor right: `pos -> pos + 1` (if `pos < current_max_tab_index`)\n3. Close tabs to the left of cursor: All tabs `[current_min_tab_index, pos - 1]` are closed. `current_min_tab_index` becomes `pos`.\n4. Close tabs to the right of cursor: All tabs `[pos + 1, current_max_tab_index]` are closed. `current_max_tab_index` becomes `pos`.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where `current_min_tab_index = l` and `current_max_tab_index = r`.\n\nLet's analyze the required actions:\n- If `l > 1`, we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. This requires moving the cursor to `l` and performing a \"close left\" operation.\n- If `r < n`, we need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. This requires moving the cursor to `r` and performing a \"close right\" operation.\n\nWe need to perform these operations in some order. The operations of closing tabs to the left and to the right are independent in the sense that closing one side doesn't prevent closing the other, but the cursor movement costs depend on the order.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**1. No tabs need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r = n`)**\nIf `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, all tabs are already within the desired range. No operations are needed.\nTime: `0` seconds.\n\n**2. Only tabs to the right need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`)**\nWe need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n- Move the cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- Close tabs to the right of `r`. This takes `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**3. Only tabs to the left need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r = n`)**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n- Move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- Close tabs to the left of `l`. This takes `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**4. Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`)**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This involves two \"close\" operations, each taking 1 second. The cursor must visit `l` (to close left) and `r` (to close right).\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Cursor is now at `l`)\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `abs(l - r)`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n    (Note: `abs(l - r)` is `r - l` since `l <= r`).\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Cursor is now at `r`)\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `abs(r - l)`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nWe choose the minimum of these two strategies:\n`min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these cases into a single logic:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    # Case 1: No tabs to close\n    print(0)\nelif l == 1:\n    # Case 2: Only close tabs to the right of r\n    # Move pos to r, then close right\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\nelif r == n:\n    # Case 3: Only close tabs to the left of l\n    # Move pos to l, then close left\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    # Case 4: Close tabs on both sides\n    # Option 1: Move pos to l, close left, then move to r, close right\n    cost1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    # Option 2: Move pos to r, close right, then move to l, close left\n    cost2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    print(min(cost1, cost2))\n\n```",
