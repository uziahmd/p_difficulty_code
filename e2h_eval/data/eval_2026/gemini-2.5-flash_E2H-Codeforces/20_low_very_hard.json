    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tricky Combinatorial Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's asking me to count the number of ways to assign integer values ($c_s$) to binary strings of lengths 1 to *n*, such that the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly *f*. The constraints are tight: *n* is at most 15, and *k* and *f* are at most 200,000.  We need the answer modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand this \"beautiful multiset\" thing.  It seems the core concept is how a string *s* relates to the strings in the multiset that have *s* as a prefix. The constraint is that the *number* of strings with *s* as a prefix must be less than or equal to $c_s$. I'm thinking, this definitely looks like it can be modeled with a trie (or a tree) structure.\n\nIf I consider a binary string *S* of length *n* in the multiset, it contributes 1 to the count for all its prefixes. We could represent the multiset by an $x_S$, indicating the number of times $S$ is in the multiset, where the total multiset size is just the sum of all $x_S$.\n\nNow, given an arbitrary string *s* with length between 1 and *n*, the number of strings in the multiset that have *s* as a prefix would be the sum of all $x_S$ where $S$ is a string of length $n$ with prefix *s*.  This sum has to be less than or equal to $c_s$.\n\nThis reminds me of flow networks or minimum cuts, but here the maximum size itself is variable.  The tree/trie structure seems important here. Binary strings of length 1 to *n* form a complete binary tree of depth *n*. Each node is a string *s*. If *s* is a prefix of *s'*, then *s* is an ancestor of *s'*. The constraint for *s* is that the sum of the $x_S$ values for all descendants of *s* (at depth *n*) must be no greater than $c_s$.\n\nI'm starting to think about defining $N(s)$ as the number of strings in the multiset with prefix *s*. Then, for strings of length less than *n*, $N(s)$ is the sum of $N(s0)$ and $N(s1)$. For strings of length *n*, $N(s) = x_s$.  The constraints are $N(s) \\le c_s$, for all strings *s* of length 1 to *n*.\n\nSo, we want to maximize the total multiset size. This is equivalent to maximizing the value of $N(\\epsilon)$ where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string, and it's basically the root of the trie.\n\nLet's see where this takes me.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. The values $c_s$ must be between $0$ and $k$. We need to output the answer modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined. Let $x_S$ be the number of times a binary string $S$ of length $n$ appears in the multiset. The total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{S \\text{ of length } n} x_S$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n]$, let $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix. The condition is $N(s) \\le c_s$.\nIf $s$ has length $n$, then $N(s) = x_s$.\nIf $s$ has length less than $n$, then $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$. This is because any string $S$ of length $n$ that has $s$ as a prefix must either have $s0$ as a prefix or $s1$ as a prefix.\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for given $c_s$ values is a standard minimum-cost maximum-flow or minimum-cut problem, or more simply, can be solved by a greedy approach on the trie structure.\nLet $M(s)$ be the maximum possible value of $N(s)$ given the constraints $c_{s'}$ for all $s'$ that are descendants of $s$ (including $s$ itself).\nFor a leaf node $s$ (a string of length $n$), $M(s) = c_s$.\nFor an internal node $s$ (a string of length $< n$), $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string (the root of the trie).\nThis is because we can always achieve $M(s0) + M(s1)$ if $M(s0)$ and $M(s1)$ are achievable, and then we are limited by $c_s$.\nThe total number of nodes in the trie (strings of length 1 to $n$) is $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2(2^n-1)$.\nFor $n=15$, this is $2(2^{15}-1) \\approx 65534$.\n\nLet's define $dp[d][v]$ as the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $d$ to $n$ such that $M(s)$ (for the specific string $s$ at depth $d$) is $v$.\nThis DP state is for a single node $s$ and its subtree. Since the trie is symmetric, all nodes at the same depth $d$ behave identically.\nThe base case is for depth $d=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. We are choosing $c_s \\in [0, k]$. So, for each $v \\in [0, k]$, there is 1 way to choose $c_s=v$.\n$dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\n\nFor $d < n$, to compute $dp[d][v]$ for a string $s$ of length $d$:\n$M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nWe need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nWe also need to choose $c_{s'}$ for descendants $s'$ of $s0$ and $s1$. The number of ways to do this such that $M(s0)=v_0$ is $dp[d+1][v_0]$ and $M(s1)=v_1$ is $dp[d+1][v_1]$.\nSo, for a fixed $c_s$, $v_0$, $v_1$:\nThe number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ in the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ is $dp[d+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[d+1][v_1]$.\nThe resulting $M(s)$ value will be $\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$.\nWe want to sum up $dp[d+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[d+1][v_1]$ for all $v_0, v_1$ such that $\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$ equals $v$.\nThis looks complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nLet $P_d(v)$ be the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for strings $s'$ in the subtree of a node at depth $d$ such that $M(s)$ (for this node $s$) is $v$. This is exactly our $dp[d][v]$.\nThe total number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings in the subtree of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $M(s0)=v_0$ and $M(s1)=v_1$ is $P_{d+1}(v_0) \\cdot P_{d+1}(v_1)$.\nLet $S_{d+1}(X) = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=X} P_{d+1}(v_0) \\cdot P_{d+1}(v_1)$. This is a convolution.\nLet $Q_{d+1}(X) = \\sum_{v_0+v_1 \\ge X} P_{d+1}(v_0) \\cdot P_{d+1}(v_1)$. This is a suffix sum of the convolution.\nThe maximum possible value for $v_0$ or $v_1$ is $k$. So $v_0+v_1$ can go up to $2k$.\nFor a node $s$ at depth $d$, we choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nThen $M(s) = \\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$.\nWe need to sum up $P_{d+1}(v_0) P_{d+1}(v_1)$ for $v_0, v_1$ such that $\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$ evaluates to $v$.\n\nLet's fix $v$. We want to find $P_d(v)$.\n$P_d(v) = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\left( \\sum_{v_0, v_1 \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)=v} P_{d+1}(v_0) P_{d+1}(v_1) \\right)$.\nThis sum can be split based on $c_s$:\n1. If $c_s < v$: Then $\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$ can never be $v$. So $c_s$ must be $\\ge v$.\n2. If $c_s = v$: Then $\\min(v, v_0+v_1)$ must be $v$. This means $v_0+v_1 \\ge v$. The contribution is $1 \\cdot \\sum_{v_0+v_1 \\ge v} P_{d+1}(v_0) P_{d+1}(v_1) = Q_{d+1}(v)$.\n3. If $c_s > v$: Then $\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1)$ must be $v$. This means $v_0+v_1 = v$. The contribution is $1 \\cdot \\sum_{v_0+v_1 = v} P_{d+1}(v_0) P_{d+1}(v_1) = S_{d+1}(v)$.\nSo, for $v \\in [0, k]$:\n$P_d(v) = Q_{d+1}(v) + \\sum_{c_s=v+1}^k S_{d+1}(v)$.\nThe sum term is $(k-(v+1)+1) \\cdot S_{d+1}(v) = (k-v) \\cdot S_{d+1}(v)$.\nThus, $P_d(v) = Q_{d+1}(v) + (k-v) \\cdot S_{d+1}(v)$.\nFor $v > k$, $P_d(v)$ could be non-zero if $v_0+v_1 > k$. However, $M(s)$ is always $\\le k$ if $c_s \\le k$.\nSo $P_d(v)$ is non-zero only for $v \\in [0, k]$.\nThe maximum possible sum $v_0+v_1$ is $2k$. So $S_{d+1}$ and $Q_{d+1}$ are defined up to $2k$.\n\nThe computation proceeds as follows:\nInitialize $P_n[v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$, and $P_n[v] = 0$ for $v > k$.\nIterate $d$ from $n-1$ down to $0$:\n  Compute $S_{d+1}[X]$ for $X \\in [0, 2k]$:\n    $S_{d+1}[X] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=X} P_{d+1}[v_0] \\cdot P_{d+1}[v_1]$. This is a convolution.\n    Can be done efficiently using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) or by direct computation.\n    Since $k$ can be $2 \\cdot 10^5$, direct computation takes $O(k^2)$ per depth, total $O(n k^2)$, which is too slow ($15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$).\n    NTT takes $O(k \\log k)$ per depth, total $O(n k \\log k)$. This is feasible ($15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$).\n  Compute $Q_{d+1}[X]$ for $X \\in [0, 2k]$:\n    $Q_{d+1}[X] = \\sum_{j=X}^{2k} S_{d+1}[j]$. This is a suffix sum.\n    $Q_{d+1}[2k] = S_{d+1}[2k]$\n    $Q_{d+1}[X] = Q_{d+1}[X+1] + S_{d+1}[X]$ for $X$ from $2k-1$ down to $0$.\n  Compute $P_d[v]$ for $v \\in [0, k]$:\n    $P_d[v] = (Q_{d+1}[v] + (k-v) \\cdot S_{d+1}[v]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    $P_d[v] = 0$ for $v > k$.\n\nThe final answer is $P_0[f]$. Note that the problem asks for $M(\\epsilon)$ to be $f$. $P_0[f]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for the root node, which is the empty string, such that $M(\\epsilon)=f$.\n\nLet's consider the maximum value for $k$. The maximum sum $v_0+v_1$ is $2k$. So the convolution result array needs to be of size $2k+1$. The NTT needs a size which is a power of 2, greater than $2k$.\n$k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, so $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. The smallest power of 2 greater than $4 \\cdot 10^5$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number and has $2^{23}$ as a factor of $MOD-1$, so it's suitable for NTT.\n\nNTT implementation details:\nWe need to implement NTT and inverse NTT.\nA polynomial $A(x) = \\sum a_i x^i$. The convolution $C(x) = A(x) \\cdot B(x)$ has coefficients $c_k = \\sum_{i+j=k} a_i b_j$.\nTo compute $S_{d+1}$:\nLet $A(x) = \\sum_{v_0=0}^k P_{d+1}[v_0] x^{v_0}$.\nThen $S_{d+1}[X]$ are the coefficients of $A(x)^2$.\nSo we compute $NTT(P_{d+1})$, square the coefficients point-wise, then compute $INVNTT$.\nThe maximum degree of $A(x)$ is $k$. So $A(x)^2$ has maximum degree $2k$.\nThe NTT size $N$ must be a power of 2, $N > 2k$.\n\nLet's trace for $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$P_1[v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le 42$, else $0$.\nWe need to compute $P_0[f]$.\n$d=0$. We need $S_1[X]$ and $Q_1[X]$.\n$A(x) = \\sum_{v_0=0}^{42} 1 \\cdot x^{v_0} = 1+x+\\dots+x^{42}$.\n$S_1[X]$ are coefficients of $A(x)^2$.\n$S_1[0]=1$\n$S_1[1]=2$\n...\n$S_1[42]=43$\n$S_1[43]=42$\n...\n$S_1[84]=1$\nAll other $S_1[X]=0$.\nMax $X$ is $2k = 84$.\n$Q_1[X]$:\n$Q_1[84] = S_1[84] = 1$\n$Q_1[83] = S_1[83] + Q_1[84] = 2+1 = 3$ (assuming $S_1[83]=2$)\n...\n$Q_1[42] = S_1[42] + \\dots + S_1[84] = 43 + 42 + \\dots + 1 = 43 \\cdot 44 / 2 = 946$.\n$Q_1[0] = \\sum_{X=0}^{84} S_1[X] = (43)^2 = 1849$.\n\nNow compute $P_0[v]$ for $v \\in [0, k=42]$:\n$P_0[v] = (Q_1[v] + (k-v) \\cdot S_1[v]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need $P_0[2]$.\n$P_0[2] = Q_1[2] + (42-2) \\cdot S_1[2] = Q_1[2] + 40 \\cdot S_1[2]$.\n$S_1[2]=3$.\n$Q_1[2] = \\sum_{X=2}^{84} S_1[X]$.\n$\\sum_{X=0}^{84} S_1[X] = (43)^2 = 1849$.\n$S_1[0]=1, S_1[1]=2$.\n$Q_1[2] = 1849 - S_1[0] - S_1[1] = 1849 - 1 - 2 = 1846$.\n$P_0[2] = 1846 + 40 \\cdot 3 = 1846 + 120 = 1966$.\n\nWait, the example output for $n=1, k=42, f=2$ is $3$. My calculation gives $1966$. What went wrong?\nThe problem statement: \"The number of strings in the multiset such that $s$ is their prefix is not exceeding $c_s$.\"\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$.\nFor $n=1$, strings are '0' and '1'.\n$M(\\epsilon) = \\min(c_\\epsilon, M(0)+M(1))$.\nNo, $M(\\epsilon)$ is not defined in the problem. The constraints are for strings of length $1$ to $n$.\nThe total size of the multiset is $\\sum x_S$ for $S$ of length $n$.\nThis is $N(\\epsilon)$ if we define $N(\\epsilon) = N(0) + N(1)$.\nIf we define $M(\\epsilon)$ as the value we want to maximize, then $M(\\epsilon) = M(0)+M(1)$.\nAnd $M(0) = c_0$, $M(1) = c_1$.\nSo the maximum size of the multiset is $c_0+c_1$.\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose $c_0, c_1 \\in [0, k]$ such that $c_0+c_1 = f$.\nThis is a stars and bars problem. For $c_0+c_1=f$ with $0 \\le c_0, c_1 \\le k$:\nThe number of solutions is $f+1$ if $f \\le k$.\nIf $f > k$, then $c_0$ can range from $f-k$ to $k$. Number of solutions is $k-(f-k)+1 = 2k-f+1$.\nFor $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$c_0+c_1=2$.\nPossible $(c_0, c_1)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$. All $c_i \\le 42$.\nThis gives $3$ ways. This matches the example!\n\nMy definition of $M(s)$ was: $M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0)+M(s1))$. This is correct for $s$ of length $<n$.\nFor $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$.\nThe maximum size of the multiset is $M(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string.\nThe $c_\\epsilon$ constraint is not given.\nSo $M(\\epsilon) = M(0)+M(1)$.\nThis means my DP formulation for $d=0$ is wrong.\nFor $d=0$: $P_0[v]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ in the entire trie such that $M(0)+M(1)=v$.\n$P_0[v] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=v} P_1[v_0] \\cdot P_1[v_1] = S_1[v]$.\nSo the final answer is $S_1[f]$.\n\nLet's re-calculate for $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$P_1[v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le 42$, else $0$.\nThe answer is $S_1[f] = S_1[2]$.\n$S_1[2]$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(1+x+\\dots+x^{42})^2$.\n$(1+x+\\dots+x^{42})^2 = (\\frac{1-x^{43}}{1-x})^2$.\nThe coefficient of $x^j$ in $(1-x)^{-2}$ is $\\binom{j+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{j+1}{1} = j+1$.\nSo $S_1[j] = j+1$ for $j \\le 42$.\n$S_1[2] = 2+1 = 3$. This matches the example!\n\nSo the corrected DP is:\nInitialize $P_n[v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$, and $P_n[v] = 0$ for $v > k$.\nFor $d$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n  Compute $S_{d+1}[X]$ for $X \\in [0, 2k]$ by NTT from $P_{d+1}[v]^2$.\n  Compute $Q_{d+1}[X]$ as suffix sums of $S_{d+1}[X]$.\n  Compute $P_d[v]$ for $v \\in [0, k]$:\n    $P_d[v] = (Q_{d+1}[v] + (k-v) \\cdot S_{d+1}[v]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    $P_d[v] = 0$ for $v > k$.\nFinally, for $d=0$:\nThe answer is $S_1[f]$. This is computed by NTT from $P_1[v]^2$.\n\nThis seems correct.\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$S_1[f]$ means we need to compute $S_1$ up to $f$. The convolution result needs to be computed up to $2k$. So $f$ can be up to $2k$.\nThe $P_d$ arrays are of size $k+1$. The $S_{d+1}$ and $Q_{d+1}$ arrays are of size $2k+1$.\nThe NTT size $N$ must be a power of 2, $N > 2k$.\n\nComplexity check:\nNumber of depths $n$.\nEach depth:\n  NTT: $O(N \\log N)$ where $N$ is smallest power of $2 > 2k$.\n  Suffix sums: $O(2k)$.\n  $P_d$ computation: $O(k)$.\nTotal complexity: $O(n \\cdot N \\log N)$.\nWith $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $N=524288$.\n$15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot \\log_2(524288) = 15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$. This is acceptable.\n\nLet's double check the constraints.\n$1 \\le n \\le 15$.\n$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$f$ can be larger than $k$. For example, if $n=1$, $f=2k$.\nThe example $n=1, k=42, f=2$. $f \\le k$.\nThe example $n=2, k=37, f=13$. $f \\le k$.\nThe example $n=4, k=1252, f=325$. $f \\le k$.\nThe example $n=6, k=153, f=23699$. Here $f > k$.\nFor $n=6, k=153$, max possible $f$ is $2^n k = 64 \\cdot 153 = 9792$.\n$f=23699$ is impossible. So the answer is 0. My formula $S_1[f]$ should give 0 if $f > 2k$.\n$S_1[f]$ is a coefficient of $A(x)^2$. The maximum degree of $A(x)^2$ is $2k$. If $f > 2k$, then $S_1[f]=0$. This is correct.\nFor $n=15, k=200000, f=198756$. $f \\le k$.\n\nThe maximum possible value of $M(s)$ for any $s$ is $k$.\nThe values $v_0, v_1$ for $P_{d+1}[v_0]$ and $P_{d+1}[v_1]$ are also $\\le k$.\nSo $v_0+v_1$ can be up to $2k$.\nThe $S_{d+1}[X]$ array should be of size $2k+1$.\nThe $P_d[v]$ array should be of size $k+1$.\nThe NTT needs to handle coefficients up to $2k$.\nThe root of unity $g$ should be a primitive $N$-th root of unity modulo $MOD$. $g=3$ for $MOD=998244353$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# NTT implementation\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, length): # length = 2, 4, 8, ..., n\n        half_length = length // 2\n        root = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length, MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            root = pow(root, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(half_length):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + k + half_length] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k + half_length] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * root) % MOD\n    \n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Determine NTT size\n    size = 1\n    while size < len_a + len_b - 1:\n        size <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials to NTT size\n    fa = list(a) + [0] * (size - len_a)\n    fb = list(b) + [0] * (size - len_b)\n    \n    # Perform NTT\n    ntt(fa, False)\n    ntt(fb, False)\n    \n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    for i in range(size):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n        \n    # Inverse NTT\n    ntt(fa, True)\n    \n    # Result has degree len_a + len_b - 2\n    return fa[:len_a + len_b - 1]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # P_d[v] is the number of ways to choose c_s for subtree starting at depth d\n    # such that M(s) (for that node s) is v.\n    # P_d will store coefficients for polynomial (up to degree k)\n    \n    # Base case: d = n\n    # For a string s of length n, M(s) = c_s.\n    # c_s can be any value from 0 to k.\n    # So P_n[v] = 1 for 0 <= v <= k.\n    \n    P_current = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for v in range(k + 1):\n        P_current[v] = 1\n    \n    # Iterate d from n-1 down to 1\n    for d in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Calculate S_{d+1}[X] = sum_{v0+v1=X} P_{d+1}[v0] * P_{d+1}[v1]\n        # This is the convolution of P_current with itself.\n        # Max degree of P_current is k.
