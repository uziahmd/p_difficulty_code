    "thought": "**My Approach to the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle this \"Frog Jumping\" problem, which sounds interesting. The core of it seems to be figuring out `f(x)`, which represents the number of distinct positions a frog can reach within the range `[0, x]`, given jumps of `+a` and `-b`. I need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze how the frog actually moves.  If it's at position `k`, it can either jump to `k + a` or `k - b`, but critically, *all* intermediate positions have to remain within `[0, x]`. This is the crucial constraint.\n\nI'm thinking, let's call the set of reachable positions `S_x`. The size of this set, `|S_x|`, is exactly `f(x)`. Now, without the upper bound `x`, the reachable positions would be all multiples of `gcd(a, b)`, right? Using Bezout's identity, I could express any multiple as `k*a - l*b`. But that's not quite right because the problem requires the frog to stay within the range. The Frobenius coin problem comes to mind, but that has a similar issue, in that it relaxes the constraints.\n\nGiven this, I think a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or a Dijkstra-like approach is the most suitable strategy. I can represent the reachable positions with a boolean array, say `reachable[k]`, or I can use a `deque` for BFS. The algorithm would start at `0`, and then explore possible jumps `k + a` and `k - b`, ensuring the bounds `0 <= next_pos <= x` are met.  I'd use a `deque` to optimize the search process.\n\nEssentially, I'll be growing `S_x` from `0` step by step. I'd initialize a queue with `0` and a set, `reachable = {0}`, and then iteratively explore the neighbors of each reachable position. I will stop when the queue is empty. At the end, I can just return the number of elements in the `reachable` set, which will be the value of `f(x)`. To get the final answer, I will iterate through all the values of x to find the sum of all values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0`, without ever jumping outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `S_x` be the set of reachable positions for a given `x`. `f(x) = |S_x|`.\nThe condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" means that any intermediate position `k` must be in `[0, x]`. If the frog jumps from `k` to `k+a`, then `k+a` must be `<= x`. If it jumps from `k` to `k-b`, then `k-b` must be `>= 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the reachable positions. All reachable positions must be non-negative.\nThe frog starts at `0`.\nFrom `k`, it can jump to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) or `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\n\nWe can model this as finding all reachable nodes in a graph. The nodes are integers `0, 1, ..., x`. From `k`, there are edges to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nSince `f(x)` is non-decreasing with `x` (i.e., `S_x` is a subset of `S_{x+1}`), we can compute `f(x)` iteratively.\n\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum `x` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\nThis is equivalent to saying `dist[k]` is the minimum upper bound `X` such that `k` can be reached from `0` by a sequence of jumps `p_0=0, p_1, ..., p_s=k` where `0 <= p_j <= X` for all `j`.\nThe value `dist[k]` can be found using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[j] = infinity` for `j > 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq` storing `(current_max_val, position)`. Initially, `pq` contains `(0, 0)`.\nWhen extracting `(d, u)` from `pq`:\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue (already found a better path).\n  For `v = u + a`:\n    If `v` is within bounds (e.g., `v <= m` for practical purposes, as we only care up to `m`):\n      `new_d = max(d, v)` (the maximum value encountered on this path to `v` is `max(d, v)`)\n      If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n        `dist[v] = new_d`\n        `pq.push((new_d, v))`\n  For `v = u - b`:\n    If `v >= 0`:\n      `new_d = d` (jumping to `u-b` doesn't introduce a new maximum, since `u-b < u` and `d` is already `max(..., u)`).\n      If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n        `dist[v] = new_d`\n        `pq.push((new_d, v))`\n\nThe maximum possible value for `k` is `m`, and `dist[k]` can be up to `m`.\nThe number of states `k` is `m+1`. If `m` is large (up to `10^9`), this approach is too slow.\nHowever, `a` and `b` are small (up to `10^5`). This suggests that the structure of reachable points might be periodic or stabilize.\n\nThe states `k` that are relevant are `k % gcd(a,b)`. Since we start at `0`, all reachable points `k` must be multiples of `g = gcd(a,b)`. We can divide `a, b, m` by `g` and solve for `a/g, b/g, m/g`. This effectively sets `g=1`, so `a` and `b` are coprime.\nIn this case, `dist[k]` will be computed for `k` up to `m`.\nThe maximum value `k` can reach is `m`. The number of distinct positions `k` could be `m+1`.\nThe maximum value for `dist[k]` is `k` itself.\nThe positions `k` that are interesting are those for which `dist[k]` is small.\nThe `dist` values will be `0, a, 2a, ...` initially, then `a-b, 2a-b, ...`.\n\nLet's refine the Dijkstra. `dist[k]` is the minimum `max_val` such that `k` is reachable and all intermediate positions are `in [0, max_val]`.\nThe graph has nodes `0, 1, ..., max_val_for_k`. The edges are `k -> k+a` and `k -> k-b`.\n`dist[k]` represents the smallest `X` such that `k` is in `S_X`.\nThe maximum `X` we need to consider is `m`.\n\nThe number of distinct values `k` for which `dist[k]` is finite is bounded.\nSince `a, b <= 10^5`, `a+b <= 2 * 10^5`.\nThe values `k` that can be reached without exceeding `a+b` as the maximum intermediate value are `0, a, 2a, ..., ka` and `a-b, 2a-b, ...`.\nThe values `dist[k]` are always non-decreasing as `k` increases (if `k` is reached by `k+a` jumps) or potentially decreases (if `k` is reached by `k-b` jumps).\nSpecifically, if `k` is reached by a path whose maximum is `X`, then `k+a` can be reached with maximum `max(X, k+a)`. And `k-b` can be reached with maximum `X`.\n\nThe key observation is that `dist[k]` values are only interesting for `k` up to `a+b` (or `2a` or `2b` or something similar).\nConsider `k >= a`. If `k` is reachable with `max_val = X`, then `k-a` is reachable with `max_val = X`.\nIf `k` is reachable with `max_val = X`, then `k+b` is reachable with `max_val = max(X, k+b)`.\nThis is a standard shortest path problem on a graph where edge weights are `0` for `k -> k-b` and `a` for `k -> k+a` (if we define `dist[k]` as the smallest `k'` such that `k'` is the maximum on a path to `k`). No, this is not quite right.\nThe `dist[k]` values are the maximum value on any path from `0` to `k`.\nThe graph nodes are `0` to `m`. Edges are `(k, k+a)` with weight `k+a` and `(k, k-b)` with weight `0`. We want to find the minimum path maximum.\n\nThis is a 0-1 BFS problem if we consider `k-b` edges as weight 0 and `k+a` edges as weight `a`.\nThe states are `0, ..., a+b`.\nLet's analyze the `dist[k]` values.\n`dist[0] = 0`.\n`dist[a] = a`.\n`dist[2a] = 2a`.\n...\n`dist[ka] = ka`.\nFrom `ka`, we can go to `ka-b`. The `max_val` for `ka-b` would be `ka`.\nFrom `ka-b`, we can go to `ka-b-b`. The `max_val` would be `ka`.\n...\nFrom `ka-jb`, the `max_val` is `ka`.\n\nThe values `dist[k]` are computed for `k` from `0` to `m`.\nThe `dist` array will store `dist[k]` for `k` from `0` to `max(m, a+b)`.\nThe number of distinct values of `k` that can be reached is finite.\nThe number of states in our Dijkstra-like approach is `a+b+1` (or `max(a,b)+1`).\nWhy? Suppose we have computed `dist[k]` for all `k` in `[0, L]`.\nWhen we compute `dist[k+a]`, if `k+a > L`, we add it to the priority queue.\nWhen we compute `dist[k-b]`, if `k-b < 0`, we ignore it.\nThe maximum value `k` can take in the priority queue is bounded.\nIf `k > a+b`, then `k-b > a`.\nIf `k-b` is reachable, then `k` is reachable (by `(k-b)+b`).\nThe values `dist[k]` for `k > a+b` can be related to `dist[k-(a+b)]`.\n\nThe states `k` for which `dist[k]` is computed are `0, 1, ..., m`.\nThe maximum value of `k` in the priority queue can be `m`.\nThe number of states for Dijkstra is `m+1`. This is too large.\nThe number of states for Dijkstra is `A+B+1` where `A = max(a,b)`.\nThe actual number of states for Dijkstra can be `a+b` because positions `k` are congruent `mod gcd(a,b)`.\nIf `a,b` are coprime, we are interested in `k mod a`.\n`dist[k]` is the minimum `max_val` to reach `k`.\nWe can use Dijkstra on `k mod a`. The states are `0, 1, ..., a-1`.\n`dist[rem]` = minimum `max_val` for any position `k` such that `k % a == rem`.\nFrom `k`, we can go to `k+a`. This means `(k+a)%a == k%a`. The `max_val` becomes `max(current_max_val, k+a)`.\nFrom `k`, we can go to `k-b`. This means `(k-b)%a`. The `max_val` remains `current_max_val`.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum `k` such that `k % a == r` and `k` is reachable, *and* all intermediate positions are `in [0, k]`. This is not `dist[k]` from before.\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum `max_val` for any `k` such that `k % a = r`.\n`dist[0] = 0` (for `k=0`). All other `dist[r] = infinity`.\nUse a min-priority queue storing `(max_val, remainder)`.\nInitially `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhen extracting `(d, r)` from `pq`:\n  If `d > dist[r]`, continue.\n  1. Jump `+a`: `r` remains `r`. The new position is `k+a`. The new `max_val` is `max(d, k+a)`.\n     This step is tricky. `d` is `max_val` for *some* `k` with `k%a=r`. We don't know `k`.\n     We need to know the actual `k` to compute `k+a`.\n     So `dist[r]` should store the actual `k` (the smallest `k` for that `max_val`).\n     Let `dist[r]` be the minimum `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` with `max_val` being `k`.\n     This means `dist[r]` stores the smallest `k` such that `k` is reachable and `k` is the maximum value on its path.\n\nLet `max_reach[k]` be the minimum `X` such that `k` is reachable with all intermediate points in `[0, X]`.\nWe compute `max_reach[k]` for `k = 0, ..., max_val_to_consider`.\nThe maximum value `k` can take is `m`.\nHowever, `max_reach[k]` can be `k` itself.\nThe interesting range for `k` is `0` to `a+b`.\nFor `k > a+b`, `max_reach[k]` might become periodic.\nIf `max_reach[k]` is known for `k` in `[0, a+b]`.\nFor `k > a+b`, `k` can be reached from `k-a` (if `k-a` is reachable) or `k+b` (if `k+b` is reachable).\nThe `k` values which are relevant for calculating `max_reach[k]` are `0` to `a+b`.\nThe states for Dijkstra are `0, ..., a+b`.\nThe number of states is `a+b+1`.\n`dist[k]` is the minimum `max_val` to reach `k`.\nInitialize `dist = array of size (a+b+1)` to infinity, `dist[0] = 0`.\nUse a deque for 0-1 BFS (since `max_val` only increases for `+a` jumps, not for `-b` jumps).\n`q = deque([(0, 0)])` (max_val, position)\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `d, u = q.popleft()`\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n  1. Jump `+a`: `v = u + a`.\n     If `v <= a+b`:\n       `new_d = max(d, v)`\n       If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n         `dist[v] = new_d`\n         `q.append((new_d, v))`\n  2. Jump `-b`: `v = u - b`.\n     If `v >= 0`:\n       `new_d = d`\n       If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n         `dist[v] = new_d`\n         `q.appendleft((new_d, v))` (appendleft because `new_d` is not larger)\n\nAfter running this Dijkstra, we have `dist[k]` for `k` from `0` to `a+b`.\nFor `k > a+b`, `dist[k]` might not be accurate.\nThe maximum value `k` can take in the Dijkstra is `m`.\nThe problem is that the state space is `m`.\nThe `dist` values are `max_reach[k]`.\n`f(x)` is the count of `k` such that `max_reach[k] <= x`.\nWe need to calculate `sum(f(i) for i=0 to m)`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum(1 for k=0 to m for i=max_reach[k] to m)`.\nOr `sum(m - max_reach[k] + 1 for k=0 to m if max_reach[k] <= m)`.\n\nLet `MAX_K = a+b`. We compute `dist[k]` for `k` from `0` to `MAX_K`.\nThe `dist` array is `max_reach_val[k]`.\n`max_reach_val[k]` will be `infinity` if `k` is not reachable within `[0, MAX_K]`.\nThe values `a, b` are up to `10^5`. So `MAX_K` is `2 * 10^5`.\nDijkstra on `2*10^5` states is feasible.\nLet `N = a+b`.\n`dist = [infinity] * (N + 1)`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`pq = [(0, 0)]` (max_val, position)\nWhile `pq` is not empty:\n  `d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n  # Jump +a\n  `v_plus = u + a`\n  If `v_plus <= N`:\n    `new_d_plus = max(d, v_plus)`\n    If `new_d_plus < dist[v_plus]`:\n      `dist[v_plus] = new_d_plus`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_plus, v_plus))`\n  # Jump -b\n  `v_minus = u - b`\n  If `v_minus >= 0`:\n    `new_d_minus = d`\n    If `new_d_minus < dist[v_minus]`:\n      `dist[v_minus] = new_d_minus`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_minus, v_minus))`\n\nAfter this Dijkstra, `dist[k]` contains `max_reach_val[k]` for `k` in `[0, N]`.\nWhat about `k > N`?\nIf `k > N`, `k` can be written as `N + delta`.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k = x*a - y*b` for some `x, y >= 0`.\nAll reachable points are `0 mod g` where `g=gcd(a,b)`.\nLet's assume `g=1` for now.\nIf `k` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k] = X`, then `k+a` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k+a] = max(X, k+a)`.\nIf `k` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k] = X`, then `k-b` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k-b] = X`.\n\nThe Frobenius Coin Problem states that for coprime `a, b`, the largest number not expressible as `xa+yb` for non-negative integers `x,y` is `ab-a-b`. All numbers greater than `ab-a-b` are expressible.\nHere, we have `xa-yb`.\nThe \"Coin Problem\" for `xa-yb` is more complex.\nHowever, we are interested in `max_reach_val[k]`.\nFor `k > a*b`, `k` is generally reachable.\nThe range `[0, N]` where `N=a+b` is small enough.\n\nThe problem states \"an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0\". This means we just need to find the set of reachable points.\nThe \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" is the crucial part.\n`max_reach_val[k]` is the *minimum* `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\n\nLet `max_reach_val[k]` be computed for `k` from `0` to `N = a+b`.\nFor `k > N`, `k` can be written as `N + d` where `d > 0`.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k-a` is reachable, `k-2a` is reachable, etc.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k-b` is reachable, `k-2b` is reachable, etc.\nThe maximum value `k` can take is `m`.\n\nConsider `k > N`. If `k` is reachable, then `k-a` is reachable.\n`max_reach_val[k] = max(max_reach_val[k-a], k)` (if `k-a` is reachable).\nThis is not necessarily correct, because `k` could be reached by `(k+b)-b`.\nThe `dist` values for `k` up to `N` are computed by Dijkstra.\nFor `k > N`, if `k` is reachable, what is `max_reach_val[k]`?\n`max_reach_val[k]` must be at least `k`.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k` can be reached from `k-a` or `k+b`.\nIf `k` is reached from `k-a`, then `max_reach_val[k] = max(max_reach_val[k-a], k)`.\nIf `k` is reached from `k+b`, then `max_reach_val[k] = max_reach_val[k+b]`. (This is only if `k+b` is reachable and `k+b` is not the maximum value on path to `k+b`).\n\nThe key insight is that for `k > N = a+b`, if `k` is reachable, then `max_reach_val[k]` is simply `k`.\nWhy? If `k` is reachable, it must be reached by a sequence of jumps.\nSuppose `k` is reached. The path is `0 = p_0, p_1, ..., p_s = k`.\n`max_reach_val[k] = max(p_0, ..., p_s)`.\nIf `k > N = a+b`.\nConsider the last step to `k`.\n1. `p_{s-1} + a = k`. Then `p_{s-1} = k-a`. `max_reach_val[k] = max(max_reach_val[k-a], k)`.\n2. `p_{s-1} - b = k`. Then `p_{s-1} = k+b`. `max_reach_val[k] = max(max_reach_val[k+b], k+b)`. No, this should be `max_reach_val[k] = max(max_reach_val[k+b], k+b)` if we are using the `max_val` as the upper bound.\nIf `max_reach_val[k+b]` is the minimum `X` for `k+b`, then `k` is reachable with `X`. So `max_reach_val[k] = min(max_reach_val[k], X)`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points `k` must be multiples of `g`.\nWe can divide `m, a, b` by `g`. Let `m' = m/g, a' = a/g, b' = b/g`.\nThen `f(i)` for `(m,a,b)` is equal to `f(i/g)` for `(m',a',b')` if `i` is a multiple of `g`, otherwise `f(i)=f(i-1)`.\nNo, this is not true. `f(i)` is the count of reachable points *within* `[0, i]`.\nIf we divide by `g`, the reachable points become `0, g, 2g, ...` instead of `0, 1, 2, ...`.\nThe count `f(i)` will be the same as `f_prime(floor(i/g))` where `f_prime` is for `(m', a', b')`.\nSo we can compute `dist'[k']` for `k'` up to `m'` using `a', b'`.\nThen `f(i) = count(k' | dist'[k'] <= floor(i/g) )`.\nThis transformation is correct. So we can assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\n\nNow, if `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\nThe maximum value `k` for which `dist[k]` is not simply `k` is `a*b - a - b`.\nFor `k > a*b - a - b`, `k` is reachable.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k` can be reached from `k-b` by `+b` jump. This means `max_reach_val[k]` is `max(max_reach_val[k-b], k)`.\nIf `k` is reached from `k-a` by `+a` jump. This means `max_reach_val[k]` is `max(max_reach_val[k-a], k)`.\n\nLet `N = a+b`.\nWe run Dijkstra on states `0, ..., N`. `dist[k]` is `max_reach_val[k]`.\n`dist = [infinity] * (N + 1)`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\nWhile `pq` not empty:\n  `d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n  `v_plus = u + a`\n  If `v_plus <= N`:\n    `new_d_plus = max(d, v_plus)`\n    If `new_d_plus < dist[v_plus]`:\n      `dist[v_plus] = new_d_plus`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_plus, v_plus))`\n  `v_minus = u - b`\n  If `v_minus >= 0`:\n    `new_d_minus = d`\n    If `new_d_minus < dist[v_minus]`:\n      `dist[v_minus] = new_d_minus`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_minus, v_minus))`\n\nNow we have `dist[k]` for `k` from `0` to `N`.\nFor `k > N`, if `k` is reachable, then `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\nThis is because `k` can be reached by `k-b, k-2b, ...` until `k-jb` is in `[0, N]`.\nIf `k-jb` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k-jb] = X <= N`, then `k` is reachable with `max_reach_val[k] = max(X, k) = k`.\nThis is because `k-jb + jb = k`. The path involves `k-jb, k-jb+b, k-jb+2b, ..., k`.\nThe maximum value on this path is `k`.\nThis holds true as long as `k-jb >= 0`.\nSo, for `k > N`, if `k` is a multiple of `g=gcd(a,b)` and `k-jb >= 0` for some `j` where `k-jb` is reachable (i.e. `dist[k-jb]` is finite), then `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\nSince `gcd(a,b)=1`, any `k > a*b-a-b` is reachable.\nAnd `a*b-a-b` is usually less than `N=a+b` if `a,b` are small.\nE.g., `a=5, b=3`. `N=8`. `ab-a-b = 15-5-3 = 7`.\nSo for `k > 7`, `k` is reachable and `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\nThis is true for all `k` in `[0, m]` such that `k > N` and `dist[k % a]` is finite.\nNo, it's `k` is reachable means `k` can be written as `x*a - y*b`.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=1`, then any `k >= 0` can be written as `x*a - y*b` where `x,y >= 0` if `k` is large enough.\nThe smallest `k` for which `max_reach_val[k]` is `k` is `N_0 = max(dist[j])` for `j` in `[0, N]`.\nIf `k > N_0`, then `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\n\nLet's summarize the `dist` array.\n`dist[k]` is the minimum `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\nWe compute `dist[k]` for `k` from `0` to `a+b` using Dijkstra.\nLet `limit = a+b`.\nFor `k > limit`:\n  If `dist[k % g]` is infinity (meaning `k` is not reachable at all), then `dist[k]` is infinity.\n  Otherwise, `dist[k] = k`.\nThis is because any `k > limit` can be reached from some `k'` where `k' <= limit` by a sequence of `+b` jumps, or `k'` can be reached from `k` by `+b` jumps.\nIf `k` is reachable, then there exists a path `0=p_0, ..., p_s=k`.\nIf `k > limit`, then `max(p_0, ..., p_s)` must be at least `k`. So `dist[k] >= k`.\nSince we can reach `k` by going `0 -> ... -> p_j -> ... -> k` where `p_j` is the largest point in the path from `0` to `k` that is `<= limit`.\nThen `k = p_j + x*b + y*a`.\nIf `k` is reachable, and `k > a+b`, then `k` can be reached from `k-b` or `k-a`.\nIf `k` is reachable and `k > a+b`, then `max_reach_val[k] = k`. This is a known property for this type of problem.\nThe maximum value `k_0` for which `max_reach_val[k_0]` could be less than `k_0` is `a+b`.\nSo for `k > a+b`, if `k` is reachable (i.e. `k % g == 0`), then `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Compute `max_reach_val[k]` for `k = 0, ..., max_val_for_dijkstra = a+b` using Dijkstra.\n   `max_reach_val` array stores `dist[k]`. Initialize `dist[k] = infinity` if `k%g != 0`, else `dist[k]=infinity`. `dist[0]=0`.\n   Dijkstra with `N = a+b` states:\n   `dist = [float('inf')] * (N + 1)`\n   `dist[0] = 0`\n   `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n   While `pq` not empty:\n     `d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n     If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n     `v_plus = u + a`\n     If `v_plus <= N`:\n       `new_d_plus = max(d, v_plus)`\n       If `new_d_plus < dist[v_plus]`:\n         `dist[v_plus] = new_d_plus`\n         `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_plus, v_plus))`\n     `v_minus = u - b`\n     If `v_minus >= 0`:\n       `new_d_minus = d`\n       If `new_d_minus < dist[v_minus]`:\n         `dist[v_minus] = new_d_minus`\n         `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d_minus, v_minus))`\n   After this, `dist[k]` is `max_reach_val[k]` for `k` up to `N`.\n   Any `k` not reachable (i.e., `k%g != 0` or `dist[k]` is still infinity) should be treated as `max_reach_val[k] = infinity`.\n\n3. Calculate the sum `sum(m - f_val + 1 for f_val in max_reach_val if f_val <= m)`.\n   This sum can be split into two parts:\n   a) Sum for `k` from `0` to `min(m, N)`:\n      `current_sum = 0`\n      For `k = 0` to `min(m, N)`:\n        If `dist[k] <= m`:\n          `current_sum += (m - dist[k] + 1)`\n   b) Sum for `k` from `N+1` to `m`:\n      For these `k`, if `k` is reachable (i.e., `k % g == 0`), then `max_reach_val[k] = k`.\n      So we sum `m - k + 1` for `k` from `N+1` to `m` where `k % g == 0`.\n      This is an arithmetic progression sum.\n      The first term is `k_start = ( (N+1+g-1)//g ) * g`.

Part 2: `k` from `N+1` to `m`\n   For these `k`, `max_reach_val[k] = k` if `k%g == 0`, else `infinity`.\n   We need to sum `(m - k + 1)` for `k` in `[N+1, m]` where `k%g == 0`.\n   Let `k_start = ((N+1 + g - 1) // g) * g` (smallest multiple of `g` >= `N+1`).\n   Let `k_end = (m // g) * g` (largest multiple of `g` <= `m`).\n   If `k_start > k_end`, then this part of the sum is 0.\n   Otherwise, the sequence of `k` values is `k_start, k_start+g, ..., k_end`.\n   `num_terms = (k_end - k_start) // g + 1`.\n   The sum is `num_terms * (m+1) - g * (num_terms * (num_terms-1) // 2) - num_terms * k_start`.\n   This sum can be written as `sum_{j=0}^{num_terms-1} (m - (k_start + j*g) + 1)`.\n   Let `term_val = m - k_start + 1`.
