Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Optimizing Souvenir Sales: A Knapsack with a Twist**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which essentially boils down to a knapsack problem, but the devil's in the details. I see the constraints: a potentially large number of souvenirs (`n`), a maximum weight limit (`m`), and varying costs and weights. The usual O(n*m) dynamic programming approach for knapsack is out of the question because of the scale of `n` and `m`. That's going to be way too slow.\n\nThen it hits me: the weights (`wi`) are *tiny*! They're limited to 1, 2, or 3. This is the key. I can immediately see the need to categorize the souvenirs. I'll need to create lists: `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3` to keep track of the costs for each weight category. To maximize the total cost, I should prioritize the most expensive souvenirs within each category. Sorting these lists in descending order of cost is a no-brainer: `costs_w1.sort(reverse=True)`, and so on.\n\nNow, the core of the problem becomes choosing how many items of each weight type to include, let's call those `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.  The total weight has to be less than or equal to `m`: `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`. The total cost is then the sum of the costs of the selected items.\n\nI initially thought I could adapt the standard knapsack DP approach, but realized I need a smarter approach. Trying to directly iterate over all possible values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` directly is still going to be computationally expensive. I need a more efficient way to navigate the possible combinations. I think I need to simplify the state, maybe revisit how I define the `dp[w]` state. Perhaps simply storing the maximum cost for total weight `w` is the most direct path forward. Let me think on that some more...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, given a maximum total weight `m`. The key constraint is that souvenir weights `wi` can only be 1, 2, or 3. The number of souvenirs `n` and maximum weight `m` can be large (up to 10^5 and 3*10^5 respectively), making a standard O(N*M) knapsack solution too slow.\n\nThe small range of weights (1, 2, 3) is crucial. We can categorize souvenirs by their weights and sort them by cost in descending order. This ensures that if we decide to take `k` items of a certain weight, we always pick the `k` most expensive ones.\n\nLet's store the costs for each weight type:\n*   `w1_costs`: list of costs for souvenirs with weight 1.\n*   `w2_costs`: list of costs for souvenirs with weight 2.\n*   `w3_costs`: list of costs for souvenirs with weight 3.\n\nSort these lists in descending order:\n`w1_costs.sort(reverse=True)`\n`w2_costs.sort(reverse=True)`\n`w3_costs.sort(reverse=True)`\n\nTo efficiently calculate the sum of the top `k` items, we can compute prefix sums for each sorted list.\n*   `w1_prefix_sums[k]` will be the sum of the top `k` costs in `w1_costs`.\n*   Similarly for `w2_prefix_sums` and `w3_prefix_sums`.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose `k1` items of weight 1, `k2` items of weight 2, and `k3` items of weight 3 such that:\n`1 * k1 + 2 * k2 + 3 * k3 <= m`\nAnd `w1_prefix_sums[k1] + w2_prefix_sums[k2] + w3_prefix_sums[k3]` is maximized.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible counts of items with weight 3 (`k3`) and items with weight 2 (`k2`).\nFor each pair (`k3`, `k2`):\n1.  Calculate the weight consumed: `current_weight = k3 * 3 + k2 * 2`.\n2.  If `current_weight > m`, this combination is invalid, so continue to the next.\n3.  Calculate the remaining capacity for weight 1 items: `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight`.\n4.  The maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is `k1_max = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_capacity)`.\n5.  The total cost for this combination is `w3_prefix_sums[k3] + w2_prefix_sums[k2] + w1_prefix_sums[k1_max]`.\n6.  Update the overall maximum cost found so far.\n\nThe maximum value for `k3` is `m/3` (approx 10^5) and for `k2` is `m/2` (approx 1.5 * 10^5). Iterating through all `k2` and `k3` would be `O(m^2)`, which is too slow (10^5 * 1.5*10^5 = 1.5*10^10).\n\nHowever, notice that `k3` can only go up to `len(w3_costs)` and `k2` up to `len(w2_costs)`. The total number of items `n` is 10^5.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 or 3 is `n`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `min(len(w3_costs), m/3)`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `min(len(w2_costs), m/2)`.\n\nLet `N2 = len(w2_costs)` and `N3 = len(w3_costs)`.\nThe maximum `k3` is around `N3`. The maximum `k2` is around `N2`.\nThe total number of items `n` is 10^5. If `N3` is small, `N2` could be large. If `N3` is large, `N2` could be small.\nThe sum `N2 + N3 <= n`.\nThe nested loop `for k3 in range(N3+1): for k2 in range(N2+1):` would be `O(N2 * N3)`. In the worst case, `N2 = N/2` and `N3 = N/2`, leading to `O(N^2)`, which is too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation is that `m` is up to 300000. If we take `k3` items of weight 3, they consume `3*k3` weight. If we take `k2` items of weight 2, they consume `2*k2` weight.\nThe loop for `k3` can go up to `m/3`. The loop for `k2` can go up to `m/2`.\nThe total number of items `N` is 100000.\nThe actual limit for `k3` is `min(len(w3_costs), m/3)`.\nThe actual limit for `k2` is `min(len(w2_costs), (m - 3*k3)/2)`.\n\nLet's consider the items with weight 1 and 2 together. We can treat them as a combined \"weight 1 and 2 pool\".\nWe can iterate through all possible numbers of weight 3 items (`k3`). For each `k3`:\n1.  Calculate `current_weight_3 = 3 * k3`.\n2.  If `current_weight_3 > m`, break the loop.\n3.  Calculate `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_3`.\n4.  Now we need to pick items from `w1_costs` and `w2_costs` to fill `remaining_capacity` and maximize cost. This is a 0/1 knapsack problem with two item types (weight 1 and weight 2) and a given capacity. This subproblem can be solved in `O(remaining_capacity)` using a DP approach or a two-pointer approach.\n\nA more direct approach for the subproblem (items with weight 1 and 2):\nWe have a capacity `C = remaining_capacity`. We want to choose `k1` items of weight 1 and `k2` items of weight 2 such that `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 <= C` and `w1_prefix_sums[k1] + w2_prefix_sums[k2]` is maximized.\nThis subproblem can be solved by iterating `k2` from `0` up to `min(len(w2_costs), C/2)`. For each `k2`, calculate `cost_2 = w2_prefix_sums[k2]`, `weight_2 = 2 * k2`. Then `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), C - weight_2)`. Calculate `cost_1 = w1_prefix_sums[k1]`. The sum `cost_1 + cost_2` is a candidate for the maximum cost for this `C`. This inner loop takes `O(C)` time.\nSo, the total complexity would be `O((m/3) * m) = O(m^2)`, still too slow.\n\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 or 3 that can be taken is `N`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 1 that can be taken is `M`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 that can be taken is `M/2`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 that can be taken is `M/3`.\n\nLet's try a different perspective. We have three \"bins\" of items.\nWe can iterate through the number of items of weight 3 (`k3`).\nFor each `k3`, we have `m - 3*k3` capacity remaining for items of weight 1 and 2.\nLet `current_max_cost = 0`.\n`for k3` from `0` to `len(w3_costs)`:\n  `if 3 * k3 > m: break`\n  `current_cost_3 = w3_prefix_sums[k3]`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - 3 * k3`\n  Now we need to maximize `w1_prefix_sums[k1] + w2_prefix_sums[k2]` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_capacity`.\n  This is a subproblem. Let's call `solve_w1_w2(C)` a function that solves this.\n\nThe `solve_w1_w2(C)` function needs to be efficient.\nWe can build a DP array `dp_w1_w2[c]` representing the max cost for capacity `c` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_w1_w2[c] = max(dp_w1_w2[c-1] + w1_costs[idx_w1], dp_w1_w2[c-2] + w2_costs[idx_w2])`\nThis is still an `O(M)` DP. If we recompute this for each `k3`, it's `O(M * M/3)`.\n\nHowever, the `solve_w1_w2(C)` function can be precomputed.\nWe can precompute an array `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` for all `c` from `0` to `m`.\nThis `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` array can be computed using a two-pointer approach or a specialized DP.\nLet `ptr1` be the index for `w1_costs` and `ptr2` for `w2_costs`.\nWe want to iterate through `c` from `0` to `m`.\nFor each `c`, `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` can be derived from `max_cost_w1_w2[c-1]` and `max_cost_w1_w2[c-2]`.\nSpecifically, `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` is the maximum of:\n1.  `max_cost_w1_w2[c-1] + (w1_costs[ptr1] if ptr1 < len(w1_costs) else -infinity)` if we add a weight 1 item.\n2.  `max_cost_w1_w2[c-2] + (w2_costs[ptr2] if ptr2 < len(w2_costs) else -infinity)` if we add a weight 2 item.\n\nThis specific DP approach is tricky because we always want the *most expensive* item.\nA simpler way to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` for all `c` up to `m`:\nInitialize `max_cost_w1_w2` array of size `m+1` with zeros.\nInitialize `current_cost_w1 = 0`, `current_cost_w2 = 0`.\nInitialize `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`.\nFor `c` from `1` to `m`:\n  `val1 = -1` (represents no item of weight 1 available or beneficial)\n  `if p1 < len(w1_costs) and c >= 1: val1 = max_cost_w1_w2[c-1] + w1_costs[p1]`\n  `val2 = -1`\n  `if p2 < len(w2_costs) and c >= 2: val2 = max_cost_w1_w2[c-2] + w2_costs[p2]`\n\n  `max_cost_w1_w2[c] = 0` (or `max_cost_w1_w2[c-1]` if we don't take anything)\n  `if val1 != -1 and val1 > max_cost_w1_w2[c]: max_cost_w1_w2[c] = val1`\n  `if val2 != -1 and val2 > max_cost_w1_w2[c]: max_cost_w1_w2[c] = val2`\n\nThis DP formulation is incorrect because `w1_costs[p1]` and `w2_costs[p2]` refer to specific items. When we do `max_cost_w1_w2[c-1] + w1_costs[p1]`, we should be adding the *next best* weight 1 item. This is exactly what the prefix sums are for.\n\nLet's use the precomputed prefix sums.\n`max_cost_w1_w2[c]` can be computed by iterating through all possible `k2` (number of weight 2 items).\n`for k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), c/2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = w2_prefix_sums[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = 2 * k2`\n  `remaining_c = c - weight_k2`\n  `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_c)`\n  `cost_k1 = w1_prefix_sums[k1]`\n  `max_cost_w1_w2[c] = max(max_cost_w1_w2[c], cost_k1 + cost_k2)`\nThis still makes `max_cost_w1_w2` take `O(M * M/2)` to precompute. This is the bottleneck.\n\nThe correct way to precompute `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` for all `c` in `O(M)` time:\nWe have two sorted lists of costs for weight 1 and weight 2 items.\nWe want to find the maximum cost for a given capacity `c`.\nInitialize `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\nInitialize `current_cost_w1 = 0`.\nFor `k1` from `0` to `len(w1_costs)`:\n  `if k1 > 0: current_cost_w1 += w1_costs[k1-1]`\n  `remaining_capacity_for_w2 = m - k1 * 1`\n  `if remaining_capacity_for_w2 < 0: break`\n\n  Now, for this fixed `k1`, we need to find the best `k2` such that `2 * k2 <= remaining_capacity_for_w2`.\n  This `k2` should be `min(len(w2_costs), remaining_capacity_for_w2 / 2)`.\n  The cost for this `k2` is `w2_prefix_sums[k2]`.\n  The total cost `current_cost_w1 + w2_prefix_sums[k2]` is a candidate for `max_cost_w1_w2[k1 * 1 + 2 * k2]`.\nThis is still not correct. We need to fill `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` for all `c`.\n\nLet's use a two-pointer approach to fill `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` for all `c`:\nInitialize `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\nInitialize `current_cost_w1_items = 0`.\nInitialize `ptr2 = len(w2_costs) - 1` (start with max weight 2 items).\nInitialize `current_cost_w2_items = w2_prefix_sums[len(w2_costs)]` (if `w2_prefix_sums` has `len(w2_costs)+1` elements).\n`current_total_weight = 2 * len(w2_costs)` (if `w2_costs` is not empty).\nThis also seems complicated.\n\nA simpler `O(M)` DP for `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` can be done using a \"deque trick\" or by observing that the optimal `k1` and `k2` change somewhat monotonically.\nLet `dp[c]` be the maximum cost for capacity `c` using items of weights 1 and 2.\n`dp[c] = max(dp[c-1] + cost_of_next_w1_item, dp[c-2] + cost_of_next_w2_item)`.\nThis is essentially what we need, but `cost_of_next_w1_item` isn't fixed.\nIt's `w1_costs[k1_taken_so_far]` and `w2_costs[k2_taken_so_far]`.\n\nConsider the \"knapsack with few item types\" problem.\nIf we have a fixed number of items `N` and weights `w_i` are small, we can use DP state `dp[k1][k2][k3]` for counts. Too large.\nThe problem is essentially:\n`max (sum(w1_costs[:k1]) + sum(w2_costs[:k2]) + sum(w3_costs[:k3]))`\nsubject to `k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`.\n\nLet's fix `k3`.\nThe remaining capacity is `M' = m - 3*k3`.\nWe need to maximize `sum(w1_costs[:k1]) + sum(w2_costs[:k2])` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= M'`.\nLet's call `f(M')` this maximum value.\n`f(M')` can be precomputed for all `M'` from `0` to `m`.\nTo compute `f(M')`:\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), M'/2)`.\nFor each `k2`, calculate `cost_k2 = w2_prefix_sums[k2]`.\nRemaining capacity for `w1` items is `M' - 2*k2`.\nNumber of `w1` items to take is `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), M' - 2*k2)`.\n`cost_k1 = w1_prefix_sums[k1]`.\n`f(M') = max(f(M'), cost_k1 + cost_k2)`.\nThis precomputation takes `O(M * N2)` where `N2` is `len(w2_costs)`. In worst case `N2` is `N`, so `O(M*N)`, too slow.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate the constraints. `N` is 100000, `M` is 300000.\nThe total number of items of weight 2 and 3 combined can be at most `N`.\nThe total weight of items of weight 2 and 3 combined can be at most `M`.\nThe number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) can be at most `N` and at most `M/2`.\nThe number of items of weight 3 (`k3`) can be at most `N` and at most `M/3`.\n\nWhat if we iterate `k3` from 0 to `min(len(w3_costs), M/3)`?\nFor each `k3`, we calculate `current_cost_3 = w3_prefix_sums[k3]`.\n`remaining_capacity = M - 3*k3`.\nNow we need to pick `k1` and `k2` items.\nThe number of items `k2` can be at most `len(w2_costs)`.\nThe number of items `k1` can be at most `len(w1_costs)`.\nThe actual limit for `k2` is `min(len(w2_costs), remaining_capacity / 2)`.\nThe actual limit for `k1` is `min(len(w1_costs), remaining_capacity - 2*k2)`.\n\nThe crucial insight often comes from realizing that if `N` is large, we can't iterate over `N` choices in an inner loop.\nBut `M` is also large.\n\nLet's fix the number of items of weight 3, say `k3`. This takes `O(M/3)` iterations.\nFor each `k3`, we have a remaining capacity `C = M - 3*k3`.\nWe need to solve a subproblem: Maximize cost from weight 1 and weight 2 items with capacity `C`.\nThis subproblem can be solved efficiently.\nLet `dp_w1_w2[c]` be the maximum value for capacity `c` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_w1_w2` can be filled in `O(M)` time.\nInitialize `dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (M + 1)`.\nInitialize `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`.\nInitialize `current_w1_cost = 0`.\nFor `c` from `1` to `M`:\n  `val_w1 = -1`\n  `if p1 < len(w1_costs) and c >= 1: val_w1 = dp_w1_w2[c-1] + w1_costs[p1]`\n  `val_w2 = -1`\n  `if p2 < len(w2_costs) and c >= 2: val_w2 = dp_w1_w2[c-2] + w2_costs[p2]`\n\n  `if val_w1 == -1 and val_w2 == -1: dp_w1_w2[c] = dp_w1_w2[c-1]` (or 0 if c=0)\n  `else if val_w1 == -1: dp_w1_w2[c] = val_w2`\n  `else if val_w2 == -1: dp_w1_w2[c] = val_w1`\n  `else: dp_w1_w2[c] = max(val_w1, val_w2)`\n\n  This DP is for an unbounded knapsack. We have many items of the same type.\n  But here we have distinct items (even if same weight, they have distinct costs, so we sort them).\n  This is a 0/1 knapsack with many items of two types.\n\nA standard way to solve 0/1 knapsack with few item types (but many items of each type) is to use a meet-in-the-middle approach or a specialized DP.\nFor the subproblem (weights 1 and 2, capacity `C`):\nWe can iterate `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), C/2)`.\nFor each `k2`, we take `k2` items of weight 2, costing `w2_prefix_sums[k2]`.\nThe remaining capacity is `C - 2*k2`.\nWe take `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), C - 2*k2)` items of weight 1, costing `w1_prefix_sums[k1]`.\nThe total cost for this `k2` is `w2_prefix_sums[k2] + w1_prefix_sums[k1]`.\nWe maximize this over all `k2`.\nThis inner loop takes `O(C)` time.\nTotal complexity for `k3` loop: `O(M/3 * M) = O(M^2)`. Still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation must be that `N` is much smaller than `M`.\nThe total number of items taken is at most `N`.\nThis means `k1 + k2 + k3 <= N`.\n\nLet's try to iterate on `k2` (number of weight 2 items) and `k3` (number of weight 3 items).\nThe number of items of weight 2 can be at most `N`, and weight 3 at most `N`.\nSo `k2` up to `N`, `k3` up to `N`.\n`for k3 in range(min(len(w3_costs), N) + 1):`\n  `for k2 in range(min(len(w2_costs), N - k3) + 1):` (This `N-k3` is an upper bound on number of items, not weight)\n    `current_weight = 3 * k3 + 2 * k2`\n    `if current_weight > m: continue`\n    `current_cost = w3_prefix_sums[k3] + w2_prefix_sums[k2]`\n    `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight`\n    `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_capacity)`\n    `current_cost += w1_prefix_sums[k1]`\n    `max_total_cost = max(max_total_cost, current_cost)`\n\nThe inner loops are `O(N * N)`. If `N = 10^5`, this is `10^{10}`, too slow.\n\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 and 3 is not `N` in general. It's `len(w2_costs)` and `len(w3_costs)`.\nLet `L2 = len(w2_costs)` and `L3 = len(w3_costs)`.\nThe outer loops are `k3` from `0` to `L3`, `k2` from `0` to `L2`.\nThe total iterations are `L2 * L3`.\nSince `L1 + L2 + L3 = N`, `L2 * L3` can be `O(N^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `L1=0, L2=N/2, L3=N/2`).\n\nThis structure `O(M/3 * M)` or `O(N*N)` suggests that one of the loops must be much smaller.\nWhat if `L2` is small? `O(L2 * M)`. If `L2` is small (e.g., `L2 <= sqrt(M)` or `L2 <= 1000`), then `1000 * 3*10^5 = 3*10^8`, which might be acceptable.\nWhat if `L3` is small? `O(L3 * M)`. Similar.\n\nThe maximum `k2` can be `M/2`. The maximum `k3` can be `M/3`.\nThe loops should be `for k3 in range(min(L3, M/3) + 1):`\n  `for k2 in range(min(L2, (M - 3*k3)/2) + 1):`\nThis is still `O(M/3 * M/2) = O(M^2)`.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M)` or `O(N log N)` or `O(N)` or `O(M log M)`.\nLet's consider the items in a combined way.\nWe have three types of items.\nWe can use a priority queue (max-heap) to always pick the most valuable item that fits.\nThis is a greedy approach. It works for fractional knapsack but not for 0/1 knapsack.\n\nWhat if `m` is small? Then `O(M)` DP is fine.\nWhat if `n` is small? Then `O(N*M)` DP is fine.\nHere both are large.\n\nThe key must be the weights being 1, 2, 3.\nThis means for any capacity `C`, we can try to fill it with items of weight 1, 2, or 3.\nConsider a DP approach where `dp[w]` is the maximum cost for weight `w`.\nTo compute `dp[w]`, we can consider adding a weight 1, 2, or 3 item.\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + cost_w1, dp[w-2] + cost_w2, dp[w-3] + cost_w3)`\nThis is for unbounded knapsack. For 0/1 knapsack, we need to be careful about not reusing items.\nSince we have many items of each weight, we can treat them as \"types\" and use prefix sums.\n\nLet's use the precomputed `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` array.\nHow to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` in `O(M)`?\n`max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`p1 = 0` (index for w1_costs)\n`p2 = 0` (index for w2_costs)\n`current_w1_cost = 0`\n`current_w2_cost = 0`\n\nThis is a variation of the change-making problem or subset sum with value.\nWe want to fill `dp[c]` for `c` from `0` to `m`.\n`dp[c]` is the maximum value for capacity `c` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[c] = max(dp[c-1] + w1_costs[k1_used], dp[c-2] + w2_costs[k2_used])`\nThis is where the problem is. `k1_used` and `k2_used` depend on `c`.\n\nLet's maintain `current_w1_cost` and `current_w2_cost` as the sum of the best `k1` and `k2` items chosen so far.\nA standard approach for this kind of problem is to use a \"sliding window maximum\" (deque) optimization for the DP, but it's typically for specific types of recurrence.\n\nLet's consider the structure of optimal solutions for `f(C)` (max cost for weight 1 and 2 items, capacity `C`).\nWhen `C` increases by 1, we can either:\n1. Add a weight 1 item.\n2. Add a weight 2 item (if `C` becomes `C+2`).\nThe key is that we always want to add the *most expensive available* item.\n`f(C)` for `C` from `0` to `m`.\n`f(0) = 0`.\n`f(C) = max(f(C-1) + w1_costs[k1_so_far], f(C-2) + w2_costs[k2_so_far])`\nThis is still not right. The `k1_so_far` and `k2_so_far` are not global. They depend on the path to `C`.\n\nThe correct DP for `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` in `O(M)` time:\nInitialize `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`p1 = 0` (index for `w1_costs`)\n`p2 = 0` (index for `w2_costs`)\n`current_w1_sum = 0`\n`current_w2_sum = 0`\n\nFor `c` from `1` to `m`:\n  `option1_cost = -1`\n  `if p1 < len(w1_costs):`\n    `option1_cost = current_w1_sum + w1_costs[p1]`\n  `option2_cost = -1`\n  `if p2 < len(w2_costs):`\n    `option2_cost = current_w2_sum + w2_costs[p2]`\n\n  This is not correct. The DP state needs to reflect the optimal choice for capacity `c`.\n  The correct DP for `max_cost_w1_w2[c]` is:\n  `dp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n  `for k1` from `0` to `len(w1_costs)`:\n    `current_cost_w1 = w1_prefix_sums[k1]`\n    `current_weight_w1 = k1 * 1`\n    `if current_weight_w1 > m: break`\n    `# Now, we have taken k1 items of weight 1. For remaining capacity, fill with w2 items.`\n    `# We need to update dp[c] for all c >= current_weight_w1`\n    `# This means dp[current_weight_w1 + 2*k2] = max(dp[...], current_cost_w1 + w2_prefix_sums[k2])`\n\nThis is essentially the `O(M * L2)` approach. We need something faster.\n\nLet's consider the total number of items `N`.\nThe solution for small `N` and small weights (like 1, 2, 3) often involves iterating through counts of the heavier items.\nIf `L3` is small, we iterate `k3` from 0 to `L3`. For each `k3`, we have capacity `M - 3*k3`.\nThen we need to solve the 1, 2 weight knapsack.\nIf `L2` is small, we iterate `k2` from 0 to `L2`. For each `k2`, we have capacity `M - 2*k2`.\nThen we need to solve the 1, 3 weight knapsack.\n\nThe solution to the `1,2` knapsack subproblem for all capacities `C` up to `M` can be done in `O(M)` time.\nLet `dp[c]` be the maximum cost for capacity `c` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp = [0] * (M + 1)`.\nInitialize `p1 = 0` (index for `w1_costs`)\nInitialize `p2 = 0` (index for `w2_costs`)\nInitialize `val1 = 0` (current sum of `w1_costs[:p1]`)\nInitialize `val2 = 0` (current sum of `w2_costs[:p2]`)\n\nThis is equivalent to finding `max_{k1, k2} (w1_prefix_sums[k1] + w2_prefix_sums[k2])` s.t. `k1 + 2*k2 <= c`.\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` as follows:\n`max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`current_w1_val = 0`\n`ptr_w1 = 0`\n`ptr_w2 = len(w2_costs)` (start with all w2 items)\n`current_w2_val = w2_prefix_sums[ptr_w2]`\n`current_total_weight = 2 * ptr_w2`\n\nFor `c` from `0` to `m`:\n  `# Add w1 items as long as capacity allows and it's better than removing w2 items`\n  `while ptr_w1 < len(w1_costs) and current_total_weight + 1 <= c:`\n    `current_w1_val += w1_costs[ptr_w1]`\n    `current_total_weight += 1`\n    `ptr_w1 += 1`\n\n  `# Remove w2 items if capacity requires it`\n  `while ptr_w2 > 0 and current_total_weight > c:`\n    `current_w2_val -= w2_costs[ptr_w2 - 1]`\n    `current_total_weight -= 2`\n    `ptr_w2 -= 1`\n  \n  `# Now current_total_weight <= c, and we have an optimal combination for some capacity <= c`\n  `# We must also consider the case where we add w1 items to fill remaining capacity`\n  `# This is tricky because adding w1 items might mean we should have removed fewer w2 items earlier.`\n\nThe standard `O(M)` DP for this problem:\n`dp = [0] * (M + 1)`\n`p1 = 0` # current index for w1_costs\n`p2 = 0` # current index for w2_costs\n`cost1 = 0` # current total cost for w1 items\n`cost2 = 0` # current total cost for w2 items\n\n`for c in range(1, M + 1):`\n  `# Option 1: Add a weight 1 item`\n  `val_w1 = -1`\n  `if p1 < len(w1_costs) and c >= 1: # check if a w1 item is available and capacity allows`\n    `val_w1 = dp[c-1] + w1_costs[p1]`\n  \n  `# Option 2: Add a weight 2 item`\n  `val_w2 = -1`\n  `if p2 < len(w2_costs) and c >= 2: # check if a w2 item is available and capacity allows`\n    `val_w2 = dp[c-2] + w2_costs[p2]`\n\n  `# This is for unbounded knapsack.

We must use the `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, `w3_costs` lists.\n\nThe only way to get `O(M)` or `O(N)` for the subproblem is if the number of distinct items is small.\nHere the number of distinct items is `N`.\n\nLet's rethink `max_cost_w1_w2[c]`.\n`max_cost_w1_w2[c]` is `max_{k1, k2} (w1_prefix_sums[k1] + w2_prefix_sums[k2])` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= c`.\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` using a two-pointer approach.\nInitialize `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`p1 = 0` (number of weight 1 items)\n`p2 = 0` (number of weight 2 items)\n`current_cost_w1 = 0`\n`current_cost_w2 = 0`\n\nFor `c` from `0` to `m`:\n  `# At capacity c, we want to find the best combination of w1 and w2 items.`\n  `# The previous capacity was c-1.
