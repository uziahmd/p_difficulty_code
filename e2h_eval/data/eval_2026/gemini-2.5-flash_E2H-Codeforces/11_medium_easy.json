A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My thought process starts with understanding the core objective: maximizing toasts for all friends, ensuring each gets the same. This boils down to finding the limiting factor among available resources: drinks, limes, and salt.**  I need a Python script to do this.\n\nFirst, I break down the problem into calculable components. I identify the input parameters: the number of friends, drinks, limes, and salt, along with the per-toast requirements for each friend.\n\nThen, I calculate the *total* resource available from each source.  For drinks, it's (bottles * ml per bottle) // ml per friend. For limes, it's (limes * slices per lime).  For salt, it is total grams // grams per friend. **Crucially, I use integer division because you can't have fractional toasts.**\n\nThe *limiting* resource is key. The minimum of these three 'total toast' values dictates the overall number of toasts possible. Finally, I divide this total by the number of friends to find the number of toasts *per friend*.\n\nI've tested this logic with the provided example and another test case, verifying that the calculations produce the correct number of toasts per friend, taking the integer constraints into account. I'm now confident that my solution is logically sound. The constraints about positive integers under 1000 ensure that I don't need to consider any edge cases relating to division by zero or large numbers. **My Python code concisely and efficiently represents this process.** I've even optimized it to use standard input and be as clear as possible.\n",
