            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Morse Code Decoding and Sequence Counting**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Morse code problem. It's about building a string `S` by appending dots and dashes and counting valid English letter sequences within *substrings* of `S`.  The key here is that a letter sequence \"ABC\" maps to the concatenation of the individual Morse codes for A, B, and C. The challenge is counting *all* valid sequences within `S`'s substrings, and remember to apply the modulo operation.\n\nMy initial thoughts are that I need to define the problem clearly: We start with an empty `S`.  Each time a '0' or '1' is added, I have to update the count. The problem is asking how many *different* sequences of English letters correspond to *any* substring of `S` after each append.\n\nI have to carefully consider the substring condition.  \"Represented by a substring\" *means* the sequence's Morse code is exactly equal to a continuous portion of `S`, and the code can overlap within the larger sequence. This seems like it could lead to potential double-counting, which needs to be carefully addressed.\n\nThe constraint that the codes are of length 1-4 is manageable. I'm going to have to carefully consider the valid codes and ensure the algorithm handles these cases well.  Invalid codes must be excluded.\n\nThe mention of dynamic programming definitely sparks something. I can see building a table to track possible sequence counts ending at each position in `S`. It could be something like:\n\n`dp[i]` = the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` within some substring of `S`.\n\nMaybe the state could also include the length of the currently represented sequence?  I need to carefully think about the transitions. Each '0' or '1' appended needs to trigger an update of `dp` values. I could iterate through all possible Morse code lengths (1 to 4) to find valid sequence continuations at the new position. I am certain I will need to iterate and check for overlaps!\n\nSince I have to use modulo arithmetic (`10^9 + 7`), overflow is certainly prevented, but I will need to ensure modulo operations are applied correctly in all counting steps.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by some substring of a growing string `S`. Each English letter is represented by a Morse code (a string of '0's and '1's) of length 1 to 4. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not correspond to any letter. We need to output the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. We are interested in sequences of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` such that their concatenated Morse codes `C_1 C_2 ... C_k` form a substring of `S`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. When a new character is appended to `S`, its length `N` increases by 1. Let `S_N` denote the string `S` of length `N`.\n\nConsider `dp[i]` as the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse codes form a prefix of `S_N` of length `i`. That is, `dp[i]` counts sequences `L_1 ... L_k` such that `C_1 ... C_k = S_N[0:i]`.\n\nThe base case is `dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which is useful for transitions but won't be directly counted in the final answer).\n\nFor `i` from 1 to `N`:\n`dp[i]` can be calculated by considering all possible last letters `L_k` that complete a sequence ending at `S_N[i-1]`.\nIf `S_N[i-L:i]` is a valid Morse code for a letter `L_k` (where `L` is its length, 1 to 4), then we can append `L_k` to any sequence that forms `S_N[0:i-L]`.\nSo, `dp[i] = sum(dp[i-L])` for all `L` from 1 to 4 such that `S_N[i-L:i]` is a valid Morse code.\n\nThe final answer for `S_N` would be `sum(dp[i])` for `i` from 1 to `N`. This is because any sequence `C_1 ... C_k` that forms a prefix `S_N[0:i]` is a valid sequence.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"some substring of S\". Our `dp[i]` only counts sequences forming prefixes `S_N[0:i]`. To count sequences forming *any* substring `S_N[j:i]`, we can modify the DP.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse codes form a substring `S_N[j:i]` for some `j <= i`. More precisely, `dp[i]` counts sequences `L_1 ... L_k` such that `C_1 ... C_k` ends at index `i-1` of `S_N`.\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S` (making `S` of length `N`), we need to calculate the contribution of all new substrings ending at `S[N-1]`.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nLet `count_ending_at_N_minus_1` be the number of non-empty sequences that form a substring `current_S[j:N]` for some `j`.\n\n`count_ending_at_N_minus_1` can be calculated as follows:\nInitialize `count_ending_at_N_minus_1 = 0`.\nFor `L` from 1 to 4 (length of Morse code):\n  If `N - L >= 0`:\n    Let `sub = current_S[N-L:N]`.\n    If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n      `count_ending_at_N_minus_1 = (count_ending_at_N_minus_1 + (dp[N-L] if N-L > 0 else 1)) % MOD`.\n      Here, `dp[N-L]` represents the number of sequences ending at `N-L-1`. If `N-L` is 0, it means `sub` itself forms a sequence starting from the beginning of `current_S`, so we add 1 (for the single letter `sub`).\n\nThe total answer after appending `c` is `(previous_total_answer + count_ending_at_N_minus_1) % MOD`.\n\nLet's refine `dp[i]` definition: `dp[i]` is the number of sequences of letters whose Morse code concatenation forms a substring of `S` that *ends* at index `i-1`.\nSo, `dp[i]` counts sequences `L_1 ... L_k` such that `C_1 ... C_k = S[j:i]` for some `j`.\n\nWhen `S` has length `N` (after appending a character):\n`dp[0] = 0` (no sequences end before index 0).\nFor `i` from 1 to `N`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - L >= 0`:\n      Let `sub = S[i-L:i]`.\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + (dp[i-L] if i-L > 0 else 1)) % MOD`.\n        The `(dp[i-L] if i-L > 0 else 1)` part means:\n        - If `i-L > 0`, we add `dp[i-L]` (sequences ending at `i-L-1`)\n        - If `i-L == 0`, it means `sub` is `S[0:i]`. This forms a new sequence `L_k` by itself, so we add 1.\n\nThe total answer after `N` characters is `sum(dp[i])` for `i` from 1 to `N`.\n\nLet's trace this with the first example: `S = \"111\"`. `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nInvalid codes: `{\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\nInitially, `S = \"\"`, `total_ans = 0`. `dp` array is empty.\n\n**1. Append '1'**: `S = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\n   `dp` array will be of size `N+1 = 2`.\n   `dp[0] = 0`.\n   For `i = 1`:\n     `dp[1] = 0`\n     `L = 1`: `i-L = 0`. `sub = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n       `dp[1] = (dp[1] + (dp[0] if 0 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `total_ans = dp[1] = 1`.\n   Output: `1`.\n\n**2. Append '1'**: `S = \"11\"`. `N = 2`.\n   `dp` array will be of size `N+1 = 3`.\n   `dp[0] = 0`. (This is conceptually `0`, but we reuse the previous `dp` values for `i < N`).\n   `dp[1]` is still `1` from previous step.\n   For `i = 2`:\n     `dp[2] = 0`\n     `L = 1`: `i-L = 1`. `sub = S[1:2] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n       `dp[2] = (dp[2] + (dp[1] if 1 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n     `L = 2`: `i-L = 0`. `sub = S[0:2] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid.\n       `dp[2] = (dp[2] + (dp[0] if 0 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n   `total_ans = (dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD = (1 + 2) % MOD = 3`.\n   Output: `3`.\n\n**3. Append '1'**: `S = \"111\"`. `N = 3`.\n   `dp` array will be of size `N+1 = 4`.\n   `dp[0] = 0`.\n   `dp[1]` is `1`.\n   `dp[2]` is `2`.\n   For `i = 3`:\n     `dp[3] = 0`\n     `L = 1`: `i-L = 2`. `sub = S[2:3] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n       `dp[3] = (dp[3] + (dp[2] if 2 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (0 + dp[2]) % MOD = (0 + 2) % MOD = 2`.\n     `L = 2`: `i-L = 1`. `sub = S[1:3] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid.\n       `dp[3] = (dp[3] + (dp[1] if 1 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (2 + dp[1]) % MOD = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n     `L = 3`: `i-L = 0`. `sub = S[0:3] = \"111\"`. \"111\" is valid.\n       `dp[3] = (dp[3] + (dp[0] if 0 > 0 else 1)) % MOD = (3 + 1) % MOD = 4`.\n   `total_ans = (dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD = (1 + 2 + 4) % MOD = 7`.\n   Output: `7`.\n\nThis matches the sample output.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`. The `dp` array will have size `m+1`.\nIn each step (appending a character), we calculate one new `dp[N]` value. This involves checking up to 4 substrings and doing constant time arithmetic operations. So, each step is `O(1)` amortized if we consider string slicing to be `O(L)` where `L` is small (max 4). Total time complexity `O(m * L_max) = O(m)`.\nSpace complexity `O(m)`. This is efficient enough.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n*   Store the `S` string. Since `m` is up to 3000, appending to a Python list of characters and then joining or slicing is fine. Or just a string and `S += char`.\n*   Maintain the `dp` array.\n*   Keep track of `total_ans`.\n*   The set of invalid codes for quick lookup: `{\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Set of invalid Morse codes\n    INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # S will store the current Morse code string\n    S = []\n    \n    # dp[i] will store the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\n    # whose concatenated Morse codes form a substring of S ending at index i-1.\n    # dp array size will be m+1. dp[0] is conceptually 0 for our sum.\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    \n    # total_answer stores the sum of all dp[i] values\n    # (i.e., total number of sequences from all substrings ending at any position)\n    total_answer = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(char)\n        N = len(S) # Current length of S\n        \n        # Calculate dp[N]\n        # dp[N] represents sequences ending at S[N-1]\n        current_dp_N = 0\n        \n        # Check substrings of length 1 to 4 ending at S[N-1]\n        for L in range(1, 5):\n            if N - L >= 0:\n                # Get the substring S[N-L : N]\n                # Python list slicing creates a new list, then join creates string.\n                # For small L (max 4), this is efficient enough.\n                sub = \"\".join(S[N-L : N])\n                \n                if sub not in INVALID_CODES:\n                    # If sub is a valid Morse code for a letter,\n                    # we can append this letter to sequences ending at S[N-L-1].\n                    # If N-L is 0, it means sub is S[0:N], a sequence starting from the beginning.\n                    # In this case, we add 1 (for the single letter represented by 'sub').\n                    # Otherwise, we add dp[N-L] (sequences ending at S[N-L-1]).\n                    \n                    # Note: dp[0] is not used to represent sequences ending at index -1.\n                    # It's a placeholder.
