    "thought": "**The Puzzle of the Least Common Multiple**\n\nAlright, here's the deal. I'm given two numbers, 'a' and 'b', and I need to find a non-negative integer 'k' that makes the least common multiple (LCM) of (a+k) and (b+k) as small as possible. If there are multiple 'k's that give me the same smallest LCM, I have to pick the *smallest* 'k'.  'a' and 'b' can be as large as a billion, that's 10^9!\n\nFirst, a little math. Let's call (a+k) 'x' and (b+k) 'y'. We know that LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y), where GCD is the greatest common divisor. Also, the difference between 'x' and 'y' is simply b - a.  A key insight here is that the GCD of 'x' and 'y' must also be a divisor of (b-a). Let's call this difference 'D'.\n\nIf 'a' and 'b' are the same, the problem is straightforward - k=0 is the answer, and the LCM is just 'a'.\n\nBut what if they aren't the same? Let's assume 'a' is less than 'b' to keep things simple. Then, the GCD has to be a divisor of 'D'. Now, I'm thinking of going through all possible divisors of 'D'. Since 'D' can be as big as a billion, finding all divisors could be a bit time consuming.  Thankfully, the maximum number of divisors for a number up to 10^9 is manageable, so it won't be overly slow.\n\nFor each divisor 'g' of 'D', I need to find the smallest 'k' that makes (a+k) a multiple of 'g'. Since (b-a) is divisible by 'g', (b+k) will also be a multiple of 'g' for this 'k'. The value of k = (g - (a % g)) % g does exactly that. By iterating through each divisor 'g', I can find a corresponding 'k'. For each combination I calculate `lcm`.\n\nI can start with k=0 as an initial guess. Then iterate through all of 'D's divisors and use the current best solution to optimize. If at any point I find a 'k' with a smaller LCM, I update my solution. I also need to keep track of any 'k' values which achieve the same min_lcm and pick the smallest of these 'k' values.\n\nI've tested this on a few examples, and it seems to work. The number of divisors is managable, the calculation is efficient. I think I have it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nAlso, `y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nLet `g = gcd(x, y)`. Since `g` divides both `x` and `y`, it must also divide their difference, `y - x`.\nTherefore, `g` must be a divisor of `abs(b - a)`.\n\nThis observation is crucial: the greatest common divisor of `a+k` and `b+k` must always be a divisor of `abs(b - a)`. This significantly limits the possible values for `gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nLet `D = abs(b - a)`.\n\n**Special Case: `a = b`**\nIf `a = b`, then `D = 0`. In this case, `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we must choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. The minimum LCM would be `a`.\n\n**General Case: `a != b`**\nWithout loss of generality, assume `a < b`. Then `D = b - a`.\nWe will iterate through all possible divisors `g` of `D`. For each divisor `g`, we consider it as a potential `gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nFor a chosen divisor `g` of `D`:\nWe need `a+k` to be a multiple of `g`.\nThe smallest non-negative integer `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\nLet's verify this `k`:\n- If `a % g == 0`, then `k = (g - 0) % g = 0`. `a+0 = a` is a multiple of `g`.\n- If `a % g != 0`, then `k = g - (a % g)`. `a+k = a + (g - (a % g))`. Since `a % g` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `g`, `a + (g - (a % g))` will be the smallest multiple of `g` that is greater than or equal to `a`.\nThis `k` ensures that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\nSince `D = b-a` is a multiple of `g`, and `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, then `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` must also be a multiple of `g`.\nSo, for this `k`, both `a+k` and `b+k` are multiples of `g`.\n\nLet `x_k = a+k` and `y_k = b+k` for this specific `k`.\nThe actual `gcd(x_k, y_k)` might be `g` or a multiple of `g` (which is also a divisor of `D`).\nWe calculate `current_lcm = (x_k * y_k) / gcd(x_k, y_k)`.\nWe keep track of the minimum `current_lcm` found so far and the corresponding `k`. If a new `k` yields the same minimum `lcm`, we choose the smaller `k`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `a` and `b`.\n2. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3. Ensure `a <= b` by swapping if necessary. This simplifies `D = b - a`.\n4. Initialize `min_lcm` and `min_k`:\n   - Set `min_k = 0`.\n   - Calculate `initial_gcd = math.gcd(a, b)`.\n   - Calculate `min_lcm = (a // initial_gcd) * b`. (Using `//` before multiplication helps prevent intermediate overflow in some languages, though Python handles large integers automatically). This sets a baseline using `k=0`.\n5. Find all divisors of `D = b - a`:\n   - Iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(D)`.\n   - If `i` divides `D`:\n     - Let `g1 = i`.\n     - Calculate `k1 = (g1 - (a % g1)) % g1`.\n     - Calculate `x1 = a + k1` and `y1 = b + k1`.\n     - Calculate `current_gcd1 = math.gcd(x1, y1)`.\n     - Calculate `current_lcm1 = (x1 // current_gcd1) * y1`.\n     - If `current_lcm1 < min_lcm`: update `min_lcm = current_lcm1` and `min_k = k1`.\n     - Else if `current_lcm1 == min_lcm`: update `min_k = min(min_k, k1)`.\n     - Also consider `g2 = D // i` (if `i*i != D` to avoid duplicates).\n     - Calculate `k2 = (g2 - (a % g2)) % g2`.\n     - Calculate `x2 = a + k2` and `y2 = b + k2`.\n     - Calculate `current_gcd2 = math.gcd(x2, y2)`.\n     - Calculate `current_lcm2 = (x2 // current_gcd2) * y2`.\n     - If `current_lcm2 < min_lcm`: update `min_lcm = current_lcm2` and `min_k = k2`.\n     - Else if `current_lcm2 == min_lcm`: update `min_k = min(min_k, k2)`.\n6. Print `min_k`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- `a, b` are up to `10^9`.\n- `D = b - a` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\n- Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(D))` time. `sqrt(10^9) \\approx 31622`.\n- For each divisor, we perform `math.gcd` which takes `O(log(max(a+k, b+k)))`. `max(a+k, b+k)` can be up to `2 * 10^9`. `log(2 * 10^9)` is approximately `31` (base 2).\n- The maximum number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is `1344` (for `735134400`).\n- Total time complexity: `O(sqrt(D) * log(max(a,b)))`. In the worst case, this is roughly `31622 * 31 \\approx 10^6` operations, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually `10^8` ops/sec).\n- Space complexity: `O(1)`.\n\n**Example 1: `a=6, b=10`**\n1. `a=6, b=10`. `a!=b`.\n2. `D = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3. Initial: `k=0`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm(6,10) = (6//2)*10 = 3*10 = 30`.\n   `min_lcm = 30`, `min_k = 0`.\n4. Divisors of `D=4`:\n   - `i=1`: `g1=1`. `k1=(1-(6%1))%1 = 0`. `x1=6, y1=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm(6,10)=30`. `min_k = min(0,0)=0`.\n     `g2=4//1=4`. `k2=(4-(6%4))%4 = (4-2)%4 = 2`. `x2=8, y2=12`. `gcd(8,12)=4`. `lcm(8,12)=(8//4)*12 = 2*12 = 24`.\n     `24 < 30`, so `min_lcm = 24`, `min_k = 2`.\n   - `i=2`: `D%2==0`. `g1=2`. `k1=(2-(6%2))%2 = 0`. `x1=6, y1=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm(6,10)=30`. `30` is not less than `24`.\n     `i*i == D` (`2*2 == 4`), so `g2` is skipped.\n5. Loop ends. Print `min_k = 2`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # If a and b are equal, lcm(a+k, b+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, choose the smallest non-negative k, which is 0.\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b for consistent calculation of D = b - a.\n    # This doesn't change the problem, as lcm(X, Y) = lcm(Y, X).\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    D = b - a # D is always positive here\n\n    # Initialize min_lcm with lcm(a, b) for k=0.\n    # lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y).\n    # Using (x // gcd(x, y)) * y is a safer way to compute LCM to prevent\n    # potential intermediate overflow if x*y exceeds maximum integer limits\n    # in languages like C++/Java, though Python handles large integers automatically.\n    initial_gcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n    min_lcm = (a // initial_gcd) * b\n    min_k = 0\n\n    # Iterate through all divisors 'g' of D.\n    # For each 'g', we find the smallest non-negative k such that a+k is a multiple of g.\n    # Since b-a is a multiple of g, b+k will also be a multiple of g.\n    # This k guarantees that g is a common divisor of a+k and b+k.\n    # We then calculate the actual lcm for this k and update our minimums.\n    \n    # Iterate up to sqrt(D) to find all divisors efficiently.\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(D)) + 1):\n        if D % i == 0:\n            # i is a divisor (g1)\n            g1 = i\n            \n            # Calculate k for g1: smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) is a multiple of g1\n            k1 = (g1 - (a % g1)) % g1\n            \n            x1 = a + k1\n            y1 = b + k1\n            current_gcd1 = math.gcd(x1, y1)\n            current_lcm1 = (x1 // current_gcd1) * y1\n\n            # Update min_lcm and min_k\n            if current_lcm1 < min_lcm:\n                min_lcm = current_lcm1\n                min_k = k1\n            elif current_lcm1 == min_lcm:\n                min_k = min(min_k, k1)\n\n            # D // i is also a divisor (g2), unless i*i == D\n            if i * i != D:\n                g2 = D // i\n                \n                # Calculate k for g2\n                k2 = (g2 - (a % g2)) % g2\n                \n                x2 = a + k2\n                y2 = b + k2\n                current_gcd2 = math.gcd(x2, y2)\n                current_lcm2 = (x2 // current_gcd2) * y2\n                \n                # Update min_lcm and min_k\n                if current_lcm2 < min_lcm:\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm2\n                    min_k = k2\n                elif current_lcm2 == min_lcm:\n                    min_k = min(min_k, k2)\n    \n    print(min_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
