    "thought": "**The Gluttony Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core is finding a way to rearrange the elements of an array `a` into a new array `b` such that the sums of all non-empty, proper subsets of `a` and `b` are never equal.  The size of the array, `n`, is the key.  I'm thinking that anything that runs in `2^n` time is probably okay, but a factorial solution is out of the question.\n\nThe problem comes down to ensuring that the sets of values making up those subsets are always distinct between `a` and `b`.  If I sort `a`, let's call it `a_sorted`, I can rearrange the items using a cyclic shift.   I'll try setting `b` up like this: `b[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.  I tried this approach on some examples and it worked!\n\nNow, how can I be certain this works?  I have to look into cases when sum of elements is equal. So if I have sorted `a` values, `a_0`, `a_1`, ... `a_n-1`, and my cyclic shift `b` values, I need to check for a subset `S` with sum elements of `a` equal sum of elements of `b` over that set.  I am thinking this is where the constraints kick in.\n\nIf I set up `c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}`, the whole check turns into figuring out if there is a subset `S` for which `sum(c)` becomes zero.\n\nA careful look at these `c` values revealed something useful, because of sorting, `c_i` is always negative except `c_{n-1}` is positive.  We need to find if `sum(c)` is zero when summed on a non empty, proper subset of indices.  We need a mix of negative and positive terms, since sum is zero. And our constraint, ensures us that sum of all terms is not zero.\n\nThis translates to subset sum problems, with `n <= 22`.\n\nI thought about the scenario when all terms are added, `sum(c)=0` for some values but that subset sum case is rejected. So, what I want is there is not any sum value in subset for `c` equal to `c_(n-1)`\nI can formulate `c_{n-1} = (val_{n-1}-val_0)` as sum of other elements.\n\nSo basically, after sorting and the cyclic shift, it seems like I'm looking for a subset sum problem where I have to check the relationship between sums made by subset of values. Then I need to map it back to the original array to present my answer.  Seems manageable!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\n\nLet `d[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. The condition can be rewritten as `sum_{i in S} d[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nA common strategy for problems involving permutations and sums is to sort the array. Let's store the original values along with their indices to reconstruct the final `b` array.\n1. Create a list of pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in the input array `a`.\n   `items = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`\n2. Sort `items` based on the `value` component. Let the sorted list be `sorted_items`.\n   `sorted_items = [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]`,\n   where `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}`.\n\nNow, we need to define the permutation `b`. A simple permutation to try is a cyclic shift.\nLet's define `b` such that for the `k`-th smallest value `val_k` (which was originally at `idx_k`), its position in `b` will contain the `(k+1)%n`-th smallest value `val_{(k+1)%n}`.\nIn other words, `b[idx_k] = val_{(k+1)%n}` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThis ensures that `b` is a permutation of `a`, as each `val_j` appears exactly once in `b`.\n\nNow let's analyze the differences `d[i] = a[i] - b[i]` based on this construction.\nFor an original index `i = idx_k`, we have `a[i] = val_k` and `b[i] = val_{(k+1)%n}`.\nSo, `d[idx_k] = val_k - val_{(k+1)%n}`.\nLet `c_k = val_k - val_{(k+1)%n}`.\nThe set of differences `{d[i] | i = 0, ..., n-1}` is exactly the set `{c_k | k = 0, ..., n-1}`.\nThe condition becomes `sum_{k in S'} c_k != 0` for any `0 < |S'| < n`. (`S'` here is a subset of indices `k` from `0` to `n-1` corresponding to the sorted values).\n\nLet's list the `c_k` values:\n`c_0 = val_0 - val_1`\n`c_1 = val_1 - val_2`\n...\n`c_{n-2} = val_{n-2} - val_{n-1}`\n`c_{n-1} = val_{n-1} - val_0`\n\nSince `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}`:\n- `c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-2}` are all negative.\n- `c_{n-1}` is positive.\n\nConsider the sum of all `c_k`: `sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k = (val_0 - val_1) + (val_1 - val_2) + ... + (val_{n-1} - val_0) = 0`.\nThis sum is for the full set of indices `S' = {0, ..., n-1}`, which is excluded by the problem condition `0 < |S'| < n`. So this specific zero sum is allowed.\n\nNow, consider any proper non-empty subset `S'`.\nIf `n-1` is not in `S'`, then all `c_k` for `k in S'` are negative. Thus, `sum_{k in S'} c_k` must be strictly negative (since `S'` is non-empty). In this case, `sum_{k in S'} c_k != 0`.\n\nIf `n-1` is in `S'`, let `S' = S_neg U {n-1}`, where `S_neg` is a subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k in S_neg} c_k + c_{n-1}`.\nFor this sum to be zero, we need `c_{n-1} = -sum_{k in S_neg} c_k`.\nSince `c_k < 0` for `k in S_neg`, `-sum_{k in S_neg} c_k` is a sum of positive values.\nLet `x_k = -c_k = val_{k+1} - val_k` for `k = 0, ..., n-2`. All `x_k > 0`.\nWe need to check if `c_{n-1} = sum_{k in S_neg} x_k` for any `S_neg` where `0 <= |S_neg| < n-1`.\n`c_{n-1} = val_{n-1} - val_0`.\nAlso, `val_{n-1} - val_0 = (val_1 - val_0) + (val_2 - val_1) + ... + (val_{n-1} - val_{n-2})`.\nThis is `c_{n-1} = x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_{n-2}`.\nThis means `c_{n-1}` is equal to the sum of *all* `x_k` values.\nSo, if `S_neg` is empty, `sum_{k in S_neg} x_k = 0`, but `c_{n-1} > 0`. So `c_{n-1} != 0`.\nIf `S_neg` is any non-empty proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`, then `sum_{k in S_neg} x_k` will be strictly less than `x_0 + ... + x_{n-2}` (because all `x_k > 0`).\nTherefore, `sum_{k in S_neg} x_k` cannot be equal to `c_{n-1}`.\n\nThis implies that `sum_{k in S'} c_k` is never zero for `0 < |S'| < n`.\nThe only case where `sum_{k in S'} c_k = 0` is when `S'` is the full set `{0, ..., n-1}`, but this is excluded by the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the cyclic shift construction always works.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)`: `items = []` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `items.append((a[i], i))`.\n4. Sort `items` based on `value`: `sorted_items = sorted(items)`.\n5. Create an empty array `b` of size `n`.\n6. For `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Let `(val_k, idx_k) = sorted_items[k]`.\n   Let `(val_next, _) = sorted_items[(k+1)%n]`.\n   Set `b[idx_k] = val_next`.\n7. Print the elements of `b` space-separated.\n\nExample 1: `n=2`, `a=[1, 2]`\n1. `items = [(1,0), (2,1)]`\n2. `sorted_items = [(1,0), (2,1)]`\n   `val_0=1, idx_0=0`\n   `val_1=2, idx_1=1`\n3. `b = [0, 0]` (initialized)\n4. `k=0`: `(val_0, idx_0) = (1,0)`. `val_next = sorted_items[(0+1)%2][0] = sorted_items[1][0] = 2`.\n   `b[0] = 2`.\n5. `k=1`: `(val_1, idx_1) = (2,1)`. `val_next = sorted_items[(1+1)%2][0] = sorted_items[0][0] = 1`.\n   `b[1] = 1`.\n6. `b = [2, 1]`. Output: `2 1`. This matches the example.\n\nExample 2: `n=4`, `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. `items = [(1000,0), (100,1), (10,2), (1,3)]`\n2. `sorted_items = [(1,3), (10,2), (100,1), (1000,0)]`\n   `val_0=1, idx_0=3`\n   `val_1=10, idx_1=2`\n   `val_2=100, idx_2=1`\n   `val_3=1000, idx_3=0`\n3. `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n4. `k=0`: `(1,3)`. `val_next = sorted_items[1][0] = 10`. `b[3] = 10`.\n5. `k=1`: `(10,2)`. `val_next = sorted_items[2][0] = 100`. `b[2] = 100`.\n6. `k=2`: `(100,1)`. `val_next = sorted_items[3][0] = 1000`. `b[1] = 1000`.\n7. `k=3`: `(1000,0)`. `val_next = sorted_items[0][0] = 1`. `b[0] = 1`.\n8. `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. Output: `1 1000 100 10`. This is a valid answer, although different from the example output `100 1 1000 10`. The problem allows any valid answer.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`. Constructing `b` takes `O(N)`. This is very efficient for `N <= 22`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Create pairs of (value, original_index)\n    items = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        items.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort items based on their values\n    # sorted_items will be [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]\n    # where val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}\n    sorted_items = sorted(items)\n\n    # Initialize the result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Construct b based on the cyclic shift strategy\n    # For each k from 0 to n-1:\n    # The element originally at sorted_items[k].original_index (which has value sorted_items[k].value)\n    # will be replaced by sorted_items[(k+1)%n].value in the b array.\n    for k in range(n):\n        val_k, original_idx_k = sorted_items[k]\n        val_next_k = sorted_items[(k + 1) % n][0]\n        b[original_idx_k] = val_next_k\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
