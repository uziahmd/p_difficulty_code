There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding Maximum Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nI've been wrestling with this problem of finding the maximum number of games a tournament winner can play under a specific rule. The rule is that two players can only compete if the absolute difference in the number of games they've already played is at most one.\n\nMy thought process led me to define a dynamic programming-like approach.  I initially thought about the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play *k* games, denoted as `dp[k]`. I quickly realized this relates to the Fibonacci sequence! Each game the winner plays against someone who has played either one fewer or two fewer games.  This pattern mirrors how Fibonacci numbers are constructed.\n\n*   `dp[0]` doesn't really matter (it is a single player).\n*   `dp[1]` is 2 (one game, two players).\n*   `dp[2]` is 3 (winner vs opponent with 0 or 1 game).\n*   `dp[3]` is 5.\n*   and so on, this gives `dp[k] = Fibonacci(k+2)`.\n\nThis `dp[k]` can be used to determine the maximum value of games (`k`) that the winner can play based on `n`, total participants, where `n >= dp[k]`.\n\nThis brings me to the core idea:  I want to iterate through Fibonacci numbers until one exceeds `n` (the total number of players). If `F_i` is <= n, this represents the Fibonacci number corresponding to `dp[k] = F_i`, so `k=i-2`. I need to find the largest *k*.\nThus, I need to find the largest *k* where `dp[k]` is less than or equal to n.\n\nThe actual code implementation: I initialize two variables representing the current and previous Fibonacci numbers. I use a `while` loop to generate Fibonacci numbers until one exceeds n.  This logic efficiently finds the target `k`.\n\nThe key is that for a given number of players `n`, I can find a corresponding maximum value of `k` (games played by winner) where `dp[k]` is the least number of players required for the winner to play k games.\nFor this, I must find the largest `F_{k+2}` <= `n`.\nThe code computes the Fibonacci numbers and stops when that condition is not satisfied.\n\nFor the final answer, I subtract one from the final games count.  This is because the loop stops when it is above n, and the games variable is off by one.\n\nI have tested a lot of values. The solution should work because it relies on the Fibonacci sequence and properly handles boundary cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner has played.\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   To play 1 game, the winner (who has played 0 games) must play against an opponent (who has also played 0 games). Both must win their previous games to reach this point. This requires 2 players in total. So, `dp[1] = 2`.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:**\n    Consider a winner who has played `k` games. For their `k`-th game, they must have already played `k-1` games. Let their opponent for this `k`-th game have played `P_O` games. According to the rule, `|(k-1) - P_O| <= 1`. This means `P_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`. However, an opponent cannot have played `k` games if the winner has only played `k-1` games before this game. So `P_O` can only be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Opponent played `k-2` games.**\n        The winner (W) has played `k-1` games, and the opponent (O) has played `k-2` games.\n        The number of players required for W's sub-tournament is `dp[k-1]`.\n        The number of players required for O's sub-tournament is `dp[k-2]`.\n        Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Opponent played `k-1` games.**\n        The winner (W) has played `k-1` games, and the opponent (O) has played `k-1` games.\n        The number of players required for W's sub-tournament is `dp[k-1]`.\n        The number of players required for O's sub-tournament is `dp[k-1]`.\n        Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`.\n\n    To find the *minimum* number of players required for the winner to play `k` games, we should choose the option that uses fewer players. Since `dp[k-2] <= dp[k-1]` (more games generally require more players), `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` will always be less than or equal to `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`.\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation is `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\n3.  **Sequence of `dp[k]` values:**\n    *   `dp[0]` (conceptual: a single player who hasn't played yet) = 1.\n    *   `dp[1]` = 2.\n    *   `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n    *   `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n\n    This sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` corresponds to the Fibonacci numbers, specifically `dp[k] = F_{k+2}` if we define `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...`.\n    `F_2 = 1` (corresponds to `dp[0]`)\n    `F_3 = 2` (corresponds to `dp[1]`)\n    `F_4 = 3` (corresponds to `dp[2]`)\n    `F_5 = 5` (corresponds to `dp[3]`)\n    And so on.\n\n4.  **Finding the maximum `k` for given `n`:**\n    We need to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`. This means finding the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\n    We can iterate through Fibonacci numbers, keeping track of the current number of games (`k`).\n    Let `f_prev` be `F_{i+1}` and `f_curr` be `F_{i+2}` (which is `dp[i]`).\n    Initialize:\n    `f_prev = 1` (representing `F_2`, which is `dp[0]`)\n    `f_curr = 2` (representing `F_3`, which is `dp[1]`)\n    `winner_games = 1` (this is `k` for `f_curr`)\n\n    Loop while `f_curr <= n`:\n        `next_f = f_prev + f_curr`\n        `f_prev = f_curr`\n        `f_curr = next_f`\n        `winner_games += 1`\n\n    After the loop, `f_curr` is the first Fibonacci number `F_{k'+2}` that is strictly greater than `n`. The `winner_games` variable would have been incremented one too many times to correspond to this `f_curr`. Therefore, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `winner_games - 1`.\n\n5.  **Example Trace (`n=10`):**\n    *   Initial: `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `winner_games = 1`.\n    *   **Iteration 1:** `f_curr (2) <= n (10)` is true.\n        `next_f = 1 + 2 = 3`\n        `f_prev = 2`\n        `f_curr = 3`\n        `winner_games = 1 + 1 = 2` (Winner plays 2 games, requires 3 players)\n    *   **Iteration 2:** `f_curr (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n        `next_f = 2 + 3 = 5`\n        `f_prev = 3`\n        `f_curr = 5`\n        `winner_games = 2 + 1 = 3` (Winner plays 3 games, requires 5 players)\n    *   **Iteration 3:** `f_curr (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n        `next_f = 3 + 5 = 8`\n        `f_prev = 5`\n        `f_curr = 8`\n        `winner_games = 3 + 1 = 4` (Winner plays 4 games, requires 8 players)\n    *   **Iteration 4:** `f_curr (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n        `next_f = 5 + 8 = 13`\n        `f_prev = 8`\n        `f_curr = 13`\n        `winner_games = 4 + 1 = 5` (Winner plays 5 games, requires 13 players)\n    *   **Iteration 5:** `f_curr (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: `winner_games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output for `n=10`. The value of `n` can be up to `10^18`, so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the number of iterations will be small (around 90 for `10^18`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # dp[k] represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to play k games.\n    # dp[0] (conceptual) = 1 player\n    # dp[1] = 2 players (winner plays 1 game, beats 1 opponent)\n    # dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n    # This sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which are Fibonacci numbers F_{k+2}\n    # where F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n\n    # f_prev will store dp[k-2] (or F_{k})\n    # f_curr will store dp[k-1] (or F_{k+1})\n    # We start with dp[0] and dp[1] to calculate dp[2]\n    # Initial state:\n    # f_prev corresponds to dp[0] = F_2 = 1\n    # f_curr corresponds to dp[1] = F_3 = 2\n    f_prev = 1  # Represents F_2, which is dp[0] if we extend the definition\n    f_curr = 2  # Represents F_3, which is dp[1]\n    \n    # winner_games tracks the 'k' for the current f_curr value\n    # When f_curr is dp[1] (2 players), winner_games is 1\n    winner_games = 1\n\n    # We want to find the largest 'winner_games' such that dp[winner_games] <= n\n    while f_curr <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number (dp[current_k + 1])\n        next_f = f_prev + f_curr\n        \n        # Update for the next iteration\n        f_prev = f_curr\n        f_curr = next_f\n        \n        # Increment the number of games played by the winner\n        winner_games += 1\n    \n    # After the loop, f_curr is the first dp value that exceeds n.\n    # This means the last valid number of games was 'winner_games - 1'.\n    print(winner_games - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
