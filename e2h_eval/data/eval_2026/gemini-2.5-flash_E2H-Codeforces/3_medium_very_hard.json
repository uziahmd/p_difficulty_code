Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solution Strategy: Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core idea is pretty straightforward: we need to figure out the *minimum* radius (`d`) for the lanterns to illuminate the entire street.  Thinking about it, the street is a simple line from 0 to `l`. We've got `n` lanterns at positions `a_i`. Each lantern shines in a range `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nMy approach:\n1.  **Understand the problem:** We have a street of length `l`, and lanterns scattered along it. We need the smallest `d` (the \"radius\") such that the entire street from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\n2.  **Constraints check:**  I've noted the constraints (1 <= n <= 1000; 1 <= l <= 10^9; 0 <= ai <= l). These constraints are important for choosing the right algorithm and data types.\n\n3.  **Sort and conquer:** Sorting the lantern positions (`a_i`) is key. Let's arrange them as `a_1, a_2, ... a_n`. This simplifies the problem into three cases:\n    *   **The beginning:**  The point 0 has to be covered. The distance from 0 to the first lantern determines the minimum radius needed. If `a_1 > 0`, that minimum radius is `a_1`.\n    *   **The end:** The point `l` has to be covered. Similarly, the distance from the last lantern to `l` dictates the radius needed there ( `l - a_n` ).\n    *   **The gaps:**  Between any two adjacent lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, there is a gap that needs to be illuminated. We need to determine the maximum required radius to cover any gap.\n\n4.  **Covering Gaps**: We need that the light range of the lantern `a_i` plus `d` at its right edge covers `a_{i+1}`'s light range: `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} -d`, which is the same as `2 * d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, meaning `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. The maximum of all these gap values will determine `max_gap_d`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required `d`:** So, the overall minimum `d` is the *maximum* of three values:\n    *   `max_gap_d` (from the gaps)\n    *   `a_1` (from the left end)\n    *   `l - a_n` (from the right end).\n\n6.  **Code and Accuracy**: The code will do this in the following way:\n    1.  Read in `n` and `l`.\n    2.  Read and sort the positions of the `n` lanterns.\n    3.  Iterate through the sorted positions to find `max_gap_d`.\n    4.  Find the distance to the left and right ends.\n    5.  Compute and print the result, making sure to use `float` in the calculation and format the output with the required 10 decimal places.\n\nI've tested the logic with edge cases (`n=1`, lanterns at the ends, multiple lanterns at the same location, all lanterns at same location) and some examples. I'm reasonably confident in this approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, located at given points `a_i` on a street of length `l` (from 0 to `l`), illuminate the entire street. Each lantern at `a_i` with radius `d` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo ensure the entire street `[0, l]` is lit, we need to consider three types of segments that must be covered:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The point `0` must be lit. If the first lantern (after sorting) is at `a_0`, its light must extend at least to `0`. This means `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. So, the minimum `d` required for the left end is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street:** The point `l` must be lit. If the last lantern (after sorting) is at `a_{n-1}`, its light must extend at least to `l`. This means `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. So, the minimum `d` required for the right end is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting), the segment between them must be covered. The lantern at `a_i` covers up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` covers from `a_{i+1} - d`. To completely cover the gap, these two ranges must meet or overlap, i.e., `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum of these `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` values across all adjacent pairs of lanterns.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions `a_i`.\n3.  Sort the lantern positions in ascending order. Let the sorted positions be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n4.  Calculate `max_gap_d`: Initialize `max_gap_d = 0.0`. Iterate from `i = 0` to `n - 2`. For each pair `(a_i, a_{i+1})`, calculate the required `d` as `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.0`. Update `max_gap_d` to be the maximum of its current value and this newly calculated `d`.\n5.  Calculate `left_end_d`: This is simply `a_0` (the distance from 0 to the first lantern).\n6.  Calculate `right_end_d`: This is `l - a_{n-1}` (the distance from the last lantern to `l`).\n7.  The minimum `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum of `max_gap_d`, `left_end_d`, and `right_end_d`.\n8.  Print this result formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\n**Example (Second Sample):**\n`n = 2, l = 5`\n`a = [2, 5]`\n\n1.  Sorted `a = [2, 5]`.\n2.  `max_gap_d`: Only one gap between `a_0=2` and `a_1=5`.\n    `gap = 5 - 2 = 3`. Required `d` for this gap is `3 / 2.0 = 1.5`. So, `max_gap_d = 1.5`.\n3.  `left_end_d`: `a_0 = 2`. So, `left_end_d = 2.0`.\n4.  `right_end_d`: `l - a_{n-1} = 5 - 5 = 0`. So, `right_end_d = 0.0`.\n5.  `result_d = max(1.5, 2.0, 0.0) = 2.0`.\nOutput: `2.0000000000`\n\nThis approach correctly accounts for all parts of the street and finds the single minimum `d` that satisfies all conditions. The time complexity is dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`, and the space complexity is `O(N)` for storing lantern positions. Given `N <= 1000`, this is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and l from the first line of input\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the lantern positions from the second line of input\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily find gaps and endpoints\n    a.sort()\n\n    # --- Calculate the maximum radius needed to cover gaps between lanterns ---\n    max_gap_d = 0.0\n    # Iterate through adjacent pairs of lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        # The distance between two adjacent lanterns\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        # To cover this gap, each lantern needs to extend its light radius by at least half the gap.\n        # We take the maximum of these required radii for all gaps.\n        max_gap_d = max(max_gap_d, gap / 2.0)\n\n    # --- Calculate the radius needed to cover the left end of the street (from 0 to a[0]) ---\n    # The first lantern is at a[0].
