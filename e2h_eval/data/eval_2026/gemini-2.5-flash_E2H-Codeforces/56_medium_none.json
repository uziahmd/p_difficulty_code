Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solution Walkthrough: Guard Duty (Easy)**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this problem. It seems manageable with the small constraints provided.\n\nFirst off, it's clear that the number of rebel spaceships (`R`) and bases (`B`) must be equal, otherwise, there's no way to create a perfect matching, right? So, I'll check for `R != B` right at the start. If they aren't equal, I can immediately print \"No\" and quit.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in ensuring that the connecting paths (segments) from bases to assigned spaceships don't intersect. Since the constraints are small (`R, B <= 10`), it suggests that brute force (trying all permutations) might be the way to go. Given the guarantee that no three points are on the same line, the intersection check should be simplified.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read the number of rebels and bases, and their coordinates.\n2.  **Initial Check:** If `R != B`, print \"No\" and return.\n3.  **Permutations:** Generate all possible permutations of the base assignments to the rebels. Since `R` is small (up to 10), this `R!` calculation is fine.\n4.  **Intersection Check:** For each permutation (pairing of rebel-base connections), iterate through all pairs of segments. Use the standard computational geometry method with cross products to determine if two segments intersect. The guarantee that no three points are collinear means I can use the sign of the cross product for orientation. I don't need to handle cases where three points are on the same line. If any pair of segments intersect for a permutation, mark that matching as invalid.\n5.  **Output:** If I find a permutation with no intersections, print \"Yes\" and return. If I go through all permutations and none are valid, print \"No.\"\n\nFor the segment intersection check, I'll write a helper function `do_segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`. This function is the cornerstone of the solution, where `p1q1` and `p2q2` are the two segments. This function returns `True` if the segments strictly intersect, and `False` if they don't. Given that no three points are collinear, I don't need to handle overlapping or collinear edge cases.\n\nI'm thinking to use the \"ccw\" (counter-clockwise) function that calculates the orientation of three points by finding the sign of the cross product `(q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])`. This is much simpler than handling all intersection scenarios. To check intersection, I'll verify if the orientation tests of `p1` and `q1` relative to `p2q2` differ, and likewise with `p2` and `q2` relative to `p1q1`.\n\nThe time complexity will be `O(R! * R^2)`. Given `R <= 10`, `10!` is around 3.6 million, and checking pairs of segments within each permutation is manageable. The python solution with all the checking has enough runtime to finish in most cases, or I'll try it with optimized python.\n\nOkay, let's implement this, and with some luck, I'll solve it efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two connecting paths (straight line segments) intersect. We are given the coordinates of all spaceships and bases. The constraints are `1 <= R, B <= 10`, and coordinates are integers within `|x|, |y| <= 10000`. It's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.\n\n**1. Initial Check: Number of Points**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships (`R`) must be equal to the number of bases (`B`). If `R != B`, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, so we immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Approach for Small N (R=B=N)**\nSince `N` is very small (up to 10), we can explore all possible perfect matchings. The number of ways to pair `N` Rebel spaceships with `N` bases is `N!` (N factorial).\nFor `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`. This number is small enough to iterate through.\n\nFor each possible matching:\n*   It consists of `N` line segments, where each segment connects a Rebel spaceship to an assigned base.\n*   We need to check if any two of these `N` segments intersect.\n*   The number of pairs of segments is `N * (N-1) / 2`. For `N=10`, this is `10 * 9 / 2 = 45` pairs.\n*   Checking if two segments intersect takes constant time using a geometric cross-product approach.\n\nThe total complexity will be roughly `N! * N^2`, which for `N=10` is approximately `3.6 * 10^6 * 45` operations, or about `1.6 * 10^8` operations. This should be acceptable within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n\n**3. Segment Intersection Check**\nThe core of the problem is the `do_segments_intersect` function. Given two segments `p1q1` and `p2q2`, they intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p2q2`.\n2.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p1q1`.\n\nThis can be checked using the orientation of triplets of points, typically determined by the sign of a 2D cross product.\n\nLet `ccw(p, q, r)` be a function that calculates `(q_x - p_x) * (r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y) * (r_x - p_x)`.\n*   If `ccw(p, q, r) > 0`, `r` is counter-clockwise to vector `pq`.\n*   If `ccw(p, q, r) < 0`, `r` is clockwise to vector `pq`.\n*   If `ccw(p, q, r) = 0`, `p, q, r` are collinear.\n\nSince the problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", `ccw` will never return 0 for any three distinct points. This simplifies the intersection logic significantly, as we don't need to handle edge cases like collinear segments or endpoints lying on other segments.\n\nThe `do_segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)` function will work as follows:\n*   Calculate `o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)`\n*   Calculate `o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)`\n*   Calculate `o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)`\n*   Calculate `o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)`\n\nThe segments `p1q1` and `p2q2` intersect if `(o1 > 0) != (o2 > 0)` (meaning `o1` and `o2` have different signs) AND `(o3 > 0) != (o4 > 0)` (meaning `o3` and `o4` have different signs). This condition correctly identifies strict intersections.\n\n**4. Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read `R` Rebel spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  Let `N = R`.\n6.  Generate all permutations of indices `0` to `N-1`. Each permutation `p` represents an assignment: `rebels[i]` is connected to `bases[p[i]]`.\n7.  For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Construct the `N` segments for this matching: `[(rebels[i], bases[p[i]]) for i in range(N)]`.\n    b.  Assume `is_valid_matching = True`.\n    c.  Iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(segment_A, segment_B)` from the current matching.\n    d.  If `do_segments_intersect(segment_A.p1, segment_A.q1, segment_B.p1, segment_B.q1)` returns `True`, then set `is_valid_matching = False` and break from the inner loops (this matching is invalid).\n    e.  If `is_valid_matching` is still `True` after checking all pairs, then a valid non-intersecting matching has been found. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n8.  If the loop finishes without finding any valid matching, print \"No\".\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`R=3, B=3`\n`rebels = [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]`\n`bases = [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]`\n\nOne permutation of base indices is `p = (0, 1, 2)`. This means:\n*   `R1(0,0)` connects to `B1(-2,1)` (Segment A)\n*   `R2(2,0)` connects to `B2(0,3)` (Segment B)\n*   `R3(3,1)` connects to `B3(2,2)` (Segment C)\n\nCheck pairs:\n*   A vs B: `ccw((0,0),(-2,1),(2,0))` is negative. `ccw((0,0),(-2,1),(0,3))` is negative. Same signs, no intersection.\n*   A vs C: `ccw((0,0),(-2,1),(3,1))` is negative. `ccw((0,0),(-2,1),(2,2))` is negative. Same signs, no intersection.\n*   B vs C: `ccw((2,0),(0,3),(3,1))` is negative. `ccw((2,0),(0,3),(2,2))` is negative. Same signs, no intersection.\n\nNo intersections found for this permutation.
