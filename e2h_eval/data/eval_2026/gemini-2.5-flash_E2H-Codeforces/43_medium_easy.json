He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**A Python Script to Validate String Formation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. The user wants me to write a Python script. My task is to determine if a given string, `S`, follows a particular set of rules. I've broken down these rules to ensure a concise, yet detailed, solution.\n\nHere's the gist of it: We've got a string `S`. This string is constructed by a process that includes appending characters in a specific order: first 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's. It's like a building blocks situation, but the count of each kind of building block is important.\n\nThe string starts with a bunch of 'a's, let's call that count `N_a`.  After the 'a's, you append 'b's,  `N_b` of them. So, at this point we have `'a' * N_a + 'b' * N_b`. Importantly, both `N_a` and `N_b` are at least 1, so the string will have both 'a's and 'b's. Finally, some number of 'c's, `N_c`, get appended. The critical condition is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` or `N_b` (or even both).\n\nFor `S` to be valid, it needs to be made up *only* of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's, in that exact order (no 'b' before 'a', etc.).  There must be at least one 'a', one 'b', and also, a valid `S` will have *at least* one 'c' because `N_c` equals either `N_a` or `N_b`.\n\nI'll check for order by iterating through the string, keeping track of where the 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's end.  I'll be counting the 'a's (`count_a`), the 'b's (`count_b`), and the 'c's (`count_c`).\n\nHere's the main algorithm:\n\n1.  **Check the order of characters:** I'll use a `while` loop that iterates the string to find where the 'a's section ends, where 'b' section ends, and where the 'c' section ends. While I'm iterating I can count a, b, and c.\n\n2.  **Count each type of character:**  As I'm checking the order, I'll count each character.\n    If the string is not in the correct order, it's invalid. If it only has 1 or zero a's, or 1 or zero b's, it's invalid. If the number of 'c's isn't equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's, it's also invalid.\n\nHere's how this translates into Python code:  I need a `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` variable to be counted. Then, if all rules are satisfied, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\". This script uses the `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` function for input, as is typical in competitive programming.\n\nI went through a bunch of test cases to verify the logic and refined a few times to get to the robust final state. All of the edge cases are considered and addressed, the logic seems solid. The code should be able to process a single string input as specified in the problem statement. The problem says this can handle inputs of up to 5,000 characters which is well within Python's processing capabilities and my designed logic.\n\nI have it! This should meet the user's needs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down these rules:\n\n1.  **A's step:** A starts with a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. Let this number be `N_a`. The condition is `N_a >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step:** B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of A's string. Let this number be `N_b`. At this point, the string contains `N_a` 'a's followed by `N_b` 'b's. A crucial condition is that at least one 'a' and one 'b' must exist in the string. This means `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step:** C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. Let this number be `N_c`. The string now has the form `N_a` 'a's, followed by `N_b` 'b's, followed by `N_c` 'c's. The condition for C's step is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`.\n\nFrom these rules, we can derive the following conditions for a string `S` to be valid:\n\n*   **Character Order:** The string `S` must consist of all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Any deviation from this order (e.g., 'b' appearing before 'a', 'c' appearing before 'b' or 'a', or any character appearing after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n*   **Minimum Counts:**\n    *   `N_a` (number of 'a's) must be at least 1.\n    *   `N_b` (number of 'b's) must be at least 1.\n    *   Since `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` or `N_b`, and both `N_a` and `N_b` are guaranteed to be at least 1, `N_c` must also be at least 1.\n*   **C's Condition:** The number of 'c's (`N_c`) must be equal to the number of 'a's (`N_a`) or equal to the number of 'b's (`N_b`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can check these conditions by iterating through the string once:\n\n1.  **Count 'a's:** Iterate from the beginning of the string, counting consecutive 'a's. Store this count as `count_a`. Stop when a non-'a' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.\n2.  **Count 'b's:** Continue from where the 'a' counting stopped. Count consecutive 'b's. Store this count as `count_b`. Stop when a non-'b' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.\n3.  **Count 'c's:** Continue from where the 'b' counting stopped. Count consecutive 'c's. Store this count as `count_c`. Stop when a non-'c' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.\n4.  **Order Check:** After these three steps, if we haven't reached the end of the string, it means there are characters remaining that are not 'c's (and appeared after 'b's), or 'a's/ 'b's appeared after 'c's, or some other invalid character/order. In this case, the string is invalid.\n5.  **Minimum Counts Check:** Verify that `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, and `count_c >= 1`. If any of these conditions are false, the string is invalid.\n6.  **C's Condition Check:** Verify that `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`. If this condition is false, the string is invalid.\n7.  If all checks pass, the string is valid.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`S = \"aaabccc\"`):**\n\n1.  `count_a = 3` (for \"aaa\"), `i` is at index 3.\n2.  `count_b = 1` (for \"b\"), `i` is at index 4.\n3.  `count_c = 3` (for \"ccc\"), `i` is at index 7.\n4.  `i == n` (7 == 7), so order is correct.\n5.  `count_a = 3 >= 1` (True), `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True), `count_c = 3 >= 1` (True). Minimum counts are met.\n6.  `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) is True. C's condition is met.\n7.  All conditions met. Print \"YES\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`S = \"bbacc\"`):**\n\n1.  `count_a = 0`, `i` is at index 0 (first char is 'b').\n2.  `count_b = 2` (for \"bb\"), `i` is at index 2.\n3.  `S[2]` is 'a', so `count_c = 0`. `i` remains at index 2.\n4.  `i != n` (2 != 5). Order is incorrect (an 'a' appeared after 'b's). Print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string a constant number of times. The space complexity is O(1).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(S)\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    i = 0\n    # Count 'a's at the beginning of the string\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Count 'b's after all 'a's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Count 'c's after all 'b's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # --- Validity Checks ---\n\n    # 1.
