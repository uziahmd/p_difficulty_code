A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The \"Soft Drinking\" problem is all about maximizing toasts, but with everyone drinking the same amount. The key is identifying the limiting factor – the bottleneck. I need a Python script to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have `n` friends, `k` drink bottles with `l` milliliters each, `c` limes with `d` slices each, and `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `nl` ml of drink and `np` grams of salt per toast.\n\nMy thought process now revolves around calculating the maximum number of toasts each resource allows and then finding the minimum value.\n\nSo, let's break it down resource by resource.\n\n*   **Drink:** Total drink: `k * l`. Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. The maximum toasts based on *total* drink is  `(k * l) / (n * nl)`.\n\n*   **Limes:** Total lime slices: `c * d`. Each friend needs one slice per toast. The maximum toasts from limes is `(c * d) / n`.\n\n*   **Salt:** Total salt: `p`. Each friend needs `np` grams per toast.  The maximum toasts from salt is `p / (n * np)`.\n\nNow, the crucial step: I need to calculate the minimum of these three values. That's the maximum number of toasts the friends can make, given the available resources. All of these calculations require floor division since we can't make fractions of toasts.\n\nI also need to remember that all the resources are divided across the group so the final output, the total number of toasts, has to be a total value and not a number that needs to be multiplied by the number of friends.\n",
