For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Triad Classification: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a triad (a set of three notes) as major, minor, or \"strange\".  This seems straightforward enough. First, I need to represent the notes numerically.  I'll map C to 0, C# to 1, and so on up to B/H as 11. That's a good starting point for calculations.\n\nThe core of this is calculating semitone distances.  The distance between two notes, going up, can be computed using modular arithmetic: `(note2_val - note1_val + 12) % 12`.  This handles the cyclic nature of the notes perfectly.\n\nNow, processing the input: I'll read the three notes, convert them to their numerical representations using the mapping I've defined, and store them in a list or tuple.  That's the setup.\n\nThe classification itself is the meat of the problem. A major triad has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (or 7, really), while a minor triad has 3 and 4 (again, or 7). The trick here is that the set of notes is *unordered*. So, I need to consider all possible orderings of the three input notes.\n\nInstead of brute-forcing all permutations (which is computationally more expensive than necessary), I can optimize the process. Let's call the three notes `a`, `b`, and `c`. The first note, `X`, can be any of these three. Then, I need to figure out which of the remaining two notes, say `Y` and `Z`, gives the correct intervals to satisfy a major or minor triad. The goal is to see if any ordering `(X, Y, Z)` satisfies the major or minor triad definitions. The problem statement guarantees a clear classification, so I expect a unique solution.\n\nThe remaining task is to write some clean and efficient Python code to implement this logic. I will use the mapping, the distance function, and the \"root\" note idea above.\n",
