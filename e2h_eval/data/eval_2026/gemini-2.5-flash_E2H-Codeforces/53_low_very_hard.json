Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: find the longest substring that repeats at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is a key detail.  The input string is made up of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 100. Let's break this down.\n\nMy initial thought is a brute-force approach, which is often a good starting point. I'll iterate through every possible substring of the input string. For each substring, I need to count how many times it appears in the original string. If it appears at least twice, I'll keep track of its length. I'll maintain the maximum length found so far.\n\nFormally, if the string is `s` of length `N`, a substring is `s[i:j+1]` where `0 <= i <= j < N`. The length of this substring is `j - i + 1`.  So, the core of the algorithm is:\n1. Initialize `max_len = 0`.\n2. Iterate `i` from 0 to `N-1`.\n3. Iterate `j` from `i` to `N-1`.\n    a. Let `sub = s[i:j+1]`.\n    b. Let `current_len = j - i + 1`.\n    c. I need a robust method to count the occurrences of `sub` in `s`, *including* overlaps.\n    d. I'll need to manually iterate through `s`, checking for `sub`.\n\nNow, the tricky part is counting those overlapping occurrences. I can't just use `s.count(sub)` because it doesn't handle overlaps correctly.  For example, \"aaaa\".count(\"aa\") gives 2 when I need 3. So, I need to implement my own search.  I'll use `s.find(sub, start_index)` in a loop, incrementing `start_index` by 1 after each match to catch those overlapping cases.  I'll keep a counter and update `max_len` whenever I find a substring that repeats. I'll stop searching for matches as soon as the count hits 2 to save time. This seems like a solid, if potentially not the most optimized, starting point for a Python solution.\n",
