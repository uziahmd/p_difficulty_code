For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Journey to Count Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out how many ways we can pick `c_s` values so that the biggest possible beautiful multiset has exactly `f` elements.  A \"beautiful multiset\" has these prefix-count limits, given by the `c_s` values.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this `c_s` thing does and what makes a multiset \"beautiful.\"  Then I think about maximizing the size of the beautiful multiset given a set of `c_s` values.  My mind goes right to maximizing a sum, which makes me consider max-flow/min-cut problems, but `n` being up to 15 makes me think `2^n` is big and maybe brute-force isn't an option.\n\nSince I'm dealing with binary prefixes, the structure of the prefixes leads me to a binary tree, where each string is represented as a node and related to its children and parents. Constraints like `N(s) <= c_s` are critical here. It seems like the maximum beautiful multiset size is somehow determined by `min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`. I'm starting to get closer, but still need to relate it back to `f`.\n\nThe problem's constraints shape my thought process, leading me to a dynamic programming approach on this binary tree-like structure. My goal is to work out a \"top-down\" recursive formula which calculates the max possible size `N(s)` starting from the leaf (length `n`) nodes.  I realize there are constraints like `max_N(s) = min(c_s, max_N(s0)+max_N(s1))` and I start to derive the formula.  I use an example to help and try to verify the approach.\n\nOkay, I need to figure out a clever way to count combinations of `c_s` that gives me exactly size `f`.  I decide to use dynamic programming again. My state is `dp[d][current_sum]`, which tells me the number of ways, for a node at depth `d`, to reach a sum. It feels a bit clunky, but I keep simplifying.\n\nThe state evolves to `g[d][val]`, which counts valid `c_s'` values associated to string `s` that is the parent of descendants s' of length `d`. The parameter `val` defines the possible size of the beautiful multiset at the given depth in the \"tree\".  This simplifies my recurrence.  The base case is where the string length is `n`, and I can deduce the recursive relation.  At this point, I think the solution is `g[0] + g[1]`.\n\nNow, I analyze the complexity, and this starts to become expensive. I realize I have a convolution-like sum, and I can use NTT. The total time complexity for this solution would be in the range of `n * k * k`.  Since `n=15` and `k=2*10^5`, the runtime complexity seems slow.\n\nI realize I need to optimize, recognizing the convolution and trying to express the solution in polynomial form. I am now at `n*k*log(k)`.   Then I get to the DP and the recurrence: `g[d][val] = H[val]*(k-val+1) + SuffixSum[val+1]`, which are the convolution (H) and suffix sum (SuffixSum) parts. Now, I have to figure out how to put it all together to calculate the number of combinations. My plan is: after calculating all `dp[1]`, I perform another convolution to get the answer. This is my strategy to compute the number of ways the `c_s` values may be chosen.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of `c_s` values.\nLet `N(s)` be the number of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe constraints for a beautiful multiset are:\n1. `N(s) <= c_s` for all `s` of length `1` to `n`.\n2. `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)` for all `s` of length `1` to `n-1`. (Here `s0` means `s` followed by `0`, and `s1` means `s` followed by `1`).\n3. `N(s) >= 0` for all `s`.\nThe total size of the multiset is `N(\"\")` (the count of strings having the empty string as a prefix), which is `N('0') + N('1')`.\n\nWe want to maximize `N('0') + N('1')`. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach on the binary prefix tree.\nLet `max_N(s)` be the maximum possible value for `N(s)` considering only the constraints related to `s` and its descendants.\n- If `|s| = n`: `s` is a string of length `n`. `N(s)` is simply the count of string `s` in the multiset. So `max_N(s) = c_s`.\n- If `|s| < n`: `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`. Also, `N(s) <= c_s`. To maximize `N(s)`, we should maximize `N(s0)` and `N(s1)` independently. So, `max_N(s) = min(c_s, max_N(s0) + max_N(s1))`.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset for a given set of `c_s` values is `max_N('0') + max_N('1')`.\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose `c_s` values such that `max_N('0') + max_N('1') = f`.\nNotice that `c_s <= k`, so `max_N(s) <= k` for any `s` of length `1` to `n`. This implies that `max_N('0')` and `max_N('1')` are both at most `k`. Therefore, their sum `max_N('0') + max_N('1')` is at most `2k`. If `f > 2k`, the answer is `0`.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming on the depth of the binary tree.\nLet `dp[d][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` for all strings `s'` of length `d` to `n` that are descendants of a *single* string `s` of length `d-1`, such that `max_N(s)` (for this `s`) evaluates to `val`.\nThe maximum value for `val` in `dp[d][val]` is `k`.\n\n**Base case: `d = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `max_N(s) = c_s`. To achieve `max_N(s) = val`, we must choose `c_s = val`.\nSince `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is 1 way to choose `c_s = val` if `0 <= val <= k`.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive step: `d` from `n-1` down to `1`**\nTo compute `dp[d][val]`, we consider a string `s` of length `d-1`. We need to assign `c_s` and then recursively assign `c_s'` for descendants of `s0` and `s1`.\n`max_N(s) = min(c_s, max_N(s0) + max_N(s1))`.\nLet `val_s0 = max_N(s0)` and `val_s1 = max_N(s1)`.\nThe number of ways to choose `c_s'` for descendants of `s0` such that `max_N(s0) = val_s0` is `dp[d+1][val_s0]`.\nSimilarly, for `s1`, it's `dp[d+1][val_s1]`.\nLet `S = val_s0 + val_s1`. We need to choose `c_s` such that `min(c_s, S) = val`.\n\nThere are two cases for choosing `c_s`:\n1. If `val = S`: We need `min(c_s, S) = S`, which means `c_s >= S`. The number of choices for `c_s` is `k - S + 1`, provided `S <= k`. If `S > k`, there are no valid choices for `c_s` (because `c_s <= k`).\n2. If `val < S`: We need `min(c_s, S) = val`, which means `c_s = val`. There is only `1` way to choose `c_s` (namely `val`), provided `0 <= val <= k`.\n3. If `val > S`: This case is impossible, as `min(c_s, S)` cannot be greater than `S`.\n\nSo, `dp[d][val]` is the sum over all possible `val_s0` and `val_s1`:\n`dp[d][val] = sum_{val_s0=0}^k sum_{val_s1=0}^k (dp[d+1][val_s0] * dp[d+1][val_s1] * ways_to_choose_c_s(val, val_s0 + val_s1))`.\n\nThis sum can be optimized using polynomial multiplication (NTT/FFT).\nLet `P_{d+1}(x)` be the generating function for `dp[d+1]`: `P_{d+1}(x) = sum_{v=0}^k dp[d+1][v] x^v`.\nThen `P_{d+1}(x)^2 = sum_S (sum_{v0+v1=S} dp[d+1][v0] * dp[d+1][v1]) x^S`.\nLet `H[S] = sum_{v0+v1=S} dp[d+1][v0] * dp[d+1][v1]`. `H` can be computed using NTT in `O(K log K)` time. The maximum value for `S` is `2k`.\nNow, the transition for `dp[d][val]` becomes:\nFor `0 <= val <= k`:\n`dp[d][val] = (H[val] * max(0, k - val + 1)) % MOD` (from case 1, where `val = S`).\n`dp[d][val] = (dp[d][val] + sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} H[S] * 1) % MOD` (from case 2, where `val < S`).\n\nThe suffix sum `sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} H[S]` can be precomputed. Let `SuffixSum[X] = sum_{S=X}^{2k} H[S]`.\n`SuffixSum[2k+1] = 0`.\n`SuffixSum[X] = (SuffixSum[X+1] + H[X]) % MOD` for `X` from `2k` down to `0`.\nThen, for `0 <= val <= k`:\n`dp[d][val] = (H[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffixSum[val+1]) % MOD`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[1]`, we need to find the total number of ways to choose `c_s` for strings of length `1` to `n` such that `max_N('0') + max_N('1') = f`.\nThis is `sum_{v0+v1=f} (dp[1][v0] * dp[1][v1])`.\nThis is again a convolution: `(dp[1] * dp[1])[f]`.\nWe compute `H_final[F] = sum_{v0+v1=F} dp[1][v0] * dp[1][v1]` using NTT.\nThe final answer is `H_final[f]`.\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n2. Iterate `d` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n   a. Compute `H = dp[d+1] * dp[d+1]` using NTT. This gives `H[S]` for `0 <= S <= 2k`.\n   b. Compute `SuffixSum[X]` for `X` from `2k` down to `0`.\n   c. For `0 <= val <= k`: `dp[d][val] = (H[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffixSum[val+1]) % MOD`.\n3. Compute `H_final = dp[1] * dp[1]` using NTT. This gives `H_final[F]` for `0 <= F <= 2k`.\n4. The result is `H_final[f]`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `n` iterations for the DP.\n- Each iteration involves one NTT convolution of size up to `2k`. NTT takes `O(K log K)` time.\n- Computing suffix sums and filling `dp[d]` takes `O(K)` time.\n- Final convolution takes `O(K log K)` time.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n * K log K)`.\nGiven `n=15`, `k=2*10^5`, `K log K` is roughly `2*10^5 * 18 = 3.6 * 10^6`.\n`15 * 3.6 * 10^6 = 5.4 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\n**NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) Details:**\n- Modulo `P = 998244353` is a prime.\n- A primitive root modulo `P` is `g = 3`.\n- The maximum size of the polynomial needed for convolution is `2k+1`. We need to pad to the next power of 2, say `M`. `M` can be up to `2 * 2*10^5 = 4*10^5`, so `M = 2^19 = 524288` is sufficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# NTT implementation\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half <<= 1\n        w_n = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            w_n = pow(w_n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half * 2):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n    \n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Pad to next power of 2\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    poly_a = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    poly_b = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n\n    ntt(poly_a, False)\n    ntt(poly_b, False)\n\n    poly_res = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        poly_res[i] = (poly_a[i] * poly_b[i]) % MOD\n    \n    ntt(poly_res, True)\n    \n    return poly_res[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    if f > 2 * k:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # dp[val] stores the number of ways for max_N(s) to be val\n    # for a single string s at current depth.\n    # The depth 'd' is implicit, we update dp iteratively.\n    \n    # Base case: d = n (strings of length n)\n    # max_N(s) = c_s.
