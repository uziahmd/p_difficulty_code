Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**TV Game Python Script Development**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to write a Python script to tackle this \"TV Game\" problem. The core of it seems to be about finding the optimal move sequence for Homer and Marge to maximize their combined score, given the initial number A.\n\n**Understanding the Game**\n\nSo, we have a number 'A' with an even number of digits (2n, to be exact), and two players: Homer and Marge. They take turns pulling the leftmost digit from 'A' and appending it to their own numbers (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2.  The output should be a sequence of 'H' and 'M' characters representing each player's moves.\n\n**Constraints & Examples**\n\nThe number of digits (2n) is limited to 18, so that hints at a practical limit on recursion or brute-force approaches if needed. The input 'A' can have leading zeroes, so I'll need to account for that.\n\nThe examples are helpful.  In the \"1234\" case, 'HHMM' seems to be a solution. I also saw that 'MMHH' provides the same result. The key is that the sequence itself determines the outcome.  In the \"9911\" example, 'HMHM' gives the maximum score.\n\n**Approach**\n\nGiven the small constraint of 'n' at most 18, it's worth exploring the concept of dynamic programming and recursion with memoization. A straightforward approach would involve trying all possible sequences of 'H' and 'M' (which could be factorial time complexity: 2^(2n)). That approach, though, could very quickly lead to an explosion in computational expense as 'n' gets larger.\n\nSince the order matters, and each move impacts the possible moves in subsequent turns, I'll need to explore every valid sequence.  I need to find a way to efficiently calculate the score for a given sequence. I can definitely build a recursive function to check possibilities, caching results using memoization, or using dynamic programming approach.\n\nI need to make sure to handle edge cases and consider how to structure the code for clarity and efficiency. I'll need to handle the calculation of S1 and S2 at each step.\n",
