Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Minimizing Array Instability**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this array stabilization problem, and my main focus is on finding the smallest possible instability after removing a single element. I need a Python script to do this.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nRight off the bat, I know instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. My goal is clear: remove one element from the array to get the smallest possible difference between the new max and min.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\nThe input array has a specific size range, and the values within it are also within a known bound. I need to keep this in mind.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nI've already run through the provided examples, which are helpful. Removing elements from the array affects the min and max, and the instability changes accordingly. This confirms my understanding.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nThe heart of this problem lies in recognizing that to minimize instability, I need to make the new maximum as small as possible and the new minimum as large as possible. If I were to remove an element in the middle, it wouldn't change the max or min values. So, it appears that I only have to consider removing the min or the max element in the given array.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf I sort the array, the original smallest is at the first index, and the original largest is at the last index. If I take out an element that isn't the smallest or largest, the max and min values remain the same and the instability is still the same.\n*   Removing the smallest element means the new minimum will be the next smallest value, and the maximum will stay the same.\n*   Removing the largest element means the maximum becomes the next largest, and the minimum will stay the same.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTherefore, to find the minimum instability, I only need to consider these two scenarios:\n1.  Remove the smallest element: calculate `max - second_smallest`.\n2.  Remove the largest element: calculate `second_largest - min`.\n\nAnd the final answer will be the smaller of these two values. That seems pretty straightforward. I think I'm ready to write the script.\n",
