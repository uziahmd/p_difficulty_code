Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Dynamic Programming Approach to Morse Code Sequences**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. I've got a growing string `S`, built character by character with '0's and '1's. The goal is to calculate, after each append, the number of *distinct* English letter sequences representable as substrings of `S`, modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's clarify. There are 26 valid Morse codes (strings of '0's and '1's) corresponding to English letters (length 1-4). And the key here is we're counting sequences, not individual letters.\n\nMy strategy? Dynamic programming! I'll define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct sequences possible using the substring of `S` starting at index `i` *and including all characters after i*. After each append, I need to recalculate. The \"trick\" here is that `dp[i]` actually counts sequences that start *at index i* as well as all possible combinations of parsing the substring.\n\nHere's the plan. When string `S` becomes length `k`, I compute the dp table for the entire string.\nFor a given substring, I'll count the number of ways to parse that substring into a sequence of English letters. And for each new string, I just need to update the dp table. I'm going to make the function `dp[i] = sum(1 + dp[i+L])` for all possible lengths L = 1 to 4, where `S[i:i+L]` is a valid Morse code. We need to do this for the full string because a given sequence can be formed by a substring, even if the parsing starts from a later point in time.\n\nThe total count, after adding a character, will be simply `dp[0]` for the entire new string.\n\nLet's do this!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by the current string `S` in Morse code, after each character is appended to `S`. The count should be reported modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nLet's first understand the Morse code rules:\n1.  Dots are '0', dashes are '1'.\n2.  English letters are represented by strings of length 1 to 4.\n3.  There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` possible strings of length 1 to 4.\n4.  Four specific strings do not correspond to any English letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n5.  The remaining `30 - 4 = 26` strings each correspond to a distinct English letter.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in interpreting \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of `S`\". The example clarifies this: for `S = \"111\"`, the distinct sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", totaling 7. Notice that \"T\" corresponds to \"1\", \"M\" to \"11\", and \"O\" to \"111\".\n*   \"T\" is from \"1\".\n*   \"M\" is from \"11\".\n*   \"O\" is from \"111\".\n*   \"TT\" is from \"1\" + \"1\" (which forms \"11\").\n*   \"TM\" is from \"1\" + \"11\" (which forms \"111\").\n*   \"MT\" is from \"11\" + \"1\" (which forms \"111\").\n*   \"TTT\" is from \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (which forms \"111\").\n\nThis implies that we are looking for the total number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing the *entire string `S`*. If a sequence `X` can be formed by `S`, it is counted once, regardless of how many different ways `S` can be parsed to form `X`. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using the suffix `S[i:]` (i.e., the substring of `S` starting at index `i`).\nTo calculate `dp[i]`:\nWe iterate through possible lengths `L` from 1 to 4.\nIf the substring `S[i : i+L]` (of length `L`) is a valid Morse code for an English letter (let's say letter `X`):\n1.  The letter `X` itself forms a sequence. This contributes `1` to the count.\n2.  If `S[i+L:]` can form `K` distinct sequences (i.e., `dp[i+L]`), then `X` followed by each of those `K` sequences also forms a distinct sequence. This contributes `dp[i+L]` to the count.\nSo, for each valid `S[i : i+L]`, it contributes `(1 + dp[i+L])` to `dp[i]`.\nThe total `dp[i]` is the sum of these contributions for all valid `L`.\n\nThe base case for the DP is `dp[len(S)] = 0`, as an empty string cannot form any sequences.\nThe recurrence relation is:\n`dp[i] = (sum from L=1 to 4, where S[i:i+L] is a valid Morse code) of (1 + dp[i+L])`\nAll calculations should be done modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThe final answer for a given string `S` is `dp[0]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Precompute the set of valid Morse codes. We can use a hash set for quick lookups.\n    `valid_codes = set()`\n    `invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n    For `L` from 1 to 4:\n        Generate all `2^L` binary strings of length `L`.\n        If a string `code` is not in `invalid_codes`, add `code` to `valid_codes`.\n\n2.  Initialize an empty string `S`.\n3.  Initialize `dp` array of size `m+1` (where `m` is the maximum length of `S`).\n4.  For each of the `m` modifications:\n    a.  Read the character (`'0'` or `'1'`) and append it to `S`.\n    b.  Let `N` be the current length of `S`.\n    c.  Set `dp[N] = 0`.\n    d.  Iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        `current_dp_value = 0`\n        Iterate `L` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `i + L <= N`:\n                Let `substring = S[i : i+L]`.\n                If `substring` is in `valid_codes`:\n                    `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[i+L]) % MOD`\n        `dp[i] = current_dp_value`\n    e.  Print `dp[0]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description): `S=\"111\"`**\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`valid_codes` will contain \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", ..., \"111\" (all length 1-3) and 12 codes of length 4.\n\n**Step 1: Append '1'. `S=\"1\"`. `N=1`.**\n`dp` array (size `m+1`, for `m=3000`): `[?, ?, ..., ?, 0]` (initially `dp[1]=0`)\n`i = 0`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[0:1]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\n  `L = 2, 3, 4`: `i+L > N`, so these substrings are out of bounds.\n`dp[0] = 1`.\nOutput: `1`\n\n**Step 2: Append '1'. `S=\"11\"`. `N=2`.**\n`dp` array: `[?, ?, 0, ?, ..., ?]` (initially `dp[2]=0`)\n`i = 1`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[1:2]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\n  `L = 2, 3, 4`: `i+L > N`.\n`dp[1] = 1`.\n`i = 0`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[0:1]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n  `L = 2`: `S[0:2]` is \"11\". \"11\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (2 + 1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 3`.\n  `L = 3, 4`: `i+L > N`.\n`dp[0] = 3`.\nOutput: `3`\n\n**Step 3: Append '1'. `S=\"111\"`. `N=3`.**\n`dp` array: `[?, ?, ?, 0, ?, ..., ?]` (initially `dp[3]=0`)\n`i = 2`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[2:3]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[3]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\n  `L = 2, 3, 4`: `i+L > N`.\n`dp[2] = 1`.\n`i = 1`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[1:2]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n  `L = 2`: `S[1:3]` is \"11\". \"11\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (2 + 1 + dp[3]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 3`.\n  `L = 3, 4`: `i+L > N`.\n`dp[1] = 3`.\n`i = 0`:\n  `L = 1`: `S[0:1]` is \"1\". \"1\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (0 + 1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\n  `L = 2`: `S[0:2]` is \"11\". \"11\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (4 + 1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (4 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 6`.\n  `L = 3`: `S[0:3]` is \"111\". \"111\" is valid.\n    `current_dp_value = (6 + 1 + dp[3]) % MOD = (6 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 7`.\n  `L = 4`: `i+L > N`.\n`dp[0] = 7`.\nOutput: `7`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Precomputation: Generating `2^1 + ... + 2^4 = 30` strings and adding to a set is constant time.\n*   Main loop: `m` iterations.\n    *   Appending character to `S`: `O(1)` (if `S` is a list of characters) or `O(N)` (if `S` is a string and reallocated). Python strings are immutable, so `S += char` is `O(N)`. Using a list of characters for `S` and `\"\".join(S[i:i+L])` for substring extraction is better.\n    *   DP calculation: For each `N`, we iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0` (`N` times). Inside, we iterate `L` from `1` to `4` (constant 4 times). Substring extraction `S[i:i+L]` takes `O(L)` time. Set lookup takes `O(L)` on average (due to string hashing). So, `O(N * 4 * L_max) = O(N)`.\n    *   Total time complexity: `sum_{N=1 to m} O(N) = O(m^2)`.\n    *   `m = 3000`, so `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n*   Space complexity: `O(m)` for `S` and `dp` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes\n    valid_codes = set()\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        # Generate all binary strings of current length\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            code = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length) # Convert int to binary string, pad with leading zeros\n            if code not in invalid_codes:\n                valid_codes.add(code)\n\n    # S will be stored as a list of characters for efficient appending\n    S_chars = []\n    # dp[i] stores the number of distinct sequences for S[i:]\n    # Max length of S is m, so dp array needs m+1 elements.\n    # dp[N] will always be 0.\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1) \n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char_to_append = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S_chars.append(char_to_append)\n        N = len(S_chars) # Current length of S\n\n        # dp[N] is always 0 (base case for empty suffix)\n        dp[N] = 0 \n\n        # Calculate dp values from right to left (N-1 down to 0)\n        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n            current_dp_value = 0\n            # Try substrings of length 1 to 4 starting at i\n            for L in range(1, 5):\n                if i + L <= N: # Check if substring is within bounds\n                    substring = \"\".join(S_chars[i : i + L])\n                    if substring in valid_codes:\n                        # If S[i:i+L] is a valid letter, it contributes:\n                        # 1 (for the letter itself)\n                        # + dp[i+L] (for sequences starting with this letter and continuing)\n                        current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1 + dp[i+L]) % MOD\n            dp[i] = current_dp_value\n        \n        sys.stdout.write(str(dp[0]) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
