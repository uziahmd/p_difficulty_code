She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Browser\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming. The core idea is to efficiently close tabs outside a given range, `[l, r]`. I'm given the total number of tabs (`n`), the initial cursor position (`pos`), and the bounds `l` and `r`. My goal is to minimize the time (in seconds) required to have only the tabs within `[l, r]` open.\n\nI've broken down the operations: I can move the cursor left or right (1 second each), and close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also 1 second). Initially, the range of open tabs is from `1` to `n`.\n\nNow, let's look at the different scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Everything's already perfect.** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, I'm done – no tabs need closing, and the cost is 0. Easy!\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Close tabs to the left.** If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is `n`, I only need to close tabs from 1 to `l-1`. The fastest way is to move the cursor to position `l` and close those tabs. The time here is simply the distance between the current cursor position and `l`, plus 1 second for the closing operation. So, `abs(pos - l) + 1` is the cost.\n\n*   **Scenario 3: Close tabs to the right.** If `l` is 1 and `r` is less than `n`, I need to close tabs from `r+1` to `n`. This is analogous to the previous scenario. I move the cursor to `r` and close the tabs to the right. The cost is `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n*   **Scenario 4: Close tabs on both sides.** This is the general case where `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is less than `n`. I've got to figure out the most efficient way to close tabs on both sides. I'll need to explore how to combine the logic from scenarios 2 and 3 to find an optimal solution here. The challenge is to determine the most cost-effective cursor movement strategy to reach the relevant tab boundaries.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). The cursor starts at `pos`. Each move (left or right) takes 1 second. Each close operation (all tabs left of cursor or all tabs right of cursor) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs to close:**\n    If `l = 1` and `r = n`, all tabs are within the desired range. No operations are needed.\n    Time: `0`\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must be moved to `l`, and then the \"close left\" operation is performed.\n    The time taken will be `abs(pos - l)` (to move the cursor to `l`) + `1` (to close tabs `[1, l-1]`).\n    Time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must be moved to `r`, and then the \"close right\" operation is performed.\n    The time taken will be `abs(pos - r)` (to move the cursor to `r`) + `1` (to close tabs `[r+1, n]`).\n    Time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides (`[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`) need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to perform two close operations: one at `l` (to close `[1, l-1]`) and one at `r` (to close `[r+1, n]`).\n    There are two main strategies:\n\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n        Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n        Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n    The minimum time for this case is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n    This can also be thought of as: move to `l` or `r` (whichever is closer to `pos`), perform one close operation, then move to the other end of the `[l, r]` segment, and perform the second close operation. The total moves will be `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l)`. The two close operations add `2` seconds.\n\n**Combined Logic:**\n\nWe can use conditional statements to cover all these cases:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Case 1: No tabs to close\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\n# Case 2: Only left side needs closing\nelif l == 1:\n    # Cursor needs to go to r, then close right\n    # Time = moves from pos to r + 1 (close op)\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n# Case 3: Only right side needs closing\nelif r == n:\n    # Cursor needs to go to l, then close left\n    # Time = moves from pos to l + 1 (close op)\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n# Case 4: Both sides need closing\nelse:\n    # Option 1: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right\n    # Time = abs(pos - l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (move l to r) + 1 (close right)\n    # Option 2: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left\n    # Time = abs(pos - r) + 1 (close right) + (r - l) (move r to l) + 1 (close left)\n    # The minimum of these two is:\n    # min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2)\n\n```",
