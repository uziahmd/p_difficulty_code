Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Determining an 'X' Pattern in a Character Grid**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to analyze a character grid and see if it forms a specific 'X' pattern.  The input is an `n x n` grid, where `n` is odd and between 3 and 299.  I need to check if the diagonals have the same character, the non-diagonals have the same character, and crucially, those two characters are different.\n\nMy approach is pretty straightforward. First, I'll read in the grid dimensions, `n`, and then read in the grid itself as a 2D list.  I'll need to keep track of two characters: `diag_char` for the diagonals and `other_char` for the rest of the cells. I'll also use a boolean flag, `is_x`, initialized to `True`, which I'll flip to `False` if I encounter a violation of the 'X' rules.\n\nI'll iterate through each cell of the grid.  For each cell, I'll first determine if it lies on a diagonal.  If it does, I'll compare its character to `diag_char`. If `diag_char` hasn't been set yet, I'll assign the current cell's character to it.  If it's already set and the characters don't match, I immediately set `is_x` to `False` and break the loop since the pattern is violated.\n\nSimilarly, if a cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll compare it to `other_char`, setting it if it's the first non-diagonal character I've seen, and setting `is_x` to `False` and breaking if it doesn't match the existing `other_char`.\n\nAfter iterating through the whole grid, I'll have to make one last check: if `is_x` is still `True`, I need to confirm that `diag_char` is actually *different* from `other_char`. If they're the same, it's not an 'X', and I'll set `is_x` to `False`.\n\nFinally, I'll just print \"YES\" if `is_x` is `True`, and \"NO\" otherwise. This seems like a pretty efficient way to do it, avoiding unnecessary iterations if the pattern is broken early.\n",
