Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given rebel spaceships and bases, and the goal is to find an assignment where each ship goes to exactly one base, and the paths don't cross. The key here is the small input size, which heavily suggests a brute-force approach.  Since the number of spaceships and bases must be equal, we can start there. If the counts don't match, we immediately output \"No\" and move on.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in efficiently checking for intersecting line segments. This calls for some geometric primitives. The 2D cross product is perfect for determining the orientation of a point with respect to a line segment. We'll implement a function `orientation` that tells us if a point is to the left, right, or collinear with a directed line.  This function is crucial for checking segment intersections.  Luckily, the problem states that no three points are collinear. This simplifies our intersection check, making it more efficient.\n\nFor a solution, we'll try every possible matching between spaceships and bases. Since the input size is small, `N <= 10`, using `itertools.permutations` is a practical way to generate all these matchings. For each permutation (matching), we'll construct the line segments connecting each ship to its assigned base. Then, we need to efficiently check for intersections between all pairs of segments.  Because `N` is small,  checking all the pairs doesn't blow up the time complexity too much.\n\nTo check for intersection, we'll use the `segments_intersect` function. It takes two line segments as input and uses the `orientation` function to determine if the segments intersect. Because of the constraint \"no three points collinear\", we can use a simplified intersection check. If any pair of segments intersects, the current matching is invalid.\n\nIf a matching is valid (no intersections found), we output \"Yes\" and stop. If we exhaust all permutations and find no valid matching, the answer is \"No\".\n\nLet's code it up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that:\n1.  Every base has exactly one guardian (spaceship) and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. This implies a perfect matching, which is only possible if `R = B`.\n2.  The straight paths (line segments) connecting a spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect each other.\n\nWe are given `R` and `B` up to 10, and coordinates `(x, y)` up to `10000`. It's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.\n\n**Problem Analysis and Approach:**\n\n1.  **Perfect Matching Requirement:** The first condition (each spaceship to one base, each base to one spaceship) means `R` must be equal to `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, so we immediately output \"No\". Let `N = R = B`.\n\n2.  **Non-intersecting Paths:** This is the core geometric constraint. We need a way to check if two line segments intersect.\n    *   **Geometric Primitive: Cross Product / Orientation:** A common technique to check segment intersection is using the 2D cross product to determine the orientation of points. For three points `p1`, `p2`, `p3`:\n        `cross_product(p1, p2, p3) = (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)`\n        *   If `cross_product > 0`, `p3` is to the left (counter-clockwise) of the directed line `p1p2`.\n        *   If `cross_product < 0`, `p3` is to the right (clockwise) of `p1p2`.\n        *   If `cross_product = 0`, `p3` is collinear with `p1` and `p2`.\n    *   **Segment Intersection Check:** Two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if:\n        1.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line `p1q1`.\n        2.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line `p2q2`.\n        The problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line.\" This simplifies the intersection check significantly, as we don't need to handle cases where points are collinear (e.g., segments overlapping or endpoints lying on another segment). In this simplified scenario, `orientation(A, B, C)` will always return `1` or `-1` (never `0`).\n        So, segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if:\n        `(orientation(p1, q1, p2) != orientation(p1, q1, q2))` AND `(orientation(p2, q2, p1) != orientation(p2, q2, q1))`\n\n3.  **Brute-Force Permutations (due to small N):** Since `N` (number of spaceships/bases) is very small (up to 10), we can try every possible perfect matching.\n    *   There are `N!` ways to assign `N` spaceships to `N` bases. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`.\n    *   For each matching, we generate `N` line segments.\n    *   Then, we check all pairs of these `N` segments for intersection. There are `N * (N - 1) / 2` pairs. For `N=10`, this is `45` pairs.\n    *   If any pair intersects, that matching is invalid.\n    *   If all pairs are non-intersecting, we've found a valid matching, so we output \"Yes\" and terminate.\n    *   If we iterate through all `N!` matchings and find none that are valid, we output \"No\".\n\n**Complexity:**\nThe total time complexity will be approximately `N! * (N^2 / 2) * O(1)` (where `O(1)` is for cross product calculation).\nFor `N=10`: `3,628,800 * 45` operations, which is about `1.6 * 10^8`. This is feasible within typical time limits for competitive programming problems (usually 1-2 seconds).\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Read `R` and `B`.\n*   Store spaceship and base coordinates as lists of tuples `(x, y)`.\n*   Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible assignments of bases to spaceships.\n*   Implement `cross_product` and `orientation` helper functions.\n*   Implement `segments_intersect` using the `orientation` function.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to read a point (x, y) from stdin\ndef read_point():\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Computes the 2D cross product of vectors (p1->p2) and (p1->p3).\n# The sign of the result indicates the orientation of p3 with respect to the directed line p1p2.\n# A positive value means p3 is to the left (counter-clockwise turn).\n# A negative value means p3 is to the right (clockwise turn).\n# A zero value means p3 is collinear with p1 and p2.\ndef cross_product(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Determines the orientation of point r with respect to the directed line segment pq.\n# Returns 1 if r is to the left of pq.\n# Returns -1 if r is to the right of pq.\n# Returns 0 if r is collinear with p and q.\n#\n# IMPORTANT: The problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\",\n# so this function will never return 0 for distinct p, q, r.\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = cross_product(p, q, r)\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # This case should not occur due to problem constraints\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\n# Checks if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect.\n# This function relies on the \"no three points are on the same line\" guarantee.\n# With this guarantee, segments intersect if and only if:\n# 1. p2 and q2 are on opposite sides of the line p1q1.\n# 2. p1 and q1 are on opposite sides of the line p2q2.\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) # Orientation of p2 with respect to p1q1\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) # Orientation of q2 with respect to p1q1\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1) # Orientation of p1 with respect to p2q2\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1) # Orientation of q1 with respect to p2q2\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if all orientations are non-zero\n    # and they are on opposite sides.\n    # Due to \"no three points are on the same line\" guarantee, o1, o2, o3, o4 will never be 0.\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = [read_point() for _ in range(R)]\n    bases = [read_point() for _ in range(B)]\n\n    # A perfect matching requires R to be equal to B.\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R # Number of spaceships/bases\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of base assignments.\n    # A permutation `p_indices` means rebel `i` is assigned to base `bases[p_indices[i]]`.\n    for p_indices in itertools.permutations(range(N)):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            # Create a segment from rebel i to its assigned base\n            current_segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p_indices[i]]))\n        \n        is_valid_matching = True\n        # Check all unique pairs of segments for intersection\n        # We need to check (N choose 2) pairs\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N): # Ensures each pair is checked once\n                s1_p1, s1_p2 = current_segments[i]\n                s2_p1, s2_p2 = current_segments[j]\n                \n                if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2):\n                    is_valid_matching = False\n                    break # Found an intersection, this matching is invalid\n            \n            if not is_valid_matching:\n                break # Break from the outer loop (over `i`) as well\n        \n        # If this matching had no intersecting segments, it's a valid solution.\n        if is_valid_matching:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return # Exit immediately after finding the first valid matching\n\n    # If the loop finishes, no valid matching was found among all permutations.\n    print(\"No\")\n\n# Call the main solve function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
