Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Morse Code Problem: A Python Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to handle this Morse Code puzzle.  Let's break down my strategy. The core of the problem lies in efficiently counting valid sequences of English letters within a growing Morse code string.  The input is a series of '0' and '1' appends, and after each append, I need to count these sequences, modulo a large prime.\n\nFirst, I'll need to establish the ground rules.  Morse code representation is simple: '0' is a dot, '1' is a dash. The codes can have lengths from 1 to 4 characters.  There are 30 possible strings of this length, but only 26 of them are valid English letters.  The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\nMy initial thought is to build a set, `VALID_CODES`, containing all the valid Morse code strings.  This is a fundamental data structure for quickly checking code validity.  I'll iterate through all possible strings of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude those four pesky invalid codes.\n\nThe real challenge is the counting. I need to iterate through all possible substrings of the current Morse string `S`. For each substring, I have to determine if it can be broken down into a sequence of valid Morse codes. If it can, I increment the count. Remember, each valid code translates to a single English letter, and these letters need to form a *non-empty* sequence.  We're looking for all possible parses of the substring.\n\nLet's call `S_k` the current Morse string after `k` appends. For each `S_k`, I'll need to compute `ans_k`, the number of valid sequences.  I think a dynamic programming approach might be useful. If a substring is valid at position *i*, then I could build upon it as I scan further into the string. We need to consider all possible parsings of substrings of `S`. \n\nUltimately, for each `S_k`, the answer is the number of valid letter sequences. And of course, I must remember to output this result modulo `10^9 + 7`. Time for some code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0's (dots) or '1's (dashes) one by one. Morse code representations for English letters are strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not correspond to any English letter. All other 26 strings of length 1-4 correspond to distinct English letters. We need to output the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nLet's define the set of `VALID_CODES`: these are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". There are 26 such codes.\n\nThe problem asks for sequences of English letters. If a substring `sub` of `S` can be parsed as `C_1 C_2 ... C_k` where each `C_i` is a `VALID_CODE`, then the sequence of letters corresponding to `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_k)` is a valid sequence. Since each valid code maps to a distinct English letter, we just need to count the number of ways to parse a substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix of `S` starting at index `i` (i.e., `S[i:]`) into a sequence of valid Morse codes. This `dp[i]` value represents the number of letter sequences that can be formed using `S[i:]`.\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, increasing its length to `N`, we are interested in substrings ending at `N-1`.\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[j:]` into valid Morse codes.\nThe total number of sequences of letters for a given `S` would be the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `N-1`. This is because each `dp[j]` counts sequences starting at `S[j]`.\n\nHowever, the problem statement \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" implies we need to consider *all* substrings, not just suffixes.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[0...i]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes, where `S[0...i]` is the entire string `S` up to the current length.\nThis `dp[i]` would count sequences like `(L_1, ..., L_k)` where `C_1...C_k = S[0...i]`.\n\nConsider `f[i]` as the number of ways `S[0...i]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse codes.\n`f[i] = sum(f[i - len(code)] for code in VALID_CODES if S[i - len(code) + 1 : i + 1] == code)`\nBase case: `f[-1] = 1` (representing an empty prefix, which allows starting a new sequence).\nThe total count for `S` would be `sum(f[i])` for all `i`. This still seems to count sequences starting from the beginning of `S`.\n\nThe problem is more subtle: \"sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". This means we need to consider *all possible starting positions* for a sequence of letters within `S`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[i:]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, `dp[i]` is calculated for `i` from `N-1` down to `0`.\n`dp[i] = 0`\nFor each `k` from 1 to 4:\n  If `S[i : i+k]` is a `VALID_CODE`:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter sequence `L(S[i:i+k])`)\n    If `i+k < N`:\n      `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+k]) % MOD` (for sequences starting with `L(S[i:i+k])` followed by sequences from `S[i+k:]`)\n\nThe total answer for `S` of length `N` would be `sum(dp[i] for i in range(N))`.\nLet's trace this.\nWhen `S` grows, say from `S_prev` of length `N-1` to `S_curr` of length `N` by appending `c`.\nThe `dp` values for `i < N-1` remain the same. We only need to compute `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1]` depends on `dp[N]` (which is 0, effectively), `dp[N+1]`, etc.\nSo, `dp[N-1]` is computed based on `S[N-1]`, `S[N-2:N]`, `S[N-3:N]`, `S[N-4:N]`.\nSpecifically, for `S_curr` of length `N`:\n`dp[N-1] = 0`\nFor `k` from 1 to 4:\n  If `N-k >= 0` and `S[N-k : N]` is a `VALID_CODE`:\n    `dp[N-k] = (dp[N-k] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter sequence)\n    If `N-k+1 < N`:\n      `dp[N-k] = (dp[N-k] + dp[N-k+1]) % MOD` (for sequences starting with `L(S[N-k:N])` followed by sequences from `S[N-k+1:]`)\nThis is still recursive on `dp[i]` values.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[i:]` (the suffix starting at index `i`).\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, making its length `N`:\nWe calculate `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1] = 0`\nFor `len = 1, 2, 3, 4`:\n  If `N - len >= 0` and `S[N-len : N]` is a `VALID_CODE`:\n    `dp[N-len] = (dp[N-len] + 1) % MOD` (This counts the single letter `L(S[N-len:N])`)\n    If `N-len < N-1`:\n      `dp[N-len] = (dp[N-len] + dp[N-len+1]) % MOD` (This counts sequences starting with `L(S[N-len:N])` followed by a sequence from `S[N-len+1:]`)\n\nThis `dp[i]` formulation is not standard.\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to parse `S[0...i]` into sequences of letters.\n`dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (dp[i-k] if S[i-k+1...i] is VALID_CODE)`\nBase case: `dp[-1] = 1`.\nThe total answer would be `sum_{j=0 to N-1} dp[j]`. This is also not right.\n\nThe problem is asking for the total number of *non-empty sequences* of English letters that can be represented by *some substring* of `S`.\nLet `ans[i]` be the total count for the string `S` of length `i+1`.\nWhen we append a character to `S`, `S` becomes `S'`.\nThe new sequences are those that involve the newly appended character `S'[N-1]`.\nThese sequences must end at `S'[N-1]`.\nLet `count_ending_at[j]` be the number of sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing substrings of `S` that *end* at index `j`.\nWhen `S` has length `N` (i.e., indices `0` to `N-1`):\n`count_ending_at[N-1] = 0`\nFor `k` from 1 to 4:\n  If `N - k >= 0` and `S[N-k : N]` is a `VALID_CODE`:\n    `current_ways = 1` (for the single letter sequence `L(S[N-k:N])`)\n    If `N - k > 0`:\n      `current_ways = (current_ways + count_ending_at[N-k-1]) % MOD`\n    `count_ending_at[N-1] = (count_ending_at[N-1] + current_ways) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer for `S` of length `N` is `sum(count_ending_at[j] for j in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nLet's trace this `count_ending_at` DP with `S = \"111\"`:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`VALID_CODES = {\"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\", ...}` (excluding the 4 invalid ones).\n\n1.

(Correct)\n\nThis `dp` formulation seems correct. `dp[i]` represents the number of sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing `S[0...i]` and *ending* at `i`. The total answer is the sum of all such `dp[i]` values, as each `dp[i]` contributes sequences ending at `i`. This correctly counts sequences like \"T\" (ending at `S[0]`), \"M\" (ending at `S[1]`), \"O\" (ending at `S[2]`), \"TT\" (ending at `S[1]`), \"TM\" (ending at `S[2]`), \"MT\" (ending at `S[2]`), \"TTT\" (ending at `S[2]`).\n\nImplementation details:\n*   Maintain `S` as a `collections.deque` or `list` to efficiently append characters. Since `m` is up to 3000, `S` can be long, but we only need the last 4 characters for checks.\n*   The `dp` array stores `dp[i]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n*   `total_ans` is a running sum.\n*   Pre-populate the `VALID_CODES` set.\n*   For each new character:\n    1.  Append to `S`. Let `N` be the new length.\n    2.  Calculate `dp[N-1]`. This involves checking substrings `S[N-1:N]`, `S[N-2:N]`, `S[N-3:N]`, `S[N-4:N]`.\n    3.  Add `dp[N-1]` to `total_ans`.\n    4.  Print `total_ans`.\n\n`S` can be represented as a list of characters or a string. Since we only need the last 4 characters, we can use `S[-k:]` for `k=1..4`. Python string slicing is efficient for this.\n`dp` array can be a list. `dp[i]` refers to `S[i]`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Pre-populate VALID_CODES\n    VALID_CODES = set()\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    # Generate all binary strings of length 1 to 4\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            code = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if code not in invalid_codes:\n                VALID_CODES.add(code)\n\n    S = [] # Using a list to represent the growing string S\n    dp = [] # dp[i] stores the number of sequences ending at index i\n    total_ans = 0\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(char)\n        N = len(S) # Current length of S\n\n        current_dp_val = 0\n        # Check substrings of S ending at N-1\n        # Substring lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n            if N - k >= 0: # Check if substring S[N-k : N] is valid\n                sub = \"\".join(S[N-k : N])\n                if sub in VALID_CODES:\n                    if N - k == 0: # The substring is S[0:N], it starts at index 0\n                        current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + 1) % MOD\n                    else: # The substring starts at some index > 0\n                        # Add ways to form sequences ending at N-k-1\n                        current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + dp[N-k-1]) % MOD\n        \n        dp.append(current_dp_val)\n        total_ans = (total_ans + current_dp_val) % MOD\n        sys.stdout.write(str(total_ans) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
