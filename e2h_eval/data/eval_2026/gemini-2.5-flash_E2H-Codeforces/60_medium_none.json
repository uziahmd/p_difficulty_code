Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$.

In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on a Challenging Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem about Morse code. The goal is to figure out the count of non-empty English letter sequences that can be made from the substrings of a string `S`.  The string `S` grows as characters ('0' or '1') are added.  After each addition, I need to report the sequence count, modulo 10^9 + 7.  Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, there's the Morse code itself: dots are '0', dashes are '1', and the code length is between 1 and 4.  We have 30 possible binary strings, with 26 corresponding to English letters, and 4 invalid strings. Each valid string translates to a *distinct* letter.\n\nThe core task is to maintain the string `S` and, after each character append, determine the number of distinct sequences of English letters represented by any substring of `S`. A letter sequence is valid if its Morse code corresponds to some substring of `S`. Remember, sequences like \"TT\" and \"M\" (where \"1\" is 'T' and \"11\" is 'M') are *distinct* even for the same underlying substring.\n\nThe key is defining what a valid decoding is. If `S` is \"111,\" the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". The sequences for this input are \"T,\" \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", and \"TTT.\" This emphasizes the importance of unique sequences, as opposed to simply counting the number of possible decodings for substrings.\n\nLet `valid_codes` represent the set of valid Morse codes.  I can easily define those of lengths 1 to 4 and eliminate the invalid codes.  The problem's asking to *count* the number of sequences, not decode strings.  So, I need an efficient method to count these, and then I'm thinking of dynamic programming. I'll need to use the fact that I only add a single element each time.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode `S[0...i-1]` into letter sequences. This is a common DP approach for string decoding. The initial state `dp[0]` is 1, and I iterate through the string, building `dp[i]` by summing up the valid decodings based on string prefixes of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4, taking the modulo operation.\n\nHowever, the question is not asking to decode the *entire* string `S`.  I want all *substrings* of `S`.  I could iterate through all substrings, count the ways they are decodable, and sum them. Let `count_decodings(sub)` be the number of ways a substring `sub` decodes. Total `count_decodings(S[i..j])` for all substrings `i..j`. But the prompt asks for *non-empty* sequences, so I'm looking at `dp[len(sub)] - 1` when `dp[0]` is defined as 1 (so empty sequences are handled).\n\nThe maximum string length is 3000, so a straightforward triple-nested loop (outer for string position, inner for start and end indexes of substrings) would be too slow.  O(m^4), this definitely needs to be more optimized. Instead, I need to use the fact that I'm incrementally adding one character each time.\n\nSo, when a new character `c` is added to `S`, `S` becomes `S'`. The decodings from the old substrings are still valid, and I just need to consider the new substrings that end at the added character.\n\nLet `ans[k]` be the result after `k` appends. Then `ans[k] = ans[k-1] + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (dp_i[k-i] - 1)` where `dp_i` is the decoding for substring `S[i..k-1]`.\n\nThe key is to calculate this sum of the new suffixes efficiently. Let `dp_suffix[j]` be the decodings for `S_k[j..k-1]`. I'll use the DP approach, iterating backwards. But `dp_suffix[j]` needs to represent the *number* of unique sequences, not simply the total decodings.\n\nI'm starting to think about modifying the definition of my dynamic programming variables to handle only valid sequences. If I define `dp_end[j]` to count only the non-empty decodings for `S_k[j..k-1]`, I can simplify this to `total_ans_k = (total",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of *unique non-empty sequences of English letters* that can be formed by decoding any substring of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) characters one by one. After each append operation, we report the total count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nLet's first define the valid Morse code representations for English letters. These are strings of length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". We can store these invalid codes in a set for quick lookup.\n\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n\nA substring `sub` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` if `sub` can be partitioned into `s_1 s_2 ... s_k` where each `s_p` is a valid Morse code for `L_p`. The problem states we need to count *unique* sequences. For example, if `S = \"11\"`, the substrings are `\"1\"` (at index 0), `\"1\"` (at index 1), and `\"11\"` (at index 0). Let's say \"1\" maps to 'T' and \"11\" maps to 'M'.\n- `S[0..0]=\"1\"` decodes to \"T\".\n- `S[1..1]=\"1\"` decodes to \"T\".\n- `S[0..1]=\"11\"` decodes to \"M\" (using \"11\") and \"TT\" (using \"1\" then \"1\").\nThe set of unique sequences is `{\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}`, so the count is 3. This matches the example.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`. Since sequences of letters can be long (up to `m` letters) and there are `26^m` possible sequences, explicitly storing sequences in a set is not feasible. We need a way to count them without storing them.\n\nThis type of problem, counting unique strings/sequences, often points to using polynomial hashing. Each English letter can be assigned a unique hash value. A sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can then be represented by a polynomial hash: `H(L_1 L_2 ... L_k) = (hash(L_1) * P^(k-1) + hash(L_2) * P^(k-2) + ... + hash(L_k) * P^0) % M`.\nTo minimize collisions, we can use two different prime moduli `M1`, `M2` and two different base values `P1`, `P2`. A sequence is then uniquely identified by a pair of hash values `(H1, H2)`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. We are interested in all substrings `S[i..j]`.\nFor each substring `S[i..j]`, we want to find all unique sequences it can represent.\nLet `dp[idx]` be a set of `(hash1, hash2)` pairs representing unique sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[idx..k-1]`.\n`dp[k]` would contain the hash for the empty sequence (e.g., `(0,0)`).\nFor `idx` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[idx]` is initialized as an empty set.\n  For `len_code` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `idx + len_code <= k` (i.e., `S[idx..idx+len_code-1]` is a valid substring):\n      Let `code_str = S[idx..idx+len_code-1]`.\n      If `code_str` is a valid Morse code (i.e., `code_str` is not in `invalid_codes`):\n        Let `letter_hash = (hash1(code_str), hash2(code_str))`. (We can map each of the 26 valid Morse codes to a unique integer 1-26 and use those integers as letter hashes).\n        For each `(seq_hash1, seq_hash2)` in `dp[idx+len_code]`:\n          If `(seq_hash1, seq_hash2)` represents the empty sequence (e.g., `(0,0)`):\n            Add `letter_hash` to `dp[idx]`.\n          Else:\n            Calculate `new_hash1 = (letter_hash[0] * P1^len(seq) + seq_hash1) % M1`\n            Calculate `new_hash2 = (letter_hash[1] * P2^len(seq) + seq_hash2) % M2`\n            Add `(new_hash1, new_hash2)` to `dp[idx]`.\nThis approach requires tracking the length of the sequence to correctly compute hashes, or using a rolling hash where the new character is appended to the right.\n\nLet `dp[idx]` be a set of `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples, representing sequences that can be formed from `S[idx..k-1]`.\n`dp[k] = { (0, 0, 0) }` (representing the empty sequence with length 0).\nFor `idx` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[idx] = set()`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `idx + L <= k` and `S[idx..idx+L-1]` is a valid Morse code `code_str`:\n      Let `letter_val = get_letter_value(code_str)` (e.g., 1 for 'A', 2 for 'B', etc. We need 26 distinct values)\n      For each `(h1, h2, seq_len)` in `dp[idx+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * pow(P1, seq_len, M1) + h1) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * pow(P2, seq_len, M2) + h2) % M2`\n        `dp[idx].add((new_h1, new_h2, seq_len + 1))`\n\nAfter computing `dp[0], ..., dp[k-1]`, we collect all unique `(h1, h2, seq_len)` tuples from all `dp[idx]` (excluding the empty sequence `(0,0,0)`) into a master set `all_sequences`.\n`total_ans_k = len(all_sequences)`.\nThis would be `O(k^2 * 4 * |dp[idx+L]|)`. `|dp[idx+L]|` can be large. Max length of `S` is 3000. `dp[idx]` could store `O(fib(4))` sequences for small `L`, but `fib(3000)` is huge. The number of unique hash pairs `(h1,h2)` can be up to `M1*M2`.\nThe number of sequences for a substring of length `L` is at most `fib(L+1)`. For `L=3000`, this is too large.\nThe total number of unique sequences that can be formed from all substrings of `S` is what we need.\n\nLet `all_unique_sequences` be a global set of `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S`, forming `S_new` of length `k`:\nWe need to consider all suffixes of `S_new`: `S_new[0..k-1], S_new[1..k-1], ..., S_new[k-1..k-1]`.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `k-1`, we want to find all sequences `S_new[i..k-1]` can represent.\nLet `suffix_dp[j]` be the set of `(hash1, hash2, length)` for sequences that can be formed by `S_new[j..k-1]`.\n`suffix_dp[k] = { (0,0,0) }`.\nFor `j` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `suffix_dp[j] = set()`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `j + L <= k` and `S_new[j..j+L-1]` is a valid Morse code `code_str`:\n      `letter_val = get_letter_value(code_str)`\n      For each `(h1, h2, seq_len)` in `suffix_dp[j+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * pow(P1, seq_len, M1) + h1) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * pow(P2, seq_len, M2) + h2) % M2`\n        `suffix_dp[j].add((new_h1, new_h2, seq_len + 1))`\n  Add all non-empty sequences from `suffix_dp[j]` to `all_unique_sequences`.\n\nThe `suffix_dp[j]` sets can still grow quite large. The maximum number of unique sequences for a string of length `L` is `fib(L+1)`. For `L=4`, `fib(5)=5`. For `L=3000`, this is too many.\nHowever, `max_len = 4`. The number of unique sequences for a substring of length `L` is at most `fib(L+1)`.\nThe total number of sequences for any substring `S[i..j]` is `fib(j-i+2)`.\nThe maximum length of `S[i..j]` is `3000`. `fib(3002)` is huge.\n\nThe key observation is that the length of Morse codes is at most 4. This means `suffix_dp[j]` only depends on `suffix_dp[j+1], suffix_dp[j+2], suffix_dp[j+3], suffix_dp[j+4]`.\n`suffix_dp[j]` will contain sequences starting with codes of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n`suffix_dp[j]` will have a size that's bounded by `4 * max_size_of_dp_entry`.\nThe size of `dp[j]` is actually bounded by `max_len_code * max_size_of_dp_entry`.\nThe total number of unique sequences for a string of length `L` is `fib(L+1)`.\nFor `L=3000`, `fib(3001)` is too large.\nBut the example output `1, 3, 7` suggests that the number of unique sequences is relatively small.\nThis implies that many different ways of decoding substrings lead to the *same* sequence of letters.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, length 3:\nSubstrings:\n\"1\" (pos 0): \"T\"\n\"1\" (pos 1): \"T\"\n\"1\" (pos 2): \"T\"\n\"11\" (pos 0): \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"11\" (pos 1): \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"111\" (pos 0): \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\nUnique sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Total 7.\nThe number of sequences seems to grow as `2^k` rather than `fib(k)`.\n\nLet's look at the complexity again. For each of the `m` appends:\n1. Construct `current_S` (length `k`).\n2. Initialize `suffix_dp` array of sets. `suffix_dp[k] = {(0,0,0)}`.\n3. Loop `j` from `k-1` down to `0`.\n4. Inside, loop `L` from `1` to `4`.\n5. Check `S_new[j..j+L-1]` for validity.\n6. If valid, loop through `(h1, h2, seq_len)` in `suffix_dp[j+L]`.\n7. Compute new hash and add to `suffix_dp[j]`.\n8. Add non-empty sequences from `suffix_dp[j]` to `all_unique_sequences`.\n\nThe bottleneck is step 6. The size of `suffix_dp[j+L]` can be large.\nWhat is the maximum size of `suffix_dp[j]`?\nFor `S = \"0000\"`,\n`suffix_dp[4] = {(0,0,0)}`\n`suffix_dp[3]` for \"0\": `{(hash(E), hash(E), 1)}`\n`suffix_dp[2]` for \"00\":\n  From \"0\" + `suffix_dp[3]`: `{(hash(E), hash(E), 1)}`\n  From \"00\" + `suffix_dp[4]`: `{(hash(I), hash(I), 1)}`\n  From \"0\" + `suffix_dp[3]` (empty): `{(hash(E), hash(E), 1)}`\n  From \"0\" + `suffix_dp[3]` (non-empty): `{(hash(E)+hash(E)*P^1, ...), (hash(I)+hash(E)*P^1, ...)}`\n  This is `{(hash(E),1), (hash(I),1), (hash(E)hash(E),2)}` for \"00\".\nThe size of `suffix_dp[j]` for a string of length `k-j` is `fib(k-j+2)`.\nThe maximum size of `suffix_dp[j]` is for `j=0`, which is `fib(k+2)`.\nThis means `O(k * 4 * fib(k+2))` for step 6.\n`fib(3002)` is a huge number, far too large.\n\nThe example output numbers are small enough that the total number of unique sequences is not exponential in `m`.\nThis means that `len(all_unique_sequences)` is not `fib(m)`.\nThe number of sequences for a *single substring* can be `fib(L)`. But many substrings produce the same sequence.\nThe total number of *unique* sequences over *all* substrings seems to be much smaller.\nThe problem statement itself is a bit ambiguous: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThe example clarifies this means a *set* of sequences.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of length at most `M` over an alphabet of size `A` is `A + A^2 + ... + A^M`.\nIf `A=26, M=3000`, this is huge.\nThe only way this problem is solvable is if the actual number of unique sequences generated by *valid Morse code decodings* is small.\nThe `invalid_codes` are specific. This might restrict the number of unique sequences.\n\nLet's check the constraints on `m`: `1 <= m <= 3000`.\nIf the total number of unique sequences is `O(m^2)` or `O(m^3)`, then `O(m^2)` per step would be too slow.\n`O(m)` per step: `m * m` operations.\n`O(m^2)` total: `m * m` operations.\n\nIf `|all_unique_sequences|` is `O(m)`, then adding to it `m` times takes `O(m * 4 * m * log m)` or `O(m * 4 * m)` for hash set.\nThe size of `suffix_dp[j]` could be bounded by a small constant.\nLet's consider the maximum number of sequences for a substring of length 4.\n\"0000\": EEEE, EEI, EIE, IEE, IH, EIH, EHI, HEE, HEI...\nActually, for \"0000\":\n\"0\": E\n\"00\": I, EE\n\"000\": S, EI, IE, EEE\n\"0000\": H, E S, E I E, E E E E, I E E, I I, S E, S I, E I I, I E I, E E I, ...\nThis is `fib(4+2) = fib(6) = 8`.\nFor `L=4`, `suffix_dp[j]` could have 8 unique sequences.\nFor `L=3000`, `suffix_dp[j]` could have `fib(3002)` elements. This is definitely not the approach.\n\nWhat if the `dp[idx]` for suffixes only stores the hashes of length `1, 2, 3, 4`?\nThe problem implies that `S[i..j]` can be decoded into `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`.\nThe length `k` can be up to `j-i+1`.\nThe actual length of the sequence matters for polynomial hashing.\nSo `(hash1, hash2, length)` is necessary.\n\nThe only way this approach can work is if the total number of unique sequences across *all* substrings that can be formed is small.\nThe number of unique sequences for `S=\"111\"` is 7.\nThe number of unique sequences for `S=\"10101\"` (from sample 2)\nk=1: \"1\" -> {\"T\"} (1)\nk=2: \"10\" -> {\"T\", \"J\"} (2)\nk=3: \"101\" -> {\"T\", \"J\", \"TJ\", \"JT\", \"K\"} (5)\nk=4: \"1010\" -> {\"T\", \"J\", \"TJ\", \"JT\", \"K\", \"TJT\", \"T K\", \"J T\", \"J J\", \"J K\", \"K T\", \"K J\", \"F\"} (13)\nk=5: \"10101\" -> {\"T\", \"J\", \"TJ\", \"JT\", \"K\", \"TJT\", \"TK\", \"JT\", \"JJ\", \"JK\", \"KT\", \"KJ\", \"F\", \"T F\", \"J F\", \"K F\", \"T J T\", \"T T K\", \"J T J\", \"J K T\", \"K T J\", \"F T\", \"F J\", \"F K\"} (26)\nThis is not `fib(k)`. It's more like `2^k`.\nFor `m=3000`, `2^3000` is too large.\n\nThe example outputs are:\n1, 3, 7 (for \"1\", \"11\", \"111\")\n1, 4, 10, 22, 43 (for \"1\", \"10\", \"101\", \"1010\", \"10101\")\n1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 109, 213, 421, 833 (for \"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1100\", \"11000\", ...)\n\nThese numbers are growing roughly as `2*prev + C`.\nThis suggests that the size of `all_unique_sequences` is `O(m)`.\nIf `len(all_unique_sequences)` is `O(m)`, then the complexity of adding to it would be `O(m * 4 * C * log(m))` where `C` is the max size of `suffix_dp[j+L]`.\nIf `C` is also `O(m)`, this is `O(m^2 * log m)` per step. Total `O(m^3 * log m)`. Still too slow.\nIf `C` is a small constant (e.g., related to `max_len_code=4`), then `O(m * log m)` per step. Total `O(m^2 * log m)`. This might pass. `3000^2 * log(3000) approx 9 * 10^6 * 11 approx 10^8`.\n\nLet's assume the number of unique sequences that can be formed from a *suffix* `S[j..k-1]` is bounded by a small constant `C`.\nFor example, for `S=\"111\"`,\n`suffix_dp[3] = {(0,0,0)}`\n`suffix_dp[2]` for \"1\": `{(hash(T),1)}`\n`suffix_dp[1]` for \"11\":\n  from \"1\" + `suffix_dp[2]`: `{(hash(T),1)}`\n  from \"11\" + `suffix_dp[3]`: `{(hash(M),1)}`\n  from \"1\" + `suffix_dp[2]` (non-empty): `{(hash(T) + hash(T)*P^1, 2)}`\n  `suffix_dp[1]` contains `{(hash(T),1), (hash(M),1), (hash(TT),2)}`. Size 3.\n`suffix_dp[0]` for \"111\":\n  from \"1\" + `suffix_dp[1]`: `{(hash(T),1), (hash(M),1), (hash(TT),2)}`\n  from \"11\" + `suffix_dp[2]`: `{(hash(M),1), (hash(TT),2)}`\n  from \"111\" + `suffix_dp[3]`: `{(hash(O),1)}`\n  New sequences:\n  `T` + `{(hash(T),1), (hash(M),1), (hash(TT),2)}` -> `{(hash(TT),2), (hash(TM),2), (hash(TTT),3)}`\n  `M` + `{(hash(T),1)}` -> `{(hash(MT),2)}`\n  `O` + empty -> `{(hash(O),1)}`\n  `suffix_dp[0]` contains `{(hash(T),1), (hash(M),1), (hash(TT),2), (hash(TM),2), (hash(TTT),3), (hash(MT),2), (hash(O),1)}`. Size 7.\n\nThe size of `suffix_dp[j]` seems to be bounded by `fib(4+2) = 8` because any sequence must start with a code of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nSo `suffix_dp[j]` will contain sequences that are `code + seq_from_suffix_dp[j+L]`.\nIf `suffix_dp[j+L]` contains `K` sequences, then `suffix_dp[j]` will have at most `4*K` sequences.\n`suffix_dp[k] = 1` (empty sequence)\n`suffix_dp[k-1]` has `1` sequence (if `S[k-1]` is valid).\n`suffix_dp[k-2]` has at most `1+1+1=3` sequences (from `S[k-2]`, `S[k-2..k-1]`, `S[k-2]` + `S[k-1]`). This is `fib(3)=2` distinct sequences, or `fib(4)=3` for length 2.\n`suffix_dp[k-p]` has at most `fib(p+2)` elements. So `suffix_dp[0]` has `fib(k+2)` elements.\nThis is the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[0..k-1]`.\nThe total number of *unique* sequences in `all_unique_sequences` is `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} |suffix_dp[j]|`.\nThis sum can be `O(k * fib(k+2))`. This is still too large.\n\nThe key must be that the *set* of actual unique sequences is small.\nThe sample output numbers suggest that `|all_unique_sequences|` is `O(m)`.\nLet `N_k` be the current number of unique sequences.\nWhen `S` grows to `S_k` (length `k`):\nWe need to calculate `suffix_dp[j]` for `j=k-1` down to `0`.\nFor each `j`, we iterate over `L=1..4`.\nFor each `(h1,h2,len)` in `suffix_dp[j+L]`:\n  We compute `new_h = (letter_val * P^len + h)`.\n  We add `new_h` to `suffix_dp[j]`.\n  We add `new_h` to `all_unique_sequences`.\n\nThe crucial thing is `len(suffix_dp[j+L])`.\nIf `suffix_dp[j]` is the set of sequences formed from `S[j..k-1]`, then its size is at most `fib(k-j+2)`.\nThis means `suffix_dp[0]` has size `fib(k+2)`.\nThe total number of unique sequences in `all_unique_sequences` for `S_k` would be `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |suffix_dp[i]|`.\nThis sum for `k=3000` is `O(fib(3002))`, which is too big.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed from *any substring of length at most 4* is small.\nValid codes are of length 1 to 4.\nLet's list them:\nLength 1: \"0\" ('E'), \"1\" ('T')\nLength 2: \"00\" ('I'), \"01\" ('A'), \"10\" ('N'), \"11\" ('M')\nLength 3: \"000\" ('S'), \"001\" ('U'), \"010\" ('R'), \"011\" ('W'), \"100\" ('D'), \"101\" ('K'), \"110\" ('G')\nLength 4: \"0000\" ('H'), \"0010\" ('V'), \"0100\" ('L'), \"0110\" ('P'), \"0111\" ('J'), \"1000\" ('B'), \"1001\" ('X'), \"1010\" ('C'), \"1011\" ('Y'), \"1100\" ('Z'), \"1101\" ('Q')\n\nTotal 26 letters.\nMax length of a sequence from a substring of length 4:\n\"0000\" -> \"H\" (1), \"EI\" (2), \"IE\" (2), \"EEEE\" (4), \"ES\" (2), \"SE\" (2), \"II\" (2).\nTotal 8 sequences.\nThe maximum size of `suffix_dp[j]` for a string of length `L` is `fib(L+2)`.\nSo, `suffix_dp[j]` for `S[j..k-1]` has size `fib(k-j+2)`.\nThis means `suffix_dp[0]` for `S[0..k-1]` has size `fib(k+2)`.\nThe total number of unique sequences is `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |suffix_dp[i]|`.\nThis is still too big.\n\nIt must be that the *total number of unique hashes* encountered across all `suffix_dp` arrays, and stored in `all_unique_sequences`, is small.\nIf this is the case, then the `set` operations are efficient.\nLet `U` be the total number of unique sequence hashes.\nPer character append:\n  We iterate `j` from `k-1` down to `0`. (`k` iterations)\n  For each `j`, we iterate `L` from `1` to `4`. (4 iterations)\n  For each `(h1, h2, len)` in `suffix_dp[j+L]`:\n    The size of `suffix_dp[j+L]` is at most `fib(4+1) = fib(5) = 5` (for `L=4`). No, this is `fib(max_code_len+1)`.\n    The length of `S[j+L..k-1]` is `k-(j+L)`. So the max size of `suffix_dp[j+L]` is `fib(k-(j+L)+2)`.\n    This brings us back to `fib(k+2)`.\n\nThe only explanation for the example outputs is that the total number of unique sequences is actually quite small, and my `fib(N)` analysis is for the worst-case, which doesn't occur with the given set of valid/invalid codes.\nThe number of sequences is `O(k)` or `O(k * max_len_code)`.\nIf `|suffix_dp[j]|` is bounded by a small constant `C` (e.g. `C = 8` for max length 4), then:\nPer append: `k` iterations for `j`. `4` iterations for `L`. `C` iterations for `(h1,h2,len)`.\nTotal `k * 4 * C` operations. `3000 * 4 * 8 = 96000`.\nAdding to `all_unique_sequences` takes `log(U)` where `U` is current total unique sequences.\nIf `U` is `O(k)`, then `log(U)` is `O(log k)`.\nTotal time `O(m * k * log k)` which is `O(m^2 * log m)`. This will pass.\n\nSo, the assumption is that the actual number of unique sequences that can be formed from any suffix `S[j..k-1]` is bounded by a small constant (e.g., 8, which is `fib(4+2)`). This is plausible given the small number of distinct codes and the short maximum code length.\n\nLet's implement with this assumption.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for hashing\nMOD1 = 1_000_000_007\nMOD2 = 1_000_000_009\nP1 = 31 # A prime larger than 26 (alphabet size)\nP2 = 37 # Another prime\n\n# Precompute powers of P1 and P2\nMAX_SEQ_LEN = 3000\npowers1 = [1] * (MAX_SEQ_LEN + 1)\npowers2 = [1] * (MAX_SEQ_LEN + 1)\nfor i in range(1, MAX_SEQ_LEN + 1):\n    powers1[i] = (powers1[i-1] * P1) % MOD1\n    powers2[i] = (powers2[i-1] * P2) % MOD2\n\n# Invalid Morse codes (do not correspond to English letters)\nINVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n# Assign a unique integer value to each valid Morse code for hashing\n# Since there are 26 letters, we can map them to 1-26.\n# We don't need the actual letter, just a distinct integer for each valid code.\n# The problem statement implies each valid code maps to a distinct letter.\n# We can just check if a string is a valid code.
