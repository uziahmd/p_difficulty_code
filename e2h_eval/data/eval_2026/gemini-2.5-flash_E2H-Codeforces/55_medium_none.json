    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**\n\nMy goal is to discover the smallest possible string achievable after applying specific swap rules.  The swaps are limited: adjacent '0' and '1' can trade places, as can adjacent '1' and '2'. This means '0's and '1's have free movement relative to each other, and the same applies to '1's and '2's. However, '0' and '2' can't swap directly.\n\nTracing this out, it becomes clear that the original order of '0's and '2's *must* be maintained in the final string.  If a '0' precedes a '2' in the input, that order is unchangeable. I need to keep the positions of 0 and 2 fixed with respect to each other.\n\nWith this crucial constraint in mind, the problem reduces to managing how '1's fit in. These '1's can freely change their positions past '0's and '2's. To get the smallest string, I want all '1's to be grouped together. So, to generate the smallest string, I must put the 0s and 2s in their original order, which means that the string can be thought of as a subsequence of 0s and 2s with all 1s free to move. I can insert these 1s somewhere in the subsequence, or at the start or end.\n\nUltimately, the solution comes down to building a 'skeleton' of '0's and '2's in their original order.  I'll then insert the block of '1's to the right of 0s and to the left of 2s to make the string as small as possible. This means keeping all 0s before the 1s and putting 1s right after 0s. The '2's will come at the end after the 1s.\n",
    "response": "To obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, then '2's. We are given two types of allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap if adjacent: \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n2. '1' and '2' can swap if adjacent: \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these swaps:\n- A '0' can move past any '1' (and vice versa). This means a '0' can effectively \"bubble\" through a sequence of '1's. For example, \"0111\" can become \"1110\".\n- A '1' can move past any '2' (and vice versa). Similarly, \"1222\" can become \"2221\".\n\nWhat about '0's and '2's?\n- Can a '0' move past a '2'? For example, \"02\" to \"20\"? No, this swap is not allowed. A '0' can only swap with an adjacent '1'.\n- Can a '2' move past a '0'? For example, \"20\" to \"02\"? No, this swap is not allowed. A '2' can only swap with an adjacent '1'.\n\nThis is the crucial invariant: the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that same '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must maintain that order.\n\nThis means that if we remove all '1's from the original string, the resulting subsequence of '0's and '2's (let's call it `s_no_ones`) must appear in the final string in the exact same relative order. The '1's are highly mobile and can move past any '0' or '2'. This implies that all '1's can be collected into a single contiguous block.\n\nThe problem then reduces to: where should this block of '1's be inserted into the fixed sequence `s_no_ones` to produce the lexicographically smallest string?\n\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we prioritize placing '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nConsider the `s_no_ones` sequence. It might look like \"002020\".\nAny '0' that appears *before* the first '2' in `s_no_ones` can be moved to the very beginning of the string. For example, in \"002020\", the initial \"00\" can be at the start.\nAll '1's can move past these initial '0's.\nAll '1's can also move past any '2's.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is:\n1. Identify all '0's and '2's from the input string `s` and form the `s_no_ones` string, preserving their original relative order.\n2. Count the total number of '1's (`num_ones`).\n3. Find the index of the first '2' in `s_no_ones`.\n   - If there are no '2's in `s_no_ones` (e.g., `s_no_ones` is \"000\" or empty), then all characters are '0's or '1's. In this case, to minimize lexicographically, all '0's should come first, followed by all '1's. So, the result is `s_no_ones` concatenated with `num_ones` '1's.\n   - If a '2' is found at `first_two_idx`:\n     The characters in `s_no_ones` before `first_two_idx` must all be '0's. These '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the final string.\n     All `num_ones` '1's should then be placed immediately after these initial '0's.\n     The rest of `s_no_ones` (from `first_two_idx` onwards, which starts with a '2') must follow the '1's, maintaining its internal relative order.\n\nThis strategy ensures that we place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then all '1's, and then the remaining '2's (and any '0's that were \"trapped\" after a '2' in the original string).\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `s_no_ones` will be \"0020\".\n2. `num_ones` will be 2.\n3. The first '2' in \"0020\" is at index 2.\n   - `s_no_ones[:2]` is \"00\".\n   - `'1' * num_ones` is \"11\".\n   - `s_no_ones[2:]` is \"20\".\n   Concatenating these gives \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nThis approach correctly handles all example cases and edge cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_no_ones_chars = []\n    num_ones = 0\n\n    # Separate '0's and '2's into s_no_ones_chars, and count '1's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_no_ones_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert list of characters to a string for easier slicing/searching\n    s_no_ones = \"\".join(s_no_ones_chars)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for the '1's block\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_no_ones)):\n        if s_no_ones[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # Case 1: No '2's in the original string (e.g., \"000\", \"111\", \"010\").\n        # All '0's come first (from s_no_ones), then all '1's.\n        result_parts.append(s_no_ones) # Contains all '0's\n        result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n    else:\n        # Case 2: '2's are present in the original string.\n        # '0's appearing before the first '2' in s_no_ones can be moved to the very beginning.\n        result_parts.append(s_no_ones[:first_two_idx])\n        # All '1's are grouped together after these initial '0's.\n        result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n        # The rest of the '0's and '2's (starting with the first '2') follow.\n        result_parts.append(s_no_ones[first_two_idx:])\n    \n    # Join all parts and print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_parts) + \"\\n\")\n\n# The problem statement implies a single string input from stdin.\n# The example input format `['100210', '11222121', '20']` is a common way to show multiple test cases\n# in problem descriptions, but usually means one input string per line in actual test files.\n# We assume standard competitive programming input/output: one string per line.\nsolve()\n\n```",
