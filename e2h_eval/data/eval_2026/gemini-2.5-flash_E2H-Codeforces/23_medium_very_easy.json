            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this problem.** I'm tasked with figuring out the fewest additional tiles needed to make a \"mentsu\" (a koutsu or shuntsu) from an initial set of three tiles. Basically, I need to know how many more tiles I need to either have three of a kind (koutsu) or three consecutive numbers of the same suit (shuntsu). I'm given the three initial tiles, like \"1m 5p 9s\".\n\nI'll approach this in a clear, prioritized way. First, I'll check if zero draws are enough. That is, do I already have a koutsu or shuntsu? For a koutsu, I check if all three tiles are identical. For a shuntsu, I need to check if all the tiles are of the same suit and if they have sequential values. If that's the case, great, the answer is 0.\n\nIf zero draws aren't enough, I'll move on to check if one draw is sufficient. I'll need to see if drawing one additional tile will create a mentsu.  I'll consider all possible pairs of tiles from the hand. If any pair is identical, I know I can just draw another of that tile to form a koutsu. If the pair has the same suit and are sequential, or if there's a difference of 2 between the numbers, I can complete the shuntsu by drawing the missing tile.\n\nIf I can't find a solution with one draw, then I know that two draws will always suffice. It's guaranteed that with two draws, I can always make a koutsu. I can just draw two of the same tile that's already in my hand, and that completes the koutsu.\n\nTo make things efficient, I'm parsing the input into a structured format where each tile is a number and suit pair (like, `(1, 's')`). The code is structured to prioritize the simpler cases first (0 draws), followed by 1 draw. After carefully checking all of my logic, it seems that this method is very effective, and handles every possible combination of initial tiles correctly.\n",
    "response": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game where she needs to form a \"mentsu\" (meld) to win. A mentsu can be either a \"koutsu\" (triplet of three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any number of extra tiles. We need to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of draws, which can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Parse Input**: Convert the input tile strings (e.g., \"1s\", \"9m\") into a more manageable format, such as `(number, suit)` tuples (e.g., `(1, 's')`, `(9, 'm')`).\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws**:\n    *   **Koutsu**: Check if the three initial tiles are all identical. If `tile1 == tile2` and `tile2 == tile3`, then she already has a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu**: Check if the three initial tiles form a sequence of the same suit. To do this, sort the tiles. If `(n1, s1), (n2, s2), (n3, s3)` are the sorted tiles, check if `s1 == s2 == s3` AND `n2 == n1 + 1` AND `n3 == n2 + 1`.\n    *   If either a koutsu or a shuntsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw**:\n    If 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if drawing one additional tile can form a mentsu. This means we need to find two of the existing tiles (`t_a`, `t_b`) such that, with one drawn tile (`t_draw`), they form a mentsu.\n    We consider all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand: `(tile1, tile2)`, `(tile1, tile3)`, and `(tile2, tile3)`. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n    *   **To form a Koutsu**: If `t_a == t_b`, we can draw a third identical tile (`t_a`) to form a koutsu `[t_a, t_a, t_a]`. This requires 1 draw.\n    *   **To form a Shuntsu**: This is only possible if `t_a` and `t_b` are of the same suit (`s_a == s_b`).\n        *   **Case 1: `abs(n_a - n_b) == 1`** (e.g., `2p, 3p`). We have two adjacent tiles. We can draw the tile one number lower (e.g., `1p`) if its number is `> 0`, or the tile one number higher (e.g., `4p`) if its number is `< 10`. Since tile numbers are 1-9, this means if `min(n_a, n_b) > 1` (can draw `min-1`) OR `max(n_a, n_b) < 9` (can draw `max+1`), then 1 draw is sufficient.\n        *   **Case 2: `abs(n_a - n_b) == 2`** (e.g., `2p, 4p`). We have two tiles separated by one number. We can draw the missing middle tile (e.g., `3p`). The missing tile's number will always be `min(n_a, n_b) + 1`, which will always be between 2 and 8, thus a valid tile number. This requires 1 draw.\n    *   If any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n4.  **Check for 2 Draws**:\n    If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, the answer is always 2. This is because we can always pick any of the initial tiles (say, `tile1`) and draw two more copies of it to form a koutsu `[tile1, tile1, tile1]`. For example, if the hand is `1m 5p 9s`, we can draw two `1m` tiles to form `[1m, 1m, 1m, 5p, 9s]`, which contains a koutsu.\n\nThe code implements this logic by first checking for 0 draws, then 1 draw, and finally defaulting to 2 draws if neither of the previous conditions is met.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper function to parse a tile string into a (number, suit) tuple\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and split it into three tile strings\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tile_strings = input_line.split()\n\n    # Parse the tile strings into a list of (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in tile_strings]\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu can be formed with the current three tiles.\n\n    # Koutsu: Three identical tiles\n    # Check if all three tiles are the same\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Shuntsu: Three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit\n    # To check for shuntsu, we need to sort the tiles.\n    # Python's default tuple sorting sorts by the first element, then the second, etc.\n    # For example, (1, 'm') < (2, 'm') < (1, 'p').
