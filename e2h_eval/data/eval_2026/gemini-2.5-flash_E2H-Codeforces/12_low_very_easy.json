The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Xenia and the Ringroad: A Python Script Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this Xenia and Ringroad problem. It's a classic, relatively straightforward graph traversal in essence. Let's see, I need to write a Python script to solve it. First, I need to clarify the specifics. I've got `n` houses, numbered 1 to `n` in a circle, and `m` tasks. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete each task in the order they're given in the `a` array.  Traffic's one-way, clockwise. Simple enough. The goal is to minimize the total travel time.\n\nThe example really clarifies the logic. Starting at house 1, I need to move to house 3. That takes 2 units of time (1 -> 2 -> 3). Then, from 3 to 2, it's a longer path (3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2), taking 3 units. Finally, from 2 to 3, it's just 1 unit. So, the total time is 6. Perfect, that sets up a concrete example to follow.\n\nNow, let's nail down the core logic. To calculate the time between houses, there are two distinct cases.  If the target house is greater than or equal to my current house, it's a simple subtraction: `target_house - current_house`. That's the direct clockwise path. However, when the target house is *less* than the current house, it wraps around the circle. That’s where the \"n\" comes into play. I'd calculate the time to get to \"n\" ( `n - current_house`) and then add the time to go from 1 to the `target_house` ( `target_house`).\n\nAlright, the algorithm emerges. Initialize `total_time` to 0, and `current_house` to 1.  I read `n` and `m`, then the `a` array of tasks. Then, iterate through `a`. In each iteration, I check the relative position of the `target_house` to the `current_house` and calculate the `time_taken` accordingly using the logic I just mentioned. I add `time_taken` to the total and update `current_house`. Finally, I print the `total_time`.\n\nSeems like a pretty efficient algorithm, but I should be aware that the `n` and `m` can go up to 10^5, so the code has to stay efficient. Shouldn't be any problem there with Python, but always something to keep in mind. I think I'm ready to write the code.\n",
