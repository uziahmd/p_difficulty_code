You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Replacing Digits Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core of it is I've got a number `a` and a set of digits `s` that I can swap into `a`. Each digit in `s` can only be used once, and my goal is to maximize the value of the resulting number.\n\nMy thought process is this: To get the biggest possible number, I need to make the leftmost digits as large as possible. Since `a`'s length stays fixed, it's just about making those leading digits count.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking of building the script:\n\n1.  I'll treat `a` as a string (or convert it into a list of characters) and do the same for `s`.\n2.  I'll sort `s` in descending order, so the biggest digits are at the start. That way, I know which digits to reach for first.\n3.  I'll use two pointers: `i` to move through `a` from left to right, and `j` to move through the sorted `s` (from largest to smallest digits).\n4.  I'll iterate through `a`: For each digit `a[i]`, I'll check if any digit from `s` is *bigger* than it. If I find a bigger one, I'll swap them (because bigger is better for that digit's position) and move `j` to the next largest available digit in `s`.\n5.  If I run out of digits in `s`, I stop looking because there's nothing left to improve the number with.\n\nEffectively, I'm trying to find the best possible replacement for each digit in `a`, starting from the left. I'm going to keep an eye out for potential edge cases, like what if `s` has duplicates, but I think the sorting should handle that well. Ultimately, it boils down to a greedy approach: replace if I can improve.\n\nIt seems like the overall logic will be pretty straightforward: compare and replace, moving left to right, using available, sorted digits from `s`. I'm confident I can put together a Python script that efficiently solves this problem.\n",
