Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this New Year Candles problem. I need a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, the goal is to figure out the maximum number of hours a room can be lit given a starting number of candles and a conversion rate. It's a classic simulation problem, and I'm pretty sure I have the core logic nailed down.\n\nI'm thinking, Vasily starts with 'a' candles. Each one burns for an hour and then becomes a spent candle.  He can then trade 'b' of those spent candles for one new candle.  The trick is maximizing the total hours the room is lit.\n\nMy plan is to simulate the process. I'm going to track a few key values: the total hours lit (`total_hours`), the number of new candles on hand (`current_new_candles`), and the number of spent candles (`burned_out_candles`).\n\nInitially, `total_hours` is zero,  `current_new_candles` is 'a', and `burned_out_candles` is also zero.  Then, I'll go into a loop that continues as long as I have new candles to light.\n\nInside the loop, the first step is to light up *all* the new candles.  I'll add the number of new candles to the `total_hours`.  Those candles then become spent candles, so I'll add the `current_new_candles` to `burned_out_candles`, and reset `current_new_candles` to zero.\n\nNext, I'll see if I have enough spent candles to make new ones. I'll use integer division (`//`) of `burned_out_candles` by 'b' to find out how many new candles I can get.  I'll add that to `current_new_candles` and update `burned_out_candles` with the remainder using the modulo operator (`%`).\n\nI'll keep repeating this until `current_new_candles` is zero, meaning I have no more candles to burn.\n\nI've even worked through an example (a=4, b=2). I think the iteration steps illustrate the algorithm perfectly. It feels pretty solid, so I'm confident in my approach. The key is in tracking the state of the candles at each step and then simulating the trade-in to maximize the burn time. This looks good.\n",
