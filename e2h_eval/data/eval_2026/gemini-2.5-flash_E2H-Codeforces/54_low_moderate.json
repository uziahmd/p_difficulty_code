Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: given a regular n-gon and a target angle 'a', I need to find three vertices that form an angle as close as possible to 'a'. The core is to map the geometry to an algorithm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry of a regular polygon.  I recall the central angle is `360/n` degrees, and the inscribed angle theorem is key. Since the polygon is regular, I know it can be inscribed in a circle, making this theorem applicable.\n\nThe vertices are numbered, and the angle is formed by picking three distinct vertices. I can fix the second vertex (v2) to be vertex 1 without loss of generality because of the polygon's symmetry. Now, I have to figure out how the positions of the other two vertices (v1 and v3) relate to the angle they form.\n\nI see that the angle `v1v2v3` is an inscribed angle. The arc that it subtends is the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2). The crucial realization is that the size of this arc determines the angle. The length of this arc can be measured by the number of polygon sides it spans. Each \"unit\" arc (between adjacent vertices) corresponds to a central angle of `360/n`. Therefore, an arc spanning 'm' sides subtends a central angle of `m * (360/n)`. The inscribed angle is half of the central angle, so that's `m * 180/n`.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: `3 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a <= 180`.\n\nI can represent v1 as vertex `1 + i` and v3 as vertex `1 + k`. Because of the distinct vertices requirement, both `i` and `k` need to be non-zero and different. The number of sides spanned by the arc between v1 and v3 will be related to `i` and `k`. I think I'll need to use modular arithmetic here (since the vertices are in a circle). `min(|i-k|, n-|i-k|)` should give me this value. Now, I'm almost ready to craft the script: I can iterate through various combinations of `i` and `k` (with the above constraints), calculate the resulting angle, and track the closest one to 'a'. I'll need to manage the indices carefully, probably using modulo `n`.\n",
