And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**A Pythonic Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over Weeks**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's pretty straightforward: we've got a list of sleep records, and we need to figure out the average sleep time over a sliding window of weeks.  A \"week\" is just a consecutive stretch of `k` days.  The trick here is to be efficient because we have up to 200,000 days.\n\nMy first thought was a brute-force approach, which would be to calculate the sum of sleep for each week individually, and then take the average. But that would be slow.  If you have k days, then summing takes O(k) time and with 2 * 10^5 days it would be too much.\n\nSo, I started digging into a more clever, sliding window solution. The key insight is that the sum of one week is directly related to the sum of the next.  If we know the sum of sleep hours in one week, we can compute the sum for the next in just O(1) time. We just subtract the element that leaves the window and add the element that enters.\n\nI'm thinking about the calculation of `TotalSum`. We initialize the sum by just summing the first window and then, use the sliding technique to sum up the sleep times for all the weeks and add them up, taking care to use the formula to do so in constant time.  After, We can just divide the whole sum by the number of weeks. This is efficient; it takes O(n) time, where n is the number of days.\n\nI had to be careful with the indexing, it is really easy to mess that up when sliding the window.\n\nTo make sure, I re-traced the logic using a small test and verified the indexing, sliding, and edge cases. I needed to ensure that I was actually calculating the correct average. The problem description seemed a bit ambiguous but the worked examples are a lifesaver.  I was confirming the interpretation. This process is very important.\n\nFinally, I checked my implementation, double-checked for edge cases like the whole data set is a single week, or a one-day week. And also verified the numeric limits, ensuring no overflows when summing.  The constraints should be fine since Python's integer type handles arbitrarily large numbers. Since, I had to ensure at least 6 decimal places, I used format string to print the result.\n\nThis approach should be efficient enough, and I am confident that it provides the correct average sleep time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate a specific average sleep time. Polycarp has `n` days of sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`. A \"week\" is defined as `k` consecutive days. We need to consider all possible weeks. There will be `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nLet's denote the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (starting on day `i` and ending on day `i+k-1`) as `S_i`. The weeks are:\n* Week 1: `a1, a2, ..., ak` (sum `S_1`)\n* Week 2: `a2, a3, ..., ak+1` (sum `S_2`)\n* ...\n* Week `n-k+1`: `an-k+1, an-k+2, ..., an` (sum `S_{n-k+1}`)\n\nThe problem asks for the \"average sleep times over all weeks\". Based on the provided examples, this is interpreted as the sum of all `S_i` values, divided by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\nSo, the final answer is `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to calculate each `S_i` by summing `k` elements, and then sum these `S_i` values. This would take `O((n-k+1) * k)` time, which is too slow for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nA more efficient approach uses a sliding window technique. We can calculate `S_1` by summing the first `k` elements. Then, each subsequent `S_i` can be calculated from `S_{i-1}` in `O(1)` time:\n`S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.\n(Using 0-indexed arrays, `S_j` for window `a[j...j+k-1]` is `S_{j-1} - a[j-1] + a[j+k-1]`).\n\nHere's the step-by-step algorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Read the list of sleep times `a`.\n3. Calculate `num_weeks = n - k + 1`. This is the divisor for the final average.\n4. Calculate the sum of the first `k` days: `current_window_sum = sum(a[0:k])`. This is `S_1`.\n5. Initialize `total_sum_of_week_sums = current_window_sum`. This variable will accumulate all `S_i`.\n6. Iterate from `i = 1` to `n - k` (inclusive). In each iteration, `i` represents the starting index of the current week (0-indexed).\n   a. Update `current_window_sum` for the next week: `current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`.\n      - `a[i-1]` is the element leaving the window.\n      - `a[i+k-1]` is the element entering the window.\n   b. Add the `current_window_sum` (which is `S_{i+1}`) to `total_sum_of_week_sums`.\n7. After the loop finishes, `total_sum_of_week_sums` will hold the sum of all `S_i`.\n8. Calculate the final average: `average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_week_sums / num_weeks`.\n9. Print the `average_sleep_time` formatted to at least 6 decimal places.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n* Reading input: `O(N)`\n* Calculating the sum of the first `k` elements: `O(k)`\n* Sliding window loop: `n - k` iterations, each taking `O(1)` time. Total `O(n-k)`.\n* Total time complexity: `O(N + k + (N-k)) = O(N)`. This is efficient enough for `N = 2 * 10^5`.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n* Storing the input array `a`: `O(N)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]):**\n1. `n=3, k=2`. `a=[3, 4, 7]`.\n2. `num_weeks = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n3. `current_window_sum = sum(a[0:2]) = a[0] + a[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n4. `total_sum_of_week_sums = 7`.\n5. Loop for `i` from `1` to `n-k = 1`:\n   - `i = 1`:\n     - `current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n     - `current_window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n     - `current_window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n     - `current_window_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n     - `total_sum_of_week_sums = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n6. Loop ends.\n7. `average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_week_sums / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n8.
