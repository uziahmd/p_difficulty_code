            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solution Strategy: Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core idea is to get the sum of all my cards to zero. I'm given the cards I have, and I know the maximum absolute value (`x`) a new card can have. My brain immediately goes through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Figure Out the Shortfall:** I first calculate the total sum (`S`) of the cards I already have. This is my starting point.\n\n2.  **The Target is Clear:** The target is to make the sum zero. So, I need to get to `-S`.\n\n3.  **Minimize the Card Count:** The real challenge is to find the *fewest* new cards. Since I can pick any value from `-x` to `x`, I want each new card to get as close to `-S` as possible in the quickest manner.\n\n4.  **Maximize Each Card:** I recognize that I should use cards with the largest possible value (`x` or `-x`, depending on whether `S` is positive or negative) to make the approach as rapid as possible. I would pick x or -x until I'm there.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Cards:**  I calculate how many cards I need using the ceiling function. The number of cards I'll need is equivalent to `ceil(abs(S) / x)` where `S` is the current sum. I realize there's a neat trick with integer division: I can use `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x` to get the ceiling without using the `math.ceil` function.\n\n**Verification and Implementation:**\n\nI've tested the logic with edge cases. I'm confident in the approach. If the sum is zero to start, I don't need any cards. Otherwise, I calculate the absolute value of the initial sum and divide by `x` with the ceiling function (integer division trick) to determine the number of cards. I need to make sure I take the input correctly, perform calculations, and print the resulting number of cards. Finally, I've checked the constraints to make sure the program will function efficiently within the limits. I can now confidently code this up!\n",
