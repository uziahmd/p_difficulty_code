For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Understanding the Constraints of a Beautiful Multiset**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. I need to count the valid ways to assign integer values, *c<sub>s</sub>*, to binary strings *s* of lengths 1 to *n*, given an upper bound *k*.  The core of this is understanding what makes a multiset of binary strings \"beautiful,\" and the problem specifies that the *maximum* size of a beautiful multiset must equal *f*.\n\nA beautiful multiset has a constraint: for any string *s*, the number of strings in the multiset that have *s* as a prefix can't exceed *c<sub>s</sub>*.  This immediately screams \"flow network\" or \"prefix sum\" constraints to me. Let's model this with a binary trie: each node represents a binary string, and the leaves represent strings of length *n*.  Each string *s* in the multiset will be some leaf of the trie.\n\nLet's represent the number of times a string *t* (length *n*) appears in the multiset with *x<sub>t</sub>*. My goal is to maximize the sum of all *x<sub>t</sub>*.  The beauty constraint translates to this: for any string *s* of length 1 to *n*, the sum of *x<sub>t</sub>* where *s* is a prefix of *t* must be no more than *c<sub>s</sub>*.  We also know all *x<sub>t</sub>* are non-negative integers.\n\nI'm thinking about *N<sub>s</sub>* as the count of strings with *s* as a prefix. For a string *s* of length *L* less than *n*, *N<sub>s</sub>* is the sum of counts for strings prefixed by *s0* and *s1*. When *s* is length *n*, *N<sub>s</sub>* is simply *x<sub>s</sub>*. My objective of maximizing the sum of *x<sub>t</sub>* is the same as maximizing the total number of strings in the multiset, *N<sub>ε</sub>*, at the root (empty string). But, the beauty constraint applies to every *N<sub>s</sub>* from length 1 up to *n*.\n\nEssentially, my constraints are:  *N<sub>s</sub>* must be less than or equal to *c<sub>s</sub>* for all *s* of length 1 to *n*, and, for strings *s* shorter than *n*, the prefix count splits between the 0 and 1 child.  I have to work with this network flow interpretation to compute all valid *c<sub>s</sub>*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for a given set of $c_s$ values. Let $N_s$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix. The strings in the multiset are all of length exactly $n$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $n$, $N_s$ is simply the count of string $s$ in the multiset.\nThe conditions are $N_s \\le c_s$ for all $s$ with $1 \\le |s| \\le n$. Also, $N_s \\ge 0$.\nWe want to maximize the total number of strings in the multiset, which is $N_{\\text{empty string}}$.\n\nThis problem can be viewed as finding the maximum flow in a network, or more simply, it's a dynamic programming problem on the trie structure.\nLet $M_s$ be the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have $s$ as a prefix, subject to the constraints $c_{s'}$ for $s'$ being $s$ or a descendant of $s$.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $n$, then $M_s = c_s$. (We can choose string $s$ up to $c_s$ times).\nIf $s$ is a string of length $L < n$, then $M_s = \\min(c_s, M_{s0} + M_{s1})$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset for the entire trie is $M_{\\text{empty string}}$.\nLet's denote $M_{\\text{empty string}}$ as $M$.\n\nThe strings $s$ are organized by their length. There are $2^L$ strings of length $L$.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ up to $n$, such that for *one specific string* of length $L$, say $s_0$, the maximum count $M_{s_0}$ is $x$.\nThis DP state definition is tricky because $M_{s_0}$ depends on $c_{s_0}$ and $M_{s_00} + M_{s_01}$. The $c_s$ values are chosen independently for each string $s$.\n\nConsider the structure: $M_s = \\min(c_s, M_{s0} + M_{s1})$.\nNotice that for any two distinct strings $s_a, s_b$ of the same length $L$, the subtrees rooted at $s_a$ and $s_b$ are isomorphic. This means that the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values in the subtree of $s_a$ to achieve a certain $M_{s_a}$ value will be the same as for $s_b$.\nThis allows us to use dynamic programming on the depth $L$.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s'$ in the subtree rooted at an arbitrary string $s$ of length $L$ (i.e., $s'$ is $s$ or a descendant of $s$), such that $M_s = x$.\nThe base case is for $L=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $M_s = c_s$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, for $L=n$: $dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $dp[L][x]$, we need to consider $M_{s0}$ and $M_{s1}$.\n$M_{s0}$ can be any value $y_0$, and $M_{s1}$ can be any value $y_1$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $M_{s0}=y_0$ is $dp[L+1][y_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $M_{s1}=y_1$ is $dp[L+1][y_1]$.\nSince the choices for $s0$ and $s1$ are independent, the number of ways to get $M_{s0}=y_0$ and $M_{s1}=y_1$ is $dp[L+1][y_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][y_1]$.\nLet $S = y_0 + y_1$. The sum $S$ can range from $0$ to $2k$.\nLet $P[S] = \\sum_{y_0+y_1=S} dp[L+1][y_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][y_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$P[S]$ can be computed by squaring the polynomial represented by $dp[L+1]$ (i.e., $(dp[L+1][0] + dp[L+1][1]X + \\dots)^2$) or by a direct sum. Since $k$ is large, we need a faster way than $O(k^2)$.\nThe maximum value for $M_s$ is $k$. So $y_0, y_1 \\in [0, k]$. $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\n\nAfter computing $P[S]$ for all $S \\in [0, 2k]$:\nFor a string $s$ of length $L$, we choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\n$M_s = \\min(c_s, S)$.\nWe want $M_s = x$.\nCase 1: $c_s = x$. Then $S \\ge x$. The number of ways is $P[S]$ for $S \\ge x$.\nCase 2: $c_s > x$. Then $S = x$. The number of ways is $P[x]$.\n\nSumming over $c_s$:\nIf $S > x$: $M_s = \\min(c_s, S)$. To get $M_s = x$, we must choose $c_s = x$. There is $1$ way to choose $c_s$ for this $S$.\nIf $S = x$: $M_s = \\min(c_s, x)$. To get $M_s = x$, we must choose $c_s \\ge x$. There are $k-x+1$ ways to choose $c_s$.\nIf $S < x$: $M_s = \\min(c_s, S)$. $M_s$ cannot be $x$. This case contributes $0$.\n\nSo, $dp[L][x] = \\sum_{S=x+1}^{2k} P[S] \\cdot 1 + P[x] \\cdot (k-x+1)$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$dp[L][x] = P[x] \\cdot (k-x+1) + \\sum_{S=x+1}^{2k} P[S]$.\nLet $SuffSumP[x] = \\sum_{S=x}^{2k} P[S]$.\nThen $\\sum_{S=x+1}^{2k} P[S] = SuffSumP[x+1]$.\nSo, $dp[L][x] = P[x] \\cdot (k-x+1) + SuffSumP[x+1]$.\nThis computation takes $O(k)$ time for each $x$, after $P[S]$ and $SuffSumP[S]$ are computed.\n$SuffSumP[x]$ can be computed in $O(k)$ time from $P[S]$: $SuffSumP[2k] = P[2k]$, $SuffSumP[x] = P[x] + SuffSumP[x+1]$.\n\nThe maximum value $x$ for $M_s$ is $k$. However, $M_{s0}+M_{s1}$ can be up to $2k$. So $P[S]$ needs to go up to $2k$.\nThe $dp[L][x]$ values are only needed for $x \\le k$.\nThe maximum sum $S$ is $2k$.\nThe overall DP:\n$dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$.\nFor $L = n-1$ down to $1$:\n  Compute $P[S] = \\sum_{y_0+y_1=S} dp[L+1][y_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][y_1]$ for $0 \\le S \\le 2k$.\n  This is a convolution. Since $dp[L+1][x]$ values are only non-zero for $x \\in [0, k]$, this is a convolution of two polynomials of degree $k$. A naive convolution takes $O(k^2)$. Using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) takes $O(k \\log k)$. Given $n \\le 15$, $k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n \\cdot k \\log k$ is feasible. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$.\n  Compute $SuffSumP[S]$ for $0 \\le S \\le 2k$. This takes $O(k)$.\n  Compute $dp[L][x] = P[x] \\cdot (k-x+1) + SuffSumP[x+1]$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$. This takes $O(k)$.\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nModulo is $998244353$, which is a prime number suitable for NTT.\n\nLet's check the ranges carefully.\n$dp[L][x]$ is defined for $x \\in [0, k]$.\nWhen computing $P[S]$, $y_0, y_1 \\in [0, k]$. So $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\n$P[S]$ will be non-zero for $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\nWhen computing $dp[L][x]$ for $x \\in [0, k]$:\n$P[x]$ is defined. $k-x+1$ is defined.\n$SuffSumP[x+1]$: if $x=k$, then $x+1=k+1$. $SuffSumP[k+1]$ is sum from $k+1$ to $2k$. This is fine.\n$SuffSumP[2k+1]$ would be 0.\n\nExample walkthrough: $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$L=n=1$.\n$dp[1][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le 42$. All other $dp[1][x]=0$.\nThe problem asks for $M_{\\text{empty string}}$. But $n=1$, so strings are $0$ and $1$. $M_{\\text{empty string}} = \\min(c_{\\text{empty string}}, M_0 + M_1)$.\nWait, the problem states \"length from $1$ to $n$\". So $c_{\\text{empty string}}$ is not defined.\nThe root of the trie is the empty string. The total number of strings is $N_{\\text{empty string}}$.\nThe definition $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$ applies for $s$ with $|s|<n$.\nThe total count is $N_0 + N_1$.\nThe maximum value $M$ is $M_{\\text{empty string}} = M_0 + M_1$. (There is no $c_{\\text{empty string}}$ constraint).\nSo the final answer is $\\sum_{y_0+y_1=f} dp[1][y_0] \\cdot dp[1][y_1]$. This is $P[f]$ computed at $L=0$.\nThe DP states should be $dp[L][x]$ = number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for $s'$ in the subtree of $s$ (length $L$) such that $M_s=x$.\nThe final answer is for $L=0$ (empty string).\n$dp[0][x]$ would be for $M_{\\text{empty string}} = x$.\n$M_{\\text{empty string}} = M_0 + M_1$.\nSo for $L=0$, $dp[0][x] = \\sum_{y_0+y_1=x} dp[1][y_0] \\cdot dp[1][y_1] = P[x]$ (using $dp[1]$ as the input to the convolution).\nThe final answer is $P[f]$.\nSo we need to compute $dp[L][x]$ for $L=n$ down to $L=1$. Then $P[f]$ using $dp[1]$ values.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$dp[1][x] = 1$ for $x \\in [0, k]$.\nWe need to calculate $P[f] = \\sum_{y_0+y_1=f} dp[1][y_0] \\cdot dp[1][y_1]$.\nSince $dp[1][y_0]=1$ for $y_0 \\in [0, k]$ and $dp[1][y_1]=1$ for $y_1 \\in [0, k]$:\n$P[f]$ is the number of pairs $(y_0, y_1)$ such that $y_0+y_1=f$, $0 \\le y_0 \\le k$, $0 \\le y_1 \\le k$.\nThis is $\\max(0, \\min(f, 2k-f) - \\max(0, f-k) + 1)$.\nMore simply, if $f \\le k$: $y_0$ can be $0, \\dots, f$. There are $f+1$ pairs.\nIf $f > k$: $y_0$ can be $f-k, \\dots, k$. There are $k-(f-k)+1 = 2k-f+1$ pairs.\nSo $P[f] = \\min(f+1, 2k-f+1, k+1)$. Wait, $f+1$ for $f \\le k$, and $2k-f+1$ for $f > k$. And $P[f]=0$ if $f > 2k$.\nFor $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$f=2 \\le k=42$. So $P[2] = 2+1 = 3$. This matches the example.\n\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum value for $M_s$ for a string $s$ of length $L$ is $k$.\nThe maximum value for $M_{\\text{empty string}}$ is $2^n \\cdot k$. But $f$ is limited to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe values $dp[L][x]$ are only needed for $x \\le k$.\nThe values $P[S]$ are needed for $S \\le 2k$.\nThe final $P[f]$ is needed for $f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nSo the maximum degree of polynomials for NTT is $2k$.\n$2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$N_{NTT} = 2^{\\lceil \\log_2(2k+1) \\rceil}$. For $2k=4 \\cdot 10^5$, $N_{NTT} = 2^{19} = 524288$.\nThis is feasible.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Initialize $dp[n][x] = 1$ for $0 \\le x \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n2. For $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Create a polynomial $A$ from $dp[L+1]$: $A(X) = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[L+1][x] X^x$.\n   b. Compute $C(X) = A(X)^2$ using NTT. $C(X) = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} P[S] X^S$. This gives $P[S]$ values.\n   c. Compute suffix sums $SuffSumP[S] = \\sum_{j=S}^{2k} P[j]$ for $S \\in [0, 2k]$. (Modulo arithmetic for sums).\n   d. For $x$ from $0$ to $k$:\n      $dp[L][x] = (P[x] \\cdot (k-x+1) + SuffSumP[x+1]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n      (Note: $SuffSumP[k+1]$ is correct, $SuffSumP[2k+1]$ should be $0$).\n3. After computing $dp[1]$:\n   a. Create polynomial $A$ from $dp[1]$: $A(X) = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[1][x] X^x$.\n   b. Compute $C(X) = A(X)^2$ using NTT. $C(X) = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} P_{final}[S] X^S$.\n4. The answer is $P_{final}[f]$.\n\nMaximum value of $k-x+1$ is $k+1$. $P[x]$ can be large.\n$dp[n][x]=1$.\n$P[S]$ for $L=n-1$ can be $S+1$ for $S \\le k$, etc. Max is $k+1$.\n$dp[n-1][x]$ can be up to $(k+1)(k+1) + k(k+1) \\approx 2k^2$.\n$dp[L][x]$ values can grow large, so they must be taken modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe maximum $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. Max $S$ is $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. So $P_{final}[f]$ is well-defined.\n\nNeed to implement NTT carefully.\nThe modulus $998244353 = 119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$. A primitive root is $3$.\nMax length $N_{NTT}$ is $2^{19}$. $2^{19} \\le 2^{23}$. So NTT works.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to perform modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to find modular inverse (a^-1 % mod)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT implementation\ndef ntt(a, inverse=False):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half <<= 1\n        w_n = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // len_half)\n        if inverse:\n            w_n = inv(w_n)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n    \n    if inverse:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return a\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply_polynomials(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum power of 2 greater than or equal to len_a + len_b - 1\n    size = 1\n    while size < len_a + len_b - 1:\n        size <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros to the calculated size\n    a.extend([0] * (size - len_a))\n    b.extend([0] * (size - len_b))\n    \n    # Perform NTT on both polynomials\n    fa = ntt(a)\n    fb = ntt(b)\n    \n    # Point-wise multiplication\n    for i in range(size):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # Inverse NTT to get the result polynomial\n    result = ntt(fa, inverse=True)\n    \n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[L][x] stores the number of ways to choose c_s values in a subtree\n    # rooted at depth L, such that M_s = x.\n    # We only need dp[L+1] to compute dp[L], so we can optimize space.\n    # `current_dp` will store dp[L+1] values, `next_dp` will store dp[L] values.\n\n    # Base case: L = n\n    # For a string s of length n, M_s = c_s.\n    # dp[n][x] = 1 for 0 <= x <= k.\n    current_dp = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for x in range(k + 1):\n        current_dp[x] = 1\n\n    # Loop for L from n-1 down to 1\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Step 2a & 2b: Compute P[S] = sum(dp[L+1][y0] * dp[L+1][y1] for y0+y1=S)\n        # This is a convolution of current_dp with itself.\n        # current_dp represents a polynomial P_L+1(X) = sum(current_dp[x] * X^x)\n        # We need P_L+1(X)^2.\n        \n        # Make a copy for NTT, as it modifies in-place\n        poly_a = list(current_dp) \n        \n        # Max degree for convolution result is k + k = 2k.\n        # Max length for NTT input is k+1.\n        # Result polynomial will have length up to 2k+1.\n        # Need to pad to power of 2.\n        \n        P_values = multiply_polynomials(poly_a, list(poly_a)) # P_values[S] is P[S]\n        \n        # P_values can have length up to 2k.
