You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Solving \"Replacing Digits\"**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to make a number `a` as large as possible by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence `s`, using each digit from `s` at most once.  My initial thought was, \"Maximize the most significant digits first!\" This screams \"greedy approach.\"  If a number has a larger digit at a certain position, it's bigger overall, right?\n\nThe first thing I did was think about how to represent the input. Since we're going to be changing digits, I thought a list of characters for `a` would be the easiest.  Then, I needed to make `s` efficient to use.  Sorting `s` in descending order seemed smart, because I'd always be picking the largest available digit.\n\nI started with this basic idea: go through `a` from left to right, and for each digit, try to replace it with the largest digit from `s` that's bigger. But the logic wasn't quite right, I initially assumed I could stop replacing digits once I encountered a digit in `a` larger or equal to the current largest in `s`. That would give an incorrect answer.\n\nI needed to refine the greedy strategy. My revised logic was, for each digit in `a`, search the available digits in `s` from `9` downward, and replace only if the available digit from `s` is strictly larger. If not, don't replace that digit and move to the next digit. If there's no suitable digit in `s` for that position, then don't change that current digit in `a`. After some thought, I realised that this replacement strategy needed a frequency map to keep track of the remaining digits from s.\n\nSo, the frequency map was the key. Then, the algorithm became clear: create a Counter for `s`, iterate through `a`, and try to replace each digit with a larger available digit from `s`. That's it!\n\nAfter coding this approach, I performed some test cases to check. I then tested the code again on the given examples and other various test cases. I was very pleased with the result of my greedy algorithm.\n\nFinally, I checked the time and space complexity to see if my solution was efficient enough. Everything checked out, the approach has a time complexity of O(N+M) and space complexity of O(1), making it very suitable for the constraints.\n",
