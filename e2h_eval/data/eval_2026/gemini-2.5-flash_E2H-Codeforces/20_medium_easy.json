For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Solving the Competitive Programming Problem: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to count the ways to set `c_s` values such that the biggest beautiful multiset has a size of precisely `f`.  I'm focusing on breaking this down:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Players:** I'm dealing with binary strings, `s`, of varying lengths and associated integer values, `c_s`. A \"beautiful\" multiset means no string's prefix count exceeds its corresponding `c_s`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Set Size, the Core:**  Given `c_s` values, I want the largest possible set size.  This led me to think of maximizing string occurrences subject to prefix count limits, and I initially considered maximum flow, but the input size made that inefficient.\n\n3.  **Trees to the Rescue:** I found a clever way to reframe the problem using a binary tree. Each string is a leaf, and `c_s` is a capacity on tree nodes (prefixes). The \"max set size\" translates to pushing as many leaves as possible down, respecting these capacity limits.  I realized this could be handled with dynamic programming!\n\n4.  **Dynamic Programming: The Heart of the Solution:** I'm using a DP table, `dp[len][val]`, that tracks how many ways to set `c_s` values starting at length `len` such that a certain value is the maximum size for that given string of length `len-1`.  The base case is assigning the values at length `n`. For recursive steps, I need to choose `c_{s_parent}` and then sum over all possibilities of `dp[s_parent0]` and `dp[s_parent1]`, the children nodes. I identified that convolution can be used to make the recursive calculation more efficient.\n\n5.  **Convolution and NTT:** The key is to convolve two polynomials created by the dynamic programming results. I'll need to use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to speed this convolution up, since simple convolution is too slow given the value of `k` (up to 200,000).\n\n6.  **Optimized Recurrence:**  I've refined the recurrence to efficiently handle prefix constraints and dynamic programming. I derived that `dp[len][val]` depends on the convolution of results for next level nodes of the tree, allowing for efficient calculations. I'm using suffix sums to get the result from convolution.\n\n7.  **Final Steps:** The answer will be found with a final convolution on the first level of my DP table. I'm carefully calculating the maximum possible size for the beautiful multiset.\n\n8.  **Complexity Analysis:** This dynamic programming, coupled with NTT, will be `O(n * k log k)` time-wise, which is efficient enough for this problem's constraints. I'm now down to the details of implementing this.  I just need to ensure my NTT implementation is correct, and I'll be good to go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all binary strings `s` of length 1 to `n` (where `0 <= c_s <= k`), such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined given all `c_s` values.\nLet `dp[s]` be the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nIf `|s| = n`, then `s` itself is a string of length `n`. The condition is that `s` can appear at most `c_s` times. So, `dp[s] = c_s`.\nIf `|s| < n`, then `s` has two children `s0` and `s1`. The strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix are exactly those that have `s0` as a prefix plus those that have `s1` as a prefix. So, `dp[s] = dp[s0] + dp[s1]`. However, we also have the constraint that the total count of strings with prefix `s` cannot exceed `c_s`. Therefore, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\n\nThe maximum total size of a beautiful multiset is `dp[0] + dp[1]`, where `0` and `1` are the binary strings of length 1. (The empty string `\"\"` is not considered, as `c_\"\"` is not defined).\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose `c_s` values such that `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\nSince the choices for `c_s` in the `0` branch and `1` branch are independent, we can use dynamic programming.\n\nLet `f_arr[len][val]` be the number of ways to assign `c_s'` for all strings `s'` of length `len` to `n` (and their descendants), such that for a *specific* string `s` of length `len-1`, `dp[s]` evaluates to `val`.\nThe maximum possible value for `dp[s]` is `k`.\nThe maximum possible value for `dp[s0] + dp[s1]` is `2k`.\n\n**Base Case:** `len = n`.\nFor a string `s` of length `n-1`, its children `s0` and `s1` are of length `n`.\n`dp[s0]` evaluates to `c_{s0}`, and `dp[s1]` evaluates to `c_{s1}`.\nSo, `f_arr[n][v]` is the number of ways to choose `c_s` for a string `s` of length `n` such that `dp[s]` (which is `c_s`) evaluates to `v`. This means `c_s = v`.\nSince `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, `f_arr[n][v] = 1` if `0 <= v <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step:** For `len` from `n` down to `2`.\nWe want to compute `f_arr[len-1][v_parent]`. This `v_parent` is the value of `dp[s_parent]` for a string `s_parent` of length `len-1`.\n`dp[s_parent] = min(c_{s_parent}, dp[s_parent \\cdot 0] + dp[s_parent \\cdot 1])`.\nLet `v_0` be the value of `dp[s_parent \\cdot 0]` and `v_1` be the value of `dp[s_parent \\cdot 1]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v_0` for `dp[s_parent \\cdot 0]` is `f_arr[len][v_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v_1` for `dp[s_parent \\cdot 1]` is `f_arr[len][v_1]`.\nSince the choices for `s_parent \\cdot 0` and `s_parent \\cdot 1` are independent, the number of ways to get `v_0` and `v_1` is `f_arr[len][v_0] * f_arr[len][v_1]`.\n\nLet `conv_f[len][V_sum]` be the sum `sum_{v_0 + v_1 = V_sum} (f_arr[len][v_0] * f_arr[len][v_1])`. This is a convolution.\n`V_sum` can range from `0` to `2k`. `conv_f[len]` can be computed using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in `O(k log k)` time.\n\nNow, we need to consider `c_{s_parent}`. `c_{s_parent}` can be any value from `0` to `k`.\n`v_parent = min(c_{s_parent}, V_sum)`.\nWe need to sum `conv_f[len][V_sum]` over `V_sum` and `c_{s_parent}` such that this condition holds.\nFor a fixed `v_parent`:\n1.  If `c_{s_parent} = v_parent`: Then `V_sum` must be `>= v_parent`. The number of ways to choose `c_{s_parent}` is 1. The contribution is `sum_{V_sum=v_parent to 2k} conv_f[len][V_sum]`.\n2.  If `c_{s_parent} > v_parent`: Then `V_sum` must be exactly `v_parent`. The number of ways to choose `c_{s_parent}` is `k - v_parent`. The contribution is `(k - v_parent) * conv_f[len][v_parent]`.\n\nLet `suff_conv_f[len][v]` be the suffix sum `sum_{V_sum=v to 2k} conv_f[len][V_sum]`. This can be computed in `O(k)` time.\nThen, `f_arr[len-1][v_parent] = ((k - v_parent) * conv_f[len][v_parent] + suff_conv_f[len][v_parent]) % MOD`.\nThis calculation is done for `v_parent` from `0` to `k`.\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter iterating `len` from `n` down to `2`, we will have `f_arr[1]`.\nThe total maximum size `f` is `dp[0] + dp[1]`.\n`dp[0]` evaluates to some `v_0_val`, and `dp[1]` evaluates to some `v_1_val`.\nThe number of ways to get `v_0_val` for `dp[0]` is `f_arr[1][v_0_val]`.\nThe number of ways to get `v_1_val` for `dp[1]` is `f_arr[1][v_1_val]`.\nWe need `v_0_val + v_1_val = f`.\nSo, the final answer is `sum_{v_0_val + v_1_val = f} (f_arr[1][v_0_val] * f_arr[1][v_1_val])`.\nThis is `conv_f[1][f]`. We compute `conv_f[1]` from `f_arr[1]` using NTT and then take the coefficient for `f`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   There are `n-1` iterations for `len` from `n` down to `2`.\n*   Each iteration involves:\n    *   One NTT for convolution: `O(k log k)`.\n    *   Suffix sum computation: `O(k)`.\n    *   Computing `f_arr[len-1]`: `O(k)`.\n*   Finally, one NTT for `conv_f[1]`: `O(k log k)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n * k log k)`.\nGiven `n <= 15`, `k <= 2e5`, `n * k log k approx 15 * 2e5 * log(2e5) approx 15 * 2e5 * 18 approx 5.4 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(k)` for storing DP arrays and NTT intermediate results.\n\n**Modulo Arithmetic and NTT details:**\nThe modulo is `998244353`. It is a prime number of the form `c * 2^p + 1` (`998244353 = 119 * 2^23 + 1`), making it suitable for NTT. A common primitive root `g=3` works for this modulo. The NTT implementation requires careful handling of powers of 2 for array sizes and inverse modulo operations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):\n        wlen = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = inverse(wlen)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inverse(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply_polynomials(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad arrays with zeros to length n\n    fa = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    fb = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    # Apply NTT\n    fa = ntt(fa, False)\n    fb = ntt(fb, False)\n    \n    # Point-wise multiplication\n    for i in range(n):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # Inverse NTT\n    fa = ntt(fa, True)\n    \n    return fa[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # f_arr[v] stores the number of ways for a single node at current level to evaluate to v\n    # Initialize for len = n (leaf nodes)\n    # For a string s of length n, dp[s] = c_s.
