He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Journey: Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about finding integers `n` such that `n!` ends in exactly `m` zeroes. The task is to count these `n`'s and list them. Right off the bat, I know trailing zeroes come from factors of 10, which means pairs of 2 and 5. Since 2s are abundant in factorials, it boils down to counting the 5s.\n\nI recall Legendre's formula. I'll use it to calculate the trailing zeroes in `n!`, let's call it `Z(n)`. It's basically `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ...` This sum grows as `n` increases. It looks like `Z(n)` will increase by roughly `n/4`.\n\nMy task is now to figure out which `n`s satisfy `Z(n) = m`. Crucially, I notice that `Z(n)` is *non-decreasing* and that it stays constant for a range of `n` values before jumping up. For example, `Z(5)` through `Z(9)` all equal 1, and only at `n = 10` does it go to 2.\n\nThis means that if a particular value, say `X`, is achieved by `Z(n)`, it's achieved for exactly 5 consecutive `n`s. This is because every multiple of 5 adds a zero, and then every multiple of 25 adds an additional zero and so on.\n\nThe problem bounds `m` from 1 to 100,000. To find `n`, the target value, I'll use binary search and a helper function to calculate `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`.  I can estimate that `n` will be roughly `4m`. Since I need the smallest `n`, my binary search will stop at the first `n` where `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` is *greater or equal* to `m`.\n\nSo, the binary search will give me `n_min`, the smallest `n` satisfying `Z(n) >= m`.  Then, I check if `Z(n_min)` *equals* `m`. If it does, then the answers are `n_min, n_min + 1, n_min + 2, n_min + 3, n_min + 4` and I can output 5. If it's *greater than* `m`, then I know `m` is skipped and there are no valid `n`s to print, so output 0.\n\nThat should be it!\n\nI'll now implement this with clean python. I also need to ensure the integers don't cause any overflow, but I know Python handles arbitrary integer sizes, so I'm good there! Let's get to coding.\n",
