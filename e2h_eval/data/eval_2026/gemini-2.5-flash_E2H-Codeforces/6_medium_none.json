Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on a Competitive Programming Problem: A Deep Dive into Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this voucher problem, and it's screaming for an efficient solution. The naive O(n^2) approach of comparing every pair of vouchers is immediately out the window. Given the size constraints, it's pretty clear we need something closer to O(n log n) or even better, O(n). The disjoint condition, where vouchers can't overlap, is the core hurdle. Let's start dissecting this…\n\nFirst, the input: `n` vouchers, a desired duration `x`, and the details of each voucher (start, end, cost). The goal is to find the cheapest *two* vouchers that perfectly sum to `x` in duration *and* don't overlap. Easy, right? \n\nLet's break down the conditions. We have two vouchers, `i` and `j`.  Their durations sum to `x`, their total cost is minimal, and they're disjoint. This \"disjoint\" part is key. That means one voucher *must* end before the other begins.  Initially, my gut said sorting by something might work. And since the start/end conditions are linked with disjointness, sorting vouchers by start or end dates seemed like a good starting point. \n\nThinking about disjointness, my mind went to two scenarios: either `voucher_i` ends before `voucher_j` starts, or `voucher_j` ends before `voucher_i` starts. The idea of sorting by start or end dates started to make sense as I realized processing in the right order could make finding the disjoint pair easier.\n\nNow, how to make the disjoint check efficient? I realized a sweep-line approach might be the key to efficiently check the conditions, using an algorithm that is often used for this kind of problems. It means we iterate through the vouchers in a particular order (sorted by start or end dates, I thought). While sorting the vouchers, I could use a data structure to maintain a list of 'potential' vouchers that are disjoint. As I moved the line, all of those are processed.\n\nI considered a few data structures. I thought about grouping by duration, but quickly realized this isn't enough, since we need to account for start/end days to ensure disjointness. And there it was: a \"sweep-line\" approach and dynamically maintaining the minimum cost for various durations seemed like the next step.\n\nI got stuck in the weeds for a while with the \"ending at or before\" and \"starting at or after\" thoughts. But, it seems that if I *sort* the vouchers based on end date (`ri`) and *process* them accordingly, I could, during the sweep, track a dynamic minimum cost for a duration that ends at or before the current sweep point (that `ri`). As I swept, for any voucher being considered, I could then, use the information gathered by the previous sweep to check the costs for disjointness. And that seemed correct. This method should efficiently check the `ri < lj` condition, and the symmetry of the problem suggests it'll implicitly take care of the `rj < li` condition as well. This, I think, should bring me to O(n) overall complexity.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers, `i` and `j`, such that their durations sum up to exactly `x`, they don't intersect, and their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote the duration of a voucher `k` as `dk = rk - lk + 1`.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  `i != j`\n2.  `di + dj = x`\n3.  Vouchers `i` and `j` don't intersect. This means `ri < lj` or `rj < li`.\n4.  Minimize `costi + costj`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `li` or `ri` is `2 * 10^5`. Let's call this `MAX_COORD`.\nA brute-force approach of checking all pairs of vouchers would be `O(N^2)`, which is too slow for `N = 2 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach, likely `O(N log N)` or `O(N + MAX_COORD)`.\n\nWe can solve this using a sweep-line algorithm. The key idea is to iterate through all possible days from `1` to `MAX_COORD`. As we sweep through the days, we maintain information about vouchers that have already ended, and use this information to find potential pairs with vouchers that are starting.\n\nLet `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d]` be an array that stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has ended on or before the current day in our sweep. Initialize all entries in this array to infinity.\n\nWe need to efficiently access vouchers based on their start and end days. We can pre-process the input vouchers into two lists:\n*   `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`: A list of `(r, duration, cost)` tuples for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n*   `vouchers_by_end_day[day]`: A list of `(duration, cost)` tuples for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n\nThe sweep-line algorithm works as follows:\n1.  Initialize `ans = float('inf')`.\n2.  Initialize `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day = [float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1)`.\n3.  Pre-process the input vouchers to populate `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`. For each voucher `(li, ri, costi)`, calculate its `duration = ri - li + 1`. Add `(ri, duration, costi)` to `vouchers_by_start_day[li]` and `(duration, costi)` to `vouchers_by_end_day[ri]`.\n\n4.  Iterate `day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Process vouchers that start on `day`**: These vouchers can potentially be the *second* voucher (`v_j`) in a non-intersecting pair `(v_i, v_j)` where `ri < lj`. For such a pair, `lj` would be the current `day`.\n        For each `(r, d, cost)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`:\n        *   Calculate the required duration for the first voucher: `d_needed = x - d`.\n        *   If `d_needed > 0` (duration must be positive) and `d_needed <= MAX_COORD` (duration cannot exceed max possible day coordinate):\n            *   Check `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_needed]`. If it's not `float('inf')`, it means we have found a `v_i` with duration `d_needed` that ended *before* `day`.\n            *   Update `ans = min(ans, cost + min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_needed])`.\n\n    b.  **Process vouchers that end on `day`**: These vouchers can potentially be the *first* voucher (`v_i`) in a non-intersecting pair `(v_i, v_j)` where `ri < lj`. For such a pair, `ri` would be the current `day`. We update our `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day` array with these vouchers.\n        For each `(d, cost)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[day]`:\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d] = min(min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d], cost)`.\n\n5.  After the sweep, if `ans` is still `float('inf')`, it means no such pair was found, so print `-1`. Otherwise, print `ans`.\n\n**Why this covers both `ri < lj` and `rj < li`:**\nThe sweep processes days in increasing order. When we are at `day = D`:\n*   `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_A]` contains the minimum cost of a voucher `v_A` with duration `d_A` that ended on any day `r_A < D`.\n*   When we consider a voucher `v_B` that starts on `day = D` (`l_B = D`), we check `cost_B + min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[x - d_B]`. This effectively finds a pair `(v_A, v_B)` where `r_A < D = l_B`, which satisfies the `ri < lj` condition.\nSince the total cost `cost_A + cost_B` is symmetric, this single sweep covers all valid non-intersecting pairs regardless of which voucher comes first chronologically.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Pre-processing vouchers: `O(N)` to iterate through `N` vouchers and append to lists.\n*   Sweep-line: The loop runs `MAX_COORD` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, processing `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` takes time proportional to the number of vouchers starting on `day`. The sum of lengths of all `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` lists is `N`.\n    *   Similarly, processing `vouchers_by_end_day[day]` takes time proportional to the number of vouchers ending on `day`. The sum of lengths of all `vouchers_by_end_day[day]` lists is `N`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`. Given `N, MAX_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`: `O(N + MAX_COORD)` in the worst case (e.g., if all vouchers start/end on distinct days, or if all vouchers are stored).\n*   `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day`: `O(MAX_COORD)`.\nTotal space complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_COORD = 2 * 10**5\n\n    # vouchers_by_start_day[day] stores list of (r, duration, cost)\n    vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n    # vouchers_by_end_day[day] stores list of (duration, cost)\n    vouchers_by_end_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, duration, cost))\n        vouchers_by_end_day[r].append((duration, cost))\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d] stores the minimum cost\n    # of a voucher with duration 'd' that has ended on or before the current day.\n    min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day = [float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1)\n\n    for day in range(1, MAX_COORD + 1):\n        # Step 1: Process vouchers that start on 'day'.\n        # These can be the second voucher (v_j) in a pair (v_i, v_j) where v_i ends before v_j starts.\n        # So, v_i must have ended on a day < 'day'.\n        for r_j, d_j, cost_j in vouchers_by_start_day[day]:\n            d_i_needed = x - d_j\n            if d_i_needed > 0 and d_i_needed <= MAX_COORD:\n                if min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_i_needed] != float('inf'):\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_j + min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_i_needed])\n        \n        # Step 2: Process vouchers that end on 'day'.\n        # These vouchers can be the first voucher (v_i) in a pair (v_i, v_j) where v_i ends before v_j starts.\n        # We update our records for vouchers that have now ended on or before 'day'.\n        for d_i, cost_i in vouchers_by_end_day[day]:\n            min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_i] = min(min_cost_for_duration_ending_at_or_before_day[d_i], cost_i)\n\n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
