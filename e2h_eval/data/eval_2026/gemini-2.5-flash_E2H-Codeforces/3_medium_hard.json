Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. Sounds straightforward enough. The core is figuring out the *minimum* radius of light, *d*, for these lanterns to cover the entire street, from 0 to *l*. The input is the street length *l*, the number of lanterns *n*, and their positions, *a_i*. The output has to be *d*, with high precision.\n\n**Strategic Approach**\n\nFirst thing, I know sorting the lantern positions is key. Sorting lets us easily determine the gaps between them.\n\n**Covering the Street**\n\nWe've got to cover the ends, 0 and *l*, and the gaps in between. To cover 0, the first lantern must be at or before 0 + *d*. Minimizing *d* means the closest lantern to 0 does the job. Same for covering *l*, the last lantern needs to be at or after *l* - *d*. Then, for the gaps between the sorted lanterns *a_i* and *a_{i+1}*, to ensure coverage, they must either overlap or touch. This gives us the equation *a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d* which simplifies to *d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2*.\n\n**Minimizing 'd'**\n\nSo to minimize *d*, it must satisfy these conditions:\n\n*   *d >= a_1* (where *a_1* is the first lantern).\n*   *d >= l - a_n* (where *a_n* is the last lantern).\n*   *d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2* for all adjacent lantern pairs *a_i* and *a_{i+1}*.\n\nWe pick the maximum among these values.\n\n**Implementation Steps**\n\n1.  Read in *n* and *l*.\n2.  Read in all lantern positions *a_i*.\n3.  Sort the *a_i* list into *a\\_sorted*.\n4.  Calculate the required *d* for the left edge (distance from 0 to the leftmost lantern).\n5.  Calculate the required *d* for the right edge (distance from *l* to the rightmost lantern).\n6.  Loop through adjacent lanterns and find the largest gap and the *d* needed for this gap.\n7.  The final result will be the maximum *d* found in the previous steps.\n8.  Output with high precision.\n\n**Edge Cases & Precision**\n\nFor edge cases, if the first lantern is at 0 or the last is at *l*, it's good, so no special logic is needed. Precision should be handled by using the Python's built-in `float` type and ensuring a consistent precision when printing. The problem's constraints mean there won't be integer overflow issues. My plan is to use f-strings for precise output. I need to make sure the final code does not have any extraneous comments. I will also add detailed, but concise comments in the final code. Let's start coding.\n",
