And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Efficient Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with calculating the average sleep time over a series of \"weeks\" defined by a sliding window of size *k* within a sleep record of *n* days. The brute-force approach, which involves iterating through each possible week and summing up the sleep times for those *k* days, would lead to an `O(n^2)` time complexity. This is too slow.\n\nThe crucial insight here is to use a sliding window technique. We can compute the sum for the first window of *k* days. Then, to calculate the sum for the next window, we can simply subtract the sleep time of the departing day and add the sleep time of the incoming day, all in constant `O(1)` time. This way, we can compute the sum for all `n - k + 1` weeks in a single pass in `O(n)` time, giving us an optimal solution.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example: Let `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`. We have two weeks.\nWeek 1: `[3, 4]`, sum = `7`\nWeek 2: `[4, 7]`, sum = `11`\nTotal Sum = `18`. Average is `18/2 = 9`.\n\nUsing the sliding window method, we compute the sum of the first window. Then, for the next window, just subtract the first day and add the next day. This takes `O(n)` time.\n\nThis approach involves reading the inputs `n, k` and the array `a`, calculating the sum of the initial window (`current_sum`), then looping for `n-k` times calculating the `total_sum_of_weeks` using a sliding window.  We will use Python's built-in arbitrary precision integers, to handle the calculations. Because it's a floating point average, let's keep it that way, dividing by the `n-k+1` to get the average. Time complexity for is `O(n)`.\n\nWe'll need to use floating-point division for the final result to meet the specified precision requirements, and we can utilize Python's concise syntax to do so. In general, it's good to be aware that floating-point arithmetic can introduce small errors due to the limitations of representing real numbers.\n\nAfter all that, it's all about implementing and testing. The critical logic is sliding the window, subtracting the departing day and adding the arriving day at each step.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. Given `n` days of sleep records `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks. For example, the first week covers days `a_1, ..., a_k`, the second week covers `a_2, ..., a_{k+1}`, and so on, up to the last week covering `a_{n-k+1}, ..., a_n`. We need to sum the sleep times for all these `n - k + 1` weeks, and then divide by `n - k + 1` to get the overall average.\n\nLet's denote the sum of sleep times for the week starting on day `i` (0-indexed) as `S_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}`. The total sum required for the average is `TotalSum = S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}`. The final answer will be `TotalSum / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nGiven the constraints `n <= 2 * 10^5`, a naive approach of calculating each `S_i` by summing `k` elements would take `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time, which is `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k = n/2`). This would be too slow for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nA more efficient approach involves using a sliding window technique.\n1. **Calculate the sum of the first window:** Compute `current_sum = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{k-1}`. This takes `O(k)` time.\n2. **Initialize `TotalSum`:** Set `TotalSum = current_sum`.\n3. **Slide the window:** For each subsequent week, we can update `current_sum` in `O(1)` time. To get the sum for the window starting at index `i` from the sum of the window starting at `i-1`:\n   `S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.\n   This means we subtract the element that leaves the window (`a_{i-1}`) and add the new element that enters the window (`a_{i+k-1}`).\n   We repeat this for `i` from `1` to `n - k`. In each step, we add the new `current_sum` to `TotalSum`. This takes `O(n - k)` time.\n\nThe total time complexity will be `O(k)` for the initial sum plus `O(n - k)` for sliding, resulting in an overall `O(n)` time complexity. The space complexity is `O(n)` to store the input array `a`.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1. `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n2. Initial window (indices `0` to `k-1`): `a[0], a[1]` which are `[3, 4]`.\n   `current_sum = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n   `TotalSum = 7`.\n3. Slide window (for `i` from `1` to `n-k = 1`):\n   For `i = 1`:\n     `current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n     `current_sum = current_sum - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n     `current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n     `TotalSum = TotalSum + current_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n4. Loop finishes.\n5. Average = `TotalSum / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\nThe maximum possible `TotalSum` would be when `n = 2 * 10^5`, `k = 1`, and all `a_i = 10^5`. In this case, each `a_i` is a week sum, and `TotalSum = sum(a_i)` for all `i`. This would be `2 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 2 * 10^{10}`, which fits perfectly within Python's arbitrary-precision integers. The division will then yield a float, satisfying the precision requirement.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first k elements\n    current_window_sum = sum(a[i] for i in range(k))\n    \n    # Initialize total_sum_of_weeks with the sum of the first window\n    total_sum_of_weeks = current_window_sum\n\n    # Slide the window through the rest of the array\n    # The loop runs from the second window (starting at index 1)\n    # up to the last possible window (starting at index n-k)\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # Subtract the element leaving the window (a[i-1])\n        # Add the element entering the window (a[i+k-1])\n        current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum_of_weeks += current_window_sum\n    \n    # The number of weeks considered is n - k + 1\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks\n    \n    # Output the result with required precision\n    print(f\"{average_sleep_time:.10f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
