            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Base Conversion**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core is to convert a number from one base to another. We've got a number `c` in base `a`, and we want it in base `b`. Base `b` could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. Let's break this into chunks.\n\nFirst, we need to read in the input: `a`, `b`, and `c`.  Then, the main steps are:\n\n1.  **Base `a` to Decimal:** Convert `c` (which is a string) from base `a` to its decimal equivalent (base 10).\n2.  **Decimal to Base `b`:**  Convert the decimal number to base `b`. If `b` is an integer, it's straightforward. If `b` is 'R', it means converting to Roman numerals.\n\nFor step 1, I'll need a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)`. The digits in base `a` can go up to 'O' (24) since `a` is between 2 and 25.\n\nFor step 2, I need two sub-functions:\n\n*   `from_decimal(decimal_val, base)` for converting to an integer base.\n*   `to_roman(decimal_val)` for converting to Roman numerals.\n\nThe tricky bit is the Roman numeral conversion, with its subtractive rules (like IV, IX). I'll use a lookup table for that.\n\nLet's dive into the details.\n\n**Reading Input:**\n\nThe input format is two lines: `a b` and `c`. Easy enough to split and read as integers and a string. I can use `input()` and `.split()`.\n\n**Base `a` to Decimal Conversion:**\n\nMy `to_decimal` function will handle any base from 2 up to 25.  I'll use a helper function `char_to_val(char)` to map characters ('0'-'9', 'A'-'O') to their corresponding integer values. The conversion will loop through the digits from right to left, multiplying each digit by the base raised to the appropriate power.  The problem states there might be leading zeros, but this conversion will handle them automatically.\n\n**Decimal to Base `b`:**\n\n*   **Integer Base (`b` is an integer):** The `from_decimal` function will repeatedly divide the decimal number by the base and take the remainders. The remainders, when read in reverse, form the digits in base `b`. I also need a `val_to_char(val)` function to map integer values to the correct character representation (0-9, A-O).\n*   **Roman Numerals (`b` is 'R'):** I'll use a predefined `ROMAN_MAP` with pairs of (value, symbol) in descending order. Then, I'll iterate through the map, repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value from the decimal number and appending the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nThe main function will read the input, call `to_decimal`, then call either `from_decimal` or `to_roman` depending on `b`, and finally print the result. I should be done.\n\nI need to make sure to handle all the edge cases and constraints, but this looks like a good, solid solution. I think I've covered everything. Time to write the code!\n",
