Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This Guard Duty Problem!**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem staring me down, and my first instinct, as always, is to break it down. The core challenge is pretty clear: we need to pair up Rebel spaceships (`R`) with bases (`B`) in a way that *doesn't* create any intersecting paths.  And the problem statement is thankfully providing some crucial clues.\n\nFirst, the obvious: `R` has to equal `B`.  If they don't match, we immediately output \"No\" and move on.  Simple.\n\nThe real meat of the problem is in the geometric constraint: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not cross. This instantly makes me think about intersection checks.  Fortunately, the constraint that `R` and `B` are small (at most 10) is a *huge* relief! It tells me I can probably get away with a brute-force approach, maybe with a little backtracking or permutation magic. Exponential complexity shouldn't be a deal-breaker here.\n\nNow, how do we *actually* check for intersections? Well, the problem statement provides the perfect framework, reminding me of the classic geometric solution using the cross product or the orientation test. Given two segments, `AB` and `CD`, they intersect if and only if points `A` and `B` are on opposite sides of the line `CD`, *and* points `C` and `D` are on opposite sides of the line `AB`.  This will involve calculating orientations of point triplets.\n\nSo I'll need a function `orientation(p, q, r)` that tells me if the points are collinear, clockwise, or counter-clockwise.  Thankfully, the problem statement *guarantees* no three points are collinear (which simplifies the intersection checks, though I'll need to keep in mind that endpoints can touch).  The formula for this is straightforward to implement, a simple cross product calculation using the points' coordinates.\n\nOnce I have the `orientation` function, I can write the main part. I'll iterate through all possible pairings (permutations) of spaceships and bases.  For each pairing, I'll iterate through every *pair* of segments and use the intersection check I've just laid out. If any pair intersects, I discard that pairing and move on.\n\nThis approach seems feasible. The small size of `R` and `B` makes a brute-force solution quite manageable, and the orientation test provides an efficient way to check for intersections.  Now, time to turn these thoughts into Python code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a perfect matching between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two paths (straight line segments) from a base to its assigned spaceship intersect. If such a matching exists, we output \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nFirst, a perfect matching requires an equal number of spaceships and bases. So, if `R != B`, it's impossible, and we should immediately output \"No\".\n\nThe constraints `R, B <= 10` are very small. This suggests that a solution with exponential complexity in `R` (or `B`) might be acceptable. A common approach for small `N` with permutations is to try all possible assignments.\n\nLet's assume `R = B = N`. We have `N` spaceships and `N` bases. We can fix the order of spaceships (e.g., `S_0, S_1, ..., S_{N-1}`). Then, we need to find a permutation `P` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` such that spaceship `S_i` is assigned to base `B_{P[i]}` for all `i`. There are `N!` such permutations. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is a feasible number of permutations to check.\n\nFor each permutation, we generate `N` segments: `(S_0, B_{P[0]}), (S_1, B_{P[1]}), ..., (S_{N-1}, B_{P[N-1]})`. Then, we need to check if any pair of these segments intersects.\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check:**\nTwo line segments `AB` and `CD` intersect if and only if:\n1.  Points `A` and `B` lie on opposite sides of the line `CD`, AND\n2.  Points `C` and `D` lie on opposite sides of the line `AB`.\n\nThis can be determined using the concept of orientation (cross product). For an ordered triplet of points `(p, q, r)`, the orientation function `orientation(p, q, r)` returns:\n*   `0` if `p, q, r` are collinear.\n*   `1` if `p, q, r` are in clockwise order.\n*   `2` if `p, q, r` are in counter-clockwise order.\n\nThe value is calculated as `(q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)`.\n*   If `val > 0`, counter-clockwise (`2`).\n*   If `val < 0`, clockwise (`1`).\n*   If `val == 0`, collinear (`0`).\n\nGiven the problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", the collinear case (`orientation == 0`) will not occur for `(A, C, D)` or `(B, C, D)` etc., unless one of the points is an endpoint of the other segment.\n\nTwo segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if:\n`(orientation(p1, q1, p2) != orientation(p1, q1, q2))` AND\n`(orientation(p2, q2, p1) != orientation(p2, q2, q1))`\n\nThis condition correctly identifies proper intersections (where segments cross). It also handles cases where an endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment. For example, if `p2` lies on `p1q1`, then `orientation(p1, q1, p2)` would be `0`. The problem statement \"do not intersect\" implies they should not cross. Touching at endpoints is generally allowed and doesn't count as an intersection in this context. The given intersection check works for this.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  Define a helper function `orientation(p, q, r)` that calculates the orientation of points `p, q, r`.\n6.  Define a helper function `segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2)` that returns `True` if segments `(s1_p1, s1_p2)` and `(s2_p1, s2_p2)` intersect, `False` otherwise.\n    *   It uses the `orientation` function.\n    *   It's important to note that if two segments share an endpoint, they do not intersect in the sense of crossing, so we should return `False` if `s1_p1` is `s2_p1` or `s2_p2`, or `s1_p2` is `s2_p1` or `s2_p2`.\n7.  Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible permutations of indices `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` for the bases.\n8.  For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Assume spaceship `rebels[i]` is assigned to base `bases[p[i]]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n    b.  Create a list of `N` segments `current_segments`.\n    c.  Initialize `has_intersection = False`.\n    d.  Iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(seg1, seg2)` from `current_segments`.\n        i.  If `segments_intersect(seg1.p1, seg1.p2, seg2.p1, seg2.p2)` returns `True`, set `has_intersection = True` and break from the inner loops (no need to check further pairs for this permutation).\n    e.  If `has_intersection` is still `False` after checking all pairs, it means we found a valid non-intersecting matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n9.  If the loop finishes without finding any valid permutation, print \"No\".\n\n**Point and Segment Representation:**\nA simple way to represent points is as tuples `(x, y)`.\nA segment can be represented as a tuple of two points `((x1, y1), (x2, y2))`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to calculate orientation of an ordered triplet (p, q, r)\n# Returns 0 if collinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # Collinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # Clockwise or Counter-clockwise\n\n# Helper function to check if two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Check if segments share an endpoint.
