He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through String Validation**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to determine if a string, `S`, adheres to this specific rule set. Let's break down the conditions. First, the string has to follow a strict pattern: a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. It's essentially like a monotonically increasing, alphabetically sorted string. No character can come out of order, which makes things simpler from a processing perspective.\n\nNow, there are some minimum requirements for the counts of each character. There has to be at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This ensures the string isn't just an empty or partial string. So, if I break down the string into `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` representing the respective character counts, they all have to be at least one.\n\nThe crucial part is the constraint on `count_c`. It has to be equal to either `count_a` or `count_b`, or both. This will determine if the input string is valid. Essentially, the number of 'c's must match either the 'a's or the 'b's (or both if the numbers of 'a' and 'b' are the same).\n\nTo check these conditions, I should probably parse the string character by character. I'll need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's, ensuring that they appear in the correct order. The algorithm should look something like this: iterate through the string, find the boundaries between characters, and then compare the counts to see if they fit the 'count_c' rule.\n",
