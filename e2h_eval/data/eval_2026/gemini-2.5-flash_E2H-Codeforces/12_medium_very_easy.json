The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution Design: Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. The core idea is pretty straightforward: minimize the travel time on a circular road. We've got `n` houses, `m` tasks, and Xenia can only move clockwise.  I've broken it down step by step to ensure a clear solution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I'm given the number of houses (`n`), the number of tasks (`m`), and an array `a` where `a[i]` is the house for the i-th task. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete the tasks in sequence. Each house is adjacent, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nI've carefully considered how the movement works. It's clockwise, which means going from house `i` to `j` could involve going through the entire circle. I need to keep track of Xenia's current position and calculate the time taken for each move, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\nI've gone through the sample cases and traced the example outputs to verify the logic. To calculate the time, I've defined two scenarios:\n\n1.  If the target house is the same or further than her current house (`target_house >= current_house`), the time is simply the difference.\n2.  If the target house is before her current house (`target_house < current_house`), she has to go all the way around. This means the time is calculated as `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI've tested this logic thoroughly with example values to confirm its correctness, even considering the edge cases. I've re-verified this edge case calculation logic for different scenarios and confirmed its accuracy.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m), which is acceptable for the given constraints (up to 10^5 tasks). The code's going to iterate through the tasks once, and all other operations will be constant. Memory-wise, it's also O(m) to store the tasks, which is fine within the problem's constraints.\n\nThe implementation should be quick and efficient: read in the input, initialize the current house and total time, iterate through the tasks, calculate the time for each move (based on the formula derived above), and update the current house and total time. Finally, the code will output the total minimum time. I'm using the typical competitive programming method of reading input and writing output for efficiency, so the code should run smoothly. Overall, I am confident in this approach.\n",
