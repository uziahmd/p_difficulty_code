The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem to tackle. The goal is to figure out the wins and losses for two players over a potentially massive number of rounds. My initial thought is that simulating *every single round* is a non-starter, given `n` can go up to 2 billion! I need a clever approach.\n\nI've zeroed in on the key details: the total rounds (`n`), the sequences each player uses (strings `A` and `B`), and the cyclic nature of their play. Nikephoros's sequence (`A`) has length `m`, and Polycarpus's sequence (`B`) has length `k`. They just keep repeating their patterns.\n\nThe insight? This cyclical behavior means the *combined* pattern of their moves also repeats. Specifically, the combined pattern will repeat after a number of rounds equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.  Since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, the LCM won't be too huge.  It'll be at most a million rounds. This is key, because I can work with that!\n\nSo, the plan is to figure out the wins and losses within a single LCM cycle. I'll calculate the LCM using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to optimize things. Then, I'll simulate that single cycle and count the losses for each player.  Once I have those counts, it's just a matter of scaling up to the total number of rounds, `n`.\n\nI'll divide `n` by the LCM to find the number of full cycles. The wins/losses from those cycles are straightforward.  The remainder after the division will be handled separately, by simulating those few extra rounds.\n\nHere's how I see the algorithm playing out:\n\n1.  **Input:** Read `n`, `A`, and `B`.\n2.  **Cycle Calculation:** Find `m` and `k`, calculate the LCM (`l`) using the `math.gcd` function.\n3.  **Simulate One Cycle:**  Iterate through `l` rounds, determining each player's move using the modulo operator (e.g., `A[i % m]`).  Compare the moves and increment the loss counters for each player based on who loses.\n4.  **Full Cycles:** Determine how many full LCM cycles are within `n`. Multiply the wins/losses from a single cycle by this number.\n5.  **Remaining Rounds:** Calculate the remaining rounds after accounting for the full cycles and simulate them to account for extra wins/losses.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Sum the losses from full cycles and remaining rounds to get the total losses for each player.\n\nThis approach should be pretty efficient. I'm leveraging the cyclical nature of the problem to avoid brute-force simulation.\n",
