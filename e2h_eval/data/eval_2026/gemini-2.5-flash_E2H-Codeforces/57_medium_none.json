His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown: Vasya's Olympiad Ranking**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in this Olympiad, given the scores from two rounds. The tricky part? We don't know which scores from round 'a' correspond to which scores from round 'b'. It's all jumbled up, which means I have some control over how the scores are paired. I also know Vasya's total score is at least 'x'.\n\n**The \"No Names\" Factor & Ranking Strategy**\n\nThe fact that we don't have specific names assigned to scores is the key. It means I can *strategically* pair up the scores to either maximize or minimize Vasya's rank. To get the *best* rank, I want Vasya's total score to be as high as possible compared to everyone else. The \"jury's discretion\" in case of ties is another advantage.\n\n**Best-Case Scenario: Always Rank 1**\n\nAfter analyzing, I realized Vasya's best possible rank is always 1. Why? Because the problem guarantees there's at least one pair of scores that adds up to 'x' or more. I can pair the highest score from round 'a' with the highest from round 'b' (or the next best, if that sum is too low). Since the problem states `a_i + b_j >= x` is guaranteed to exist. I can always make Vasya be the highest scorer, or at least tied, and get the jury to place Vasya first!\n\n**Worst-Case Scenario: Minimizing Vasya's Score**\n\nTo get the *worst* rank, it becomes a bit more complex. My goal is to maximize the number of competitors that score at least as high as Vasya. It is not about making Vasya's score the smallest possible, but it is about maximizing the \"competitors higher\". My best chance is to make Vasya's score as small as possible while still being at least 'x'. I'll need to figure out what that minimum score is and then try to pair the other scores to create as many equal or higher scores as possible.\n\n**Finding Vasya's Lowest Possible Score (While >= x)**\n\nMy main strategy becomes to first, find `S_min_vasya`. I'll sort the scores from both rounds and use a two-pointer approach to efficiently locate the smallest possible sum that meets the 'x' threshold. I'll need to determine this minimum sum of `a_i + b_j`. Once that `S_min_vasya` is figured out, I'll need to calculate how many other participants could score that high or higher. Then, by adjusting the pairs and applying the jury rule about ties, I should have Vasya's rank maximized.\n\nThe worst possible rank is equivalent to finding the smallest total sum for Vasya and, in the `n-1` remaining participants, maximize their scores to match `S_min_vasya` or larger, so that the total of elements strictly higher + elements that equal `S_min_vasya` (including Vasya) would equal the worst rank for Vasya.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given his minimum total score `x` and the lists of scores for the first and second tours. The key challenge is that we don't know which first-tour score belongs to which second-tour score; we can form any permutation of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` using all `a_i`'s and `b_j`'s exactly once.\n\n**1. Best Possible Place for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya should aim for the highest possible total score. The highest possible score any participant can get is `max(a) + max(b)`.\nThe problem guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This implies that `max(a) + max(b)` must be at least `x` (because `max(a) >= a_i` and `max(b) >= b_j` for any `i, j`).\nTherefore, Vasya can be assigned the `max(a)` score from the first tour and the `max(b)` score from the second tour. His total score would be `max(a) + max(b)`.\nSince `max(a) + max(b)` is the highest possible score any participant can achieve, no other participant can score strictly higher than Vasya.\nIf other participants also achieve `max(a) + max(b)` points, the problem states that \"it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice\". For the best case scenario, the jury would place Vasya first among all participants with the highest score.\nThus, Vasya can always achieve the **1st place**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Place for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank (numerically largest rank), we need to:\na. Choose a pair `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nb. Pair the remaining `n-1` scores such that as many participants as possible score *greater than or equal to* Vasya's score.\nc. If other participants have the same score as Vasya, the jury places them higher than Vasya.\n\nLet Vasya's score be `S_V`. If `k` participants (including Vasya) score `S_V` or more, and Vasya is placed last among them, his rank would be `k`. So, we want to maximize `k`.\n\nThe maximum number of participants that can score `K` or more, for any given `K`, can be found using a greedy two-pointer approach:\n1. Sort array `a` in ascending order (`a_s`).\n2. Sort array `b` in ascending order (`b_s`).\n3. Initialize a counter `count = 0`.\n4. Use two pointers: `ptr_a = 0` (for `a_s`) and `ptr_b = n - 1` (for `b_s`).\n5. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n   If `a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] >= K`:\n     We found a pair that sums to at least `K`. Increment `count`. To maximize such pairs, we use the smallest available `a_s[ptr_a]` with the largest available `b_s[ptr_b]`. Then move both pointers: `ptr_a++`, `ptr_b--`.\n   Else (`a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] < K`):\n     The current `a_s[ptr_a]` is too small to form a sum of `K` or more even with `b_s[ptr_b]` (the largest available `b` at this point). So, `a_s[ptr_a]` cannot be part of any pair summing to `K` or more. Discard `a_s[ptr_a]` and try a larger `a`: `ptr_a++`.\nThis `count` represents the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `K`.\n\nTo find Vasya's worst rank:\n1. We need to determine the score `S_V` Vasya will get. To maximize his rank (make it numerically large), we want to maximize `count_ge(S_V)`. Since `count_ge(K)` is a non-increasing function of `K`, this means we should choose the *smallest possible score* `S_V` for Vasya such that `S_V >= x`. Let's call this `S_min_vasya`.\n2. `S_min_vasya` can be found efficiently:\n   a. Sort `a` in ascending order (`a_s`).\n   b. Sort `b` in ascending order (`b_s`).\n   c. Initialize `S_min_vasya = infinity` (or a sufficiently large value like `2 * 10^5 + 1`).\n   d. Use two pointers: `ptr_a = 0` (for `a_s`) and `ptr_b = n - 1` (for `b_s`).\n   e. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n      If `a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        `S_min_vasya = min(S_min_vasya, a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b])`.\n        To try to find an even smaller sum that is still `>= x`, we must use a smaller `b` value: `ptr_b--`.\n      Else (`a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] < x`):\n        The current `a_s[ptr_a]` is too small to combine with `b_s[ptr_b]` (even the largest available `b` after previous decrements) to reach `x`. We need a larger `a`: `ptr_a++`.\n   This `S_min_vasya` is the smallest total score Vasya can achieve while satisfying the `x` requirement.\n3. Once `S_min_vasya` is found, calculate `count_ge(S_min_vasya)` using the two-pointer method described above. This count will be Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Example):**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n1. **Best Place:**\n   `max(a) = 6`, `max(b) = 8`.\n   Vasya's score can be `6 + 8 = 14`.\n   Since `14 >= x=7`, Vasya can achieve 14 points, which is the maximum possible. So, best place is **1**.\n\n2. **Worst Place:**\n   Sorted `a_s = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n   Sorted `b_s = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n   **Find `S_min_vasya` (minimum score >= `x=7`):**\n   `S_min_vasya = infinity`\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=5 (b_s[5]=8)`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. `S_min_vasya = 11`. `ptr_b=4`.\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=4 (b_s[4]=6)`. `3+6=9 >= 7`. `S_min_vasya = 9`. `ptr_b=3`.\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=3 (b_s[3]=4)`. `3+4=7 >= 7`. `S_min_vasya = 7`. `ptr_b=2`.\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=2 (b_s[2]=4)`. `3+4=7 >= 7`. `S_min_vasya = 7`. `ptr_b=1`.\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=1 (b_s[1]=3)`. `3+3=6 < 7`. `ptr_a=1`.\n   `ptr_a=1 (a_s[1]=4), ptr_b=1 (b_s[1]=3)`. `4+3=7 >= 7`. `S_min_vasya = 7`. `ptr_b=0`.\n   `ptr_a=1 (a_s[1]=4), ptr_b=0 (b_s[0]=0)`. `4+0=4 < 7`. `ptr_a=2`.\n   ... (continue until `ptr_a` or `ptr_b` goes out of bounds) ...\n   Eventually, `S_min_vasya` remains **7**.\n\n   **Calculate `count_ge(7)`:**\n   `count = 0`\n   `ptr_a=0 (a_s[0]=3), ptr_b=5 (b_s[5]=8)`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. `count=1`. `ptr_a=1, ptr_b=4`.\n   `ptr_a=1 (a_s[1]=4), ptr_b=4 (b_s[4]=6)`. `4+6=10 >= 7`. `count=2`. `ptr_a=2, ptr_b=3`.\n   `ptr_a=2 (a_s[2]=4), ptr_b=3 (b_s[3]=4)`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count=3`. `ptr_a=3, ptr_b=2`.\n   `ptr_a=3 (a_s[3]=4), ptr_b=2 (b_s[2]=4)`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count=4`. `ptr_a=4, ptr_b=1`.\n   `ptr_a=4 (a_s[4]=5), ptr_b=1 (b_s[1]=3)`. `5+3=8 >= 7`. `count=5`. `ptr_a=5, ptr_b=0`.\n   `ptr_a=5 (a_s[5]=6), ptr_b=0 (b_s[0]=0)`. `6+0=6 < 7`. `ptr_a=6`.\n   Loop ends. `count` is **5**.\n   Worst place is **5**.\n\nBoth best and worst cases match the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Sorting `a` and `b`: `O(N log N)`.\n- Finding `S_min_vasya`: `O(N)` using two pointers.\n- Calculating `count_ge(S_min_vasya)`: `O(N)` using two pointers.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)`, which is efficient enough for `N=10^5`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for storing sorted arrays (or `O(1)` if sorting in-place and input arrays can be modified).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible place for Vasya\n    # Vasya can always choose the highest score from tour 1 and highest from tour 2.\n    # The problem guarantees that at least one pair (a_i, b_j) sums to >= x.\n    # Therefore, max(a) + max(b) must be >= x.\n    # Since max(a) + max(b) is the highest possible score any participant can get,\n    # Vasya can achieve this score.
