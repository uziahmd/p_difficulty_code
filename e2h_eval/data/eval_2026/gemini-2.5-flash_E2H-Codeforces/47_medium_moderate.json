During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The Quest for Minimal LCM**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The problem is to find a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. My first instinct is to try and simplify the LCM calculation.  I know `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. So let's use that. I'll call `a+k` as `x` and `b+k` as `y`.\n\nThe crucial thing here is the greatest common divisor, `g = gcd(x, y)`. Since `g` divides both `x` and `y`, it also divides their difference, which is `b - a`. I'll call that difference `D`. This means `g` *must* be a divisor of `D`. This feels important because it limits the possible values of `g`.\n\nIf `a` and `b` are equal, this becomes pretty trivial. The answer is simply `k=0`, and the minimum LCM is `a`. So, let's assume `a` is not equal to `b`.\n\nNow, for a fixed divisor `g` of `D`, the challenge is to find the right `k`.  I need `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` are both divisible by `g`. This means `a+k` should be congruent to 0 mod `g`. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this is a modular inverse.  It can be calculated as  `k = (-a % g + g) % g`. This also guarantees `b+k` is divisible by `g`.\n\nI have a strategy:\n1. Calculate the absolute difference `D = |b - a|`.\n2. Find all the divisors of `D`.\n3. For each divisor `g`:\n   a. Calculate the smallest `k`:  `k = (-a % g + g) % g`.\n   b. Calculate `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`.\n   c. Calculate `current_lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`.\n   d. Keep track of the smallest `current_lcm` seen and its `k`.\n\nNow, a quick analysis of divisor complexity. Finding the divisors should be tractable.  The problem size suggests numbers up to `10^9` for the difference `D`.  Even though the maximum number of divisors can be significant, the number should still be manageable, so iterating over divisors is a reasonable approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\nA fundamental property of GCD is `gcd(u, v) = gcd(u, v-u)`. Applying this, `g = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nThis implies that `g` must be a divisor of `b-a`.\nLet `D = |b-a|`. So `g` must be a divisor of `D`.\n\nCase 1: `a = b`.\nIf `a = b`, then `D = 0`. In this case, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\n`lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\nTo minimize `a+k`, we should choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`.\nSo, if `a = b`, the answer is `k=0`.\n\nCase 2: `a != b`.\nWithout loss of generality, assume `a < b`. So `D = b - a > 0`.\nThe strategy is to iterate through all possible values of `g`, where `g` is a divisor of `D`. For each `g`, we find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` is a multiple of `g` (ideally exactly `g`).\n\nFor `g` to be `gcd(a+k, b+k)`, `a+k` and `b+k` must both be multiples of `g`.\nThis means `a+k = 0 \\pmod g`.\nThe smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this condition is `k = (-a % g + g) % g`.\nLet this `k` be `k_candidate`.\nWith this `k_candidate`, `a+k_candidate` is a multiple of `g`.\nSince `g` is a divisor of `D = b-a`, `b-a` is also a multiple of `g`.\nThen `b+k_candidate = (a+k_candidate) + (b-a)` is also a multiple of `g`.\nSo, for any divisor `g` of `D`, we can find a `k_candidate` such that `g` divides both `a+k_candidate` and `b+k_candidate`.\n\nNow, for each divisor `g` of `D`:\n1. Calculate `k_candidate = (-a % g + g) % g`.\n2. Calculate `x = a + k_candidate` and `y = b + k_candidate`.\n3. Calculate `current_lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`. Note that `gcd(x,y)` is guaranteed to be a multiple of `g`.\n4. We need to keep track of the minimum `current_lcm` found so far and the corresponding `k_candidate`.\n   Initialize `min_lcm` to infinity and `best_k` to 0.\n   If `current_lcm < min_lcm`, update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_candidate`.\n   If `current_lcm == min_lcm`, update `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)` (to choose the smallest `k`).\n\nThe number `D` can be up to `10^9 - 1`. The maximum number of divisors for a number less than `10^9` is `1344` (for `735134400`). So iterating through all divisors is feasible.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n2. Calculate `D = abs(b - a)`.\n3. Initialize `min_lcm = infinity` and `best_k = 0`.\n4. Find all divisors of `D`. A simple way is to iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(D)`. If `i` divides `D`, then `i` and `D/i` are both divisors.\n5. For each divisor `g` (both `i` and `D/i`):\n    a. Calculate `k_candidate = (-a % g + g) % g`.\n    b. Calculate `x = a + k_candidate`.\n    c. Calculate `y = b + k_candidate`.\n    d. Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)`.\n    e. Calculate `current_lcm = (x // current_gcd) * y`. (This form prevents overflow if `x*y` exceeds `sys.maxsize`, although `(10^9+10^9)^2 / 1 = 4*10^18` which fits in Python's arbitrary precision integers. Still, it's good practice).\n    f. Compare `current_lcm` with `min_lcm`:\n        i. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n           `min_lcm = current_lcm`\n           `best_k = k_candidate`\n        ii. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n           `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)`\n6. Print `best_k`.\n\nExample 1: `a=6, b=10`\n`D = |10-6| = 4`.\nDivisors of `D=4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n- For `g = 1`:\n  `k_candidate = (-6 % 1 + 1) % 1 = 0`.\n  `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n  `gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n  `lcm(6, 10) = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n  `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n- For `g = 2`:\n  `k_candidate = (-6 % 2 + 2) % 2 = 0`.\n  `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n  `gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n  `lcm(6, 10) = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n  `current_lcm (30)` is equal to `min_lcm (30)`. `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n- For `g = 4`:\n  `k_candidate = (-6 % 4 + 4) % 4 = (-2 + 4) % 4 = 2`.\n  `x = 6+2 = 8`, `y = 10+2 = 12`.\n  `gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n  `lcm(8, 12) = (8 * 12) // 4 = 24`.\n  `current_lcm (24)` is less than `min_lcm (30)`.\n  `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\nFinal `best_k = 2`.\n\nExample 2: `a=21, b=31`\n`D = |31-21| = 10`.\nDivisors of `D=10`: `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n- For `g = 1`:\n  `k_candidate = (-21 % 1 + 1) % 1 = 0`.\n  `x = 21, y = 31`. `gcd(21, 31) = 1`. `lcm = 21 * 31 = 651`.\n  `min_lcm = 651`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n- For `g = 2`:\n  `k_candidate = (-21 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (-1 + 2) % 2 = 1`.\n  `x = 21+1 = 22, y = 31+1 = 32`. `gcd(22, 32) = 2`. `lcm = (22 * 32) // 2 = 11 * 32 = 352`.\n  `current_lcm (352)` < `min_lcm (651)`.\n  `min_lcm = 352`, `best_k = 1`.\n\n- For `g = 5`:\n  `k_candidate = (-21 % 5 + 5) % 5 = (-1 + 5) % 5 = 4`.\n  `x = 21+4 = 25, y = 31+4 = 35`. `gcd(25, 35) = 5`. `lcm = (25 * 35) // 5 = 5 * 35 = 175`.\n  `current_lcm (175)` < `min_lcm (352)`.\n  `min_lcm = 175`, `best_k = 4`.\n\n- For `g = 10`:\n  `k_candidate = (-21 % 10 + 10) % 10 = (-1 + 10) % 10 = 9`.\n  `x = 21+9 = 30, y = 31+9 = 40`. `gcd(30, 40) = 10`. `lcm = (30 * 40) // 10 = 3 * 40 = 120`.\n  `current_lcm (120)` < `min_lcm (175)`.\n  `min_lcm = 120`, `best_k = 9`.\n\nFinal `best_k = 9`.\n\nExample 3: `a=5, b=10`\n`D = |10-5| = 5`.\nDivisors of `D=5`: `1, 5`.\n\n- For `g = 1`:\n  `k_candidate = (-5 % 1 + 1) % 1 = 0`.\n  `x = 5, y = 10`. `gcd(5, 10) = 5`. `lcm = (5 * 10) // 5 = 10`.\n  `min_lcm = 10`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n- For `g = 5`:\n  `k_candidate = (-5 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 0`.\n  `x = 5, y = 10`. `gcd(5, 10) = 5`. `lcm = (5 * 10) // 5 = 10`.\n  `current_lcm (10)` is equal to `min_lcm (10)`. `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\nFinal `best_k = 0`.\n\nAll examples match the logic.
