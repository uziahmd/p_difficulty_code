Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Vanya's Card Problem: My Optimized Approach**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring down a competitive programming problem. Vanya needs to get the sum of a bunch of card values to zero. He's found some cards already, and now he needs to find the fewest additional cards to reach that sweet zero sum. The absolute value of the numbers on the cards, both found and to be found, is capped at *x*. And get this, Vanya has an infinite supply of any integer between *-x* and *x*.\n\nFirst, I gotta calculate the current sum (*S*) of the cards Vanya already has.  Easy peasy. Then, the target is 0. If *S* is already 0, done and done, the answer is 0. If it's not zero, Vanya needs a new set of cards whose sum is *-S* to reach the magic zero.\n\nThe key to finding the minimum number of cards lies in maximizing each new card's contribution. If the current sum (*S*) is positive, I want negative cards (value of *-x*), to reduce it as fast as possible. If *S* is negative, I want positive cards (value of *x*). The number of cards I need is the ceiling of *|S| / x*. I can use the formula `(S + x - 1) // x` to do this.\n\nLet's test it: If *S* is 7 and *x* is 3, then using `(7 + 3 -1) // 3` or `9 // 3` gives 3, which is the correct number of cards (three `-3` cards to get the total sum to `-9`). In the Python code, I would handle these with appropriate variable names to make it readable. And a division that results with a remainder would be handled by ceiling because it needs one more card.\n\nSo the code: read the input; calculate the absolute sum; check if the sum is zero, otherwise calculate `(|S| + x - 1) // x`; output the count.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (initially found `n` cards plus the new ones) becomes zero. Each card, whether already found or to be found, has an integer value whose absolute value does not exceed `x`. Vanya has an infinite supply of cards with any integer value from `-x` to `x`.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:** First, we need to sum the values of the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\n\n2.  **Check if sum is already zero:** If `S` is already `0`, Vanya doesn't need to find any more cards. The answer is `0`.\n\n3.  **Determine the target sum for new cards:** If `S` is not `0`, Vanya needs to find additional cards whose sum, when added to `S`, makes the total sum `0`. This means the sum of the new cards must be `-S`.\n\n4.  **Minimize the number of new cards:** To find the minimum number of additional cards, Vanya should choose cards that contribute the maximum possible value towards the target sum `-S` with each card.\n    *   If `S > 0`, Vanya needs to add negative numbers to reach `0`. The largest absolute negative value a card can have is `-x`. So, he should pick cards with value `-x` as much as possible.\n    *   If `S < 0`, Vanya needs to add positive numbers to reach `0`. The largest absolute positive value a card can have is `x`. So, he should pick cards with value `x` as much as possible.\n\n    In both scenarios, each additional card can reduce the absolute difference from zero by at most `x`. The total absolute sum that needs to be compensated is `abs(S)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum cards using ceiling division:** To cover an absolute sum of `abs(S)` using cards that each contribute at most `x` (in absolute value), the minimum number of cards required is `ceil(abs(S) / x)`.\n    For positive integers `a` and `b`, the ceiling division `ceil(a / b)` can be calculated using integer arithmetic as `(a + b - 1) // b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 3, x = 2`\nCards: `-1, 1, 2`\nCurrent sum `S = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n`abs(S) = 2`.\n`x = 2`.\nMinimum cards needed = `ceil(2 / 2) = ceil(1) = 1`.\nUsing the formula: `(2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`.\nVanya needs to find 1 card (e.g., a card with value -2).\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 2, x = 3`\nCards: `-2, -2`\nCurrent sum `S = -2 + (-2) = -4`.\n`abs(S) = 4`.\n`x = 3`.\nMinimum cards needed = `ceil(4 / 3) = ceil(1.33...) = 2`.\nUsing the formula: `(4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2`.\nVanya needs to find 2 cards (e.g., two cards with value 2).\n\nThis greedy approach works because we have an infinite supply of cards with any integer value from `-x` to `x`. This means if we need to sum to `-S` and `abs(S)` is not a perfect multiple of `x`, say `abs(S) = k*x + r` where `0 < r < x`, we can use `k` cards of value `x` (or `-x`) and one final card of value `r` (or `-r`). Since `|r| < x`, a card with value `r` (or `-r`) is always valid.\n\nThe constraints `n <= 1000` and `x <= 1000` mean that the maximum possible sum `S` is `1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`. This fits comfortably within standard integer types, and the calculations are very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value on a card)\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the n space-separated integers representing the numbers on found cards\n    cards = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the current sum of all found cards\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, Vanya needs 0 more cards.\n    if current_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # Vanya wants the final sum to be zero.\n        # This means the sum of the additional cards must be -current_sum.\n        # To minimize the number of cards, each new card should contribute the maximum\n        # possible absolute value towards compensating the current_sum.\n        # The maximum absolute value a card can have is x.\n\n        # The absolute value of the sum that needs to be compensated is abs(current_sum).\n        abs_current_sum = abs(current_sum)\n\n        # The minimum number of cards needed is ceil(abs_current_sum / x).\n        # For positive integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be calculated as (a + b - 1) // b\n        num_cards_needed = (abs_current_sum + x - 1) // x\n\n        # Print the result\n        print(num_cards_needed)\n\n# Execute the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
