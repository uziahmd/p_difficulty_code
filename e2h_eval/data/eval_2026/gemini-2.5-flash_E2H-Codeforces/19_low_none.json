The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Solving a Competitive Programming Tree Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face. It involves a tree and I need to write a Python script to figure out which districts to remove. Let's break this down. I'm given `n` districts (nodes), `k` contestants to remove, and a tree structure defined by `n-1` edges. The goal is to identify which `k` districts to axe so that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and we maximize the total number of fans. Each district has `2^i` fans, with `i` being the district number.\n\nImmediately, I see that the exponential growth of the fan count is crucial. Keeping districts with higher numbers is far more beneficial than smaller ones. I need an `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` solution, because `n` can be as large as `10^6`. This rules out anything quadratic.\n\nMy initial thought is a greedy approach. Since we're aiming to maximize the sum of `2^i`, I should try to keep the districts with the largest indices. I need to keep the nodes `n, n-1, n-2,...`.  I'm basically looking for a connected subgraph containing `n-k` nodes.\n\nSo, the problem is rephrased: I need to *remove* `k` nodes in a way that the remaining `n-k` nodes are connected and maximize the sum. I need to ensure that the chosen `n-k` nodes form a connected subgraph. It's essentially about finding the best connected subgraph of size `n-k` within this tree to get the highest fan count. Prioritizing larger district numbers is the key here.  I need to figure out an efficient way to select the best `k` nodes to remove, aiming to keep as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible within a connected component.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly `k` contestants (districts) from a total of `n` districts. The districts are connected in a tree structure. After removing `k` districts, the remaining `n-k` districts must form a single connected component. We want to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants, where district `i` has `2^i` fans. We need to output the `k` removed district numbers in increasing order.\n\nThe key to maximizing the total number of fans is to keep districts with larger indices. Since `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`, keeping a district `i` is always much more valuable than keeping any district `j < i`. This suggests a greedy strategy: we should try to keep the districts with the largest possible indices.\n\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`. We want to select a connected component of `n-k` districts that maximizes the sum of `2^i`. This is equivalent to finding a connected component of `n-k` districts that contains as many high-indexed districts as possible.\n\nConsider the largest district `n`. If we want to maximize the sum, we should definitely try to keep district `n`. If we keep district `n`, then we need to select `n-k-1` more districts such that they form a connected component with `n`.\n\nThis problem can be rephrased as follows: we want to find a connected component of size `n-k` that contains the highest possible district numbers.\nLet `R` be the set of `k` districts to remove. We want to choose `R` such that the graph `G - R` has a connected component of size `n-k` and the sum of `2^i` for `i` in this component is maximized.\n\nA more direct approach is to identify the `k` districts that are \"least valuable\" to keep. Since we prioritize high-indexed districts, the \"least valuable\" districts are those with low indices. However, we can't just remove the `k` smallest-indexed districts, because that might disconnect the graph into multiple components, none of which has size `n-k`.\n\nThe strategy is to identify the \"core\" component we want to keep. This core component should contain district `n`. We then try to expand this core component by adding districts `n-1, n-2, ...` as long as they are adjacent to the current core component, until we have `n-k` districts.\nThis is essentially a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) like traversal, but prioritizing nodes with higher indices.\n\nLet's maintain a set `kept_nodes` for the districts we want to keep, initially empty. We also maintain a count `removed_count` for the districts we have decided to remove.\nWe iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each district `i`:\n1.  If `i` is already marked for removal (because one of its neighbors was removed and it became isolated, or it was part of a small component that was removed), skip it.\n2.  If `i` is not yet in `kept_nodes` and `n - k - len(kept_nodes) > 0` (meaning we still need to keep more nodes):\n    *   Perform a traversal (e.g., BFS or DFS) starting from `i` to find all nodes reachable from `i` *without passing through any nodes already in `kept_nodes`*. Let this set of reachable nodes be `C_i`.\n    *   If `len(kept_nodes) + len(C_i) <= n - k`:\n        *   Add all nodes in `C_i` to `kept_nodes`.\n        *   Mark all nodes in `C_i` as visited/processed.\n    *   Else (if adding `C_i` would exceed `n-k` nodes):\n        *   We need to select `n-k - len(kept_nodes)` nodes from `C_i` to add to `kept_nodes`. To maximize the sum of fans, we should pick the `n-k - len(kept_nodes)` nodes from `C_i` that have the largest indices. Since we are iterating `i` from `n` down to `1`, `i` is currently the largest available node. So we add `i` to `kept_nodes`. We might need to select more nodes from `C_i` later if `i` is not enough. This logic is a bit complex.\n\nA simpler greedy approach that works:\n1.  Initialize `kept_nodes` as an empty set.\n2.  Initialize a `removed_set` as an empty set.\n3.  Initialize a `queue` for a BFS/DFS-like traversal.\n4.  Add district `n` to `kept_nodes` and to the `queue`.\n5.  While `len(kept_nodes) < n - k` and the `queue` is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a node `u` from the `queue`.\n    b.  Find all unvisited neighbors `v` of `u` (neighbors not in `kept_nodes` and not in `removed_set`).\n    c.  Sort these neighbors `v` in decreasing order of their district numbers.\n    d.  For each neighbor `v` (from largest to smallest):\n        i.  If `len(kept_nodes) < n - k`:\n            *   Add `v` to `kept_nodes`.\n            *   Enqueue `v`.\n        ii. Else (`len(kept_nodes) == n - k`):\n            *   Add `v` to `removed_set`. (These are nodes that are connected but we don't have space for them in the final component).\n6.  After the loop, all nodes `i` from `1` to `n` that are not in `kept_nodes` and not in `removed_set` must be part of isolated components (or components that were never reached by the traversal starting from `n`). These nodes are implicitly removed.\n\nThe final set of removed nodes will be all nodes `j` such that `j` is not in `kept_nodes`.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy:\n1.  Initialize `kept_nodes` as a boolean array or set, initially all `False` or empty.\n2.  Initialize `removed_candidates` as a list of `n` elements, initially all `False`. This will store nodes that we *could* remove.\n3.  Create an adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n4.  Start a \"virtual\" traversal from district `n`. Add `n` to `kept_nodes`.\n5.  Maintain a `degree` array for the current graph, where `degree[i]` is the number of neighbors of `i` that are *not* yet marked for removal. Initially, this is just the actual degree of each node.\n6.  Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes that are candidates for removal. The priority of a node `i` should be its index `i` (smaller index means higher priority for removal).\n7.  Initially, for every node `i` from `1` to `n-1`, add `i` to the `removed_candidates` list.\n8.  Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   If `i` is already marked for removal (i.e., `removed_candidates[i]` is `False` due to an earlier step), continue.\n    *   If `len(kept_nodes) == n - k`, we have selected enough nodes. All remaining nodes (not in `kept_nodes`) are removed. Break.\n    *   Otherwise, `i` is a candidate to be kept. Add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n    *   Now, we need to consider its neighbors. If `i` is kept, its neighbors might become part of the component.\n    *   The crucial part is that when we keep a node `i`, it potentially \"saves\" its neighbors from being removed.\n    *   This is tricky because the connectivity constraint applies to the *final* set of `n-k` nodes.\n\nThe most common and effective approach for this type of problem (find a connected subgraph of a specific size maximizing/minimizing a sum) is to use a \"pruning\" strategy.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. This means we must remove `k` nodes.\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)`, we should remove nodes with the smallest possible indices.\nHowever, removing a node might disconnect the graph. If we remove a node `u`, it might split its neighbors into separate components.\n\nConsider the nodes in increasing order of their indices: `1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nLet `visited` be a boolean array, initially all `False`.\nLet `removed_count = 0`.\nLet `removed_list = []`.\n\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `i` is already visited (part of a component we've decided to keep), skip.\nIf `removed_count == k`, we cannot remove any more nodes. Break.\n\nOtherwise, `i` is an unvisited node.\nPerform a BFS/DFS starting from `i` to find the size of the connected component `C_i` that `i` belongs to, considering only unvisited nodes.\nIf `n - k - (nodes_kept_so_far) < len(C_i)`:\n    This means if we keep `C_i`, we would exceed `n-k` total nodes. This is the component we want to keep. We must keep `n-k - (nodes_kept_so_far)` nodes from `C_i`. To maximize sum, we keep the largest ones.\n    But this is not right. We want to remove `k` nodes.\n    The problem is finding `k` nodes to remove.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy involves starting from the \"most valuable\" node (`n`) and expanding, while carefully tracking which nodes are effectively \"removed\" because they are too far or too small-indexed.\n\nLet's use a \"pruning\" approach:\n1.  Initialize `kept_nodes` as a boolean array `kept[1...n]`, all `True` initially.\n2.  Initialize `num_kept = n`.\n3.  Create an adjacency list `adj` for the tree.\n4.  Initialize a `degree` array `deg[1...n]`, where `deg[i]` is the number of neighbors `j` of `i` such that `kept[j]` is `True`. Initially, this is just the actual degree of each node.\n5.  Use a min-priority queue `pq` to store nodes that are \"leaves\" in the current `kept` subgraph (nodes `i` where `deg[i] == 1`). We prioritize nodes with smaller indices for removal.\n6.  Add all initial leaves (nodes with `deg[i] == 1`) to `pq`.\n7.  While `num_kept > n - k`:\n    a.  Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from `pq`.\n    b.  If `kept[u]` is already `False` (meaning it was processed as a neighbor of another removed node, and its degree dropped to 0), continue to the next node in `pq`.\n    c.  Mark `kept[u] = False`.\n    d.  `num_kept -= 1`.\n    e.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  If `kept[v]` is `True`:\n            *   Decrement `deg[v]`.\n            *   If `deg[v] == 1`, `v` has become a new leaf in the `kept` subgraph. Add `v` to `pq`.\n            *   If `deg[v] == 0`, `v` is now isolated. This means `v` was the last neighbor of `u` that was kept. If `v` was already in `pq` (because it was a leaf before `u` was removed), it should be effectively ignored when extracted from `pq` (step 7b).\n\nThis pruning strategy removes nodes with degree 1 first, prioritizing smaller indices. This ensures that the remaining graph stays connected. We continue this until `n-k` nodes remain.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 1):**\nn=6, k=3. Need to keep 3 nodes.\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nInitial `kept` array: `[T,T,T,T,T,T]` (for nodes 1 to 6)\nInitial `num_kept = 6`.\nInitial `deg`:\n1: 1\n2: 4\n3: 1\n4: 1\n5: 1\n6: 2\n\nInitial `pq`: `[1, 3, 4, 5]` (sorted by index)\n\nLoop `while num_kept > 6 - 3 = 3`:\n\n1.  Extract `u=1` from `pq`. `kept[1]` is `True`.\n    `kept[1] = False`. `num_kept = 5`.\n    Neighbor of 1 is 2. `kept[2]` is `True`.\n    `deg[2]` becomes `4-1=3`. (2 is not a leaf, so not added to pq)\n\n    `pq`: `[3, 4, 5]`\n\n2.  Extract `u=3` from `pq`. `kept[3]` is `True`.\n    `kept[3] = False`. `num_kept = 4`.\n    Neighbor of 3 is 2. `kept[2]` is `True`.\n    `deg[2]` becomes `3-1=2`. (2 is not a leaf)\n\n    `pq`: `[4, 5]`\n\n3.  Extract `u=4` from `pq`. `kept[4]` is `True`.\n    `kept[4] = False`. `num_kept = 3`.\n    Neighbor of 4 is 2. `kept[2]` is `True`.\n    `deg[2]` becomes `2-1=1`. (2 is now a leaf!) Add 2 to `pq`.\n\n    `pq`: `[2, 5]`\n\nLoop condition `num_kept > 3` is now `3 > 3`, which is `False`. Loop terminates.\n\nThe nodes marked `False` in `kept` are the removed nodes.\n`kept`: `[F,T,F,F,T,T]` (for nodes 1 to 6)\nRemoved nodes are `1, 3, 4`.\nOutput: `1 3 4`. This matches the sample output!\n\nThis pruning strategy works because removing a leaf node `u` (degree 1) maintains the connectivity of the remaining graph. The node `u` is connected to only one other node `v` in the `kept` subgraph. Removing `u` just makes `v`'s degree in the `kept` subgraph decrease, and if `v` becomes a leaf, it might be removed next. By prioritizing smaller indices, we ensure that larger indexed nodes are kept whenever possible.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Adjacency list for graph: `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`.\n*   `kept` array: `kept = [True] * (n + 1)`.\n*   `deg` array: `deg = [0] * (n + 1)`.\n*   Min-priority queue: `heapq` module in Python.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list and calculating initial degrees: `O(N+M)` where `M=N-1` edges, so `O(N)`.\n*   Initializing `pq` with leaves: `O(N log N)` in worst case (if many nodes are leaves, adding them to heap). Or `O(N)` if using `heapify` on a list of leaves.\n*   The `while` loop runs `k` times. In each iteration:\n    *   `heappop`: `O(log N)`.\n    *   Iterating neighbors: sum of degrees is `2M = O(N)`. Each neighbor operation involves decrementing degree and potentially `heappush`: `O(log N)`. In total, each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint when it's removed), so total `O(N log N)` for `heappush`/`heappop` operations across all iterations.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible (`10^6 * log(10^6) approx 10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   Adjacency list: `O(N+M) = O(N)`.\n*   `kept`, `deg` arrays: `O(N)`.\n*   Priority queue: `O(N)` in worst case (all leaves).\nTotal space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\nThis approach fits within the typical competitive programming limits for `N=10^6`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    deg = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        deg[u] += 1\n        deg[v] += 1\n\n    # kept[i] is True if district i is currently part of the component we are keeping\n    # Initially, all districts are kept\n    kept = [True] * (n + 1)\n    num_kept = n\n\n    # Min-priority queue to store districts that are 'leaves' in the current kept subgraph.\n    # We store (district_id) in the heap.\n    # We prioritize smaller district IDs for removal to maximize sum of 2^i.\n    pq = []\n\n    # Initialize pq with all initial leaves (districts with degree 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if deg[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, i)\n        # Handle the case of n=1, k=0 (not possible due to 1 <= k < n)\n        # or n=2, k=1, where both nodes have deg=1.\n        # If n=1, deg[1] is 0, it's not a leaf.\n        # If n > 1 and it's an isolated node (deg[i]=0), it means the graph is not connected\n        # which contradicts the problem statement (\"exactly one path connecting it to every other district\").\n        # So deg[i] >= 1 for all i in a tree with n > 1.\n\n    # If n = 1, k = 0, the above loop for deg[i] == 1 won't add anything.\n    # However, k < n, so n must be at least 2.\n    # For n=2, k=1, deg[1]=1, deg[2]=1.
