The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Solving the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm facing this competitive programming problem where the goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open. We have `n` chests and `m` keys, each with a number. A key opens a chest if their sum is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe key insight here is to categorize the chests and keys by their parity: even or odd. Let's count how many even and odd chests and keys we have. A key can only open a chest if their parities differ. So, I can match even chests with odd keys or odd chests with even keys.\n\nThis is essentially a matching problem. We want to maximize the pairings. Let `x` be the number of even chests opened by odd keys, and `y` be the number of odd chests opened by even keys.  The total number of chests opened is `x + y`. The constraints are that `x` and `y` can't be more than the available even/odd chests or keys.\n\nTo maximize `x + y`, I need to maximize `x` and `y` individually. I can open at most `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs of even chests with odd keys and at most `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` pairs of odd chests with even keys. Therefore, the maximum number of chests I can open is the sum of these two minima.\n\nAfter going through several examples, the logic seems correct. I just need to count the parity of the numbers and use the formula: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. This takes `O(n + m)` time and `O(1)` space which is very efficient.\n\nThe implementation is also straightforward. Read the inputs, count the even and odd chests and keys, and apply the formula. Even for large inputs, this approach should work very well. The problem even hints that the intended solution is simple and efficient. The problem states \"Note that this is a very easy question.\" which confirms the simplicity of the approach.  I think this is it! I have a solid, fast, and correct solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests and `m` keys. Each chest has a number `a_i` and each key has a number `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if the sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two scenarios for a successful match:\n1. `a_i` is an even number and `b_j` is an odd number.\n2. `a_i` is an odd number and `b_j` is an even number.\n\nTo maximize the total number of chests opened, we should maximize the number of matches for each scenario independently, as they use different types of chests and keys.\n\nLet's count the number of chests and keys of each parity:\n- `chests_even`: number of chests with even numbers.\n- `chests_odd`: number of chests with odd numbers.\n- `keys_even`: number of keys with even numbers.\n- `keys_odd`: number of keys with odd numbers.\n\nFor scenario 1 (even chest + odd key):\nThe maximum number of matches we can make is limited by the available even chests and available odd keys. So, the number of matches for this scenario is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nFor scenario 2 (odd chest + even key):\nSimilarly, the maximum number of matches for this scenario is limited by the available odd chests and available even keys. So, the number of matches for this scenario is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two scenarios use distinct sets of resources (an even chest cannot be opened by an even key, and an odd chest cannot be opened by an odd key; similarly, an odd key cannot open an odd chest, and an even key cannot open an even chest), the total maximum number of chests opened is simply the sum of the maximum matches from these two independent scenarios.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number, check its parity:\n   - If even, increment `chests_even`.\n   - If odd, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers. For each number, check its parity:\n   - If even, increment `keys_even`.\n   - If odd, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. **Chest Parities:**\n   - Even chests: `14, 6, 2` (`chests_even = 3`)\n   - Odd chests: `9, 11` (`chests_odd = 2`)\n\n2. **Key Parities:**\n   - Even keys: `8, 4, 20` (`keys_even = 3`)\n   - Odd keys: `7` (`keys_odd = 1`)\n\n3. **Calculate Matches:**\n   - Matches (even chest + odd key): `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   - Matches (odd chest + even key): `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4. **Total Maximum Chests:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis approach is efficient, requiring a single pass through the chest numbers and a single pass through the key numbers, resulting in `O(n + m)` time complexity. The space complexity is `O(1)` for storing counts.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read chest numbers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read key numbers\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count even and odd chests\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Count even and odd keys\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate matches for even chests with odd keys\n    # An even chest can only be opened by an odd key.\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the count of even chests and odd keys.\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # Calculate matches for odd chests with even keys\n    # An odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the count of odd chests and even keys.\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    # The total maximum number of chests is the sum of these two independent types of matches.\n    print(matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
