Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down for the \"Amusing Joke\" problem.**\n\nMy initial thought is that I need a Python script to tackle this. The problem itself is pretty straightforward: I'm given three strings â€“ a guest's name, a host's name, and a pile of letters. The goal is to determine if the pile of letters is an exact rearrangement of all the letters from the guest and host names combined.\n\nMy intuition says the most efficient approach will involve character frequencies. I can easily combine the guest and host names into a single string. Then, I can create frequency maps (dictionaries or even arrays, considering it's only uppercase letters) for both the combined names and the pile of letters. After that, a simple comparison of these frequency maps will give me the answer. If the frequency of each letter is identical in both maps, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO.\"\n\nThinking about the implementation, I see that Python's `collections.Counter` would be ideal for this. It simplifies frequency counting considerably. Alternatively, sorting the combined names and the pile of letters and comparing the sorted strings would also do the trick. If the sorted strings are identical, then the character composition and their frequencies would naturally be the same, giving me the answer. I think I'll lean towards the `Counter` for readability, but sorting is definitely a valid and potentially more concise method.\n",
