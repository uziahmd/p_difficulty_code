He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Validating String Formation**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this string validation problem. The user wants a Python script to determine if a string `S` adheres to a specific, three-step formation rule. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Step A dictates an initial sequence of 'a's â€“ let's call this `count_a_initial`. Then, Step B appends a sequence of 'b's, `count_b_appended`, with the crucial condition that both `count_a_initial` and `count_b_appended` must be at least one. Finally, Step C appends 'c's, `count_c_appended`, and this final count is bound to either `count_a_initial` or `count_b_appended` (or both).\n\nMy initial instinct is to break down `S` into its constituent parts: `a...a b...b c...c`. This means I need to confirm the contiguous nature of each character group within `S`. All the 'a's have to be together, followed by all the 'b's, and then all the 'c's. No interleaving allowed.\n\nTo analyze `S`, I'll need to calculate the character counts. Let's use `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` to represent the total number of each character in `S`. These counts directly correspond to the intermediate variables `count_a_initial`, `count_b_appended`, and `count_c_appended` from the rules.\n\nTherefore, for `S` to be valid, several conditions need to be met:\n\n1.  **Character Order and Contiguity**: The sequence of characters in S must strictly follow the `a...a b...b c...c` pattern.  I need to check for this order and make sure the segments are uninterrupted.\n\nThis is where I'll start with the Python script.\n",
