You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number Through Digit Replacement**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this \"Replacing Digits\" problem.  The goal is to take a number, `a`, and a set of available digits, `s`, and replace some digits in `a` with those from `s` to get the largest possible resulting number. It's clear that to maximize the number, the strategy has to be a greedy one: focus on the most significant digits first.\n\nI've got a solid plan forming. I'll need to iterate through `a` from left to right, the most significant to least. For each digit in `a`, I'll check if any digit in `s` is greater. The key is finding that \"best\" replacement: pick the largest digit from `s` that's *greater* than the current digit in `a`.  This ensures I'm always making the number as big as possible from left to right.\n\nI need to make this efficient, so I'll be working directly with the strings.  First, I'll convert `a` into a list so I can modify it in-place. Then I'll convert `s` to a list too and sort that in descending order, to make it easy to find the largest available digit.\n\nHere's the algorithm breakdown: I'll have two pointers, one for `a` and one for `s`.  At each step, I'll compare the current digits, `a[i]` and `s[j]`. If `s[j]` is bigger, I'll replace `a[i]` with it and move both pointers forward.  If `s[j]` isn't bigger, I can't do anything better at that position, so I just move the `a` pointer forward.  Since `s` is sorted in descending order, there's no point checking the remaining digits in `s` if the current one is smaller or equal; they'll all be smaller too. This will keep me from unnecessarily looping through `s` once I've hit a barrier.\n\nBasically, I'm aiming for the biggest possible leftmost digits, and this greedy approach should work perfectly. I feel confident I can translate this thought process into a clean and efficient Python script.\n",
