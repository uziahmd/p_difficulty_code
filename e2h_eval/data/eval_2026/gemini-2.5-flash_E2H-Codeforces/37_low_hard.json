Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.\n\n## Output\nIf there is no such array b, print -1.Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn.

    "thought": "**Gluttony Problem - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core of it is building a permutation `b` from an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty, non-full subset of `a` are different from the sums of those same indices in `b`.  It's a permutation problem with a tricky condition.\n\nFirst, the inputs. `n` up to 22. That screams exponential complexity is likely the path to success, maybe something like `O(n * 2^n)` or a bit higher, as I don't think factorials will be viable at that scale.  The input values can be large (up to 10^9), which means I need to make sure I'm using a language (like Python) that handles large integers without issues. And crucially, all input integers are distinct. That's a helpful characteristic, and I'll keep that in mind.\n\nMy first thought on approaching this is to simplify by considering it after sorting the array. Since `b` is just a permutation of `a`, if I can find a valid `b` for the sorted `a`, it's a valid solution for any input array.  So, I can sort the input array, and work with the sorted version.\n\nNow, let's break down the condition: I need to ensure that for *every* subset (excluding the empty set and the full set), the sum of the elements in that subset in `a` is *different* from the sum of the elements in the corresponding subset in `b`.\n\nLet's look at the simple cases to find hints. For `n = 1`, there's no subset to consider! The constraint is `0 < k < n`, and if `n` is 1, then this can't happen. So, any permutation of a length-1 array trivially works (and should be `a` itself).\n",
