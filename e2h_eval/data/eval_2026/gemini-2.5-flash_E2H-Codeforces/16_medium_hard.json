Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.

    "thought": "**Solving the Crazy Town Problem: A Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got a competitive programming problem here, the \"Crazy Town\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it. It's about finding the minimum number of steps to get from a home block to a university block, given a set of roads represented as lines.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, the input: home and university coordinates, the number of roads (`n`), and the equations of those roads. The coordinates and coefficients are relatively small, which is good. The key here is the movement rule: you can move between blocks only if they share a common border segment, meaning they're separated by a line but not just touching at a point.\n\n**The Geometric Insight:**\n\nThis screams geometry. Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. A \"block\" is just a region formed by the intersection of these half-planes. Moving between adjacent blocks means crossing exactly one line, no more, no less.  Therefore, the problem boils down to counting how many lines separate the home and university blocks.\n\n**Determining the Separation:**\n\nThe core concept is checking if two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a given line.  For a line `ax + by + c = 0`, if `ax1 + by1 + c` and `ax2 + by2 + c` have different signs for two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, they're on opposite sides. That's the crucial test!\n\n**The Solution Strategy:**\n\nThe solution is straightforward: iterate through each road, calculate `ax + by + c` for both the home and university points, and if the signs are different (product is negative), increment a counter. The final count is the answer. This approach is O(n), very efficient given the constraints.\n\n**Potential Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Large numbers:**  Even though we have relatively small numbers for the coordinates and coefficients, products and sums of those might get large. Thankfully, Python handles arbitrary-precision integers, so that's not an issue.\n*   **Home/University not on a road:** This is important because it means `ax + by + c` won't ever be zero, making our sign comparison reliable.\n*   **Redundant lines**: The problem statement explicitly says there will be no duplicate roads, which is a nice simplification.\n*   **The \"shared border\" condition**:  The problem hints that blocks must have a *non-zero* border segment. My analysis indicates that crossing a line with different signs *implies* such a border is present. If the blocks are separated by line `L`, and are on the same side of all other lines, they *must* have some shared border on L. This interpretation simplifies to \"count the separating lines\".\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  Read the home and university coordinates.\n2.  Read the number of roads.\n3.  Initialize a counter `crossings = 0`.\n4.  Loop through each road:\n    *   Read the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n    *   Calculate `val1 = ax1 + by1 + c` for the home.\n    *   Calculate `val2 = ax2 + by2 + c` for the university.\n    *   If `val1 * val2 < 0`, the points are on opposite sides, `crossings += 1`.\n5.  Print the final `crossings` value.\n\n**Code and Validation:**\n\nI'll write a Python script following this logic. I'll test it with the provided examples to verify its correctness. The O(n) runtime is excellent, and the logic seems sound. Let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing your home) to a destination block (containing the university). A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, where adjacency means they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nEach line `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes: `ax + by + c > 0` and `ax + by + c < 0`. A \"block\" is a connected region of the plane that does not contain any part of any road. Such a block is defined by being on a specific side (either `>` or `<`) of every single road line.\n\nTo move from one block to an adjacent block, you must cross exactly one road line. This means the two blocks are on opposite sides of precisely one line, and on the same side of all other lines. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to get from the home block to the university block is simply the total count of distinct road lines that separate the home point from the university point.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the coordinates of your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)`.\n2.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n3.  Initialize a counter `crossings = 0`. This counter will store the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the line `ax + by + c = 0`.\n    b.  Evaluate the expression `ax + by + c` for the home point `(x1, y1)`. Let this be `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c.  Evaluate the expression `ax + by + c` for the university point `(x2, y2)`. Let this be `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val1` and `val2` have different signs, it means the home and university points lie on opposite sides of this particular line. In this case, this line must be crossed to get from one block to the other. Increment `crossings`.\n        *   A concise way to check for different signs (when neither value is zero) is `val1 * val2 < 0`.\n        *   The problem guarantees that neither home nor university lies on any road, so `val1` and `val2` will never be zero.\n5.  After checking all `n` roads, the value of `crossings` will be the minimum number of steps required. Print `crossings`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from Problem Example 1):**\n\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nRoads:\n1. `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\n2. `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\n\n*   **Initialize `crossings = 0`**\n\n*   **Road 1 (`a=0, b=1, c=0`):**\n    *   For home (1, 1): `val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   For university (-1, -1): `val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val1 * val2 = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Signs are different.\n    *   `crossings` becomes 1.\n\n*   **Road 2 (`a=1, b=0, c=0`):**\n    *   For home (1, 1): `val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   For university (-1, -1): `val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val1 * val2 = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Signs are different.\n    *   `crossings` becomes 2.\n\n*   **Final Answer:** 2\n\n**Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), as we iterate through each of the `n` roads once, performing constant time calculations for each. Given `N <= 300`, this is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only store a few variables.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    crossings = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients a, b, c for the current road: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the home point (x1, y1)\n        # This value indicates which side of the line the home point lies on.\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the university point (x2, y2)\n        # This value indicates which side of the line the university point lies on.\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have different signs, it means the home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this road.
