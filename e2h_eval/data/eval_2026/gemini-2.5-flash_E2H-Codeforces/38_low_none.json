    "thought": "**My Approach to a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and my goal is to figure out the least number of nodes needed, and the most unidirectional connections possible, in a specific type of directed graph. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"p-reachable\" means. It's all about pairs of nodes that can reach each other in both directions. That points straight to the concept of Strongly Connected Components, or SCCs, in graph theory. Essentially, nodes within the same SCC are mutually reachable.\n\nThe problem specifically asks about *ordered* pairs where the first node's value is less than the second's. That means I need to focus on how to count those.\n\nIf I've got an SCC of size 's', the number of these ordered, reachable pairs *u* < *v* is *s*(s-1)/2. It's a combination problem, the total number of bidirectional pairs within the SCC. So the problem then, becomes figuring out how to construct a graph with a total of exactly 'p' of these pairs. I need to minimize the number of nodes in total.\n\nMy instinct says to minimize the node count, I need to make the SCCs as large as possible. If I fix 'p', I want to use fewer, larger components. This means I want a balance between minimizing the number of SCCs and finding the best way to group nodes into SCCs. Since the number of bidirectional connections grows quadratically with size, I need to find the smallest 's' where *s*(s-1)/2 is greater than or equal to 'p'.  Essentially, I need to figure out how to arrange the graph to hit the p number of reachable pairs while keeping the total node count down. That seems like the right path forward, which means I can start calculating.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `n` nodes.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable graph:**\nA directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has size `s`, the number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within this SCC that are reachable from each other is `s * (s - 1) / 2`.\nLet `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k` be the sizes of the SCCs in a graph. The total number of nodes is `n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k`.\nThe total count of such pairs `p` is `sum(s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2 for i=1 to k)`.\n\n**2. Unidirectional pair:**\nAn ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\nThis means `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `SCC(u)` to `SCC(v)` in the condensation graph (DAG of SCCs).\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, we want to make the SCCs as large as possible. The function `f(s) = s * (s - 1) / 2` grows quadratically.\nLet's find the largest `s_max` such that `f(s_max) <= p`.\nWe can find `s_max` by solving `s * (s - 1) / 2 <= p` for `s`. This is approximately `s^2 / 2 <= p`, so `s <= sqrt(2p)`. We can iterate `s` starting from 1 or use binary search.\nFor `p = 2 * 10^5`, `2p = 4 * 10^5`, `sqrt(2p) approx 632`. So `s_max` will be at most around 633.\n\nOnce we find `s_max`, we form an SCC of size `s_max`. This accounts for `f(s_max)` pairs.\nThe remaining pairs needed are `p_rem = p - f(s_max)`.\nIf `p_rem == 0`, we only need `s_max` nodes.\nIf `p_rem > 0`, we need to find additional SCCs to account for `p_rem` pairs. Each additional SCC must contribute at least 1 pair (i.e., size at least 2). To minimize `n`, we should use a single SCC of size `s'` such that `f(s') = p_rem`. However, `p_rem` might not be a value of `f(s')`.\nThe most efficient way to account for `p_rem` pairs using minimum additional nodes is to use SCCs of size 2. Each SCC of size 2 contributes `f(2) = 1` pair and uses 2 nodes.\nSo, we need `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. This adds `2 * p_rem` nodes.\nThe total number of nodes `n` would be `s_max + 2 * p_rem`.\n\nLet's test this strategy:\nSuppose `p = 3`.\n`f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3`.\n`s_max = 3` because `f(3)=3 <= 3`.\n`p_rem = 3 - f(3) = 0`.\nMinimum nodes `n = s_max + 2 * p_rem = 3 + 2 * 0 = 3`.\n\nSuppose `p = 4`.\n`f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3`.\n`s_max = 3` because `f(3)=3 <= 4`.\n`p_rem = 4 - f(3) = 1`.\nMinimum nodes `n = s_max + 2 * p_rem = 3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.\nThis graph would consist of one SCC of size 3 and one SCC of size 2. Total nodes = 3+2=5.\n\nThis strategy correctly finds the minimum number of nodes `n`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nWe have determined the structure of the graph: one SCC of size `s_max` and `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. Let `k = 1 + p_rem` be the total number of SCCs.\nLet these SCCs be `C_0` (size `s_max`), `C_1, ..., C_{p_rem-1}` (each size 2).\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange these SCCs in a way that maximizes paths between them in the condensation graph. A linear chain structure for the condensation graph is optimal for maximizing unidirectional pairs.\nIf we have `k` SCCs, and we arrange them in a chain `C_0 -> C_1 -> ... -> C_{k-1}` (meaning there's an edge from `C_i` to `C_{i+1}`), then for any `i < j`, there's a path from `C_i` to `C_j`, but no path from `C_j` to `C_i`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs between two SCCs `C_i` and `C_j` (where `i < j`) is `size(C_i) * size(C_j)`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum(size(C_i) * size(C_j))` for all `i < j`.\n\nLet `S = [s_max] + [2] * p_rem` be the list of SCC sizes.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum(S[i] * S[j] for 0 <= i < j < k)`.\nThis sum can be computed more efficiently. Let `s_total = sum(S) = n`.\nThe sum `sum(S[i] * S[j] for i < j)` is equal to `(s_total^2 - sum(S[i]^2)) / 2`.\nSo, `unidirectional_pairs = (n^2 - (s_max^2 + p_rem * 2^2)) / 2`.\n\nLet's recheck the example `p = 3`:\n`s_max = 3`, `p_rem = 0`.\n`n = 3`.\n`S = [3]`. `k = 1`.\nThere are no pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j` if `k=1`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = (3^2 - (3^2)) / 2 = (9 - 9) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\nExample `p = 4`:\n`s_max = 3`, `p_rem = 1`.\n`n = 5`.\n`S = [3, 2]`. `k = 2`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = S[0] * S[1] = 3 * 2 = 6`.\nUsing the formula: `(n^2 - (s_max^2 + p_rem * 2^2)) / 2 = (5^2 - (3^2 + 1 * 2^2)) / 2 = (25 - (9 + 4)) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. Matches example.\n\nExample `p = 0`:\n`s_max = 1` (since `f(1)=0`). `p_rem = 0 - f(1) = 0`.\n`n = 1`.\n`S = [1]`. `k = 1`.\n`unidirectional_pairs = 0`.\nOutput: `1 0`. (The example says `0 0`, which implies `n=0` for `p=0`. If `n=0`, there are no nodes, no pairs. If `n=1`, there are no pairs `u<v` that are reachable from each other, and no unidirectional pairs. The problem asks for minimum nodes. `n=1` is the minimum positive number of nodes. If `p=0` means no pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v` are reachable, then a graph with 1 node satisfies this. If `n=0` is allowed, it's 0. Competitive programming usually assumes `n >= 1` unless stated otherwise. If `p=0`, `n=1` is the smallest graph that fits the definition (no pairs means 0 pairs). If `p=0` is given, it means 0 pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v` are reachable from each other. A graph with 1 node has 0 such pairs. A graph with 0 nodes also has 0 such pairs. Let's assume `n>=1`. `s_max = 1` for `p=0`. `n=1`, `unidirectional=0`. Output `1 0`. The example output `0 0` suggests `n=0` is allowed. If `n=0` is allowed, then for `p=0`, `n=0` is minimal, and unidirectional pairs is also 0. I will stick to the logic that `s_max` is found starting from `s=1`. If `p=0`, `s_max=1`, `n=1`, `unidirectional=0`. This is a common small edge case in programming contests. Let's assume `n=1` for `p=0` as it's the smallest non-empty graph.)\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)`... `u != v`\". If `n=1`, there are no such pairs. So `p=0` is naturally satisfied by `n=1`.\nThe example output `0 0` for `p=0` is peculiar. It suggests `n=0` is the minimum. If `n=0`, there are no nodes, so no pairs, so `p=0` and 0 unidirectional pairs.\nIf `n=1`, `s_max=1`, `p_rem=0`. `n=1`. Unidirectional pairs = 0.\nThis is a standard ambiguity. Let's assume `n>=1`. So `1 0`.\nHowever, if the example output is `0 0`, I should follow it for `p=0`.\nFor `p=0`, if `n=0` is allowed, then `n=0` is minimal, and unidirectional pairs is `0`.\nIf `p > 0`, then `n >= 2`.\nMy logic gives `s_max = 1` for `p=0`. Then `n = 1 + 2*0 = 1`.\nIf `p=0`, the formula for `s_max` gives `s_max=1`.\nThen `p_rem = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n`min_nodes = 1 + 2*0 = 1`.\n`unidirectional = (1^2 - (1^2 + 0*4))/2 = 0`.\nSo `1 0`.\nLet's stick to the logic for `n>=1`. The example output for `p=0` is likely an exception.\n\nFinal check on `s_max` calculation:\n`s * (s - 1) / 2 <= p`\n`s^2 - s - 2p <= 0`\nRoots of `s^2 - s - 2p = 0` are `(1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`.\nSo `s <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`.\n`s_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\nThis is a more robust way to find `s_max`.\n\nLet's test `p=0` with `s_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 0)) / 2) = floor((1+1)/2) = floor(1) = 1`.\n`min_nodes = 1`. `unidirectional = 0`.\nMy solution for `p=0` is `1 0`. If the judge expects `0 0`, then I need a special case for `p=0`. Given it's a competitive programming problem, `0 0` for `p=0` is a common special case.\n\nLet's implement the logic assuming `p=0` is `0 0`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Part 1: Minimum number of nodes (n)\n    # Find the largest s such that s * (s - 1) / 2 <= p\n    # s^2 - s - 2p <= 0\n    # s <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2\n    s_max = int((1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * p)) / 2)\n    \n    # Due to floating point precision, s_max might be off by 1.\n    # We need to make sure s_max * (s_max - 1) / 2 <= p.\n    # If s_max * (s_max - 1) / 2 > p, decrement s_max.\n    # If (s_max + 1) * s_max / 2 <= p, increment s_max.\n    # A safer way is to check both s_max and s_max-1 (if s_max > 0)\n    # The value from the formula is typically correct or needs -1.\n    # Let's verify:\n    # If s_max*(s_max-1)/2 > p, then s_max is too large.\n    while s_max * (s_max - 1) // 2 > p:\n        s_max -= 1\n    # If (s_max+1)*s_max/2 <= p, then s_max could be larger.\n    while (s_max + 1) * s_max // 2 <= p:\n        s_max += 1\n\n    # Calculate remaining pairs\n    p_covered = s_max * (s_max - 1) // 2\n    p_rem = p - p_covered\n\n    # Total nodes: s_max for the largest SCC, and 2*p_rem for p_rem SCCs of size 2\n    min_nodes = s_max + 2 * p_rem\n\n    # Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # The SCCs are: one of size s_max, and p_rem of size 2.\n    # Arrange them in a linear chain to maximize unidirectional pairs.\n    # Total unidirectional pairs = (sum of sizes)^2 - sum(size_i^2) / 2\n    # sum of sizes = min_nodes\n    # sum(size_i^2) = s_max^2 + p_rem * (2^2)\n    \n    sum_of_squares_of_scc_sizes = s_max * s_max + p_rem * (2 * 2)\n    \n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_nodes * min_nodes - sum_of_squares_of_scc_sizes) // 2\n\n    print(f\"{min_nodes} {max_unidirectional_pairs}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
