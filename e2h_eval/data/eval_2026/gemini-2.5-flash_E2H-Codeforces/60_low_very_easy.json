Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Morse Code Decoding Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Morse code problem. It's about counting valid letter sequences derived from substrings of a binary string, `S`, that's built up character by character. After each addition, I need to report the count modulo 10^9 + 7.  Right, I'm already seeing some classic dynamic programming potential here.\n\nFirst, I need to be clear on the rules. We're dealing with Morse code representations that have lengths from 1 to 4, using only '0' and '1'.  There are 26 valid representations corresponding to English letters, and I quickly remember those four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". That's crucial. I already double-checked that 2+4+8+12 equals 26, matching the problem description.\n\nThe key is that we're counting *sequences* of letters, meaning if a substring can be decoded as multiple letters in a row, like \"hello\" (though in Morse!), it should be counted as such.\n\nNow, my mind goes straight to a dynamic programming approach. I'll need a `dp` array. I'll set `dp[i]` to represent the number of ways the prefix `S[0...i-1]` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters. The base case, `dp[0]`, should be 1 (because the empty string can be decoded into an empty sequence, which is valid).\n\nFor each position `i` in `S`, I need to consider all possible lengths of valid Morse code substrings ending at `i`.  So, I check the substring ending at `S[i-1]` (length 1), then the substring ending at `S[i-2]` (length 2), all the way up to length 4, and if they represent a valid Morse code (ie if a decoding exists), I'll add the corresponding `dp[i-k]` value (where k is the substring's length) to `dp[i]`. I'll do this modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers, of course.\n\nThe final answer isn't just `dp[len(S)]`. We need *all* sequences. So I need to sum `dp[i]` for every possible substring of `S`, making sure to take the modulus at each step. That means for each character appended to the string I will need to process every substring ending at that new character.\n\nOkay, I'm feeling confident about this. Dynamic programming seems like the natural fit. I'm ready to start coding a solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding substrings of a growing string `S`. Each English letter is represented by a Morse code string of '0's and '1's, with length 1 to 4. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not correspond to any letter.\n\nLet's first identify the valid Morse code strings. There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` possible strings of length 1 to 4. Out of these, 4 are invalid. So, `30 - 4 = 26` strings are valid Morse codes, each corresponding to a distinct English letter.\n\nThe set of invalid Morse codes is `INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\nA string `s` is a valid Morse code if its length is between 1 and 4, and `s` is not in `INVALID_CODES`.\n\nWe are interested in non-empty sequences of English letters. If a substring `sub` of `S` can be decoded in `k` different ways into sequences of English letters, then these `k` sequences contribute to our total count.\n\nLet `S_current` be the string `S` at any given moment. `S_current` has length `L`.\nWe need to consider all substrings `S_current[j...i]` for `0 <= j <= i < L`.\nFor each such substring, we want to count how many ways it can be decoded into a sequence of English letters.\n\nThis can be solved using dynamic programming. For a given substring `sub`, let `dp_sub[k]` be the number of ways the prefix `sub[0...k-1]` can be decoded.\n`dp_sub[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence).\nFor `k` from 1 to `len(sub)`:\n  `dp_sub[k] = 0`\n  If `sub[k-1]` is a valid Morse code (length 1), `dp_sub[k] += dp_sub[k-1]`.\n  If `sub[k-2...k-1]` is a valid Morse code (length 2), `dp_sub[k] += dp_sub[k-2]`.\n  If `sub[k-3...k-1]` is a valid Morse code (length 3), `dp_sub[k] += dp_sub[k-3]`.\n  If `sub[k-4...k-1]` is a valid Morse code (length 4), `dp_sub[k] += dp_sub[k-4]`.\nAll additions are modulo `10^9 + 7`.\nThe number of ways `sub` can be decoded is `dp_sub[len(sub)]`. Since we need non-empty sequences, we subtract 1 (for the empty sequence) if `len(sub) > 0`. So, `(dp_sub[len(sub)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `O(L^2)` substrings and for each substring, run the `O(L)` DP, leading to `O(L^3)` per append operation, or `O(M^4)` total. Given `M=3000`, this is too slow.\n\nWe can optimize this. When a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S_new = S_current + c`, the length of `S` increases by 1. Let `L` be the new length.\nThe new substrings are `S_new[j...L-1]` for `0 <= j < L`.\nFor each `j`, `S_new[j...L-1]` is a suffix of `S_new`. We need to calculate its decoding count.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways the suffix `S_new[k...L-1]` can be decoded.\nThis is not quite right. The DP definition above is for prefixes.\nLet `dp_end[i]` be the number of ways the prefix `S_new[0...i-1]` can be decoded.\nThe total sum we need is `sum_{j=0}^{L-1} (dp_j[L-j] - 1)`.\nHere `dp_j` refers to the DP for substring `S_new[j...L-1]`.\n\nConsider the total sum of `(dp_sub[len(sub)] - 1)` for all substrings `sub`.\nLet `f[i]` be the number of ways the prefix `S[0...i-1]` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters.\n`f[0] = 1` (empty string, one way to decode: empty sequence).\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  `f[i] = 0`\n  If `S[i-1]` is valid (len 1), `f[i] += f[i-1]`\n  If `S[i-2...i-1]` is valid (len 2), `f[i] += f[i-2]`\n  If `S[i-3...i-1]` is valid (len 3), `f[i] += f[i-3]`\n  If `S[i-4...i-1]` is valid (len 4), `f[i] += f[i-4]`\n  `f[i] %= MOD`\n\nThe total count of *all* possible sequences (including empty ones) formed by *all* prefixes `S[0...i-1]` is `sum(f[i] for i in 1 to L)`.\nThis is not what we want. We need `sum_{j=0}^{L-1} (dp_j[L-j] - 1)`.\n\nLet `total_count` be the answer.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S` (current length `L-1`), forming `S_new` (length `L`):\nThe answer for `S_new` is the answer for `S_current` plus the number of sequences that *end* at index `L-1`.\nLet `g[i]` be the number of ways the suffix `S_new[i...L-1]` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters.\nWe need to sum `(g[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` for `i` from `0` to `L-1`.\nThis is equal to `sum_{i=0}^{L-1} g[i] - L`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[k...L-1]`.\n`dp[L] = 1` (empty suffix, one way to decode: empty sequence).\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n  If `S[k]` is valid (len 1), `dp[k] += dp[k+1]`\n  If `S[k...k+1]` is valid (len 2), `dp[k] += dp[k+2]`\n  If `S[k...k+2]` is valid (len 3), `dp[k] += dp[k+3]`\n  If `S[k...k+3]` is valid (len 4), `dp[k] += dp[k+4]`\n  `dp[k] %= MOD`\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let the new length be `L`.\nThe values `dp[k]` for `k < L-1` are not simply shifted or reused because they referred to suffixes of the *previous* string.\nHowever, we are calculating the total count of sequences.\nLet `total_ans[L]` be the answer for the string of length `L`.\n`total_ans[L] = total_ans[L-1] + (sum of ways to decode suffixes ending at L-1) - (number of new empty sequences)`.\nThe number of new empty sequences is 1 (for the new suffix `S[L-1...L-1]`).\n\nLet `count_ways_ending_at_current_position[j]` be the number of ways to decode the substring `S[j...L-1]` (where `L-1` is the current last index).\nWe need `sum_{j=0}^{L-1} (count_ways_ending_at_current_position[j] - 1)`.\nLet `dp_suffix[k]` be the number of ways to decode `S[k...L-1]` (including empty sequence).\nWhen `S` grows by one character `c` to `S_new` of length `L`:\nWe need `dp_suffix[L] = 1`.\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffix[k] = 0`\n  If `S_new[k]` is valid (len 1), `dp_suffix[k] += dp_suffix[k+1]`\n  If `S_new[k...k+1]` is valid (len 2), `dp_suffix[k] += dp_suffix[k+2]`\n  If `S_new[k...k+2]` is valid (len 3), `dp_suffix[k] += dp_suffix[k+3]`\n  If `S_new[k...k+3]` is valid (len 4), `dp_suffix[k] += dp_suffix[k+4]`\n  `dp_suffix[k] %= MOD`\nThe sum of `dp_suffix[k]` for `k=0...L-1` would be `sum_{k=0}^{L-1} (number of ways to decode S[k...L-1])`.\nThe total answer is `(sum_{k=0}^{L-1} dp_suffix[k]) - L`.\n\nThis approach still requires recomputing `dp_suffix` for all `L` positions for each new character, leading to `O(L)` per character, total `O(M^2)`.\n`M=3000`, `M^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which might be acceptable.\n\nLet `current_string` be the string `S`.\nLet `total_sum_dp` be the running total of `dp_suffix[k]` values.\nInitialize `total_sum_dp = 0`.\nInitialize `dp_vals = [0] * (M+1)` where `dp_vals[k]` represents `dp_suffix[k]` for the current `S`.\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\nFor each new character `c`:\n  Append `c` to `current_string`. Let `L` be `len(current_string)`.\n  `dp_vals[L] = 1` (base case for empty suffix)\n  `new_sum_for_current_suffix = 0`\n  For `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n    `val_k = 0`\n    # Check length 1 suffix\n    if `k+1 <= L`:\n      `val_k = (val_k + dp_vals[k+1]) % MOD`\n    # Check length 2 suffix\n    if `k+2 <= L`:\n      `sub = current_string[k:k+2]`\n      if `sub not in INVALID_CODES`:\n        `val_k = (val_k + dp_vals[k+2]) % MOD`\n    # Check length 3 suffix\n    if `k+3 <= L`:\n      `sub = current_string[k:k+3]`\n      if `sub not in INVALID_CODES`:\n        `val_k = (val_k + dp_vals[k+3]) % MOD`\n    # Check length 4 suffix\n    if `k+4 <= L`:\n      `sub = current_string[k:k+4]`\n      if `sub not in INVALID_CODES`:\n        `val_k = (val_k + dp_vals[k+4]) % MOD`\n    `dp_vals[k] = val_k`\n    `new_sum_for_current_suffix = (new_sum_for_current_suffix + val_k) % MOD`\n  \n  `current_ans = (new_sum_for_current_suffix - L + MOD) % MOD`\n  Print `current_ans`.\n\nLet's test this `O(M^2)` approach with an example. `S = \"111\"`.\n`M=3`.\n\n1. Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`, `L = 1`.\n   `dp_vals = [0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n   `dp_vals[1] = 1`.\n   `new_sum_for_current_suffix = 0`.\n   `k = 0`:\n     `val_0 = 0`.\n     `S[0]` is \"1\" (valid, len 1). `val_0 = (val_0 + dp_vals[1]) % MOD = 1`.\n     `dp_vals[0] = 1`.\n     `new_sum_for_current_suffix = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `current_ans = (1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`.\n   This is incorrect. For \"1\", the sequence \"T\" is 1 way. `(dp_suffix[0] - 1)` should be 1.\n   The sum `new_sum_for_current_suffix` is `sum_{k=0}^{L-1} dp_suffix[k]`.\n   For `S=\"1\"`, `L=1`. `dp_suffix[0]` means ways to decode \"1\". \"1\" is a valid code, so it can be decoded as \"T\". The empty sequence is not counted by `dp_suffix[0]` if we define `dp_suffix[k]` as ways to decode `S[k...L-1]` into non-empty sequences.\n   Let's redefine `dp_suffix[k]` as ways to decode `S[k...L-1]` into non-empty sequences.\n   Then `dp_suffix[L] = 0`.\n   For `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n     `val_k = 0`\n     If `S[k]` is valid (len 1): `val_k = (val_k + dp_suffix[k+1] + 1) % MOD` (add 1 for the single letter itself)\n     If `S[k...k+1]` is valid (len 2): `val_k = (val_k + dp_suffix[k+2] + 1) % MOD`\n     ...\n   The total answer is `sum_{k=0}^{L-1} dp_suffix[k]`.\n\nLet's use the definition of `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode string `S[i...L-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\n`dp[L] = 0` (empty string, 0 non-empty sequences).\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n  `s1 = S[k]`\n  If `len(s1) == 1` and `s1 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+1] + 1) % MOD`\n  `s2 = S[k:k+2]`\n  If `len(s2) == 2` and `s2 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+2] + 1) % MOD`\n  `s3 = S[k:k+3]`\n  If `len(s3) == 3` and `s3 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+3] + 1) % MOD`\n  `s4 = S[k:k+4]`\n  If `len(s4) == 4` and `s4 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+4] + 1) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer after `L` characters is `sum_{k=0}^{L-1} dp[k]`.\nThis is exactly `O(M^2)`. Let's re-trace with `S=\"111\"` and this DP definition.\n\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n`current_string = []`\n`dp = [0] * (M+5)` (pad for `k+4`)\n`total_ans = 0`\n\n1.

Now we need to add `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` for `S=\"11\"`.\n   `dp[0]` for \"11\" is 3. `dp[1]` for \"11\" is 1.\n   The total for `S=\"11\"` is `dp[0] + dp[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`. This is the sum of ways to decode \"11\" (3 ways: \"TT\", \"M\", \"T\" followed by empty) and \"1\" (1 way: \"T\").\n   The problem asks for sequences from *some substring*.\n   For `S=\"11\"`, substrings are \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"11\".\n   \"1\" (index 0) -> \"T\" (1 way)\n   \"1\" (index 1) -> \"T\" (1 way)\n   \"11\" -> \"M\" (1 way), \"TT\" (1 way). Total 2 ways.\n   Total unique sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". This is 3.\n\nThe problem states: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis sounds like we need to sum `(dp_sub[len(sub)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` for all substrings `sub`.\n\nLet `dp_val[i]` be `dp_sub[len(sub)]` for `sub = S[0...i-1]`.\nThis means `dp_val[i]` is the number of ways to decode `S[0...i-1]` (including empty sequence).\n`dp_val[0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  `dp_val[i] = 0`\n  `s1 = S[i-1]`\n  If `len(s1) == 1` and `s1 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-1]) % MOD`\n  `s2 = S[i-2:i]`\n  If `len(s2) == 2` and `s2 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-2]) % MOD`\n  `s3 = S[i-3:i]`\n  If `len(s3) == 3` and `s3 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-3]) % MOD`\n  `s4 = S[i-4:i]`\n  If `len(s4) == 4` and `s4 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-4]) % MOD`\n\nThis `dp_val` is for prefixes *starting at index 0*.\nWe need it for all substrings.\nThis is a common DP problem structure. The total number of ways to decode *any* substring `S[j...i]` can be found by summing up `dp_val_for_substring[i-j+1]` for each substring.\nLet `dp[i]` be the sum of `(number of ways to decode S[j...i-1] - 1)` for all `j <= i`.\nThis is equivalent to: `dp[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (ways_to_decode(S[j...i-1]) - 1)`.\nThis is the total answer for the string `S[0...i-1]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences ending at index `i-1`.\nNo, this is also not right.\nThe example output for S=\"111\" is 1, 3, 7.\n\nLet's re-read the example output for S=\"111\":\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal 7 distinct sequences.\n\nThis implies that if a substring `sub` can be decoded in multiple ways, say `W1, W2, W3`, these are all counted.\nIf another substring `sub'` can also be decoded as `W1`, then `W1` from `sub` and `W1` from `sub'` are considered the *same* sequence. The problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters\". This phrasing typically means distinct sequences.\n\nIf it means distinct sequences, then we need a `set` to store all generated sequences and count its size. This is impossible with `M=3000` as sequences can be very long.\n\nCompetitive programming problems usually mean \"sum of ways\" when they say \"number of sequences\" unless \"distinct\" is explicitly mentioned AND the problem constraints allow for it. The example output is `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"111\"`. Let's verify if \"sum of ways\" matches.\n\n`S=\"1\"`:\nSubstring \"1\". Decodes to \"T\". 1 way. Total = 1.

The problem is rated \"easy\", so it's unlikely to involve a complex set-based DP.\nLet's re-read the example's \"Note\" carefully:\n\"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\"\nThen it lists:\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nAnd then it says: \"Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\"\nThe example lists 7 sequences. The output for `S=\"111\"` is `7`.\nThis confirms that the problem asks for the *number of distinct sequences*.\n\nThe \"easy\" rating for a problem with `M=3000` and \"distinct sequences\" usually implies that the maximum length of a decoded sequence is small, or the number of distinct sequences is small enough to fit in a set, or there's a trick.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. So a sequence of letters `L1 L2 ... Lk` can have length `k` up to `M`. `M=3000`. So `k` can be 3000.\nStoring strings of length 3000 in a set is not feasible.\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of the problem statement or the example.\n\"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nLet's assume \"sequence of English letters\" refers to the *type* of sequence, not the specific instance.\nFor `S=\"11\"`, substrings are `S[0]=\"1\"`, `S[1]=\"1\"`, `S[0:2]=\"11\"`.\n`S[0]=\"1\"` decodes to \"T\".\n`S[1]=\"1\"` decodes to \"T\".\n`S[0:2]=\"11\"` decodes to \"M\" and \"TT\".\nThe set of sequences found is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. The size is 3. This matches the example.\n\nThe problem implies that we need to keep track of all *distinct* sequences of letters.\nHow can we do this efficiently?\nIf \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" are invalid, then there are 26 valid Morse codes.\nLet's assign an ID to each letter (0 to 25). A sequence of letters can be represented as a tuple of IDs.\nStill, the length of the tuple can be up to `M`.\n\nPerhaps the problem constraints or structure lead to a limited number of *new* sequences at each step.\nWhen `c` is appended to `S` to form `S_new` of length `L`:\nThe new sequences are those formed by substrings `S_new[j...L-1]` for `0 <= j < L`.\nA substring `S_new[j...L-1]` can be decoded into sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`.\n`L_k` must be represented by `S_new[p...L-1]` for some `p`.\n`L_{k-1}` must be represented by `S_new[q...p-1]`.\nThis is a standard DP approach on suffix.\nLet `dp_suffix[k]` be a set of all distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[k...L-1]`.\n`dp_suffix[L] = {}` (empty set).\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffix[k] = {}`\n  `s1 = S[k]`\n  If `s1` is valid, let `letter_s1` be its corresponding letter.\n    `dp_suffix[k].add(letter_s1)`\n    For each `seq` in `dp_suffix[k+1]`: `dp_suffix[k].add(letter_s1 + seq)`.\n  `s2 = S[k:k+2]`\n  If `s2` is valid, let `letter_s2` be its corresponding letter.\n    `dp_suffix[k].add(letter_s2)`\n    For each `seq` in `dp_suffix[k+2]`: `dp_suffix[k].add(letter_s2 + seq)`.\n  ... and similarly for `s3`, `s4`.\n\nThis approach involves sets of strings, which will be too slow and memory intensive.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This means `S[k...L-1]` can be broken down in at most 4 ways from the start.\nThe \"easy\" rating is a strong hint. What if the total number of distinct sequences is not that large? Or there's a way to count them without explicitly storing them?\n\nLet's check the constraints again. `M <= 3000`.\nA common trick for \"distinct sequences\" when `M` is large is to use hashing, but even with hashing, storing all sequences is problematic due to collisions and memory.\n\nWhat if the problem meant \"sum of ways to decode *each substring*\"?\n`S=\"1\"`: \"1\" -> \"T\". 1 way. Total = 1.\n`S=\"11\"`:\n  \"1\" (idx 0) -> \"T\". 1 way.\n  \"1\" (idx 1) -> \"T\". 1 way.\n  \"11\" (idx 0) -> \"M\", \"TT\". 2 ways.\n  Total sum of ways: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.\n  Example output: `3`.\nThis means \"sum of ways\" is NOT the answer. It is indeed distinct sequences.\n\nThe only way this is \"easy\" is if the number of distinct sequences is small enough.\nMaximum length of Morse code is 4.\nThis means that a sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is formed by `S[idx_1...idx_2-1] S[idx_2...idx_3-1] ... S[idx_k...L-1]`.\nThe length of `S[idx_i...idx_{i+1}-1]` is at most 4.\nThis means `idx_{i+1} - idx_i <= 4`.\nSo, `L-idx_1 <= 4k`.\nThis does not bound `k` to be small.\n\nCould it be that the problem is not about the \"value\" of the sequence (e.g., \"T\" vs \"M\"), but merely the \"pattern\" of lengths of Morse codes? No, \"T\" and \"M\" are distinct.\nCould it be that the number of distinct sequences ending at `L-1` is small?\nLet's consider the state `(last_4_chars_of_S, last_letter_decoded, length_of_last_letter_code)`. This is a finite state automaton.\nThis is a standard technique for \"number of distinct substrings\" or \"number of distinct paths\".\nThe states are pairs `(last_k_chars_of_S, last_decoded_sequence)`.\nThe `last_decoded_sequence` can be long. This doesn't help.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter made a mistake in rating or problem statement, and it's actually \"sum of ways\". If so, the `O(M^2)` DP I derived earlier would work.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways prefix `S[0...i-1]` can be decoded.\nLet `total_sum_ways` be the sum of `dp[i]` for all substrings `S[j...k]`.\nThis is `sum_{j=0}^{L-1} sum_{k=j}^{L-1} (decoding_ways(S[j...k]) - 1)`.\nThis is exactly `sum_{j=0}^{L-1} (dp_suffix[j] - 1)` from my `O(M^2)` DP.\nLet's re-verify the example with `S=\"111\"` and `O(M^2)` DP.\n`dp[k]` = number of non-empty sequences from `S[k...L-1]`.\n`dp[L] = 0`.\n`total_ans = 0`.\n\n1.

(Output: 3) Does not match.\n\nThe problem explicitly says \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThe example output for S=\"11\" is 3. My `O(M^2)` DP gave 4.\nThis means the `O(M^2)` DP for \"sum of ways\" is incorrect.\nThe problem is indeed about *distinct* sequences.\n\nThis implies there's a very clever trick or a very specific property of Morse codes being used.\nThe fact that there are only 26 letters, and only 4 invalid codes, means that a lot of strings are valid.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This is a small constant.\n\nWhat if we consider the *last 4 characters* of the string `S`?\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S'`.\nThe new sequences are those ending at the new last character `S'[L-1]`.\nThese sequences are `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`, where `L_k` is formed by `S'[p...L-1]`.\n`S'[p...L-1]` can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nLet `new_sequences_ending_at_L_minus_1` be the set of sequences formed by `S'[j...L-1]` for `0 <= j < L`.\nThis set can be constructed by considering `S'[L-1]`, `S'[L-2...L-1]`, `S'[L-3...L-1]`, `S'[L-4...L-1]`.\nFor each of these (if valid Morse codes), say `code_X` maps to letter `X`:\n  Add `X` to `new_sequences_ending_at_L_minus_1`.\n  For each sequence `prev_seq` that ended at `L-1-len(code_X)`:\n    Add `X + prev_seq` to `new_sequences_ending_at_L_minus_1`.\n\nThis is still using sets of strings.\nWhat if we use a Trie (prefix tree) to store all distinct sequences?\nEach node in the Trie represents a prefix of a sequence. The total count would be the number of nodes in the Trie that represent a complete sequence.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S_new` of length `L`.\nWe need to generate all sequences `X_1 X_2 ... X_k` that end at `L-1`.\n`X_k` is `S_new[L-1]`, `S_new[L-2...L-1]`, etc.\n`X_1 ... X_{k-1}` is generated from `S_new[j...L-1-len(X_k)]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be a set of all distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[0...i-1]`.\n`dp[0] = {\"\"}` (empty sequence).\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  `dp[i] = {}`\n  `s1 = S[i-1]`\n  If `s1` is valid, `letter_s1`.\n    For `seq` in `dp[i-1]`: `dp[i].add(seq + letter_s1)`\n  `s2 = S[i-2:i]`\n  If `s2` is valid, `letter_s2`.\n    For `seq` in `dp[i-2]`: `dp[i].add(seq + letter_s2)`\n  ...\n\nThis generates sequences for prefixes. We need for all substrings.\nThis is also too slow.\n\nLet's rethink the \"easy\" rating. Could the problem statement be slightly ambiguous and the example be misleading for the general case?\n\"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThis could mean:\n1. Count of distinct sequences (like my \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\" for \"11\"). This is hard.\n2. Sum of `(ways_to_decode(sub) - 1)` for all substrings `sub`. This is `O(M^2)`.\n3. Sum of `(ways_to_decode(sub) - 1)` for all *suffixes* of `S`. This is `O(M)` per step, `O(M^2)` total.\n\nLet's assume it's interpretation #3, as this is the most common \"easy\" DP for such problems.\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"111\"`:\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp[0]=1`. Total `1`.\n`S=\"11\"`: `dp[0]=3`, `dp[1]=1`. Total `3+1=4`. (Example output `3`).\n`S=\"111\"`:\n  `dp[3]=0`\n  `k=2`: `s1=\"1\"` (valid). `dp[2] = (dp[2] + dp[3] + 1) = 1`.\n  `k=1`: `s1=\"1\"` (valid). `dp[1] = (dp[1] + dp[2] + 1) = (0 + 1 + 1) = 2`.\n         `s2=\"11\"` (valid). `dp[1] = (dp[1] + dp[3] + 1) = (2 + 0 + 1) = 3`.\n  `k=0`: `s1=\"1\"` (valid). `dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[1] + 1) = (0 + 3 + 1) = 4`.\n         `s2=\"11\"` (valid). `dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[2] + 1) = (4 + 1 + 1) = 6`.\n         `s3=\"111\"` (valid). `dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[3] + 1) = (6 + 0 + 1) = 7`.\n  Total `dp[0] + dp[1] + dp[2] = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`. (Example output `7`).\n\nMy `O(M^2)` DP (sum of ways for all suffixes) does not match the example output.\nThis strongly implies the example output is for \"distinct sequences\".\nThe only way this is an easy problem is if the number of distinct sequences is limited.\nWhat if the sequences are only distinct up to a certain length?\nNo, the example lists \"TTT\" (length 3).\n\nFinal attempt at logic for distinct sequences:\nThe key insight for this type of problem is often related to the small constant (max length 4).\nLet `dp[i]` be the *set* of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[j...i-1]` for *any* `j <= i-1`.\nThis is `dp[i] = union_{j=0}^{i-1} ways_to_decode(S[j...i-1])`.\n`dp[i]` is the set of all distinct sequences that end at `i-1`.\nWhen we add `c` to `S` to make `S_new` of length `L`.\nWe need to calculate `dp[L]`.\n`dp[L]` will be formed by taking letters `X` from `S_new[L-1]`, `S_new[L-2...L-1]`, etc.\nAnd prepending them to sequences in `dp[L-1]`, `dp[L-2]`, etc.\n\nLet `all_sequences` be a Trie (or Aho-Corasick automaton) that stores all distinct sequences found so far.\nWhen `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S_new` of length `L`.\nWe need to find all sequences `X_1 ... X_k` that can be formed by `S_new[j...L-1]` for `0 <= j < L`.\nFor each `j` from `L-1` down to `max(0, L-4)`:\n  Let `sub = S_new[j...L-1]`.\n  If `sub` is a valid Morse code for letter `X`.\n    Then `X` is a new sequence. Add it to `all_sequences`.\n    For each `prev_seq` in `all_sequences` that ends at `j-1`:\n      The sequence `X + prev_seq` is a new sequence. Add it to `all_sequences`.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nThe problem statement seems to be a standard problem that implies a very simple DP for \"sum of ways\". The example output is the only thing making it distinct sequences.\nGiven it's an \"easy\" problem, it's highly probable the example output is specifically tailored to match the \"distinct sequences\" for small M, but for larger M, it simplifies to \"sum of ways\". This is a common pattern in competitive programming, where \"distinct\" is often dropped or simplified for large inputs due to complexity.\n\nLet's consider the problem statement \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nIf `S=\"1\"`, substring is \"1\". \"T\". Count = 1.\nIf `S=\"11\"`, substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"11\".\n\"1\" -> \"T\".\n\"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\".\nThe problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences\".\nIf I have \"T\" from `S[0]` and \"T\" from `S[1]`, are these the same sequence? Yes, \"T\" is one sequence.\nIf I have \"M\" from `S[0:2]` and \"TT\" from `S[0:2]`, these are two different sequences.\nSo the set of sequences is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Size is 3.\n\nThis is a problem that requires a specific DP state.\nLet `dp[i]` be the set of sequences formed by decoding `S[j...i-1]` for *some* `j`.\nThis means `dp[i]` contains all sequences that *end* at index `i-1`.\n`dp[i]` is a set of strings.\n`dp[0] = {}`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  `dp[i] = {}`\n  `s1 = S[i-1]`\n  If `s1` is valid, let `letter_s1` be its letter.\n    `dp[i].add(letter_s1)`\n    For `seq` in `dp[i-1]`: `dp[i].add(seq + letter_s1)`\n  `s2 = S[i-2:i]`\n  If `s2` is valid, let `letter_s2` be its letter.\n    `dp[i].add(letter_s2)`\n    For `seq` in `dp[i-2]`: `dp[i].add(seq + letter_s2)`\n  ... and for `s3`, `s4`.\n\nThe total answer after `L` characters is `union_{k=1}^{L} dp[k]`.size().\nThis is still too complex for `M=3000`.\n\nThe only way this is feasible is if the number of distinct sequences is small enough to be put in a set.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences is `26^M`. No.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences ending at `i` is bounded by `26 * (max_len_of_prev_seq)`.\nIf `max_len_of_prev_seq` is `M-1`, then `26 * (M-1)`.\nThe total number of sequences could be `M * 26 * M`.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the valid/invalid codes.\nInvalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nThese are specific patterns.\nWhat if we use polynomial hashing for strings?\nEach sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can be hashed to a single integer.\nWe can then store these hashes in a `set`.\n`set_of_hashes = set()`.\nWhen `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S_new` of length `L`.\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `max(0, L-4)`:\n  `current_code = S_new[k...L-1]`\n  If `current_code` is valid (let its letter be `X`):\n    `hash_X = hash(X)`\n    `set_of_hashes.add(hash_X)`\n    For `j` from `0` to `k-1`:\n      Let `prev_hash` be the hash of `S_new[j...k-1]`.\n      The sequence `S_new[j...k-1] + X` has hash `prev_hash * P + hash_X`.\n      This is still generating all substrings.\n\nThe problem asks for *sequences of English letters*. This means the `X` is an actual letter, not its Morse code.\nExample: \"1\" -> T. \"11\" -> M. \"111\" -> O.\n\"11\" can be \"TT\" as well.\n\"111\" can be \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nLet's use the `O(M^2)` DP for \"sum of ways\" and see if it passes.\nThe specific phrasing \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters\" combined with the \"easy\" tag strongly suggests that the problem intended to ask for the sum of `(ways_to_decode(sub) - 1)` for all substrings `sub`. The example output might be misleading, or a special case.\nIf the solution is `O(M^2)` and passes, it means the problem statement and example are conflicting for `M > 2`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[i...L-1]` into a sequence of English letters (including the empty sequence).\n`dp[L] = 1` (empty string, 1 way: empty sequence).\nFor `i` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  `s1 = S[i:i+1]`\n  If `i+1 <= L` and `s1 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+1]) % MOD`\n  `s2 = S[i:i+2]`\n  If `i+2 <= L` and `s2 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+2]) % MOD`\n  `s3 = S[i:i+3]`\n  If `i+3 <= L` and `s3 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+3]) % MOD`\n  `s4 = S[i:i+4]`\n  If `i+4 <= L` and `s4 not in INVALID_CODES`:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+4]) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer for string `S` of length `L` is `(sum_{i=0}^{L-1} dp[i]) - L`.\nThis is the sum of ways to decode each suffix `S[i...L-1]` (including empty sequence) minus `L` (for the `L` empty sequences).\nThis is `O(L)` computation for each appended char, total `O(M^2)`.\n\nLet's re-trace `S=\"111\"` with this `O(M^2)` DP.\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n`current_string = []`\n`dp = [0] * (M+5)`\n\n1.

Still mismatch.\n\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"111\"` is critical.\n`S=\"1\"`: 1 sequence (\"T\").\n`S=\"11\"`: 3 sequences (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\").\n`S=\"111\"`: 7 sequences (\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\").\n\nThis is the exact set of sequences given in the example note!\nThis means the problem is asking for the size of the union of all distinct sequences formed by decoding *any* substring of `S`.\nThis is a very hard problem for `M=3000` if implemented naively.\n\nHowever, there is a known trick for counting distinct strings/sequences when they are formed by combining a small number of \"base\" elements.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This is a small constant.\nThere are 26 letters.\nLet `dp_val[i]` be the set of distinct sequences that *end* at index `i-1`.\n`dp_val[i]` would be `set()`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `L`:\n  `dp_val[L]` is computed.\n  `current_ans = (current_ans union dp_val[L]).size()`.\nThe `dp_val[L]` calculation is:\n  For `k` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `L-k >= 0` and `S[L-k...L-1]` is a valid code `X`:\n      If `L-k == 0`:\n        `dp_val[L].add(X)`\n      Else:\n        `dp_val[L].add(X)`\n        For `prev_seq` in `dp_val[L-k]`:\n          `dp_val[L].add(prev_seq + X)`\n\nThis still involves sets of strings. Using polynomial hashing:\nLet `hashes[i]` be the set of hashes of distinct sequences ending at index `i-1`.\n`hashes[0] = set()`.\n`total_hashes = set()`.\nFor `L` from `1` to `M`:\n  Append `c` to `S`.\n  `hashes[L] = set()`\n  For `k` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `L-k >= 0` and `S[L-k...L-1]` is a valid code `X`:\n      `hash_X = hash_letter(X)` (e.g., `ord(X)`)\n      `hashes[L].add(hash_X)`\n      `total_hashes.add(hash_X)`\n      If `L-k > 0`:\n        For `prev_hash` in `hashes[L-k]`:\n          `new_hash = (prev_hash * P + hash_X) % MOD_HASH`\n          `hashes[L].add(new_hash)`\n          `total_hashes.add(new_hash)`\n  Print `len(total_hashes)`.\n\nThis looks like a plausible `O(M^2 * max_len_code * (avg_set_size))` approach.\n`max_len_code` is 4.\n`avg_set_size` could be large.\nThe number of distinct sequences ending at `i` could be `~ 26 * M`.\nSo `O(M * 4 * M) = O(M^2)` per step. Total `O(M^3)`.\n`3000^3 = 2.7 * 10^10`. Too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation is that `prev_seq` is a sequence from `S[j...L-k-1]`.\nThe length of `prev_seq` can be `L-k`.\nThe number of distinct sequences of length `L-k` could be huge.\nHowever, `prev_seq` is stored as a hash.\nThe number of hashes in `hashes[L-k]` could be `~ (L-k) * 26`.\nSo, `sum(len(hashes[L-k]))` for `k=1..4`. This is `O(L)`.\nSo for each `L`, we do `sum_{k=1 to 4} (len(hashes[L-k]) * 1)` operations to compute `hashes[L]`.\n`len(hashes[L-k])` can be `O(L-k)`.\nSo `hashes[L]` takes `O(L)` time to compute. Total `O(M^2)`.\n`M^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is feasible.\n\nLet's refine the `O(M^2)` polynomial hashing approach.\n`MOD_HASH_1 = 10^9 + 7`\n`P1 = 31` (or some other prime greater than 26)\n`MOD_HASH_2 = 10^9 + 9` (for double hashing, to reduce collisions)\n`P2 = 37`\n\n`letter_to_int` mapping: 'A'->1, 'B'->2, ..., 'Z'->26.\n`morse_to_letter` mapping:\n  \"0\" -> 'E', \"1\" -> 'T',\n  \"00\" -> 'I', \"01\" -> 'A', \"10\" -> 'N', \"11\" -> 'M',\n  \"000\" -> 'S', \"001\" -> 'U', \"010\" -> 'R', \"011\" -> 'W',\n  \"100\" -> 'D', \"101\" -> 'K', \"110\" -> 'G', \"111\" -> 'O',\n  \"0000\" -> 'H', \"0001\" -> 'V', \"0010\" -> 'F',\n  \"0100\" -> 'L', \"0110\" -> 'P', \"0111\" -> 'J',\n  \"1000\" -> 'B', \"1001\" -> 'X', \"1010\" -> 'C', \"1011\" -> 'Y',\n  \"1100\" -> 'Z', \"1101\" -> 'Q'.\n\n`current_S = []`\n`dp_hashes = [set() for _ in range(M + 1)]`  # dp_hashes[i] stores hashes for sequences ending at index i-1\n`total_distinct_hashes = set()`\n\nFor `L` from `1` to `M`:\n  `char_added = input()`\n  `current_S.append(char_added)`\n\n  `# Calculate hashes for sequences ending at L-1`\n  `# These are formed by X, or prev_seq + X`\n  For `k` from `1` to `min(L, 4)`:\n    `start_idx = L - k`\n    `morse_code_segment = \"\".join(current_S[start_idx:L])`\n\n    If `morse_code_segment not in INVALID_CODES`:\n      `letter = morse_to_letter[morse_code_segment]`\n      `letter_val = letter_to_int[letter]`\n\n      `# Case 1: Sequence is just the letter X`\n      `h1 = letter_val`\n      `h2 = letter_val`\n      `dp_hashes[L].add((h1, h2))`\n      `total_distinct_hashes.add((h1, h2))`\n\n      `# Case 2: Sequence is prev_seq + X`\n      If `start_idx > 0`:  # There is a 'prev_seq'\n        For `prev_h1, prev_h2` in `dp_hashes[start_idx]`:\n          `new_h1 = (prev_h1 * P1 + letter_val) % MOD_HASH_1`\n          `new_h2 = (prev_h2 * P2 + letter_val) % MOD_HASH_2`\n          `dp_hashes[L].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n          `total_distinct_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n\n  Print `len(total_distinct_hashes)`\n\nThis approach is `O(M * (4 * (1 + Sum(len(dp_hashes[L-k])))))`.\n`Sum(len(dp_hashes[L-k]))` can be `O(L)`.
