She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.**\n\nMy goal is to minimize the time to close tabs outside a specific range. I've dissected the problem into several scenarios: when the target range covers all or no tabs, and when tabs need to be closed on either side.\n\nI've determined the operations: moving the cursor and closing tabs, each taking one second.  Initially, the cursor is at a specified position, and tabs from index 1 to 'n' are open. I identified that the core of the problem is about efficiently positioning the cursor to close the tabs to the left and/or right of the target range.\n\nMy logic is built on different cases. If the range is the entire set, nothing needs to be closed (cost 0). If it's the right side, I go to 'r'. if it is the left side, i go to 'l'. Otherwise, If there's a range of tabs to close, I have two strategies:\n\n1.  Go to the left boundary 'l', close tabs, then go to the right boundary 'r', and close the rest.\n2.  Go to the right boundary 'r', close tabs, then go to the left boundary 'l', and close the rest.\n\nI figured out the cost for each strategy which involves finding the distance to one of the boundaries plus 2 seconds for closing the segments, and also finding the distance between 'l' and 'r' when we move between those two. It's really the sum of a distance, the operation and the distance between those two boundaries. The final answer is the smaller of the two costs.\n\nI've carefully checked all cases to ensure they work. The most general case is really a simple formula, but the trick is making sure the movement cost for positioning the cursor works correctly. I have considered a lot of test cases and examples. I am now confident that my approach is correct and that my code will provide the minimum time needed.\n",
