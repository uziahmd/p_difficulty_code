And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core problem is finding the average sleep time over all possible 'weeks', where a week is a set of `k` consecutive days within a record of `n` days. The input is a list of sleep times, `a1` to `an`.\n\nMy initial thought was to brute force it, generating every single week and summing the sleep times within each. But the constraints (specifically, `n` up to `2 * 10^5`) tell me that `O(n^2)` would be too slow. So, I need something more efficient.\n\nThe key is realizing the sliding window technique. We can calculate the first week's sum directly. Then, for each subsequent week, we don't have to recalculate everything. We just need to subtract the sleep time of the day that falls out of the window and add the sleep time of the new day that enters. This is an `O(1)` operation per week.\n\nThe formula I derived is: `S_{i+1} = S_i - a_i + a_{i+k}`, where `S_i` is the sum of the i-th week.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n1.  Read `n`, `k`, and the sleep times array `a`.\n2.  Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements (the first week). This is our initial `current_week_sum`.\n3.  Initialize the `total_sum_of_weeks` with the sum of the first week.\n4.  Iterate from the second week onwards (`i = 1` to `n - k`):\n    *   Update `current_week_sum`: subtract the element leaving the window and add the element entering the window.\n    *   Add this `current_week_sum` to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n5.  Calculate the number of weeks: `num_weeks = n - k + 1`.\n6.  Calculate the average: `average = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks`.\n7.  Print the average with sufficient precision (at least 6 digits after the decimal point, though 10 is safe).\n\nI have considered the edge cases: `n=1`, `k=1`, and `k=n`. The logic holds. The values are within constraints and will always result in a valid result. There won't be any integer overflows, and Python's `float` type should be sufficient for the required precision. This should give the optimal time complexity, O(n).\n",
