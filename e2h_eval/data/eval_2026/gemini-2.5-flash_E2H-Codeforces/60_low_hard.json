Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Dynamic Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The core is about counting letter sequences within a growing string `S` constructed from '0's and '1's.  Each new character addition triggers a count, modulo `10^9 + 7`, of all possible letter sequences representable as substrings of `S`.  It's like a running tally of decodings, and it smells like a dynamic programming problem.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the essentials.  English letters are encoded in Morse code, right? And we're dealing with a specific set of valid codes: strings of '0's and '1's, 1 to 4 characters long. A little bit of combinatorics shows us that out of the potential `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` combinations, exactly 4 are invalid. That leaves us with 26 valid Morse code representations - a perfect 1:1 match with the English alphabet.  \n\nThe string `S` is built character by character. We're interested in the count of distinct letter sequences that can be formed from substrings of `S` after *each* append operation. Let's call the set of valid Morse codes `VALID_CODES`. A valid sequence means we can divide a substring of `S` into individual Morse code elements, each corresponding to an English letter.\n\nThis screams dynamic programming!  Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the prefix of `S` from index 0 up to index `i`.  This is a typical approach for counting decodings. The base case, `dp[0]`, represents an empty string - which is decodable in exactly one way (an empty sequence). \n\nNow, for each index `i`, we iterate through the valid Morse codes in `VALID_CODES`. If a code perfectly matches the substring of `S` ending at index `i`, we can consider that code as the last part of a valid sequence. So, we sum the counts from the previous positions. More precisely, `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - len(code)]` for all `code` in `VALID_CODES` if the corresponding substring matches that specific code. This handles the overlapping substrings properly.\n\nThis way, after each append to `S`, I just need to update `dp` to reflect the new state of the string and report the value modulo `10^9 + 7`.  It's a clean, standard DP approach, and it seems like it will do the trick. Now to code it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding any substring of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0's and '1's one by one. After each append, we report the count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nA key aspect is that each valid Morse code string (length 1-4, not one of the 4 forbidden strings) corresponds to a *distinct* English letter. This simplifies the problem: if a substring `X` decodes to `L1 L2`, and another substring `Y` decodes to `L1 L2`, they represent the same sequence of letters. We need to count distinct sequences, not distinct ways to form them or distinct substrings that form them.\n\nLet `VALID_CODES` be the set of 26 valid Morse code strings. The forbidden strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c` (length `k+1`).\nWe need to consider all substrings `S[i:j]` (where `0 <= i < j <= k+1`). For each such substring, we want to find all possible sequences of letters it can represent.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming on the current string `S`.\nLet `S` have length `N`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding any suffix of `S[0...i-1]` (i.e., `S[j...i-1]` for `0 <= j < i`).\nThis definition is tricky because we need *all* substrings, not just suffixes.\n\nA more effective approach is to consider the contribution of the newly appended character. When `S_new = S_old + c` is formed, new substrings are created that end at the new character `c`. These are `S_new[0...N]`, `S_new[1...N]`, ..., `S_new[N...N]`.\nFor each `j` from `0` to `N`, `S_new[j...N]` is a new suffix to consider.\n\nLet `count[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding *suffixes* of `S[0...i-1]`. Specifically, `count[i]` is the number of distinct sequences `L_1...L_p` such that `S[j...i-1]` decodes to `L_1...L_p` for some `j <= i-1`.\n\nWhen `S` grows from length `k` to `k+1` by appending character `c`, let the new string be `S'`.\nWe need to calculate `count[k+1]`.\n`count[k+1]` will include sequences formed by:\n1. Decoding `S'[k...k]` (the single new character `c`). If `c` is a valid code (length 1), it forms a sequence of 1 letter.\n2. Decoding `S'[k-1...k]` (the last two characters). If `S'[k-1...k]` is a valid code (length 2), it forms a sequence of 1 letter.\n3. ...\n4. Decoding `S'[k-3...k]`. If `S'[k-3...k]` is a valid code (length 4), it forms a sequence of 1 letter.\n\nThese are single letters. For each `len` from 1 to 4, if `S'[k-len+1...k]` is a valid code `C`, then `C` represents a letter. This letter forms a sequence of length 1.\n\nBeyond single letters, we can form longer sequences:\nA sequence `L_1...L_p` ending at index `k` (`S'[j...k] = C_1...C_p`) can be formed by taking a sequence `L_1...L_{p-1}` ending at some index `k'` (`S'[j...k'] = C_1...C_{p-1}`) and appending a letter `L_p` represented by `S'[k'+1...k] = C_p`.\nThis looks like `count[k+1] = sum(count[k+1-len] for len in [1,2,3,4] if S'[k+1-len...k]` is valid)`.\nThis is a standard DP for counting decodings of a *prefix*.\nLet `dp_prefix[i]` be the number of ways to decode `S[0...i-1]` into a sequence of letters.\n`dp_prefix[0] = 1` (empty sequence).\n`dp_prefix[i] = sum(dp_prefix[i-len] for len in [1,2,3,4] if S[i-len...i-1]` is valid code).\nThis `dp_prefix` counts sequences for a fixed prefix `S[0...i-1]`.\n\nThe problem asks for *all* non-empty sequences from *any* substring.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding substrings ending at index `i-1`. That is, `S[j...i-1]` for `0 <= j < i`.\nWhen we append a character to `S` to get `S_new` of length `N+1`:\nWe need to calculate `dp[N+1]`.\n`dp[N+1]` will be the sum of:\n1. All sequences of length 1 formed by `S_new[N...N]`, `S_new[N-1...N]`, `S_new[N-2...N]`, `S_new[N-3...N]`.\n2. All sequences of length > 1 formed by appending a letter to sequences ending at `N-1`, `N-2`, `N-3`, `N-4`.\n\nLet `current_sequences` be a set of all distinct sequences found so far.\nWhen `S` grows to `S_N`, we iterate `j` from `0` to `N-1`.\nFor each `j`, consider the suffix `S_N[j...N-1]`.\nLet `dp_suffix[k]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using the suffix `S_N[k...N-1]`.\nThis is still not quite right as we need *all* substrings.\n\nLet's maintain `total_sequences_count` as the running total.\nWhen `S` grows to `S_N` (length `N`), we need to add sequences formed by substrings ending at `N-1`.\nThese substrings are `S_N[j...N-1]` for `j` from `0` to `N-1`.\nFor each `j`, `S_N[j...N-1]` can be decoded.\nLet `f[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i...N-1]`.\nThis is not good as `N` changes.\n\nLet's use the standard DP definition:\n`dp[i]` = number of distinct sequences formed by `S[0...i-1]` (the prefix of length `i`).\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty sequence).\nFor `i > 0`, `dp[i]` is the number of distinct sequences `L_1...L_k` such that `S[0...i-1] = C_1...C_k` and `C_j` is the Morse code for `L_j`.\nTo calculate `dp[i]`:\n`dp[i] = 0`\nFor `len` from `1` to `4`:\n  If `i - len >= 0` and `S[i-len...i-1]` is a valid code:\n    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-len]) % MOD`\n\nThis `dp[i]` counts sequences for *one specific prefix*. The problem asks for *all* substrings.\nThe total number of sequences would be `sum(dp[i] for i in 1...N)`.\nHowever, this `sum` would overcount because `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` might count the same sequence if `S[0...i-1]` and `S[0...j-1]` can both decode to it. But this is not possible by definition of `dp[i]` (decoding *the* prefix `S[0...i-1]`).\nThe problem is that `S[0...i-1]` and `S[k...j-1]` are different substrings.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we are adding *new* substrings ending at the current position `N-1`.\nFor each `k` from `0` to `N-1`, the substring `S[k...N-1]` is a new substring that could potentially form new sequences.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding the suffix `S[i...N-1]`.\nThis `dp[i]` itself is not enough.\n\nLet `total_count` be the total number of distinct sequences found so far.\nWhen a new character is appended, say `S` becomes `S_new` of length `N`.\nWe need to count all *new* sequences that can be formed using substrings that end at index `N-1`.\nA substring ending at `N-1` is `S_new[j...N-1]` for some `0 <= j <= N-1`.\nLet `current_suffix_dp[k]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S_new[k...N-1]`.\n`current_suffix_dp[N] = 1` (representing the empty sequence for an empty suffix `S_new[N...N-1]`).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_suffix_dp[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N` and `S_new[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code:\n      `current_suffix_dp[k] = (current_suffix_dp[k] + current_suffix_dp[k+len]) % MOD`\nThe values `current_suffix_dp[k]` (for `k < N`) count distinct sequences formed by `S_new[k...N-1]`.\nThe total number of *new* sequences ending at `N-1` is `sum(current_suffix_dp[k] for k in 0...N-1)`.\nHowever, this sum includes sequences that might have been formed by substrings ending at `N-2`, `N-3`, etc.\nFor example, if `S_new = \"111\"`, `N=3`.\n`S_new[0...2] = \"111\"` could be \"O\".\n`S_new[1...2] = \"11\"` could be \"M\".\n`S_new[2...2] = \"1\"` could be \"T\".\nThe sequences are \"O\", \"M\", \"T\".\nAlso, \"111\" could be \"TM\" (\"1\" + \"11\").\nAnd \"111\" could be \"MT\" (\"11\" + \"1\").\nAnd \"111\" could be \"TTT\" (\"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\").\n\nThis suggests using a set to keep track of *all* distinct sequences found. But `m` is up to 3000, and sequences can be long, so a set won't work due to memory and time. We need a DP approach.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding *any* substring of `S[0...i-1]`.\nThis `dp[i]` is what we want to output.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_old` (length `i-1`) to `S_new` (length `i`) by appending `c`:\n`dp[i] = dp[i-1]` (all sequences from `S_old`)\n`+` (new sequences formed by substrings ending at `i-1`).\n\nLet `new_seqs_ending_at_i_minus_1` be the set of distinct sequences formed by `S_new[j...i-1]` for `0 <= j < i`.\nThe number of such sequences is `|new_seqs_ending_at_i_minus_1|`.\nWe need to add `|new_seqs_ending_at_i_minus_1|` to `total_count`.\nBut some sequences in `new_seqs_ending_at_i_minus_1` might have already been found in `S_old`.\nE.g., if `S_old = \"11\"` and `S_new = \"111\"`.\n`S_old` produces \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\n`new_seqs_ending_at_2` (for `S_new[...2] = \"111\"`) are \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThe total for \"111\" is \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". (7 sequences).\n`dp[2]` for \"11\" is 3.\n`new_seqs_ending_at_2` for \"111\" are \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". (4 sequences).\nThe sum `3 + 4 = 7`. This looks like it works.\nThis implies that sequences formed by substrings ending at `i-1` are always distinct from sequences formed by substrings ending at `k < i-1`.\nThis is true! A sequence `L_1...L_p` is uniquely identified by its last letter and the suffix of the original string it was formed from.\nIf `S[j...i-1]` decodes to `L_1...L_p`, and `S[k...l-1]` decodes to `L'_1...L'_q`. If `i-1 != l-1`, they are distinct in terms of their \"ending position\".\nThe problem asks for \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". This means the *content* of the sequence matters, not where it came from. \"T\" from \"1\" at `S[0]` and \"T\" from \"1\" at `S[1]` are the same sequence \"T\".\n\nThis means we need to count the size of `Union_{0 <= j < i} {sequences from S[j...i-1]}`.\nThis is difficult.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThis means we need a global set of all distinct sequences.\nExample: S=\"111\".\nSubstrings: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\"1\" -> 'T'\n\"11\" -> 'M', 'TT'\n\"111\" -> 'O', 'TM', 'MT', 'TTT'\nTotal distinct sequences: {'T', 'M', 'TT', 'O', 'TM', 'MT', 'TTT'}. Count = 7.\nThis is exactly `dp[2]` for \"11\" (3) + `count_new_sequences_ending_at_index_2` for \"111\" (4).\n\nSo the strategy is:\nLet `total_answer` be the running total of distinct sequences.\nWhen `S` grows to `S_new` (length `N`):\nWe need to compute the number of *new* distinct sequences formed by substrings `S_new[j...N-1]` for `0 <= j < N`.\nLet `dp_at_end[k]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding the substring `S_new[k...N-1]`.\n`dp_at_end[N] = 1` (represents the empty sequence, needed for DP base case).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_at_end[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N` and `S_new[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code `C`:\n      `dp_at_end[k] = (dp_at_end[k] + dp_at_end[k+len]) % MOD`\nThe sum `sum(dp_at_end[k] for k in 0...N-1)` gives the total number of ways to decode *suffixes* of `S_new` into sequences.\nHowever, this sum counts `L_1...L_p` and `L_1...L_p` as distinct if they come from different suffixes.\nE.g., for `S_new = \"111\"`, `N=3`.\n`dp_at_end[2]` for `S_new[2...2] = \"1\"`: `dp_at_end[2] = dp_at_end[3] = 1`.

Add `dp_at_end[3] = 1`.\n  `dp_at_end[1] = 2`. (Sequences \"T\", \"M\").\n`dp_at_end[0]` for `S_new[0...2] = \"111\"`:\n  `S_new[0...0] = \"1\"` is valid.

(Sequences \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"O\").\n\nThe set of sequences formed by substrings ending at `N-1` is:\n`{Sequence(S_new[j...N-1]) | 0 <= j < N}`.\nLet `dp_suffix[k]` be the number of distinct sequences formed by `S_new[k...N-1]`.\nThis is exactly what `dp_at_end[k]` calculates IF `dp_at_end[N]` is defined as 0.\nLet `dp_at_end[k]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences that can be formed by decoding `S_new[k...N-1]`.\n`dp_at_end[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `distinct_sequences_from_here = set()`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N` and `S_new[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code `C`:\n      `letter = get_letter(C)`\n      `distinct_sequences_from_here.add(letter)`\n      If `k+len < N`:\n        For each `seq` in `sequences_from_S_new[k+len...N-1]`:\n          `distinct_sequences_from_here.add(letter + seq)`\n  `sequences_from_S_new[k...N-1] = distinct_sequences_from_here`\n  `dp_at_end[k] = len(distinct_sequences_from_here)`\n\nThis is too slow because `sequences_from_S_new` stores actual sequences (strings).\nThe key insight from the example `S=\"111\"`:\n`dp[2]` (for \"11\") = 3.\n`new_sequences_ending_at_2` (for \"111\"):\n  `S[2...2] = \"1\"` -> \"T\"\n  `S[1...2] = \"11\"` -> \"M\", \"TT\" (from \"1\"+\"1\")\n  `S[0...2] = \"111\"` -> \"O\", \"TM\" (from \"1\"+\"11\"), \"MT\" (from \"11\"+\"1\"), \"TTT\" (from \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\")\nThe sequences formed by `S[j...N-1]` are:\n  `S[N-1...N-1]` forms `L_1`\n  `S[N-2...N-1]` forms `L_1`, `L_2`, `L_1 L_2'`\n  `S[N-3...N-1]` forms `L_1`, `L_2`, `L_3`, `L_1 L_2'`, `L_1 L_3'`, `L_2 L_3''`, `L_1 L_2' L_3''`\nThis is difficult because of the distinctness.\n\nConsider the problem constraints: `m <= 3000`. `O(M^2)` might be acceptable if inner operations are fast. `O(M^3)` is too slow.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding any substring of `S[0...i-1]`.\nThis is the value we want to report after `i` appends.\n`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (number of distinct sequences that end at index i-1 and were not counted in dp[i-1])`.\nThe \"not counted in dp[i-1]\" part is the problem.\nA sequence `L_1...L_k` is counted in `dp[i-1]` if it can be formed by `S[a...b]` where `b < i-1`.\nA sequence `L_1...L_k` is counted as \"new\" if it can be formed by `S[a...i-1]` but not by `S[a'...b']` where `b' < i-1`.\nThis is equivalent to saying that `L_1...L_k` can *only* be formed by substrings ending at `i-1`.\nThis implies that `L_k` must be represented by `S[p...i-1]` for some `p`, and `S[p...i-1]` must be the *first* occurrence of this Morse code string. This is not true.\n\nThe problem is simpler than I'm making it. The example output is `1, 3, 7`.\nFor `S = \"1\"`: \"T\". Count = 1.\nFor `S = \"11\"`: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". Count = 3. `3 = 1 + 2`.

(4 new sequences: \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\").\n\nIt seems that the number of distinct sequences ending at the current position `i-1` are simply added to the total.\nLet `dp_ends_at[k]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding `S[k...N-1]` (the suffix starting at `k` and ending at `N-1`).\nLet `S_N` be the string of length `N`.\n`dp_ends_at[N] = 0` (no sequences from empty string).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_ends_at[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N` and `S_N[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code `C`:\n      `dp_ends_at[k] = (dp_ends_at[k] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter `C`)\n      `dp_ends_at[k] = (dp_ends_at[k] + dp_ends_at[k+len]) % MOD` (for `C` followed by sequences from `S_N[k+len...N-1]`)\nThe `+1` is for the single letter itself.\nThis DP counts *distinct sequences*. How?\nConsider `dp_ends_at[k]`. It's `1` (for `C`) plus `dp_ends_at[k+len]` (for `C` followed by sequences from `S_N[k+len...N-1]`).\nThis sum automatically handles distinctness if we assume all letters are distinct and all sequences starting with different letters are distinct.\nThe problem states \"each string of '0' and/or '1' of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\". This is crucial.\nSo if `C_1` and `C_2` are different valid codes, they map to different letters `L_1` and `L_2`.\nA sequence `L_1 X` is distinct from `L_2 Y`.\nA sequence `L X` is distinct from `L Y` if `X` is distinct from `Y`.\nA sequence `L` is distinct from `L X`.\n\nSo, the `dp_ends_at` formulation can work if we are careful.\nLet `dp_suffix[k]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[k...N-1]`.\n`dp_suffix[N] = 0` (empty suffix produces no non-empty sequences).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffix[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N` and `S[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code:\n      `dp_suffix[k] = (dp_suffix[k] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter represented by `S[k...k+len-1]`)\n      `dp_suffix[k] = (dp_suffix[k] + dp_suffix[k+len]) % MOD` (for the sequences `L + X` where `L` is `S[k...k+len-1]` and `X` is a sequence from `S[k+len...N-1]`)\n\nThis `dp_suffix[k]` calculates the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding the *specific* suffix `S[k...N-1]`.\nFor example, `S=\"111\"`, `N=3`.\n`dp_suffix[3] = 0`.\n`k=2` (`S[2...2]`=\"1\"):\n  `len=1`: \"1\" is valid. `dp_suffix[2] = (0 + 1 + dp_suffix[3]) % MOD = (1 + 0) = 1`. (Sequence \"T\").\n`k=1` (`S[1...2]`=\"11\"):\n  `len=1`: \"1\" is valid. `dp_suffix[1] = (0 + 1 + dp_suffix[2]) % MOD = (1 + 1) = 2`. (Sequences \"T\", \"TT\").\n  `len=2`: \"11\" is valid. `dp_suffix[1] = (2 + 1 + dp_suffix[3]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) = 3`. (Sequences \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\").\n`k=0` (`S[0...2]`=\"111\"):\n  `len=1`: \"1\" is valid. `dp_suffix[0] = (0 + 1 + dp_suffix[1]) % MOD = (1 + 3) = 4`. (Sequences \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\").\n  `len=2`: \"11\" is valid. `dp_suffix[0] = (4 + 1 + dp_suffix[2]) % MOD = (4 + 1 + 1) = 6`. (Sequences \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"MT\").\n  `len=3`: \"111\" is valid. `dp_suffix[0] = (6 + 1 + dp_suffix[3]) % MOD = (6 + 1 + 0) = 7`. (Sequences \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"MT\", \"O\").\n\nThe value `dp_suffix[0]` for `S_N` is exactly the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S_N` itself.\nThe problem wants the total number of distinct sequences from *any* substring.\nLet `total_count` be the answer.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_old` (length `N-1`) to `S_new` (length `N`).\nThe new sequences are those formed by substrings ending at `N-1`.\nThese are `S_new[0...N-1]`, `S_new[1...N-1]`, ..., `S_new[N-1...N-1]`.\nLet `current_ans` be the total number of distinct sequences formed by `S_old`.\nWe need to add the number of distinct sequences formed by `S_new[j...N-1]` for `0 <= j < N`.\nThe sum `sum(dp_suffix[j] for j in 0...N-1)` would overcount.\nExample `S=\"111\"`\n`N=1`, `S=\"1\"`. `dp_suffix[0]` for \"1\" is 1. `total_count = 1`.\n`N=2`, `S=\"11\"`. `dp_suffix[0]` for \"11\" is 3. `dp_suffix[1]` for \"1\" is 1.\n  New substrings ending at index 1: `S[0...1]=\"11\"`, `S[1...1]=\"1\"`.\n  Sequences from `S[0...1]` are \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\".\n  Sequences from `S[1...1]` are \"T\".\n  The set of all distinct sequences formed by substrings ending at index 1 is {\"T\", \"TT\", \"M\"}. Count is 3.\n  `total_count` for \"11\" is `dp_suffix[0]` for \"11\" = 3.\n  This means `total_count` is just `dp_suffix[0]` for the current full string `S`. This is not correct for the problem statement.\n  The example output for \"11\" is 3. It's the `dp_suffix[0]` value for \"11\".\n  The example output for \"111\" is 7. It's the `dp_suffix[0]` value for \"111\".\n  This interpretation is too simple and doesn't match \"any substring\".\n  \"T\" from `S[0]` in \"111\" is `S[0...0]`.\n  \"T\" from `S[1]` in \"111\" is `S[1...1]`.\n  \"T\" from `S[2]` in \"111\" is `S[2...2]`.\n  All these are the same sequence \"T\".\n\nThe problem is asking for `| Union_{0 <= a <= b < N} {sequences from S[a...b]} |`.\nThis is exactly what `dp_suffix` computes if we sum it up.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, `N=3`.\n`dp_suffix[0]` (for \"111\") = 7.\n`dp_suffix[1]` (for \"11\") = 3.\n`dp_suffix[2]` (for \"1\") = 1.\nThe total distinct sequences from \"111\" is 7.\nThe total distinct sequences from \"11\" is 3.\nThe total distinct sequences from \"1\" is 1.\n\nThe example output:\nS=\"1\" -> 1\nS=\"11\" -> 3\nS=\"111\" -> 7\nThis is `dp_suffix[0]` for the current `S`.\nThis means the problem is simpler and asks for the number of distinct sequences formed by decoding the *entire string* `S`.\nLet's check the wording again: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThe example explanation:\nFor S=\"111\":\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal 7.\nNotice that \"T\" is represented by \"1\" (from `S[0...0]`, `S[1...1]`, `S[2...2]`).\n\"M\" is represented by \"11\" (from `S[0...1]`, `S[1...2]`).\n\"O\" is represented by \"111\" (from `S[0...2]`).\n\"TT\" is represented by \"11\" (from `S[0...1]`, `S[1...2]`).\n\"TM\" is represented by \"111\" (from `S[0...2]`).\n\"MT\" is represented by \"111\" (from `S[0...2]`).\n\"TTT\" is represented by \"111\" (from `S[0...2]`).\n\nThe example is consistent with `dp_suffix[0]` of the *current full string S*.\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. We just need to calculate `dp_suffix[0]` after each append.\n\nLet `S` be the current string. Let `N` be its length.\n`dp[i]` = number of distinct non-empty sequences formed by decoding `S[i...N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = 0`.\nWhen `S` grows to `S_new` (length `N+1`) by appending `c`:\nThe new `dp` array will be `dp_new`.\n`dp_new[N+1] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n  `dp_new[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + len <= N+1` and `S_new[k...k+len-1]` is a valid code `C`:\n      `dp_new[k] = (dp_new[k] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter `C`)\n      `dp_new[k] = (dp_new[k] + dp_new[k+len]) % MOD` (for `C` followed by sequences from `S_new[k+len...N]`)\nThe answer after appending `c` is `dp_new[0]`.\n\nThis means for each of `m` appends, we recompute the entire `dp` array of length `N+1`.\nThe length `N` goes up to `m`.\nRecomputing `dp` takes `O(N * 4)` time. Total time `O(M^2)`.\n`M = 3000`. `M^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This should be acceptable.\n\nLet's define the set of valid codes.\n`FORBIDDEN = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\nA string `s` is a valid code if `1 <= len(s) <= 4` and `s not in FORBIDDEN`.\n\nImplementation details:\n-   Maintain `S` as a list of characters for efficient appending and slicing.\n-   `dp` array of size `N+1`.\n-   Modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nLet's trace `S = \"1\", \"11\", \"111\"` with this `dp` definition.\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`current_S = []`\n\n1.
