Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.\n\n## Output\nIf there is no such array b, print -1.Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn. Note that b must be a permutation of a.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1 2', '4\\n1000 100 10 1']\n\n### Output\n['2 1', '100 1 1000 10']\n\n## Note\nAn array x is a permutation of y, if we can shuffle elements of y such that it will coincide with x.Note that the empty subset and the subset containing all indices are not counted.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Gluttony\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Gluttony\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it.  It's a permutation problem with some pretty specific constraints.  The core idea is to take an array `a` of distinct integers and create a new array `b`, also a permutation of `a`, such that the sums of all non-empty, proper subsets of `a` are different from the corresponding sums in `b`.\n\nThe problem statement gives me some useful constraints: `n` is limited to 22, and the elements of `a` are within a reasonable range (0 to 10^9), meaning I won't have to worry too much about integer overflow.  If no valid permutation `b` exists, I need to output -1.  Otherwise, I need to print the elements of `b`.\n\nMy first step is to clarify the condition a bit. The crucial part is that the sum of elements in any proper, non-empty subset of `a` cannot equal the sum of the elements in the corresponding subset of `b`. I've started by defining these subset sums with the `a_sum(S)` and `b_sum(S)` notation; this helps keep things clear.\n\nI've already started to reason through the base cases. If `n=1`, there are no subsets that need to be considered, so any permutation (which is just the original array `a`) would work. Then, I considered the case when `n=2`.  I realized that the only possible permutation that would satisfy the condition is reversing the array `a`. For example if a = [1,2], then b = [2,1] and the condition holds because the sums of the subsets of size one are different.\n\nNext, I need to extend this reasoning to higher values of `n`. For `n=3`, the subsets become more complex. I already see that the individual elements need to be swapped, but I'm going to need to look more carefully at the size-2 subsets to figure out a general solution. This is definitely going to involve some careful analysis of subset sums and how they change with different permutations.  It looks like a backtracking or a combinatorial approach might be necessary to systematically search for a valid `b`, or to prove that one doesn't exist.\n",
