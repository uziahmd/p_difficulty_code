The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this competitive programming challenge. The goal is to maximize the number of chests we can open. We have `n` chests, each with a number `a_i`, and `m` keys, each with a number `b_j`. A key opens a chest if `a_i + b_j` is odd. This means the numbers must have opposite parities—one even, one odd. Let's break this down further: an even chest needs an odd key, and an odd chest needs an even key.\n\nWe need to consider each chest and key only once. So, it's a matching problem, where we need to pair chests and keys. Let's count the even and odd chests, and the even and odd keys. This is crucial for determining the best pairings.\n\nLet's use `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd` for these counts.  For each even chest, we are looking for an odd key, and for each odd chest, we are looking for an even key. The maximum number of even chests we can open is limited by `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`. Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests we can open is limited by `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. Since opening an even chest and an odd chest requires different types of resources, we can simply add them. The total number of chests opened is then: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nLet's test this! We have some example inputs.\nFirst test case:\n*  `n=5, m=4`\n*  `a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]` --> `chests_even = 3, chests_odd = 2`\n*  `b = [8, 4, 7, 20]` --> `keys_even = 3, keys_odd = 1`\n\nApplying the formula:\n*   `min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3` which is the expected answer.\nThe logic holds up.\n\nLet's try other examples to be certain.\n\nSecond example. All even chests:\n*   `a = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` --> `chests_even = 5, chests_odd = 0`\n*   `b = [5]` --> `keys_even = 0, keys_odd = 1`\n*   `min(5, 1) + min(0, 0) = 1`. This is also correct.\n\nThird example. Only one even:\n*   `a = [10]` --> `chests_even = 1, chests_odd = 0`\n*   `b = [20, 30, 40, 50]` --> `keys_even = 4, keys_odd = 0`\n*   `min(1, 0) + min(0, 4) = 0`. Correct!\n\nThis looks like a simple counting problem.\nConstraints:  `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`. The numbers can be large, but we only care about their parity (odd/even).  The modulus operator (`% 2`) efficiently checks parity. The time complexity of this will be O(n + m), which is perfect.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1. Read `n`, `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, `keys_odd` to 0.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers and update the counts based on parity using `% 2`.\n4. Read the `m` key numbers and do the same.\n5. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n6. Print the result.\n\nImplementing this in Python seems straightforward. For large inputs, reading input with `sys.stdin.readline()` is generally preferred for efficiency.\n\nThe problem requires a single loop through the chest and keys - and involves just counting, checking parity (which is a O(1) operation), and taking the minimum of two integers (O(1)). So the solution has a time complexity of O(n + m) and O(1) space if the inputs are read one by one or O(n + m) if we stored the inputs in lists.\nThis should be fast enough.\n\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe core condition is `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}`. This means that the sum of the chest number and the key number must be odd.\nFor a sum of two integers to be odd, one integer must be even and the other must be odd.\nThere are two scenarios for a valid pairing:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys by their parity:\n- Count of even-numbered chests: `chests_even`\n- Count of odd-numbered chests: `chests_odd`\n- Count of even-numbered keys: `keys_even`\n- Count of odd-numbered keys: `keys_odd`\n\nNow, we can consider the two types of pairings independently:\n\n**Scenario 1: Opening even-numbered chests**\nTo open an even-numbered chest, we need an odd-numbered key.\nThe number of even chests available is `chests_even`.\nThe number of odd keys available is `keys_odd`.\nThe maximum number of even chests we can open using odd keys is limited by whichever count is smaller. So, we can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` chests of this type.\n\n**Scenario 2: Opening odd-numbered chests**\nTo open an odd-numbered chest, we need an even-numbered key.\nThe number of odd chests available is `chests_odd`.\nThe number of even keys available is `keys_even`.\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd chests we can open using even keys is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two scenarios use distinct types of chests (even vs. odd) and distinct types of keys (odd vs. even), the resources used for one scenario do not affect the resources for the other. Therefore, these two counts are independent and can simply be summed to find the total maximum number of chests opened.\n\n**Total maximum chests opened = `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` + `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`**\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers. For each `a_i`, check its parity:\n   - If `a_i` is even (`a_i % 2 == 0`), increment `chests_even`.\n   - If `a_i` is odd (`a_i % 2 == 1`), increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers. For each `b_j`, check its parity:\n   - If `b_j` is even (`b_j % 2 == 0`), increment `keys_even`.\n   - If `b_j` is odd (`b_j % 2 == 1`), increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`chests: 9 14 6 2 11`\n`keys: 8 4 7 20`\n\n1. **Count chest parities:**\n   - `9` (odd)\n   - `14` (even)\n   - `6` (even)\n   - `2` (even)\n   - `11` (odd)\n   `chests_even = 3`\n   `chests_odd = 2`\n\n2. **Count key parities:**\n   - `8` (even)\n   - `4` (even)\n   - `7` (odd)\n   - `20` (even)\n   `keys_even = 3`\n   `keys_odd = 1`\n\n3. **Calculate pairings:**\n   - Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   - Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4. **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N + M) because we iterate through the chest numbers once and the key numbers once. The space complexity is O(N + M) for storing inputs (or O(1) if processed on the fly without storing full lists), which is efficient enough for the given constraints (`N, M <= 10^5`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line of input\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the n chest numbers from the second line\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read the m key numbers from the third line\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd chest numbers\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through chest numbers to count their parities\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:           # If the number is odd\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd key numbers\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through key numbers to count their parities\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:           # If the number is odd\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # To open an even chest (a_i is even), we need an odd key (b_j is odd).\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available even chests and odd keys.\n    opened_even_chests_with_odd_keys = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # To open an odd chest (a_i is odd), we need an even key (b_j is even).\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available odd chests and even keys.\n    opened_odd_chests_with_even_keys = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    # Since pairings of even chests with odd keys are independent of pairings of odd chests with even keys\n    # (they use different types of chests and keys), we can simply sum the maximums from both scenarios.\n    total_opened_chests = opened_even_chests_with_odd_keys + opened_odd_chests_with_even_keys\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(total_opened_chests)\n\n# This ensures the solve() function is called when the script is executed.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
