The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Chest-Key Matching Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to help Neko open as many treasure chests as possible. The core of this seems to be a matching problem.  I've got `n` chests and `m` keys, and each chest has a number `a_i` and each key has a number `b_j`. The trick is that a key only opens a chest if their sum is odd ( `a_i + b_j` is odd).  I need to maximize the number of chests opened.\n\nThe key insight, and where my expertise kicks in, is realizing this odd/even constraint means I can divide and conquer. The condition `a_i + b_j` being odd is the crux of the matter.  For this to happen, one number *must* be even, and the other *must* be odd. This immediately tells me I can decouple the problem into two independent subproblems: pairing odd chests with even keys, and pairing even chests with odd keys.\n\nSo, first I'll count. I'll get `chests_odd` and `chests_even`, and also `keys_odd` and `keys_even`. Then, to maximize matches for odd chests, I'm limited by either the number of odd chests or the number of even keys. It's the minimum of those two counts. Similarly, for the even chests, I'm limited by the number of even chests or the number of odd keys, and I take the minimum.\n\nFinally, I'll sum the results from both independent scenarios to find the total maximum number of chests I can open. It's elegant really, simple matching. The whole is sum of min(odd chests, even keys) + min(even chests, odd keys).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum `a_i + b_j` must be odd. This occurs if and only if one of `a_i` and `b_j` is odd, and the other is even.\nThere are two scenarios for a successful match:\n1. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n2. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n\nNotice that these two types of pairings are completely independent. An odd chest can only be opened by an even key, and an even chest can only be opened by an odd key. There's no overlap in the types of keys or chests required for these two categories. Therefore, we can maximize the matches for each category independently and sum the results.\n\nLet's count the number of odd and even chests, and odd and even keys:\n- `chests_odd`: Number of chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n- `chests_even`: Number of chests with an even number `a_i`.\n- `keys_odd`: Number of keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n- `keys_even`: Number of keys with an even number `b_j`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum matches for each scenario:\n1. For chests with odd numbers (`chests_odd`) and keys with even numbers (`keys_even`):\n   The maximum number of matches is limited by whichever count is smaller. So, we can open `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` chests of this type.\n\n2. For chests with even numbers (`chests_even`) and keys with odd numbers (`keys_odd`):\n   Similarly, the maximum number of matches is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two independent maximums:\n`max_opened_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_odd = 0`, `chests_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`, `keys_even = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n   - If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`.\n   - Else, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n   - If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`.\n   - Else, increment `keys_odd`.\n5. Calculate `result = min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n6. Print `result`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. Chests classification:\n   - Odd: 9, 11 (`chests_odd = 2`)\n   - Even: 14, 6, 2 (`chests_even = 3`)\n2. Keys classification:\n   - Odd: 7 (`keys_odd = 1`)\n   - Even: 8, 4, 20 (`keys_even = 3`)\n\n3. Calculate matches:\n   - `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n   - `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n\n4. Total: `2 + 1 = 3`\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest and key lists once to count parities, and then performs a few constant-time operations. The time complexity will be O(N + M), which is well within limits for N, M up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_odd = 0\n    chests_even = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_odd = 0\n    keys_even = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # Max matches for odd chests and even keys\n    matches1 = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    # Max matches for even chests and odd keys\n    matches2 = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    print(matches1 + matches2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
