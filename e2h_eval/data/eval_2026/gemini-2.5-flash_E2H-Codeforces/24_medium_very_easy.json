She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Minimum Tab Closing Time**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem in my sights. The goal is to figure out the least amount of time, in seconds, it takes to shut all the tabs on a browser *outside* a specified range, from `l` to `r`, where I start with `n` total tabs and a cursor currently at tab `pos`.\n\nHere's how this goes down: I can move the cursor left or right, each movement taking a second. And, I can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor – that's another second.  `a` and `b` define the current boundaries for active tabs. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is `n`.  My main task is to end up with only the tabs `l` through `r` open. So, I have to close all tabs from 1 to `l-1` and from `r+1` to `n`.\n\nLet's break down the different scenarios:\n\n*   **Case 1: Everything is already good to go.** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, I don't need to close anything – the answer is 0.\n\n*   **Case 2:  Left side closure needed.** If `l` is greater than 1 but `r` is `n`, that means I have to close from 1 up to `l-1`. To do this, I need to get my cursor to position `l` and then I pay 1 second to close all the left-hand tabs. The cost of getting to `l` will be the absolute difference between my current `pos` and `l` (i.e. abs(`pos - l`)). Total cost here is then `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n*   **Case 3: Right side closure needed.** If `l` is 1 but `r` is less than `n`, I close from `r+1` up to `n`. I get the cursor over to tab `r` and pay 1 second to close the tabs. Similar to above, cost is `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n*   **Case 4:  Both sides need to be closed.**  When `l` is more than 1 and `r` is less than `n`, I have to shut tabs on *both* sides of the target range. This means there's a certain cost for getting from the current position to one of the range boundaries, then a second to do the close, and then a cost to get to the opposite boundary before closing. This will always require at least 2 seconds because I have to close both sides.\n\n   My optimal strategy must minimize the time of moving to and from range-boundaries while closing. It is most efficient to move to either `l` or `r`, close one side, travel to the other side to close the second segment. It turns out that this will result in the `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2` value. So I calculate the cost of moving to both sides, add 1 for the close operations, and then add `r-l` for moving between the tabs, and then 1 for the second closing operation. Then, I take the minimum.\n\nWhen I think about the movement operations and closing segments, it turns out that `a` and `b` are more about *shrinking* the tabs as operations happen. When I close tabs left of `i`, then `a` becomes `i` and `b` would still be `n`. When I close tabs right of `i`, then `b` becomes `i`, and `a` still remains. This also changes for the movement operation since I will not be able to traverse tabs that are already closed! However, the operations stay the same and the key is that `r-l` is the path distance between `l` and `r`, and it stays as such since all in-between tabs are opened, so `a` and `b` should not cause trouble here!\n\nI just need to implement this as an `if/elif/else` structure, and it will give me the optimal solution. The core idea is always the minimum of two strategies for when both sides need to be closed!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, cursor at `pos`.\n\nThe operations are:\n1. Move cursor left/right: 1 second per step.\n2. Close tabs to the left of the cursor (e.g., `[a, i-1]` if cursor is at `i`): 1 second.\n3. Close tabs to the right of the cursor (e.g., `[i+1, b]` if cursor is at `i`): 1 second.\n`a` and `b` are the minimum and maximum indices of unclosed tabs. Initially, `a=1` and `b=n`.\n\nWe need to achieve a state where only tabs `l` through `r` are open. This means we must close:\n- Tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`)\n- Tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`)\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l=1` and `r=n`. In this case, the desired range `[l, r]` already covers all tabs, so no operations are needed.\n*Cost: 0*\n\n**Scenario 2: Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l=1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at tab `r`.\n1. Move the cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n2. Close all tabs to the right of `r`. This takes 1 second.\n*Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`*\n\n**Scenario 3: Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r=n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at tab `l`.\n1. Move the cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n2. Close all tabs to the left of `l`. This takes 1 second.\n*Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`*\n\n**Scenario 4: Both tabs to the left of `l` and tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close both `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This will always require two \"close\" operations, costing 2 seconds. We also need to move the cursor to `l` (to close the left side) and to `r` (to close the right side).\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n*   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: 1 second. (After this, the leftmost unclosed tab is `l`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: 1 second. (After this, the rightmost unclosed tab is `r`).\n    *Total cost for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`*\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: 1 second. (After this, the rightmost unclosed tab is `r`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `(r - l)` seconds (since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: 1 second. (After this, the leftmost unclosed tab is `l`).\n    *Total cost for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`*\n\nThe minimum time for Scenario 4 is `min(Strategy A cost, Strategy B cost)`.\nThis can be simplified to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe `a` and `b` parameters for movement and closing operations (e.g., `max(i-1, a)`) do not complicate these optimal strategies because the chosen paths (`pos` to `l`, `l` to `r`, etc.) always stay within the currently valid range of tabs. The \"close\" operations correctly target the initial `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]` segments.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n\n1.  If `l == 1` and `r == n`: Print `0`.\n2.  Else if `l == 1`: Print `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n3.  Else if `r == n`: Print `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n4.  Else (`l > 1` and `r < n`): Print `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Scenario 1: No tabs need to be closed.\n    # This happens if the desired range [l, r] is already the full range [1, n].\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Scenario 2: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed.\n    # This happens if the desired range starts at 1 (l=1) but doesn't extend to n (r<n).\n    if l == 1:\n        # We need to close tabs [r+1, n].\n        # To do this, we must move the cursor to 'r' and then perform the close operation.\n        # Cost = (moves from pos to r) + (1 second for close operation)\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Scenario 3: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed.\n    # This happens if the desired range ends at n (r=n) but doesn't start at 1 (l>1).\n    if r == n:\n        # We need to close tabs [1, l-1].\n        # To do this, we must move the cursor to 'l' and then perform the close operation.\n        # Cost = (moves from pos to l) + (1 second for close operation)\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Scenario 4: Both tabs to the left of 'l' and tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed.\n    # This happens if l > 1 and r < n.\n    # We need to close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n    # This requires two close operations (2 seconds).\n    # We must visit both 'l' and 'r'.\n    # There are two main strategies:\n    # 1.
