For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Heart of the Problem: Finding Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out how many ways we can assign values to these constraints (`c_s`) to get a specific maximum size (`f`) for a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings.  The core of \"beautiful\" is this rule: the number of strings in the multiset that start with any given prefix (`s`) can't exceed the corresponding `c_s`.  It's like having a cap on how many strings can share the beginning of a code.\n\nMy first thought is to break this down. The prefixes are nicely structured as a binary tree, so each string of length `n` has its prefixes from length 1 to n forming a path in this tree, starting at the root (empty string). I'm focusing on the condition `count(s) <= c_s`. The `c_s` values are the key. We want to maximize the multiset size while respecting these constraints. This screams \"maximum flow\" or, perhaps more simply, a greedy approach – trying to fill each prefix with as many strings as the constraints allow.\n\nTo achieve maximum size, for a prefix `s` of length `L < n`, we want as many strings as possible starting with `s` (N(s)), which would mean N(s0) + N(s1). And for `N(s)` to be as large as possible, it must not exceed `c_s`. I'm starting to think about dynamic programming to build solutions level by level. Let's call `max_size(s)` the maximum count we can achieve for strings that have s as a prefix. It seems `max_size(s)` can be defined as `min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`, and for a length-n string, `max_size(s) = c_s`.\n\nThe problem is now to choose `c_s` such that `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"] = f`. It feels like DP is the way to go here. Let's define dp[L][val] as the number of ways to pick the c_s values for all strings that have s as a prefix, making `max_size(s)` equal to `val`. My base case is for level `n`, when `dp[n][val]` is simply 1 if `0 <= val <= k`, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThen I can work backwards. For a string of length L < n, this `max_size(s) = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`. I'm calculating all ways to pick values `c_s`, and all ways to make children `s0` and `s1`. I see that the number of ways to pick `c_s` isn't dependent on `s0` and `s1`. If the children's subtrees can achieve `v0` and `v1` counts, there are `dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]` ways. So now `min(c_s, s0 + s1)`. I have to sum over all the values of possible values of v0 and v1. And based on which of the three scenarios we're in, there's `ways_to_choose_cs` for `val` such that `min(c_s, s0+s1) = val`.\n\nAfter working through the logic on how to deal with all combinations of `v0` and `v1`, I can put the DP function together. My states are `dp[L][val]`.\n\nNow, I'm stuck with the nasty sum of `dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]`. If I brute force this directly, I'll be in trouble.  The key observation is that this is a convolution, which is calling for the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)! Now, I can use NTT for fast polynomial multiplication to speed up this convolution. With NTT, this reduces to `O(k log k)` time!\n\nBy computing `Q` which is the result of convolving P with itself,  I have the final formula `dp[L][val] = (Q[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffQ[val+1]) % MOD`.\n\nI have to pre-compute the suffix sums of Q. The final result will be at `dp[1][f]`.\nI've implemented the NTT code and put everything together. I have to be careful with the modular arithmetic (using the given MOD). Now I have the final solution. The runtime complexity is `",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integer values $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$, such that $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, and the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length $n$ is exactly $f$.\n\nLet $N(s)$ be the number of strings in a multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nA multiset is beautiful if $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$.\nWe want to maximize the total size of the multiset. The total size is $N(\\text{\"0\"}) + N(\\text{\"1\"})$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L < n$, we have $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ is simply the count of string $s$ in the multiset.\n\nLet $max\\_size(s)$ be the maximum possible count of strings in a beautiful multiset that have $s$ as a prefix, given the $c_x$ values for $s$ and all its descendants.\nIf $s$ has length $n$, then $max\\_size(s) = c_s$, because we can simply add $c_s$ copies of string $s$ to the multiset, and this is limited only by $c_s$.\nIf $s$ has length $L < n$, then $max\\_size(s)$ is determined by $c_s$ and the maximum counts from its children: $max\\_size(s) = \\min(c_s, max\\_size(s0) + max\\_size(s1))$.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $max\\_size(\\text{\"0\"}) + max\\_size(\\text{\"1\"})$.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming on the levels of the binary tree formed by prefixes.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_x$ values for all strings $x$ in the subtree rooted at a generic string of length $L$, such that $max\\_size(\\text{root of subtree}) = val$. Since all subtrees at the same level are symmetric, we only need one such $dp$ array per level.\n\nBase case: $L = n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $max\\_size(s) = c_s$. We are free to choose $c_s$ from $0$ to $k$.\nSo, for each $val$ from $0$ to $k$, there is $1$ way to set $c_s$ such that $max\\_size(s) = val$.\n$dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nRecursive step: For $L < n$.\nWe want to compute $dp[L][val]$ based on $dp[L+1]$.\nLet $P = dp[L+1]$. This $P$ is an array where $P[v]$ is the number of ways to achieve $max\\_size(\\text{child}) = v$.\nFor a string $s$ at level $L$, its children $s0$ and $s1$ are at level $L+1$.\nLet $v_0 = max\\_size(s0)$ and $v_1 = max\\_size(s1)$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $v_0$ for $s0$'s subtree is $P[v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $v_1$ for $s1$'s subtree is $P[v_1]$.\nThe combined ways for children subtrees to yield $v_0$ and $v_1$ is $P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1]$.\nThen, $max\\_size(s) = \\min(c_s, v_0 + v_1)$. We want this to be $val$.\n\nWe need to choose $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) such that $\\min(c_s, v_0 + v_1) = val$.\nLet $S = v_0 + v_1$.\n1. If $val < S$: We must choose $c_s = val$. There is $1$ way for this.\n2. If $val = S$: We must choose $c_s \\ge S$. There are $k - S + 1$ ways (if $S \\le k$, else $0$ ways).\n3. If $val > S$: This is impossible, as $\\min(c_s, S)$ cannot be greater than $S$. So $0$ ways.\n\nSo, $dp[L][val] = \\sum_{v_0, v_1} (P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1] \\cdot \\text{ways\\_to\\_choose\\_cs}(val, v_0+v_1, k))$.\nThe sum can be rewritten by grouping terms with the same $S = v_0 + v_1$:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} \\left( \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1] \\right) \\cdot \\text{ways\\_to\\_choose\\_cs}(val, S, k)$.\n\nThe inner sum $\\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1]$ is the $S$-th coefficient of the convolution of $P$ with itself, denoted $Q[S]$.\n$Q = P * P$. This can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\nThe maximum value for $v_0, v_1$ is $k$, so $S$ can go up to $2k$. $P$ has length $k+1$, $Q$ has length $2k+1$.\n\nAfter computing $Q$:\nFor $0 \\le val \\le k$:\n$dp[L][val] = (Q[val] \\cdot (k - val + 1)) \\pmod{MOD}$ (for the case $val = S$, assuming $val \\le k$)\n$dp[L][val] += \\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} Q[S] \\pmod{MOD}$ (for the case $val < S$, assuming $val \\le k$)\nThe sum $\\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} Q[S]$ can be computed efficiently using suffix sums of $Q$. Let $SuffQ[x] = \\sum_{i=x}^{2k} Q[i]$. Then the sum is $SuffQ[val+1]$.\nSo, $dp[L][val] = (Q[val] \\cdot (k - val + 1) + SuffQ[val+1]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n(Note: $SuffQ[2k+1]$ should be $0$.)\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize $dp[val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise. This is for level $n$.\n2. For $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Let $P$ be the current $dp$ array (from level $L+1$).\n   b. Compute $Q = P * P$ using NTT. $Q$ will be an array of size up to $2k+1$.\n   c. Compute suffix sums $SuffQ$ for $Q$.\n   d. Create a new $dp$ array ($new\\_dp$) for level $L$. For $val$ from $0$ to $k$:\n      $new\\_dp[val] = (Q[val] \\cdot (k - val + 1) + SuffQ[val+1]) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n      For $val > k$, $new\\_dp[val] = 0$.\n   e. Set $dp = new\\_dp$.\n3. After the loop, $dp$ contains the values for level $1$.\nThe final answer is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $max\\_size(\\text{\"0\"}) + max\\_size(\\text{\"1\"}) = f$.\nThis is $\\sum_{v_0+v_1=f} dp[v_0] \\cdot dp[v_1]$.\nThis is simply the $f$-th coefficient of $(dp * dp)$. Let $P_{final} = dp$. The answer is $(P_{final} * P_{final})[f]$.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The maximum value for $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n- The length of $P$ is $k+1$. The length of $Q$ is $2k+1$.\n- For NTT, we need to pad polynomials to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to their combined length. For $Q=P*P$, this is $2k+1$. Smallest power of 2 greater than $2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5) + 1 = 400001$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.\n- Each NTT operation takes $O(N \\log N)$ time, where $N = 2^{19}$.\n- There are $n-1$ iterations of the loop (from $L=n-1$ down to $1$).\n- Total time complexity: $O(n \\cdot N \\log N)$.\n- For $n=15$, $15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$. This is acceptable for typical time limits (1-2 seconds) in Python (especially with PyPy or if the constants are small enough).\n\n**Modular Arithmetic:**\n$MOD = 998244353$ is a prime number suitable for NTT, with primitive root $3$.\nAll calculations are done modulo $MOD$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to calculate (base^exp) % MOD\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to calculate modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\n# A: list of coefficients of a polynomial\n# inverse: boolean, True for inverse NTT, False for forward NTT\ndef ntt(A, inverse):\n    n = len(A)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]\n\n    # Cooley-Tukey algorithm\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        length = len_half * 2\n        # wlen is the principal root of unity for this length\n        wlen = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if inverse:\n            wlen = inv(wlen) # For inverse NTT, use inverse root of unity\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1 # Current root of unity\n            for j in range(0, len_half):\n                u = A[i + j]\n                v = (A[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                A[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                A[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_half = length # Move to the next block size\n    \n    # Scale by 1/n for inverse NTT\n    if inverse:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            A[i] = (A[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return A\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply(poly1, poly2):\n    len1 = len(poly1)\n    len2 = len(poly2)\n    \n    # The result polynomial will have degree (len1-1) + (len2-1), so length is len1 + len2 - 1\n    result_len = len1 + len2 - 1\n    \n    # Find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len for NTT\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros to length n\n    A = list(poly1) + [0] * (n - len1)\n    B = list(poly2) + [0] * (n - len2)\n    \n    # Perform forward NTT on both polynomials\n    A_ntt = ntt(A, False)\n    B_ntt = ntt(B, False)\n    \n    # Multiply point-wise in frequency domain\n    C_ntt = [(A_ntt[i] * B_ntt[i]) % MOD for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # Perform inverse NTT to get the result polynomial in coefficient form\n    C = ntt(C_ntt, True)\n    \n    # Return only the significant coefficients\n    return C[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[val] stores the number of ways to choose c_s values for a subtree\n    # such that the maximum possible size for the root of that subtree is `val`.\n    # This dp array represents the values for a generic node at the current level.\n    \n    # Base case: L = n (bottommost level of the prefix tree)\n    # For a string s of length n, max_size(s) = c_s.\n    # We choose c_s from 0 to k.
