And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a \"week\" is defined as a consecutive group of `k` days, from a sequence of sleep times over `n` days. The most straightforward approach is to calculate the sum of sleep times for each week and then average these sums. This means I'll need to identify all possible starting points for each week, calculate the sum for each window of `k` days, and finally divide the total sum of all week sums by the number of weeks.\n\nThe first week begins on day 1 (index 0). The second week starts on day 2 (index 1), and so on, until the last possible week that starts at day `n-k+1` (index `n-k`). This gives us a total of `n - k + 1` possible weeks to consider.\n\nTo avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, I can use a sliding window technique. Instead of calculating the sum of each window from scratch, I can reuse the previous sum and update it in constant time by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the element that is entering the window.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the sum of the first `k` elements (the first week). Then, I'll iterate through the remaining windows, updating the sum of the current window using the sliding window approach. Finally, I'll divide the sum of all window sums by the total number of windows, which is `n - k + 1`, to get the average.\n\nThe time complexity of this optimized approach will be linear, O(n), because I'm iterating through the sequence only once. This should be fast enough given the constraints on `n`. The memory complexity will be O(1).\n",
