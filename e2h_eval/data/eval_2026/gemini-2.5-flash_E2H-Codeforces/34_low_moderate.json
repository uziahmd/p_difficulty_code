And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to devise a Python script to compute the average sleep time, considering every possible \"week\" within a given dataset.  Let's define a \"week\" as a consecutive block of `k` days.  The data consists of `n` sleep records: `a1, a2, ... an`.\n\nFirst, I have to figure out how to generate these weeks.  A week starts at day 1 and goes to day `k`, then the next starts at day 2 to `k+1`, and so on.  The last week starts at `n-k+1` and ends at `n`. So, there are `n - k + 1` weeks in total.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of sleep times for each week. I'll call them `S1, S2, ..., Sn-k+1`.  `S1` is the sum of `a1` to `ak`, `S2` is the sum from `a2` to `ak+1`, and so on.\n\nThen, to find the average for each week, I'll simply divide each `Si` by `k`.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the *overall* average across all weeks.  That means I have to sum up the average of each individual week and divide by the number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`. This would be the most straightforward approach:  `((S1/k) + (S2/k) + ... + (Sn-k+1)/k) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nHowever, I see a more elegant simplification:  `(S1 + S2 + ... + Sn-k+1) / (k * (n - k + 1))`. This makes things much cleaner.  I will just compute the sum of all `Si` values and then divide by `k * (n - k + 1)`. Let's call this the `Total_Sum_Of_Weeks`. Then, `Overall_Average = Total_Sum_Of_Weeks / (k * (n - k + 1))`.\n\n**Efficiency is Key**\n\nI have to be careful about efficiency. `n` can be as large as 200,000, and the values `ai` can be up to 100,000. If I naively iterate through each week and sum `k` elements each time, I'm looking at an O((n-k+1)*k) complexity.  In the worst case, `k` could be around `n/2`, which would lead to an O(n^2) algorithm. This is definitely too slow for 200,000.  I need a way to sum the sleep times more efficiently. This is where I can implement dynamic programming (I believe it will be needed). I have to work through it carefully.\n",
