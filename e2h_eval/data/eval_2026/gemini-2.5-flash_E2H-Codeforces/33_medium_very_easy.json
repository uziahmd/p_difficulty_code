You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements.

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey: Replacing Digits**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem, and I'm ready to tackle it head-on. The core is maximizing a number 'a' by strategically swapping its digits with those from a sequence 's', using each digit in 's' at most once. The key insight? The most significant digits dictate the magnitude; bigger is always better from the left.\n\nThe game plan is crystal clear. I'll begin by sorting 's' in descending order. This makes picking the largest available digit a breeze – I'll always grab the biggest remaining number from 's'. Then, I'll traverse 'a' digit by digit, left to right. For each position in 'a', I'll compare its digit with the largest unused digit from 's'. If the 's' digit is *greater*, bingo! I replace the 'a' digit – maximizing that position. I'm keeping a mental note of used digits to prevent re-use. However, if the largest 's' digit is *less than or equal to* the current 'a' digit, no replacement. There's no benefit in making it smaller or the same, and I'm saving that 's' digit for a possibly more impactful swap later.\n\nThe details are pretty straightforward. I'll convert 'a' into a mutable list. Same with 's' after sorting. Then, I'll iterate through 'a', keeping track of my 's' pointer. At each position, I'll compare and conditionally replace. If I run out of 's' digits, I'm done. Otherwise, if the 's' digit is better, replace and advance. If it isn't better, leave it be and move on. Finally, join the list back into a string and print it.\n\nI've even worked through examples – just to make sure the logic is sound. It's all about that greedy approach: optimize at each step. This process should be time-efficient – O(m log m) for sorting 's' and O(n + m) for the rest. Plenty fast for inputs of 10^5. It's looking robust, no leading zeroes issues or anything like that. The code's ready to go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the value of a number `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit from `s` can be used at most once.\n\nTo maximize a number, we should prioritize making its most significant (leftmost) digits as large as possible. This is a standard greedy approach for number maximization.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1.  **Prepare `s`**: To easily pick the largest available digits from `s`, we should sort `s` in descending order. This way, we can iterate through the sorted `s` and always consider the largest unused digit.\n2.  **Iterate through `a`**: We iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right (from the most significant position to the least significant).\n3.  **Decision for each digit `a[i]`**: For each digit `a[i]` in `a`:\n    *   We compare `a[i]` with the current largest available digit from `s` (let's call it `s_max`).\n    *   If `s_max` is strictly greater than `a[i]`: It is beneficial to replace `a[i]` with `s_max` because it makes the number larger at this significant position. We perform the replacement and mark `s_max` as used.\n    *   If `s_max` is less than or equal to `a[i]`: Replacing `a[i]` with `s_max` would either make the number smaller or keep it the same at this position. Since we want to maximize, and we're processing from left to right, we should *not* replace `a[i]` in this case. We save `s_max` for a potential future position `j` where `a[j]` might be smaller and thus `s_max` could provide a strict improvement.\n4.  **Termination**: We continue this process until we have iterated through all digits of `a` or we have run out of digits in `s`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet `a = \"1024\"` and `s = \"010\"`.\n\n1.  Convert `a` to a mutable list: `a_list = ['1', '0', '2', '4']`.\n2.  Sort `s` in descending order: `s_sorted_list = ['1', '0', '0']`.\n3.  Initialize a pointer `s_ptr = 0` to track the current largest digit in `s_sorted_list`.\n\n*   **`i = 0` (digit '1' in `a_list`):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 0`, `s_sorted_list[0] = '1'`.\n    *   `int('1') > int('1')` is `False`. So, no replacement.\n    *   `a_list` remains `['1', '0', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `0`.\n\n*   **`i = 1` (digit '0' in `a_list`):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 0`, `s_sorted_list[0] = '1'`.\n    *   `int('1') > int('0')` is `True`. So, replace `a_list[1]` with `'1'`.\n    *   `a_list` becomes `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. Increment `s_ptr` to `1`.\n\n*   **`i = 2` (digit '2' in `a_list`):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 1`, `s_sorted_list[1] = '0'`.\n    *   `int('0') > int('2')` is `False`. So, no replacement.\n    *   `a_list` remains `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `1`.\n\n*   **`i = 3` (digit '4' in `a_list`):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 1`, `s_sorted_list[1] = '0'`.\n    *   `int('0') > int('4')` is `False`. So, no replacement.\n    *   `a_list` remains `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `1`.\n\nThe loop finishes. Join `a_list` to get the final result: `\"1124\"`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting `s` takes `O(m log m)` time, where `m` is the length of `s`.\n*   Iterating through `a` takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of `a`. Inside the loop, operations are constant time.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(m log m + n)`. Given `n, m <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: `O(n + m)` for storing `a_list` and `s_sorted_list`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the first line for integer a\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Read the second line for sequence s\n    s_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Convert a to a list of characters for mutable access\n    a_list = list(a_str)\n    \n    # Convert s to a list of characters and sort it in descending order.\n    # This allows us to always pick the largest available digit from s.\n    s_sorted_list = sorted(list(s_str), reverse=True)\n\n    n = len(a_list)\n    m = len(s_sorted_list)\n\n    # Pointer for iterating through the sorted s_list\n    s_ptr = 0 \n\n    # Iterate through the digits of a from left to right (most significant to least significant)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # If we have used all available digits from s, we can't make any more replacements.\n        if s_ptr >= m:\n            break\n        \n        # If the current largest digit from s is strictly greater than a_list[i],\n        # then replacing it is optimal to maximize the number.\n        if int(s_sorted_list[s_ptr]) > int(a_list[i]):\n            a_list[i] = s_sorted_list[s_ptr]\n            s_ptr += 1 # Move to the next largest digit in s (mark the current one as used)\n        # Else (s_sorted_list[s_ptr] <= a_list[i]):\n        # We don't replace a_list[i].
