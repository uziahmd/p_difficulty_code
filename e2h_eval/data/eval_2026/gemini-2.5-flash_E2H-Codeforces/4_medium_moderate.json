The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI'm tackling a competitive programming challenge. It's Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with a twist. Two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each have their own repeating strategies. Nikephoros plays according to a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus follows sequence `B` of length `k`. We have to figure out how many times each player *loses* in `n` rounds.\n\nThe core idea is that these strategies are cyclic. The overall cycle length for both players is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. This means, after `L = LCM(m, k)` rounds, their moves will repeat. Since `n` could be huge, we're going to precompute losses within a cycle, and scale them to a large number of rounds. Then handle the remainder.\n\nFirst, I need to create a helper function `get_outcome()` which, given choices from Nikephoros and Polycarpus, determines who loses. This will be my core building block.\n\nThen, calculate the `LCM` of `m` and `k` using the `math.gcd()` function.\n\nNext, simulate the first `L` rounds to get losses within the repeating cycle.\n\nFinally, I can calculate the number of full cycles of `L` rounds in `n`. Multiply losses in one cycle by the number of cycles to determine full-cycle losses. Add losses from any remaining rounds. That's the solution.\n\nSpecifically,\n\n1.  Create a helper function `get_outcome` to determine losses for each player. If there's a draw, no one loses. If Nikephoros's choice wins, Polycarpus loses; if Polycarpus' choice wins, Nikephoros loses.\n\n2.  Calculate the `LCM` of `m` and `k` using `math.gcd()`.\n\n3.  Simulate a cycle of `L` rounds, accumulating Nikephoros's and Polycarpus's losses in separate variables: `nikephoros_losses_L` and `polycarpus_losses_L`.\n\n4.  Calculate `num_cycles = n // L` (number of full cycles) and `remaining_rounds = n % L` (remaining rounds).\n\n5.  Compute `total_nikephoros_losses = num_cycles * nikephoros_losses_L` and `total_polycarpus_losses = num_cycles * polycarpus_losses_L`.\n\n6.  Loop through `remaining_rounds` using the `get_outcome` method to add losses for these.\n\n7.  Print the total losses for both.\n\nBecause of the constraints of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the most time-consuming part (the full cycle simulation) will be at most `LCM(m, k)` iterations, which is at most `10^6`, which is manageable.\n\nI'll write the code and test with the example cases, including edge cases, to confirm everything is working as intended.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses (red spots) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both players use a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros repeats a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus repeats a sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nThe core idea to solve this problem efficiently, given that `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9) while `m` and `k` are small (up to 1000), is to observe the cyclic nature of their strategies. The combined pattern of choices for both players repeats every `L` rounds, where `L` is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand Rock-Paper-Scissors Rules**:\n    *   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n    *   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n    *   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n    *   Same choices result in a draw.\n    A player gets a red spot (loses) if their opponent wins the round.\n\n2.  **Determine Outcome Function**:\n    Create a helper function, say `get_outcome(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)`, which returns a tuple `(nikephoros_loss, polycarpus_loss)`. Each element in the tuple will be 1 if that player loses the round, and 0 otherwise.\n    *   If `nikephoros_choice == polycarpus_choice`, it's a draw: `(0, 0)`.\n    *   If Nikephoros wins (e.g., 'R' vs 'S'): `(0, 1)`.\n    *   If Polycarpus wins (e.g., 'R' vs 'P'): `(1, 0)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate LCM**:\n    The length of the repeating pattern `L` is `LCM(m, k)`. The LCM can be calculated using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`, where `GCD` is the Greatest Common Divisor. Python's `math` module provides `math.gcd()`.\n    Since `m, k <= 1000`, `L` will be at most `1000 * 999 = 999000` (for `m=1000, k=999` or similar coprime numbers), which is well within a manageable range for simulation.\n\n4.  **Simulate One Full Cycle**:\n    Iterate `i` from `0` to `L - 1`. In each round `i`:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Use `get_outcome` to determine losses for this round and accumulate them into `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle` and `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Losses for `n` Rounds**:\n    *   Determine how many full `L`-round cycles fit into `n`: `num_full_cycles = n // L`.\n    *   Determine the number of remaining rounds: `remaining_rounds = n % L`.\n    *   The total losses from full cycles are:\n        `total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`\n        `total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`\n    *   Simulate the `remaining_rounds` by iterating `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`, calculating losses for each round using `A[i % m]` and `B[i % k]`, and adding them to the respective total loss counts.\n\n6.  **Print Results**:\n    Print `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses` separated by a space.\n\nThis approach is efficient because the simulation is only performed for `L` rounds (at most ~10^6 operations) plus `remaining_rounds` (at most `L` operations), regardless of how large `n` is.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_outcome(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the outcome of a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n    Returns (nikephoros_loss, polycarpus_loss).\n    1 indicates a loss for the player, 0 indicates no loss (win or draw).\n    \"\"\"\n    if nikephoros_choice == polycarpus_choice:\n        return 0, 0  # Draw, no one loses\n\n    # Check if Nikephoros wins\n    # R beats S\n    # S beats P\n    # P beats R\n    if (nikephoros_choice == 'R' and polycarpus_choice == 'S') or \\\n       (nikephoros_choice == 'S' and polycarpus_choice == 'P') or \\\n       (nikephoros_choice == 'P' and polycarpus_choice == 'R'):\n        return 0, 1  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        # If not a draw and Nikephoros doesn't win, Polycarpus must win\n        return 1, 0  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input()\n    B = input()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate LCM(m, k)\n    # LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // common_divisor\n\n    # Simulate one full cycle of 'lcm' rounds to find losses within one cycle\n    nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0\n    polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n        n_loss, p_loss = get_outcome(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        nikephoros_losses_in_cycle += n_loss\n        polycarpus_losses_in_cycle += p_loss\n\n    # Calculate total losses using the full cycles\n    num_full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remaining_rounds = n % lcm\n\n    total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle\n    total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle\n\n    # Simulate the remaining rounds that don't form a full cycle\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n        n_loss, p_loss = get_outcome(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        total_nikephoros_losses += n_loss\n        total_polycarpus_losses += p_loss\n\n    print(total_nikephoros_losses, total_polycarpus_losses)\n\n# Execute the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
