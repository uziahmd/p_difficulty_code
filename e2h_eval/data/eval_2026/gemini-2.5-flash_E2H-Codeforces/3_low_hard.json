Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and Lanterns - A Python Script Design**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to address the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. Let me break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I've got a street of length `l`, running from 0 to `l`. There are `n` lanterns positioned at coordinates `a_i`. Each lantern has a light radius, say `d`. A lantern at `a_i` illuminates the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. My goal is to determine the *minimum* possible value of `d` that will fully light the entire street, meaning every single point from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\nThe core concept is that for the entire street to be illuminated, every point `x` in the range `[0, l]` must be covered by at least one lantern. This means there needs to exist a lantern at `a_i` such that the point `x` falls within the range `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nNow, for my strategy:\n\n1.  **Sorting Lanterns:** The first, and arguably most crucial, step is to sort the lantern positions `a_i`. Ordering them makes it much easier to analyze the gaps and coverage. Let's call the sorted positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\n\n2.  **Identifying Gaps:**\n    *   **The Beginning:** The segment from 0 to `a_1` must be lit.  To ensure this, the first lantern at `a_1` needs to extend far enough. We need `a_1 - d <= 0`, which means `d >= a_1`.\n    *   **The End:** Similarly, the segment from `a_n` to `l` must be illuminated. This requires `a_n + d >= l`, thus `d >= l - a_n`.\n    *   **Between Lanterns:**  The real trick is what lies *between* the lanterns. Consider adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. We want to be sure their light radii overlap to cover the space in between. The worst case scenario, is when the light from each lantern \"meets\" exactly halfway between them: `(a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`.  So `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.  This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. I need to calculate this for all pairs of adjacent lanterns. The largest resulting value is going to be the minimum `d` needed to cover the biggest gap.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Minimum `d`:**\n    To get the minimum `d` that does the job, I have to find the maximum of the individual requirements:\n    *   `d_1 = a_1` (to cover the beginning)\n    *   `d_2 = l - a_n` (to cover the end)\n    *   `d_3 = max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` (to cover gaps)\n\n    The final answer, then, is `max(d_1, d_2, d_3)`.\n\nAs a quick check, let me think about this second example:\n\n`n = 2, l = 5`\n`a = [2, 5]`\nThen:\n* `d_1 = 2`\n* `d_2 = 5 - 5 = 0`\n* `d_3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5`\nThen d = max (2, 0, 1.5) = 2.\n\nPerfect. Now I think I can write a very efficient Python script to solve this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` (from coordinate 0 to `l`) are lit by `n` lanterns. Each lantern `a_i` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo ensure the entire street `[0, l]` is lit, we need to consider three types of segments that must be covered:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The segment `[0, a_0]` (where `a_0` is the position of the first lantern after sorting) must be lit. The lantern at `a_0` must cover the point 0. This means `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`.\n    The required `d` for this part is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street:** The segment `[a_{n-1}, l]` (where `a_{n-1}` is the position of the last lantern after sorting) must be lit. The lantern at `a_{n-1}` must cover the point `l`. This means `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n    The required `d` for this part is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting), the segment between them must be fully lit. The lantern at `a_i` covers up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` covers from `a_{i+1} - d`. To ensure continuous coverage, these two segments must meet or overlap: `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n    We need to find the maximum `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` among all adjacent pairs to determine the `d` required to cover the largest internal gap.\n\nThe minimum light radius `d` required to light the entire street will be the maximum of these three requirements.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions `a_i` into a list.\n3.  Sort the list of lantern positions `a`.\n4.  Initialize a variable `max_d_needed` to 0.0 (using float for precision).\n5.  **Calculate `d` for the beginning:** `max_d_needed = max(max_d_needed, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  **Calculate `d` for the end:** `max_d_needed = max(max_d_needed, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n7.  **Calculate `d` for internal gaps:** Iterate from `i = 0` to `n-2`. For each pair `(a_i, a_{i+1})`, calculate the required `d` as `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.0`. Update `max_d_needed` with the maximum value found so far.\n8.  Print `max_d_needed` formatted to the required precision.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 7, l = 15`\n`a = [15, 5, 3, 7, 9, 14, 0]`\n\n1.
