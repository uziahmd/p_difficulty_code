The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Solving Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down systematically. The problem gives us `n` houses in a ring, and Xenia needs to complete `m` tasks, each at a specific house. Movement is clockwise, one house at a time, and it costs one unit of time per move.\n\nMy approach will be to simulate Xenia's movements. I'll keep track of her current house and the total time elapsed. For each task, I'll calculate the time it takes to get to the required house and update the total time.\n\nThe core logic lies in calculating the time for each move. If the target house is ahead of her current house, it's just a simple subtraction: `target_house - current_house`. But, if the target house is behind her, she has to go all the way around the ring. In this case, the time is calculated as `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n\nI'll initialize `current_house` to 1 and `total_time` to 0. Then, I'll loop through each task, apply the appropriate time calculation, update `current_house`, and accumulate the time.  Finally, I'll output the `total_time`. I need to ensure I handle the edge cases where the target house is the same as the current house. The provided logic correctly accounts for the cases.\n\nFor efficiency, I know the maximum time for a single task is when she must go from house 1 to house n which costs `n-1`, while the total moves can be `m * n`, with the input constraints of `n <= 10^5` and `m <= 10^5`, this will be `10^10` which is possible for 64-bit integer, which is native for Python. The algorithm itself is O(m) and since python handles arbitrary precision integers, there's no problem. The algorithm will work with the example inputs.\n",
