The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core challenge here is that we're dealing with a massive number of rounds, up to 2 * 10^9, making a brute-force approach immediately unfeasible. We need to identify a repeating pattern, and the cyclic sequences provide the key.\n\nMy initial thought is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences, `m` and `k`. This LCM, which I'll call `cycle_len`, will represent the length of a complete repeating cycle of moves.\n\nThe game is simple enough, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, and draws are irrelevant. So, my plan is this:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** Grab the input `n`, `A`, and `B`, and extract lengths `m` and `k`.\n2.  **LCM Calculation:** Use the `math.gcd` function, and calculate `cycle_len = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)`.\n3.  **Cycle Simulation:** Simulate a single cycle of `cycle_len` rounds. For each round within the cycle, determine the winner and increment the appropriate loss counter.\n4.  **Full Cycle Counts:** Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (`n`). Multiply the loss counts from the single cycle by this number to get the losses from complete cycles.\n5.  **Remaining Rounds:**  Figure out the remaining rounds after the full cycles (`remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len`). Simulate these remaining rounds and update the loss counts.\n6.  **Output:** Print the total number of losses for both players.\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nI will create a helper function called `get_round_result`. This function will take the moves of the two players as input and return 0 for a draw, 1 if Nikephoros wins, and -1 if Polycarpus wins. This makes the counting logic easier to manage and the code more readable.\n\nThe use of `i % m` and `i % k` inside the loops is crucial to correctly handle the cyclic sequences.\n\nLet's quickly check the constraints: The lengths of `A` and `B` are up to 1000, so the LCM (and thus the cycle length) can be at most 10^6. This means the simulation of a single cycle will be at most 10^6 operations, which is perfectly acceptable. `math.gcd` is efficient and is not a bottleneck.  Python's integer handling naturally takes care of large numbers for `n`.\n\nI will also make sure the code is structured cleanly and includes all the necessary imports.\n",
