He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Decoding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script to tackle this \"A Trivial Problem\".  Seems straightforward enough on the surface, but I know these competitive programming challenges can hide little traps. The core of the problem is figuring out how many trailing zeroes `n!` has, and then finding all the `n`s that produce exactly `m` zeroes.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on those trailing zeroes.  It's all about prime factors, isn't it? Trailing zeroes come from multiples of 10, which means pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of 5s determines the number of zeroes.  Legendre's formula is the key here: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  That's my tool to calculate the trailing zeroes.\n\nNow, let's analyze `Z(n)`. It's non-decreasing, which is good.  It only jumps up when `n` is a multiple of 5.  I can already see that it doesn't increase in even steps every time. I did some mental math and realized that from `n=24` to `n=25` there's a jump of two in the number of trailing zeroes. So, `Z(n)` doesn't take on all integer values.  That's the critical insight!\n\nIt's going to increase by at least 1 for every multiple of 5. If it is also multiple of 25, it will increase by 2, and so on. Understanding this pattern of \"skipping\" is going to be central to finding all the valid `n`s.\n\nI need to use this information to determine the algorithm of my script.\n",
