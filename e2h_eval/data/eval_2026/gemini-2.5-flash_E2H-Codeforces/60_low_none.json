Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Morse Code Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving Morse code and letter sequences.  The goal is to dynamically calculate the number of unique letter sequences that can be formed from substrings of a growing binary string, `S`, representing the Morse code.  Each character appended to `S` is either a '0' or a '1'.  This needs to be done modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the basics. Morse code is represented with '0' as a dot and '1' as a dash.  Each English letter has a Morse code equivalent that is a string of length 1 to 4.  There are a total of 30 possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4, which is `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30`.  However, we know there are only 26 English letters. Looking at the examples provided, I can see that some binary combinations don't correspond to any English letters. There are four unused binary combinations: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". That means only 26 out of the 30 combinations actually correspond to English letters.  Those four strings are the ones we need to exclude from the count.\n\nThe input is straightforward: `m` is the number of modifications, and each modification appends a '0' or a '1' to `S`.  I need to output the count of valid letter sequences *after each modification*.  The phrase \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of `S`\" is the key here. It means I'm not just looking at single letters, but also at concatenated sequences of letters, as long as the entire Morse code representation of the combined letters appears as a substring within `S`.\n\nLet me think this through with the example. If `S = \"111\"`, then the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". We're interested in all possible sequences of letters represented by these substrings.  \"1\" can be just 'T', \"11\" can be just 'M' but also \"TT\", \"111\" can be 'O' or \"TM\" or \"MT\". This tells me I need to account for overlapping possibilities. So if I have \"1111\" and \"0\" represents 'E' and \"00\" represent 'I' then \"11110\" could be \"0\" and \"00\" so \"11110\" could be \"EE\". But also, \"1111\" could represent the same thing and this is where overlap gets tricky and where Dynamic Programming will become useful.\n\nSo the core of the problem seems to be efficiently finding *all* valid letter sequences for *all* possible substrings of `S`, and doing it dynamically as `S` grows.  I'm thinking dynamic programming, or maybe a clever state machine, will be the way to go to keep track of these overlapping possibilities and avoid redundant calculations. The modulo part is standard, but the dynamic aspect and the need to handle overlapping substring-to-sequence mappings are the real challenge.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by *some* substring of a growing binary string `S`. Each English letter corresponds to a unique Morse code string of length 1 to 4, composed of '0' (dot) and '1' (dash). Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not represent any letter.\n\nLet's clarify the definition of a \"sequence of English letters\". If a substring `sub` of `S` can be parsed into `c_1c_2...c_k`, where each `c_i` is the Morse code for an English letter, then the sequence of letters `L_1L_2...L_k` (where `L_i` is the letter for `c_i`) is counted. We need to find the total number of *distinct* such sequences.\n\nThis problem can be modeled using dynamic programming. When a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S' = S + c`, we need to update the total count.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[0...i]`, considering `S[0...i]` as the *entire* Morse code string. This is not quite what the problem asks, as it wants sequences from *any substring*.\n\nInstead, let's consider the contribution of each new character. When `S` grows to length `k`, we are interested in all substrings `S[i...j]` for `0 <= i <= j < k`.\nThe key insight is that a sequence of letters `L_1...L_p` corresponds to a concatenated Morse code `C_1...C_p`. This `C_1...C_p` must be equal to some substring `S[i...j]`.\n\nLet `valid_codes` be the set of 26 Morse code strings that map to English letters.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed using `S[0...i]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\nWhen `S` has length `k`, we are interested in `S[k-1]`, `S[k-2...k-1]`, `S[k-3...k-1]`, `S[k-4...k-1]`.\nFor each `j` from `max(0, k-4)` to `k-1`:\nConsider the substring `sub = S[j...k-1]`.\nIf `sub` is in `valid_codes`:\n    Let `N = len(sub)`.\n    If `j == 0`: `sub` itself forms a sequence of one letter. So `dp[0]` for `S[0...N-1]` is 1.\n    If `j > 0`: `sub` can form a sequence of one letter. Also, `sub` can be appended to any sequence formed by `S[0...j-1]`.\n    So, if `sub` is valid, it adds `(1 + dp[j-1])` new ways to form sequences ending at `k-1`.\n\nThis is still not quite right because `dp[j-1]` counts sequences for `S[0...j-1]` as a whole. We need to consider *any* substring ending at `j-1`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[0...i]` as the *end* of the Morse code sequence.\nWhen `S` has length `k` (0-indexed `k-1`):\n`dp[k-1]` = sum of `(1 + dp[j-1])` for all `j` such that `S[j...k-1]` is a valid Morse code. (If `j=0`, it's just `1`).\nThe total answer after `k` characters is `sum(dp[i])` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`.\n\nLet `f[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[...i]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\nWhen the `k`-th character `c` is appended to `S`: `S_new = S_old + c`. Let `S_new` have length `k`.\nWe need to calculate `f[k-1]`.\n`f[k-1]` is the sum of `(1 + f[j-1])` (or `1` if `j=0`) for all `j` such that `S_new[j...k-1]` is a valid Morse code.\nThe strings `S_new[j...k-1]` are `S_new[k-1]`, `S_new[k-2...k-1]`, `S_new[k-3...k-1]`, `S_new[k-4...k-1]`.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S` after `k` characters are appended.\nLet `dp[i]` store the number of ways to form sequences ending at index `i` of `current_S`.\n`dp[i] = 0` initially.\nFor `length` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - length + 1 >= 0`:\n        Let `sub = current_S[i - length + 1 ... i]`.\n        If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n            If `i - length + 1 == 0`:\n                `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD` (This `sub` forms a single-letter sequence)\n            Else:\n                `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1 + dp[i - length]) % MOD` (This `sub` forms a single-letter sequence, or extends sequences ending at `i-length`)\n\nThis `dp[i]` definition is what we need. It counts sequences whose Morse representation *ends* at index `i`.\nThe total answer after `k` characters is `sum(dp[i])` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`.\n\nLet's refine the DP state:\n`dp[i]` = number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code *ends* at index `i` of the current string `S`.\nWhen a new character `ch` is appended to `S`, `S` grows from length `k-1` to `k`. We need to calculate `dp[k-1]`.\n`dp[k-1] = 0`.\nWe check substrings ending at `k-1` of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4:\n1.  `sub_1 = S[k-1]` (length 1)\n2.  `sub_2 = S[k-2...k-1]` (length 2)\n3.  `sub_3 = S[k-3...k-1]` (length 3)\n4.  `sub_4 = S[k-4...k-1]` (length 4)\n\nFor each `sub_len` from 1 to 4:\n    Let `start_idx = k - sub_len`.\n    If `start_idx >= 0`:\n        Let `current_morse_code = S[start_idx ... k-1]`.\n        If `current_morse_code` is one of the 26 valid Morse codes:\n            If `start_idx == 0`:\n                `dp[k-1] = (dp[k-1] + 1) % MOD`. (This is a sequence of one letter)\n            Else:\n                `dp[k-1] = (dp[k-1] + 1 + dp[start_idx - 1]) % MOD`. (This is a sequence of one letter, or extends existing sequences)\n\nAfter computing `dp[k-1]`, the total answer for the current `S` (of length `k`) is `(previous_total_ans + dp[k-1]) % MOD`.\n\nLet's list the valid Morse codes (non-invalid ones):\nAll 30 strings of length 1-4:\n\"0\", \"1\"\n\"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\n\"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\"\n\"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0100\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"\n\nInvalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nSo, the set of valid Morse codes is all 30 strings minus these 4.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `S = \"111\"`\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`dp` array stores `dp[i]` for the current `S`. `total_ans` accumulates results.\nInitially `S = \"\"`, `dp = []`, `total_ans = 0`.\n\n**1. Append '1'**: `S = \"1\"`\n   `k = 1`. Compute `dp[0]`.\n   Substrings ending at `S[0]`:\n   - `S[0]` (\"1\"): Valid. `start_idx = 0`.\n     `dp[0] = (dp[0] + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `total_ans = (0 + dp[0]) % MOD = 1`.\n   Output: 1\n\n**2. Append '1'**: `S = \"11\"`\n   `k = 2`. Compute `dp[1]`.\n   Substrings ending at `S[1]`:\n   - `S[1]` (\"1\"): Valid. `start_idx = 1`.\n     `dp[1] = (dp[1] + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n   - `S[0...1]` (\"11\"): Valid. `start_idx = 0`.\n     `dp[1] = (dp[1] + 1) % MOD = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n   `total_ans = (1 + dp[1]) % MOD = (1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\n   Wait, example output is 3. My `dp[1]` is 3.\n   Let's re-read the example output for \"11\":\n   \"T\" (from \"1\")\n   \"M\" (from \"11\")\n   \"TT\" (from \"11\")\n   Total 3.\n   My `dp[1]` calculation:\n   `sub=\"1\"` (from `S[1]`): `start_idx=1`. Adds `1 + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`. (`dp[0]` means sequences ending at index 0, i.e., \"T\" from `S[0]`). So this is \"T\" (from `S[1]`) and \"TT\" (from `S[0]` then `S[1]`).\n   `sub=\"11\"` (from `S[0...1]`): `start_idx=0`. Adds `1`. This is \"M\".\n   Total `dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3`. This matches the example's count of sequences that *use* `S[0...1]` as a whole or end at `S[1]`.\n   The `total_ans` is `dp[0] + dp[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n   The example output for \"11\" is `3`. This means `total_ans` is not `sum(dp[i])`.\n\n   The problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of S in Morse code\".\n   This means we need to count the number of distinct (Letter_1, ..., Letter_p) sequences such that there exists `0 <= i <= j < k` where `S[i...j]` is the concatenation of Morse codes for `Letter_1, ..., Letter_p`.\n\n   Let's reconsider the definition of `dp[i]`.\n   `S = \"11\"`\n   `dp[0]` for `S[0]` (\"1\"): `1` sequence (\"T\").\n   `dp[1]` for `S[1]` (\"1\"): `1` sequence (\"T\").\n   `dp[0...1]` for `S[0...1]` (\"11\"): `2` sequences (\"M\", \"TT\").\n\n   The example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3. These are: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\n   \"T\" is formed by `S[0]` or `S[1]`.\n   \"M\" is formed by `S[0...1]`.\n   \"TT\" is formed by `S[0...1]`.\n\n   This means we need to maintain a *set* of all distinct sequences found so far.\n   A set of strings will be too slow (`m` up to 3000, sequences can be long).\n   The problem asks for *count* modulo `10^9 + 7`, which usually implies DP.\n\n   Let's re-read the example's explanation for `S=\"111\"`:\n   \"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n   \"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n   \"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n   \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n   \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n   \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n   \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\n   Total 7.\n\n   This implies that if a substring `sub` can be parsed in multiple ways (e.g., \"11\" -> \"M\" or \"TT\"), all these ways contribute to the count.\n   Also, if the same sequence of letters can be formed by different substrings (e.g., \"T\" from `S[0]` and \"T\" from `S[1]` in `S=\"11\"`), it's only counted once. This is the tricky part.\n\n   \"T\" from `S[0]` is distinct from \"T\" from `S[1]`? No, it's the same sequence \"T\".\n   The problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". This refers to the actual sequence of letters, not their positions in `S`.\n\n   This changes the problem significantly. We need to count distinct letter sequences.\n   Let `dp[i]` be the set of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed using `S[0...i]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\n   `dp[i] = Union over j < i of (dp[j] + L)` where `S[j+1...i]` is Morse for `L`, AND `L` where `S[0...i]` is Morse for `L`.\n   This is still too slow.\n\n   The length of `S` can be up to 3000. The length of a Morse code for a single letter is at most 4.\n   This means a sequence of letters `L_1...L_p` would have a Morse code `C_1...C_p` of length at most `4p`.\n   If `S` has length `k`, then `p` can be up to `k`. So `C_1...C_p` can be up to length `k`.\n\n   Let's re-read the example for `S=\"111\"` again.\n   \"T\" (from \"1\") - `S[0]`, `S[1]`, `S[2]`\n   \"M\" (from \"11\") - `S[0...1]`, `S[1...2]`\n   \"O\" (from \"111\") - `S[0...2]`\n   \"TT\" (from \"11\") - `S[0...1]`, `S[1...2]`\n   \"TM\" (from \"111\") - `S[0...2]`\n   \"MT\" (from \"111\") - `S[0...2]`\n   \"TTT\" (from \"111\") - `S[0...2]`\n\n   Total 7 distinct sequences.\n   This means if a sequence `X` can be formed by `S[i...j]` and also by `S[i'...j']`, it's counted only once.\n\n   This is a classic problem for Aho-Corasick automaton or similar structure if the \"patterns\" (Morse codes) were fixed and we were matching them against `S`. Here, the \"patterns\" are sequences of letters.\n\n   Let `dp[i]` be a set of all distinct letter sequences that can be formed by substrings `S[x...i]` for any `x <= i`.\n   When `S` grows to `k`, we compute `dp[k-1]`.\n   `dp[k-1] = {}`\n   For `sub_len` from 1 to 4:\n       `start_idx = k - sub_len`.\n       If `start_idx >= 0`:\n           `current_morse_code = S[start_idx ... k-1]`.\n           If `current_morse_code` is a valid Morse code for letter `L`:\n               If `start_idx == 0`:\n                   `dp[k-1].add(L)`.\n               Else:\n                   For each sequence `seq` in `dp[start_idx - 1]`:\n                       `dp[k-1].add(seq + L)`.\n                   `dp[k-1].add(L)`. (This is for the single letter sequence L)\n\n   This `dp[i]` would contain sequences of letters.\n   The maximum length of a letter sequence can be `m` (if all letters are length 1).\n   Storing sets of strings is too slow and memory intensive.\n\n   The modulo arithmetic suggests we should be summing counts, not storing sets.\n   This implies that the \"distinct sequences\" part might be simpler than it seems, or there's a trick.\n\n   What if `dp[i]` is just the *count* of distinct sequences that can be formed by substrings *ending* at `i`?\n   Let `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters whose Morse representation `C_1...C_p` is exactly `S[x...i]` for some `x`.\n   Let `total_distinct_sequences` be a `set` of strings (letter sequences).\n   When `S` grows by one character (to length `k`), we iterate `i` from `0` to `k-1`.\n   For each `i`, we iterate `j` from `i` to `min(i+3, k-1)`.\n   Let `sub = S[i...j]`.\n   If `sub` is a valid Morse code for letter `L`:\n       If `i == 0`:\n           `total_distinct_sequences.add(L)`.\n       Else:\n           For each `seq` in `sequences_ending_at_i-1`:\n               `total_distinct_sequences.add(seq + L)`.\n           `total_distinct_sequences.add(L)`.\n\n   This is still a set of strings. The problem is very tricky with the \"distinct sequences\" part.\n   If it means \"distinct sequences of letters that *can be formed* by *any* substring\", then the set approach is the only direct interpretation.\n   Given `m=3000`, this is too slow.\n\n   What if the \"distinct sequences\" refers to sequences that are formed by specific substrings?\n   Example `S=\"11\"`:\n   `S[0]` (\"1\") -> 'T'\n   `S[1]` (\"1\") -> 'T'\n   `S[0...1]` (\"11\") -> 'M'\n   `S[0...1]` (\"11\") -> 'TT'\n   The set of sequences is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Count = 3.\n\n   My previous `dp[i]` definition:\n   `dp[i]` = number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by `S[0...i]` *as the whole Morse string*.\n   `S=\"1\"`: `dp[0] = 1` (\"T\")\n   `S=\"11\"`:\n     `S[1]` is \"1\" (T). Can be formed as \"T\" or \"TT\" (if `S[0]` was \"T\").\n     `S[0...1]` is \"11\" (M). Can be formed as \"M\".\n     `dp[1]` = sequences for \"11\".\n     `S[1]` (\"1\") -> `L_1 = 'T'`.\n       If `0` is `start_idx`: `L_1`.\n       If `1` is `start_idx`: `L_1` or `seq + L_1` where `seq` is for `S[0]`.\n     This is confusing.\n\n   Let's use the standard competitive programming interpretation for \"number of sequences modulo X\".\n   Usually, this means if `A` can be formed in 5 ways and `B` in 3 ways, and `A != B`, then `A` and `B` contribute `5+3` to the count. If `A` can be formed in 5 ways and `A` in 3 ways, the total for `A` is 5 (not 8). This is the \"distinct\" part.\n\n   The problem is asking for the size of `Union_{i,j} { sequences_from(S[i...j]) }`.\n   Let `ends_at[k]` be the set of sequences that can be formed by any substring `S[i...k]`.\n   When `S` extends to length `k`:\n   `new_sequences = {}`\n   For `len` from 1 to 4:\n       `sub = S[k-len ... k-1]`\n       If `sub` is valid for letter `L`:\n           `new_sequences.add(L)`\n           If `k-len-1 >= 0`:\n               For `prev_seq` in `ends_at[k-len-1]`:\n                   `new_sequences.add(prev_seq + L)`\n   `total_sequences = total_sequences union new_sequences`.\n   `ends_at[k-1] = new_sequences`.\n\n   This is still using sets of strings. This cannot be the intended solution.\n   What if the problem implies that any time a substring `S[i...j]` parses to `L_1...L_p`, that sequence is counted, even if another `S[i'...j']` parses to the same sequence? No, the word \"distinct\" forbids this.\n\n   Let's check the constraints on `m`: `m <= 3000`.\n   A solution that is `O(m^2)` or `O(m^2 log m)` might pass.\n   If we use polynomial hashing for sequences, we can store hashes in a set.\n   `dp[i]` would be a set of hashes of sequences ending at `i`.\n   `total_hashes` would be a global set of hashes.\n\n   Let `P = 31` (or another prime), `MOD_HASH = 10^9 + 9` (or two different large primes for robustness).\n   Each letter `L` can be mapped to an integer (e.g., 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2, ..., 'Z' -> 26).\n   Hash of `L_1...L_p` = `(val(L_1) * P^(p-1) + val(L_2) * P^(p-2) + ... + val(L_p)) % MOD_HASH`.\n   This is a rolling hash.\n\n   Let `dp_hashes[i]` be a set of hashes of sequences that can be formed by substrings `S[x...i]`.\n   `current_S` is `S` after appending `k` characters. `dp_hashes` is a list of sets.\n   `total_hashes = set()`.\n\n   When `S` grows to length `k`:\n   `idx = k-1`.\n   `dp_hashes[idx] = set()`.\n   For `sub_len` from 1 to 4:\n       `start_idx = idx - sub_len + 1`.\n       If `start_idx >= 0`:\n           `current_morse_code = current_S[start_idx ... idx]`.\n           If `current_morse_code` is a valid Morse code for letter `L`:\n               `letter_val = get_letter_value(L)`.\n               `dp_hashes[idx].add(letter_val)`. // Sequence \"L\"\n               `total_hashes.add(letter_val)`.\n\n               If `start_idx > 0`:\n                   For `prev_hash` in `dp_hashes[start_idx - 1]`:\n                       `new_hash = (prev_hash * P + letter_val) % MOD_HASH`.\n                       `dp_hashes[idx].add(new_hash)`.\n                       `total_hashes.add(new_hash)`.\n   The answer for this step is `len(total_hashes)`.\n\n   Let's analyze the complexity:\n   `m` iterations.\n   In each iteration `k` (from 1 to `m`):\n     `idx = k-1`.\n     `dp_hashes[idx]` is a new set.\n     Loop `sub_len` from 1 to 4 (constant 4 iterations).\n       Inside, `current_morse_code` check (constant time, using a precomputed hash set or a trie/dict).\n       If valid:\n         `dp_hashes[idx].add(letter_val)` (O(1) amortized for set insertion).\n         `total_hashes.add(letter_val)` (O(1) amortized).\n         If `start_idx > 0`:\n           Loop `prev_hash` in `dp_hashes[start_idx - 1]`.\n             The size of `dp_hashes[j]` can be large. Max size of `dp_hashes[j]` can be `j+1` (if all letters are length 1, and each `S[x...j]` forms a unique sequence).\n             If `dp_hashes[j]` contains `j+1` elements, then the inner loop can run `O(k)` times.\n             Total complexity: `m * 4 * (1 + k) = O(m^2)`.\n             For `m=3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This should be acceptable.\n             Set insertions take `O(length_of_hash_key)` for string keys, or `O(1)` for integer hashes.\n             Python `set` operations are generally efficient for integers.\n\n   We need to map Morse codes to letters. A dictionary `morse_to_letter_val` can store this.\n   Map letters 'A'-'Z' to 1-26.\n   `P` should be chosen carefully. A prime larger than 26.\n   `MOD_HASH` should be a large prime. Using two hash functions with different `P` and `MOD_HASH` values is safer against collisions, but one usually suffices for competitive programming unless collisions are specifically targeted.\n\n   Let's list the 26 valid Morse codes:\n   Length 1: \"0\" (E), \"1\" (T)\n   Length 2: \"00\" (I), \"01\" (A), \"10\" (N), \"11\" (M)\n   Length 3: \"000\" (S), \"001\" (U), \"010\" (R), \"011\" (W), \"100\" (D), \"101\" (K), \"110\" (G), \"111\" (O)\n   Length 4:\n     \"0000\" (H), \"0001\" (V), \"0010\" (F)\n     \"0100\" (L), \"0110\" (P), \"0111\" (J)\n     \"1000\" (B), \"1001\" (X), \"1010\" (C), \"1011\" (Y)\n     \"1100\" (Z), \"1101\" (Q)\n\n   The four invalid strings are: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n   Let's create a dictionary `valid_morse_codes`.\n   `morse_to_letter_map = {\n       \"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, # E, T\n       \"00\": 3, \"01\": 4, \"10\": 5, \"11\": 6, # I, A, N, M\n       \"000\": 7, \"001\": 8, \"010\": 9, \"011\": 10, \"100\": 11, \"101\": 12, \"110\": 13, \"111\": 14, # S, U, R, W, D, K, G, O\n       \"0000\": 15, \"0001\": 16, \"0010\": 17, # H, V, F\n       \"0100\": 18, \"0110\": 19, \"0111\": 20, # L, P, J\n       \"1000\": 21, \"1001\": 22, \"1010\": 23, \"1011\": 24, # B, X, C, Y\n       \"1100\": 25, \"1101\": 26 # Z, Q\n   }`\n   (The specific letter mapping doesn't matter, just that each valid Morse code maps to a unique integer).\n\n   Let's trace `S=\"111\"` with the hashing approach.\n   `P = 31`, `MOD_HASH = 10^9 + 9`.\n   `dp_hashes = [set() for _ in range(m)]`\n   `total_hashes = set()`\n   `current_S = []`\n\n   **1.
