The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem involving radio towers. The goal is to figure out the probability of a specific scenario where the towns get signals as described. The final answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nI need to start by understanding the problem details. We have $n+2$ towns labeled $0$ to $n+1$, with each town located at its corresponding coordinate. Radio towers are constructed in towns $1$ to $n$, with each town having a 50/50 chance of building one. If a tower exists in town $i$ with signal power $p$, it reaches other towns $c$ such that the distance between $i$ and $c$ is less than $p$ (i.e., $|c-i| < p$). This means the signal range extends from $i - p + 1$ to $i + p -1$.\n\nThere are a couple of crucial constraints. First, towns $0$ and $n+1$ must *not* receive any signal. Second, each of the towns $1$ through $n$ must receive signals from *exactly one* tower.\n\nLet's denote the set of towns with towers as $S$.  For each town $i$ that has a tower (i.e., $i \\in S$), we have to choose a signal power $p_i$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nConsidering the constraints, let's break down the implications:\n\n*   For town $0$ to receive no signal, any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ must satisfy $i - p_i \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $p_i \\le i$.\n*   Similarly, for town $n+1$ to receive no signal, we need $i + p_i \\le n+1$, or $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n\nTherefore, for a tower at town $i$, its power $p_i$ is bounded by $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This defines the signal range of a tower at $i$ as $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$.\n\nFor the second constraint, we need the union of the signal ranges of all towers in $S$ to cover exactly towns $1$ to $n$, and these ranges must be non-overlapping. This means if $C_i$ is the set of towns reached by a tower at town $i$, then the union of all $C_i$ for $i \\in S$ should be equal to the set $\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$, and any two $C_i$ and $C_j$ for distinct towns $i$ and $j$ should have no overlap. So, the $C_i$ are pairwise disjoint.\n\nSo, I need to figure out how to count the number of valid tower configurations, considering the tower locations (the set $S$) and the assigned powers $p_i$. Then, divide this by the total number of possible scenarios (2^n since each town can independently build or not build a tower) to get the final probability, and reduce it modulo 998244353. The trick is to find an efficient way to check which tower configurations are valid. I'll need to explore some dynamic programming or backtracking ideas.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid assignment of signal powers exists, given a random selection of towns $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ where towers are built. Each town $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ builds a tower with probability $1/2$, independently.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each tower $i \\in S$, we assign a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means towns in the interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. The integer towns covered are $\\{i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1\\}$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n   - For town $0$: For any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$, $0$ must not be in $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. Since $i \\ge 1$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i+p_i > 0$. So we must have $i-p_i \\ge 0$, which implies $p_i \\le i$.\n   - For town $n+1$: For any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$, $n+1$ must not be in $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. Since $i \\le n$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i-p_i < n+1$. So we must have $i+p_i \\le n+1$, which implies $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n   Combining these, for any tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n   Let $R_i = \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This is the maximum possible power for a tower at $i$.\n   A tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n   This means the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   That is, $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1] = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and for distinct $i, j \\in S$, $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1] \\cap [j-p_j+1, j+p_j-1] = \\emptyset$.\n\nConsider a tower at $i \\in S$. The towns it covers are symmetric around $i$. The interval covered is centered at $i$.\nIf $p_i$ is chosen, the interval is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$. Its length is $2p_i-1$.\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i' = i+p_i-1$.\nFor the intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, they must be contiguous.\nSuppose we have towers at $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ in $S$.\nLet $C_j = [i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$.\nThen we must have $C_1 = [1, i_1+p_{i_1}-1]$, $C_k = [i_k-p_{i_k}+1, n]$, and for $1 \\le j < k$, $C_j$ and $C_{j+1}$ must meet exactly: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThis implies $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+2$.\nAlso, each $i_j$ must be covered by its own tower, so $i_j \\in C_j$, which is true if $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$.\n\nConsider the \"midpoints\" of the covered intervals.\nThe interval $[L, R]$ has length $R-L+1$. If it's covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p$, then $L=i-p+1$ and $R=i+p-1$.\nThis implies $i = (L+R)/2$ and $p = (R-L+2)/2$.\nFor $i$ and $p$ to be integers, $L+R$ must be even, and $R-L$ must be even. This means $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity.\nSo, each interval $[L, R]$ covering towns must have $L$ and $R$ of the same parity.\n\nIf $L$ and $R$ have the same parity, then $R-L$ is even, so $R-L+2$ is even, so $p$ is an integer.\nAlso, $L+R$ is even, so $(L+R)/2$ is an integer. This means the center $i$ is an integer.\nThe conditions $1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must hold for the chosen $p$.\n$p \\le i \\implies (R-L+2)/2 \\le (L+R)/2 \\implies R-L+2 \\le L+R \\implies 2 \\le 2L \\implies L \\ge 1$. This is always true for towns $1, \\dots, n$.\n$p \\le n+1-i \\implies (R-L+2)/2 \\le n+1-(L+R)/2 \\implies R-L+2 \\le 2n+2-L-R \\implies 2R \\le 2n \\implies R \\le n$. This is always true for towns $1, \\dots, n$.\n\nSo, a valid partition exists if and only if we can find a set of disjoint intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ that partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, such that for each $j$:\n1. $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity.\n2. The center $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is in $S$.\n\nThis means the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, and for each such interval, the town $(L_j+R_j)/2$ must have a tower.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ into such intervals, such that for each interval $[L, R]$ in the partition, a tower must be present at $(L+R)/2$.\nThe base case is $dp[0] = 1$ (empty partition).\nFor $k > 0$, we consider the last interval $[L, k]$.\n$L$ must have the same parity as $k$.\nThe center of this interval is $i = (L+k)/2$. A tower must be built at $i$. This happens with probability $1/2$.\nThe segment $\\{1, \\dots, L-1\\}$ must be partitioned in $dp[L-1]$ ways.\nSo, $dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^k dp[L-1] \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability for a specific configuration of towers is $(1/2)^N$ where $N$ is the number of towers built.\nThe total probability is $\\sum_{\\text{valid } S} (1/2)^{|S|} (1/2)^{n-|S|} = \\sum_{\\text{valid } S} (1/2)^n$.\nSo we need to count the number of valid sets $S$, then multiply by $(1/2)^n$.\n\nLet $f[k]$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ into intervals $[L, R]$ where $L, R$ have the same parity.\n$f[0] = 1$.\n$f[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^k f[L-1]$.\nThis sum can be written as:\nIf $k$ is even, $L$ must be even. $L \\in \\{2, 4, \\dots, k\\}$.\n$f[k] = f[1] + f[3] + \\dots + f[k-1]$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $L$ must be odd. $L \\in \\{1, 3, \\dots, k\\}$.\n$f[k] = f[0] + f[2] + \\dots + f[k-1]$.\n\nLet's compute the first few values of $f[k]$:\n$f[0] = 1$\n$f[1]$ (last interval $[1,1]$): $L=1, k=1$, same parity. $f[0]=1$. So $f[1]=1$.\n$f[2]$ (last interval $[L,2]$, $L$ must be even):\n  $L=2$: interval $[2,2]$, $f[1]=1$.\n  $f[2]=f[1]=1$.\n$f[3]$ (last interval $[L,3]$, $L$ must be odd):\n  $L=1$: interval $[1,3]$, $f[0]=1$.\n  $L=3$: interval $[3,3]$, $f[2]=1$.\n  $f[3]=f[0]+f[2]=1+1=2$.\n$f[4]$ (last interval $[L,4]$, $L$ must be even):\n  $L=2$: interval $[2,4]$, $f[1]=1$.\n  $L=4$: interval $[4,4]$, $f[3]=2$.\n  $f[4]=f[1]+f[3]=1+2=3$.\n$f[5]$ (last interval $[L,5]$, $L$ must be odd):\n  $L=1$: interval $[1,5]$, $f[0]=1$.\n  $L=3$: interval $[3,5]$, $f[2]=1$.\n  $L=5$: interval $[5,5]$, $f[4]=3$.\n  $f[5]=f[0]+f[2]+f[4]=1+1+3=5$.\n\nThe sequence $f[k]$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$. This is the Fibonacci sequence, shifted.\nSpecifically, $f[k] = F_{k+1}$, where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nLet's verify:\nIf $k$ is odd: $f[k] = f[0] + f[2] + \\dots + f[k-1]$.\n$f[k-1]$ is $F_k$. $f[k-2]$ is $F_{k-1}$.\n$f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-3] + \\dots + f[0]$\n$f[k-2] = f[k-3] + \\dots + f[0]$ (if $k-2$ is odd, then $k-3$ is even, $L$ even case is $f[k-2] = f[1]+f[3]+\\dots+f[k-3]$)\nThis is not directly $F_{k+1}$. Let's re-examine the recurrence for $f[k]$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $f[k] = f[0] + f[2] + \\dots + f[k-1]$.\nIf $k-1$ is even, $f[k-1] = f[1] + f[3] + \\dots + f[k-2]$.\nThis is not $f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-2]$.\n\nLet's use the definition:\n$f[k] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor (k-1)/2 \\rfloor} f[k-1-2j]$.\n$f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-3] + f[k-5] + \\dots$.\nIf $k$ is even, $f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-3] + \\dots + f[1]$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $f[k] = f[k-1] + f[k-3] + \\dots + f[0]$.\n\nLet's check $f[k] = F_{k+1}$:\n$F_{k+1} = F_k + F_{k-1}$.\n$f[0]=F_1=1$.\n$f[1]=F_2=1$.\n$f[2]=F_3=2$. But we got $f[2]=1$. So it's not $F_{k+1}$.\n\nThe sequence is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$.\n$f[0]=1$\n$f[1]=1$\n$f[2]=1$\n$f[3]=2$\n$f[4]=3$\n$f[5]=5$\n$f[6]=f[1]+f[3]+f[5] = 1+2+5=8$.\nThis sequence is $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6, F_7, \\dots$ starting from $f[0]=F_1$.\nSo $f[k] = F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\nMy calculation for $f[2]$ was wrong.\n$f[2]$ (last interval $[L,2]$, $L$ must be even):\n  $L=2$: interval $[2,2]$. The preceding part is $\\{1\\}$, which is $f[1]=1$.\n  So $f[2] = f[1] = 1$. This is correct.\n\nLet's re-check the Fibonacci definition $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\n$f[0]=1=F_1$.\n$f[1]=1=F_2$.\n$f[2]=1=F_3$.\n$f[3]=2=F_4$.\n$f[4]=3=F_5$.\n$f[5]=5=F_6$.\nIt seems $f[k] = F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\nLet's prove $f[k] = F_{k+1}$ by induction.\nBase cases: $f[0]=1=F_1$, $f[1]=1=F_2$.\nAssume $f[j]=F_{j+1}$ for all $j < k$.\nIf $k$ is even: $f[k] = f[1] + f[3] + \\dots + f[k-1]$.\nUsing the identity $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i} = F_{2m+1}-1$:\n$f[k] = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_k = (F_3-1) + (F_5-1) + \\dots + (F_{k+1}-1)$ NO, this is wrong.\nUsing the identity $\\sum_{i=0}^m F_i = F_{m+2}-1$.\nAnother identity: $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i-1} = F_{2m}$.\n$f[k] = \\sum_{j=1, j \\text{ odd}}^{k-1} f[j] = \\sum_{j=1, j \\text{ odd}}^{k-1} F_{j+1}$.\nSince $j$ is odd, $j+1$ is even. Let $j+1 = 2m$.\n$f[k] = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_k$.\nUsing the identity $\\sum_{i=1}^m F_{2i} = F_{2m+1}-1$. Here $m=k/2$.\n$f[k] = F_{k+1}-1$.\nThis is not $F_{k+1}$. So $f[k]$ is not $F_{k+1}$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $f[k]$ carefully.\n$f[0]=1$.\n$f[1]=f[0]=1$.\n$f[2]=f[1]=1$.\n$f[3]=f[0]+f[2]=1+1=2$.\n$f[4]=f[1]+f[3]=1+2=3$.\n$f[5]=f[0]+f[2]+f[4]=1+1+3=5$.\n$f[6]=f[1]+f[3]+f[5]=1+2+5=8$.\nThis sequence IS $F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$. My identity check was incorrect.\n\nLet's re-prove $f[k]=F_{k+1}$ using the recursive definition:\n$f[k] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor (k-1)/2 \\rfloor} f[k-1-2j]$.\nCase 1: $k$ is even. $k=2m$.\n$f[2m] = f[2m-1] + f[2m-3] + \\dots + f[1]$.\nWe want to show $f[2m]=F_{2m+1}$.\nCase 2: $k$ is odd. $k=2m+1$.\n$f[2m+1] = f[2m] + f[2m-2] + \\dots + f[0]$.\nWe want to show $f[2m+1]=F_{2m+2}$.\n\nLet's use the property $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$.\nConsider $f[k]$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1$. $f[2m+1] = f[2m] + f[2m-2] + \\dots + f[0]$.\n$f[2m-1] = f[2m-2] + f[2m-4] + \\dots + f[0]$.\nSo $f[2m+1] = f[2m] + f[2m-1]$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nThis is the Fibonacci recurrence!\n$f[0]=1, f[1]=1$.\n$f[2]=f[1]=1$.\n$f[3]=f[2]+f[1]=1+1=2$.\n$f[4]=f[3]+f[2]=2+1=3$.\n$f[5]=f[4]+f[3]=3+2=5$.\nThis confirms $f[k]=F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\nSo the number of valid ways to choose tower locations and powers is $F_{n+1}$.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nThus, the probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe modulus $M = 998244353$ is a prime number.\nWe need to compute $F_{n+1}$ using matrix exponentiation for large $n$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $F_{n+1}$ is the top-left element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n+1}$.\nLet $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. We need to compute $M^{n+1}$.\nThe power $2^n$ can be computed using modular exponentiation.\nThe inverse $(2^n)^{-1}$ can be computed as $(2^n)^{M-2} \\pmod M$ using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nLet's implement matrix exponentiation and modular exponentiation.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, n):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = mat_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(n): # Returns F_n, where F_0=0, F_1=1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # We want F_n.\n    # [F_{k+1}, F_k] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k * [F_1, F_0] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k * [1,0]\n    # So F_n is the top-left element of [[1,1],[1,0]]^(n-1) when multiplied by [1,0].\n    # That is, if M_pow = [[a,b],[c,d]], then [a,b]*[1,0] = a.\n    # So F_n is M_pow[0][0].\n    \n    # For F_{n+1}, we need M^(n).\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    T_pow_n_minus_1 = mat_pow(T, n - 1)\n    \n    # F_n is the element at (0,0) of T_pow_n_minus_1 * [1,0]\n    # which is T_pow_n_minus_1[0][0] * 1 + T_pow_n_minus_1[0][1] * 0 = T_pow_n_minus_1[0][0]\n    \n    return T_pow_n_minus_1[0][0]\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef mod_inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # We need F_{n+1}.\n    # The fibonacci function above returns F_k.
