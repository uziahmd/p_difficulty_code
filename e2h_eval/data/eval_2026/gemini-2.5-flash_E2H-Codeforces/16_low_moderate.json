Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Crazy Town\"**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Crazy Town\" problem. The core of it seems to be finding the shortest path between a home and a university within a grid defined by infinite lines.  My initial thought is to figure out the fundamental building blocks – these blocks are just regions in the plane, formed by the intersections of the roads.  I'm trying to visualize this. A block is simply a connected area untouched by any of the lines.\n\nMoving between blocks involves crossing a road, a key insight. So, this screams \"shortest path.\" I just need to define what the nodes and edges of my graph are.\n\nNow, let's zoom in on a single line `ax + by + c = 0`.  This divides the plane into two half-planes.  Any point can be either on one side or the other, or *crucially* on none (since the home and university aren't on any roads).  I think I can leverage this. I can represent a point's position relative to each line using the sign of `f_i(x, y) = a_i x + b_i y + c_i`. A block is then characterized by a consistent set of signs for all these functions.\n\nA crucial thing is that when I go from one block to an adjacent one, I'm *only* crossing one line. The sign of *only* one `f_i` flips. The others stay the same.\n\nLet's use the coordinates of the home and university. For each road, I need to compute the sign of `a_i x + b_i y + c_i` at the home and university locations.  This is key! Let's call these values `val1_i` and `val2_i`. Since the points aren't on any lines, they are never zero.\n\nHere's the critical observation: if `val1_i` and `val2_i` have the *same* sign, the home and university are on the *same* side of road `i`.  If they have *different* signs, they are on *opposite* sides. I only need to consider roads that *separate* the home and university blocks.\n\nCrossing a road, any road, costs one step. Therefore, to minimize the number of steps, I need to count the *number of roads that separate the home and the university*. If the signs are different, I have to cross it. It's that simple! That count is the minimum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (home) to a target block (university). A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a single road segment. Neither the home nor the university are located on any road.\n\nEach road is an infinite line defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`. This line divides the plane into two open half-planes: one where `ax + by + c > 0` and another where `ax + by + c < 0`.\n\nLet `(x1, y1)` be the coordinates of the home and `(x2, y2)` be the coordinates of the university.\nFor each road `i` with coefficients `(ai, bi, ci)`, we can evaluate the expression `ai*x + bi*y + ci` at the home and university coordinates:\n*   `val_home_i = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`\n*   `val_univ_i = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`\n\nSince neither home nor university lie on any road, `val_home_i` and `val_univ_i` will never be zero for any road `i`.\n\nNow, consider the relationship between `val_home_i` and `val_univ_i`:\n1.  **If `val_home_i` and `val_univ_i` have the same sign (both positive or both negative):** This means that the home and the university are on the same side of road `i`. To travel from home to university, it is not necessary to cross road `i`.\n2.  **If `val_home_i` and `val_univ_i` have different signs (one positive and one negative):** This means that the home and the university are on opposite sides of road `i`. To travel from home to university, one *must* cross road `i` at least once.\n\nEach time we cross a road, it counts as one step. To reach the university block from the home block, we need to cross exactly those roads that separate the two points. The minimum number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n1.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `(ai, bi, ci)`.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_univ = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n    d.  If `val_home` and `val_univ` have different signs (i.e., `val_home * val_univ < 0`), increment `steps`.\n5.  Print `steps`.\n\nThis approach correctly determines the minimum number of road crossings required, which directly translates to the minimum number of steps according to the problem definition.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read road coefficients\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for home coordinates\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for university coordinates\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If the signs are different, home and university are on opposite sides of this road.\n        # This road must be crossed to get from home to university.\n        # Since neither point is on the road, val_home and val_univ will never be zero.\n        if (val_home > 0 and val_univ < 0) or (val_home < 0 and val_univ > 0):\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
