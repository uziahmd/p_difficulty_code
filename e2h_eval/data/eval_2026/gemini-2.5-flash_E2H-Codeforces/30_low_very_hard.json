Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Initial Thoughts on the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got the gist of this \"TV Game\" problem. It's a competitive programming challenge.  Two players, Homer and Marge, are battling over a number, `A`, with `2n` digits.  They take turns grabbing digits from the left, building their own numbers, `S1` and `S2`, with the goal of maximizing the sum of those numbers. The game has some constraints: `n` is limited to 18, and `A` can have leading zeros.\n\nThe example clarifies things. It’s about string manipulation and choosing the right sequence of moves to get the biggest total prize.  I see that concatenating digits forms the players' numbers. The digits within each player's number maintain their original order in `A`, and that the goal is to maximize the sum of these concatenated strings.\n\nThe constraint on `n` (up to 18) suggests the search space isn't ridiculously large, but it's still large enough to need some smarts.  Brute force would be slow.  I need to think about a way to represent the game's state and find an optimal strategy. The problem statement's hint of a 'hard' question usually points towards dynamic programming or an insightful observation.\n\nI'm thinking I'll represent the state by considering each of the `2n` digits and who gets to claim it.  Given the size constraint, I'm hoping I can find a smart way to traverse possible moves. The total possibilities could get cumbersome.  I'll explore a dynamic programming approach, focusing on building up the optimal solution incrementally.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and the sum of their final numbers `S1 + S2` is maximized. The input number `A` has `2n` digits.\n\nLet the digits of `A` be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{2n-1}`.\nWhen a player takes a digit, it's appended to their number. For example, if Homer takes `a_i` then `a_j` (where `i < j`), his number `S1` will contain `a_i` followed by `a_j`. This means the relative order of digits taken by a player is preserved.\n\nThe total number of digits is `2n`. Each player takes `n` digits. This is a classic dynamic programming setup.\n\nLet `dp[i][h_moves][m_moves]` be the maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` after considering the first `i` digits of `A`, with Homer having made `h_moves` and Marge having made `m_moves`. However, this state definition is insufficient because `S1` and `S2` depend on the actual digits taken, not just the count. The value of `S1` and `S2` can be very large, exceeding standard integer types and making them unsuitable for direct storage in a DP state or as a return value.\n\nInstead, let's observe how the value of `S1 + S2` is calculated.\n`S1 = d_{i_0}d_{i_1}...d_{i_{n-1}}`\n`S2 = d_{j_0}d_{j_1}...d_{j_{n-1}}`\nwhere `{i_0, ..., i_{n-1}}` and `{j_0, ..., j_{n-1}}` form a partition of `{0, ..., 2n-1}`.\n\nThe value of a number like `d_0 d_1 d_2` is `d_0 * 10^2 + d_1 * 10^1 + d_2 * 10^0`.\nEach digit `a_k` contributes `a_k * 10^p` to either `S1` or `S2`, where `p` is its position from the right in the player's number.\nFor example, if `S1 = a_0 a_2 a_4` and `S2 = a_1 a_3 a_5`:\n`S1 = a_0*10^2 + a_2*10^1 + a_4*10^0`\n`S2 = a_1*10^2 + a_3*10^1 + a_5*10^0`\n`S1 + S2 = a_0*10^2 + a_2*10^1 + a_4*10^0 + a_1*10^2 + a_3*10^1 + a_5*10^0`\n\nNotice that the powers of 10 (`10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^{n-1}`) are fixed for the `n` positions within each player's number. The `k`-th digit taken by a player (0-indexed) will be multiplied by `10^(n-1-k)`.\nSo, `S1 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit_H_k * 10^(n-1-k))`\nAnd `S2 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit_M_k * 10^(n-1-k))`\n\nLet `dp[i][h_count][m_count]` be the maximum possible `S1 + S2` value.\n`i`: index of the current digit `a_i` being considered (from `0` to `2n-1`).\n`h_count`: number of digits Homer has taken so far.\n`m_count`: number of digits Marge has taken so far.\n\nThe base case is `dp[2n][n][n] = 0`. All other `dp` values are initialized to `-infinity`.\n\nFor each state `(i, h_count, m_count)`:\nWe consider taking `a_i`.\n1. **Homer takes `a_i`**:\n   This is possible if `h_count < n`.\n   The contribution of `a_i` to `S1` will be `a_i * 10^(n-1-h_count)`.\n   The new state is `(i+1, h_count+1, m_count)`.\n   `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] = max(dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count], dp[i][h_count][m_count] + a_i * 10^(n-1-h_count))`\n2. **Marge takes `a_i`**:\n   This is possible if `m_count < n`.\n   The contribution of `a_i` to `S2` will be `a_i * 10^(n-1-m_count)`.\n   The new state is `(i+1, h_count, m_count+1)`.\n   `dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1] = max(dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1], dp[i][h_count][m_count] + a_i * 10^(n-1-m_count))`\n\nThe dimensions of the DP table would be `(2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1)`.\nFor `n=18`, `2n=36`. The table size is `37 * 19 * 19` which is about `13,327` states. Each state involves two transitions. This is feasible.\nThe maximum value of `S1 + S2` can be very large. For `n=18`, `S1` can be `18` nines, e.g., `99...9` (18 times). This is `10^18 - 1`. `S1 + S2` can be `2 * (10^18 - 1)`. Python's arbitrary precision integers handle this automatically.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, we can store `parent` pointers or `choice` (H or M) in a separate table, or retrace the path from the final state. Retracing is generally cleaner.\n\n**Retracing the path:**\nStart from `(0, 0, 0)` and the maximum `dp[2n][n][n]`.\nFor each digit `a_i` (from `0` to `2n-1`):\nIf taking `a_i` for Homer leads to the current `dp` value (i.e., `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] == dp[i][h_count][m_count] + a_i * 10^(n-1-h_count)`), then Homer must have taken it. Append 'H' to the result and update `h_count`.\nElse, Marge must have taken it. Append 'M' and update `m_count`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1. Read `n` and `A`.\n2. Convert `A` to a list of integers `digits`.\n3. Precompute powers of 10: `powers_of_10[k] = 10^k`.\n4. Initialize `dp` table with `-1` (or some other indicator for \"not reachable\").\n   `dp[i][j][k]` stores the maximum sum.\n   `dp[0][0][0] = 0`.\n5. Iterate `i` from `0` to `2n-1`.\n6. Iterate `h_count` from `0` to `n`.\n7. Iterate `m_count` from `0` to `n`.\n8. If `dp[i][h_count][m_count]` is `-1` (unreachable), continue.\n9. Consider Homer's move: If `h_count < n`, calculate `new_val = dp[i][h_count][m_count] + digits[i] * powers_of_10[n - 1 - h_count]`. If `new_val > dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count]`, update `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] = new_val`.\n10. Consider Marge's move: If `m_count < n`, calculate `new_val = dp[i][h_count][m_count] + digits[i] * powers_of_10[n - 1 - m_count]`. If `new_val > dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1]`, update `dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1] = new_val`.\n11. After filling the `dp` table, retrace the path:\n    Initialize `result = []`, `h_count = 0`, `m_count = 0`.\n    For `i` from `0` to `2n-1`:\n        Current digit `d = digits[i]`.\n        `h_power = n - 1 - h_count`.\n        `m_power = n - 1 - m_count`.\n\n        `h_possible = False`\n        If `h_count < n`:\n            `val_if_h_takes = dp[i][h_count][m_count] + d * powers_of_10[h_power]`\n            If `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] == val_if_h_takes`:\n                `h_possible = True`\n        \n        `m_possible = False`\n        If `m_count < n`:\n            `val_if_m_takes = dp[i][h_count][m_count] + d * powers_of_10[m_power]`\n            If `dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1] == val_if_m_takes`:\n                `m_possible = True`\n        \n        # Determine which move was made to achieve the optimal sum from dp[i][h_count][m_count]\n        # If both are possible, either choice is fine (problem says \"any of them\").\n        # Prioritize 'H' if it leads to the same optimal sum.\n        if h_possible and (not m_possible or dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] >= dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1]):\n            result.append('H')\n            h_count += 1\n        elif m_possible: # Marge must have taken it.\n            result.append('M')\n            m_count += 1\n        # Note: it's guaranteed that exactly one path leads to the optimal value\n        # from the previous state, unless there are multiple optimal solutions.\n        # The check `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] >= dp[i+1][h_count][m_count+1]`\n        # handles the case where both moves lead to the same maximum value for the next state,\n        # ensuring we pick one consistently (e.g., Homer first).\n        # A simpler check is `dp[i+1][h_count+1][m_count] == dp[i][h_count][m_count] + d * powers_of_10[h_power]`\n        # and if true, take H.
