Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's all about minimizing the radius of light from these lanterns to cover an entire street.  Let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, I need to really *understand* the core of the problem. We have a street of length *l* and *n* lanterns positioned at various points *a<sub>i</sub>*. Each lantern shines a radius *d* in both directions. The objective is to calculate the smallest possible value of *d* that ensures the entire street from 0 to *l* is illuminated.\n\nI quickly recognized some important constraints:  the number of lanterns (*n*) is up to 1000, the street length (*l*) can be as large as 10<sup>9</sup>, and each lantern's coordinate *a<sub>i</sub>* falls between 0 and *l*.  The output must be precise up to 10<sup>-9</sup>. These constraints will guide my algorithm.\n\nThe most straightforward initial step seems to be sorting the lantern positions. Sorting the *a<sub>i</sub>* values makes everything more manageable.\n\nNow, to determine the necessary *d*, I'm going to look at the street in terms of coverage. The street from 0 to *l* must be lit. I see that I have to think about how lanterns cover the beginning, the end, and the gaps in between.\n\nTo start, the first lantern's position must be close enough to 0, which gives me one lower bound for *d*. Similarly, the last lantern has to be near *l*, which gives me another. I'll take the maximum of these two values as *d_ends*.\n\nThen there are the gaps *between* the lanterns. I realized that if the illumination from any two adjacent lanterns doesn't touch, that would mean a section of the street would remain dark. I worked out that the radius needed in those gaps is half of the distance between two adjacent lanterns. I will need to calculate this for all gaps and then take the maximum value (*d_gaps*).\n\nFinally, the overall minimum radius *d* would be the greater of these values: *d = max(d_ends, d_gaps)*. That gives me the answer.\n\nI can test my approach using a simple example, say the second sample with `n = 2, l = 5, a = [2, 5]`.\n",
