There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Maximum Games in a Constrained Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this interesting problem about maximizing the games played by the winner in a knockout tournament, but with this unusual rule. Essentially, the constraint is that players can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one. The core challenge is figuring out how this rule shapes the tournament structure and how it impacts the winner's maximum possible game count.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent the number of games played by each player. I'll use `k` for the winner's games. A knockout tournament always has `n-1` games total, which is a useful constraint. The key lies in understanding the dynamics of how players can be paired together given the `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` rule.\n\nI started by tracing the game progression. When the winner, let's call them `W`, begins, they have zero games. Their first opponent must also have zero games, which makes sense. From there, `W` will try to maximize their game count. My initial calculations gave me `f(2)=1` and `f(3)=2` as my base cases.\n\nI need to understand the implications of this rule on the structure of the tournament. In a standard knockout, the number of games played is roughly log base 2 of the number of players, provided they are structured correctly. But here, the constraint makes things different. I am guessing this constraint will impact the standard power of 2 structure. So the key is to determine how the `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` rule changes the typical tournament grid arrangement, and hence the winner's maximum possible games.\n\nI have established a function notation, `f(n)` representing the maximum games for `n` players. I will need to determine how the value of this function relates to other values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `f(n)` be the maximum number of games the winner can play with `n` players.\n\nLet's analyze the number of games played by the winner for small `n`:\n- `n = 2`: There's only one game. The winner plays 1 game. `f(2) = 1`.\n- `n = 3`:\n    - Player 1 (0 games) plays Player 2 (0 games). Player 1 wins. Player 1 has 1 game.\n    - Player 3 has 0 games.\n    - Now, Player 1 (1 game) plays Player 3 (0 games). The difference `abs(1-0) = 1`, which is `<= 1`. This is allowed. Player 1 wins. Player 1 has 2 games.\n    - The winner plays 2 games. `f(3) = 2`.\n- `n = 4`:\n    - Option 1: Player 1 beats Player 2 (1 game). Player 1 has 1 game.\n      Player 1 beats Player 3 (2 games). Player 1 has 2 games.\n      Now Player 1 has 2 games. Player 4 has 0 games. The difference `abs(2-0) = 2`, which is `> 1`. This is NOT allowed. So Player 1 cannot play Player 4 directly. This path leads to a maximum of 2 games for Player 1.\n    - Option 2:\n      Round 1: Player 1 (0 games) vs Player 2 (0 games). Player 1 wins. Player 1 has 1 game.\n      Round 1: Player 3 (0 games) vs Player 4 (0 games). Player 3 wins. Player 3 has 1 game.\n      Round 2: Player 1 (1 game) vs Player 3 (1 game). The difference `abs(1-1) = 0`, which is `<= 1`. This is allowed. Player 1 wins. Player 1 has 2 games.\n    - The winner plays 2 games. `f(4) = 2`.\n\nNotice the pattern:\n`f(2) = 1`\n`f(3) = 2`\n`f(4) = 2`\n\nLet's consider the state of players who have won `k` games. Let `N_k` be the number of players who have won exactly `k` games and are still in the tournament.\nTo maximize the winner's games, the winner should play against opponents who have also played as many games as possible, or at least not too few.\n\nConsider the players who have won `k` games. For them to play their `(k+1)`-th game, they need an opponent.\nIf they play against someone who also won `k` games, both players will have `k+1` games.\nIf they play against someone who won `k-1` games, the winner will have `k+1` games, and the loser will be eliminated. The opponent had `k-1` games. This is allowed (`abs(k - (k-1)) = 1`).\n\nThis problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers.\nLet `F_k` be the `k`-th Fibonacci number, where `F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, F_5 = 5, ...` (or `F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ...` as commonly defined).\nUsing the definition `F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, ...`\nLet `g(k)` be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n- For `k=1`: Winner plays 1 game. Needs 2 players (P1 vs P2). `g(1) = 2`.\n- For `k=2`: Winner plays 2 games.\n    - P1 (0) vs P2 (0) -> P1 (1)\n    - P3 (0)\n    - P1 (1) vs P3 (0) -> P1 (2)\n    - Needs 3 players. `g(2) = 3`.\n- For `k=3`: Winner plays 3 games.\n    - P1 (0) vs P2 (0) -> P1 (1)\n    - P3 (0) vs P4 (0) -> P3 (1)\n    - P5 (0)\n    - P1 (1) vs P3 (1) -> P1 (2) (allowed, `abs(1-1)=0`)\n    - Now, P1 (2) vs P5 (0) is NOT allowed (`abs(2-0)=2`).\n    - To allow P1 (2) to play, P1 needs an opponent with 1 or 2 games.\n    - Let's construct it optimally:\n      The winner plays `k` games.\n      Suppose the winner plays their `i`-th game against an opponent who has played `i-1` games (this is the most \"efficient\" way to get the winner to `i` games, by eliminating players who are \"behind\").\n      The `k`-th game for the winner: The winner has `k-1` games. The opponent must have `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k` games.\n      To maximize `k`, the most efficient way to structure the tournament is that the winner always plays against an opponent who has played `k-1` or `k-2` games.\n      Consider the number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\n      Let `A_k` be the number of players who have played `k` games.\n      Let `B_k` be the number of players who have played `k-1` games.\n      To produce one winner with `k+1` games:\n      - One player from `A_k` plays one player from `A_k`. This consumes 2 players from `A_k` and produces 1 winner with `k+1` games.\n      - One player from `A_k` plays one player from `B_k`. This consumes 1 player from `A_k` and 1 player from `B_k`, and produces 1 winner with `k+1` games.\n      The minimum number of players required to produce a winner with `k` games is `F_{k+2}` (using `F_1=1, F_2=1`).\n      Let's verify:\n      `k=1`: `F_{1+2} = F_3 = 2`. Correct.\n      `k=2`: `F_{2+2} = F_4 = 3`. Correct.\n      `k=3`: `F_{3+2} = F_5 = 5`.\n        - P1(0) vs P2(0) -> P1(1)\n        - P3(0) vs P4(0) -> P3(1)\n        - P1(1) vs P3(1) -> P1(2)\n        - P5(0) vs P6(0) -> P5(1) (This requires 6 players, not 5)\n        - P1(2) vs P5(1) -> P1(3) (Allowed, `abs(2-1)=1`)\n        - This requires 6 players for winner to play 3 games.\n      Let's re-evaluate the Fibonacci sequence mapping.\n      Let `dp[k]` be the minimum number of initial players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\n      `dp[0] = 1` (a player who hasn't played yet)\n      `dp[1] = 2` (P1 vs P2)\n      `dp[2] = 3` (P1(0) vs P2(0) -> P1(1); P1(1) vs P3(0) -> P1(2))\n      To get a winner with `k` games, the winner must have played `k-1` games and won, and then played one more game.\n      The opponent for the `k`-th game could have played `k-1` games or `k-2` games.\n      If the opponent played `k-1` games:\n        The winner needed `dp[k-1]` players to reach `k-1` games.\n        The opponent also needed `dp[k-1]` players to reach `k-1` games.\n        Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1] = 2 * dp[k-1]`.\n      If the opponent played `k-2` games:\n        The winner needed `dp[k-1]` players to reach `k-1` games.\n        The opponent needed `dp[k-2]` players to reach `k-2` games.\n        Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`. This path is more efficient (uses fewer players).\n      So, `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n      This is the Fibonacci sequence.\n      `dp[0] = 1`\n      `dp[1] = 2`\n      `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n      `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`\n      `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n      `dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 8 + 5 = 13`\n      ...\n      This sequence is `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` which corresponds to `F_{i+2}` if we define `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...`.\n      Or `F_{i+1}` if we define `F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, ...`\n      Using the standard definition `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, ...`:\n      `dp[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n      `dp[1] = F_3 = 2`\n      `dp[2] = F_4 = 3`\n      `dp[3] = F_5 = 5`\n      `dp[4] = F_6 = 8`\n      `dp[5] = F_7 = 13`\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nGiven `n` (up to `10^18`), we need to find `k`. We can precompute Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nLet's list Fibonacci numbers:\n`F_0 = 0`\n`F_1 = 1`\n`F_2 = 1`\n`F_3 = 2` (dp[1])\n`F_4 = 3` (dp[2])\n`F_5 = 5` (dp[3])\n`F_6 = 8` (dp[4])\n`F_7 = 13` (dp[5])\n...\n`F_{90}` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`.\n`F_{91}` is approximately `4.66 * 10^18`.\n`F_{92}` is approximately `7.54 * 10^18`.\n`F_{93}` is approximately `1.22 * 10^19`.\nSo, the maximum index `k+2` will be around 92. This means `k` will be around 90.\nWe can iterate and find `k`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F_2`) and `b = 2` (representing `F_3`). This corresponds to `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` if we use `a` for `dp[k-2]` and `b` for `dp[k-1]`.\n   Let `count = 1` (number of games for the winner, corresponding to `b` which is `dp[1]`).\n2. Read `n`.\n3. If `n = 2`, print `1` (special case, or handled by loop).\n4. Loop:\n   While `b <= n`:\n     `temp = a + b` (this is the next Fibonacci number, `dp[count+1]`)\n     `a = b` (update `dp[count-1]` to `dp[count]`)\n     `b = temp` (update `dp[count]` to `dp[count+1]`)\n     `count += 1` (increment number of games)\n5. After the loop, `b` is the first Fibonacci number greater than `n`. The previous `count` value (before `count += 1` made `b` exceed `n`) is the maximum number of games.\n   So, we print `count - 1`.\n\nLet's trace with examples:\n`n = 2`:\n  `a=1, b=2, count=1`\n  `b (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n  `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `b = 3`\n  `count = 2`\n  `b (3) <= n (2)` is false. Loop ends.\n  Print `count - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\n`n = 3`:\n  `a=1, b=2, count=1`\n  `b (2) <= n (3)` is true.\n  `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `b = 3`\n  `count = 2`\n  `b (3) <= n (3)` is true.\n  `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `b = 5`\n  `count = 3`\n  `b (5) <= n (3)` is false. Loop ends.\n  Print `count - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n\n`n = 4`:\n  `a=1, b=2, count=1`\n  `b (2) <= n (4)` is true.\n  `temp = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `b = 3`\n  `count = 2`\n  `b (3) <= n (4)` is true.\n  `temp = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `b = 5`\n  `count = 3`\n  `b (5) <= n (4)` is false. Loop ends.\n  Print `count - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n\n`n = 10`:\n  `a=1, b=2, count=1`\n  `b (2) <= n (10)`: T. `temp=3, a=2, b=3, count=2`\n  `b (3) <= n (10)`: T. `temp=5, a=3, b=5, count=3`\n  `b (5) <= n (10)`: T. `temp=8, a=5, b=8, count=4`\n  `b (8) <= n (10)`: T. `temp=13, a=8, b=13, count=5`\n  `b (13) <= n (10)`: F. Loop ends.\n  Print `count - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. Correct.\n\nThis algorithm works for all given examples and handles large `n` efficiently since the number of Fibonacci numbers to compute is small (around 90).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # dp[k] = minimum number of players for the winner to play k games\n    # dp[0] = 1 (a single player, hasn't played yet)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (P1 vs P2, winner plays 1 game)\n    # dp[2] = 3 (P1(0) vs P2(0) -> P1(1); P1(1) vs P3(0) -> P1(2))\n    # dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2] for k >= 2\n\n    # We are looking for the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n    # Initialize a and b to represent dp[k-2] and dp[k-1] respectively.\n    # Let's map a to dp[current_games - 1] and b to dp[current_games].\n    # Start with current_games = 1.\n    # dp[0] is not directly used in the loop, but dp[1] = 2 and dp[0]=1.\n    # So, we can start with a = dp[0] = 1, b = dp[1] = 2.\n    # The 'count' variable will track the number of games played by the winner.\n    \n    a = 1  # Represents dp[k-2]\n    b = 2  # Represents dp[k-1], for which winner plays 'games_count' games\n    games_count = 1 # Number of games winner plays if using 'b' players\n\n    # If n is 2, the winner plays 1 game.\n    # Our loop will correctly handle n=2:\n    # a=1, b=2, games_count=1\n    # Loop: b (2) <= n (2) is True\n    #   temp = 1+2 = 3\n    #   a = 2\n    #   b = 3\n    #   games_count = 2\n    # Loop: b (3) <= n (2) is False.
