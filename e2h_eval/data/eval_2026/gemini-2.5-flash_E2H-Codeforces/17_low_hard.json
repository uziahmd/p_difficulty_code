He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and the first thing that jumps out is the structure. We're given a set of strings that are all prefixes and suffixes of some hidden string. The length of the prefixes and suffixes varies, but the key is that for each length, we have exactly one prefix and one suffix. That constraint is the crux.\n\nI immediately start thinking about how to exploit the relationships between these prefixes and suffixes.  If we know a prefix of length *k* and a suffix of length *k*, they must be related in a specific way within the unknown, larger string.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the longest prefix and suffix (length *n-1*) are particularly important.  Knowing those two allows us to essentially reconstruct the whole string.  Let's call them P and S.  P looks like the beginning of *s* and S looks like the end of *s*.  If we know P and S, we can figure out the first and last characters of *s*.\n\nThe critical relationship is this: if we append the last character of S to P, or prepend the first character of P to S, we should get the same full string *s*. This implies that most of the characters must overlap between P and S. This overlap is key.  The overlapping part is *s_2...s_{n-1}*.  The string *s* is `s_1s_2...s_{n-1}s_n`.\n\nIn other words, the core of this seems to be about matching up the parts of the given strings.  I have to determine which pair of strings of length *n-1* are the prefix and suffix and use this relationship to determine the hidden string. The others can be determined afterwards using this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length `k` and the other is the suffix of length `k`.\n\nLet the unknown string be `s = s_1s_2...s_n`.\nThe prefix of length `k` is `P_k = s_1...s_k`.\nThe suffix of length `k` is `S_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n`.\n\nA crucial observation is related to the strings of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\nOne of them must be `P_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1}` and the other must be `S_{n-1} = s_2...s_n`.\n\nThis gives us two possibilities for assigning `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`:\n\n**Possibility 1:** `str1` is `P_{n-1}` and `str2` is `S_{n-1}`.\nIn this case, the full string `s` can be reconstructed in two ways:\n1. `s = str1 + str2[-1]` (i.e., `s_1...s_{n-1}` followed by `s_n`)\n2. `s = str1[0] + str2` (i.e., `s_1` followed by `s_2...s_n`)\nFor this assignment to be valid, these two reconstructions must yield the same string. That is, `str1 + str2[-1]` must be equal to `str1[0] + str2`. This implies two conditions:\n   a. `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. (This means `s_2...s_{n-1}` must match.)\n   b. If condition (a) holds, then `s` is uniquely determined as `str1[0] + str2`.\n\n**Possibility 2:** `str2` is `P_{n-1}` and `str1` is `S_{n-1}`.\nSimilarly, `s` would be `str2 + str1[-1]` and `str2[0] + str1`. For this to be valid:\n   a. `str2[1:]` must be equal to `str1[:-1]`.\n   b. If condition (a) holds, then `s` is uniquely determined as `str2[0] + str1`.\n\nAt least one of these possibilities must be valid according to the problem statement. If both are valid, either one can be used.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Store the `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices. It's helpful to group them by length.\n2.  **Identify `n-1` length strings:** Find the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `candidate_P_n_minus_1` and `candidate_S_n_minus_1`. These are the two strings we will test as `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`.\n3.  **Test Possibility 1:**\n    *   Let `P_candidate = candidate_P_n_minus_1` and `S_candidate = candidate_S_n_minus_1`.\n    *   Check if `P_candidate[1:] == S_candidate[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, reconstruct `s = P_candidate[0] + S_candidate`. This is our potential `s`.\n    *   Then, verify if all other `2n-4` strings (excluding `P_candidate` and `S_candidate`) can be formed as prefixes or suffixes of this `s`.\n        *   For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n            *   The true prefix is `s[:k]`.\n            *   The true suffix is `s[n-k:]`.\n        *   We need to check if for every `k`, the two strings of length `k` in the input are exactly `s[:k]` and `s[n-k:]`.\n        *   A robust way to do this is to count occurrences:\n            *   Create a multiset (or frequency map) of all `2n-2` input strings.\n            *   For `s` derived from `P_candidate` and `S_candidate`, generate all its expected prefixes (`s[:k]` for `k=1..n-1`) and suffixes (`s[n-k:]` for `k=1..n-1`).\n            *   Create a multiset of these expected strings.\n            *   If the two multisets are identical, then this `s` is valid.\n    *   If valid, we found our answer! Construct the output string. The string `P_candidate` is a 'P', `S_candidate` is an 'S'. For all other strings, we check if they match `s[:k]` (then 'P') or `s[n-k:]` (then 'S'). If a string of length `k` matches `s[:k]` and *not* `s[n-k:]`, it's 'P'. If it matches `s[n-k:]` and *not* `s[:k]`, it's 'S'. If `s[:k] == s[n-k:]` (palindrome), then both strings of length `k` are identical, and we can assign one 'P' and one 'S' arbitrarily. The problem states \"The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'\", which is `n-1` each.\n\n4.  **Test Possibility 2:** If Possibility 1 didn't yield a valid `s`, try the other assignment: `P_candidate = candidate_S_n_minus_1` and `S_candidate = candidate_P_n_minus_1`. Repeat the verification process.\n\n**Detailed Output Construction:**\n\nOnce a valid `s` is found:\nInitialize `result = [''] * (2n-2)`.\nCreate a boolean array `used_for_prefix = [False] * (2n-2)` to handle cases where `s[:k] == s[n-k:]` (palindromic substrings).\n\nIterate through the original input strings with their indices `i` and string value `current_str`:\n*   If `current_str == s[:len(current_str)]` and `not used_for_prefix[i]`:\n    *   `result[i] = 'P'`\n    *   `used_for_prefix[i] = True`\n*   Else (it must be a suffix, or it's a prefix of a palindromic pair already assigned 'P'):\n    *   `result[i] = 'S'`\n\nThis logic works because for each length `k`, there are two strings.\nIf `s[:k]` is different from `s[n-k:]`: one string will match `s[:k]` and the other `s[n-k:]`. The first `if` condition correctly identifies the prefix. The `else` then correctly identifies the suffix.\nIf `s[:k]` is equal to `s[n-k:]`: both input strings of length `k` will be identical and equal to `s[:k]`. The first time we encounter such a string (say, at index `j`), `used_for_prefix[j]` is `False`, so it becomes 'P'. The second time we encounter it (say, at index `m`), `used_for_prefix[m]` is `False`, it also becomes 'P'. This is wrong as we need `n-1` 'P's and `n-1` 'S's.\n\nA better way to construct the output string:\n1.  Find the valid `s`.\n2.  Initialize `ans = [''] * (2n-2)`.\n3.  Create two lists: `expected_prefixes = [s[:k] for k in range(1, n)]` and `expected_suffixes = [s[n-k:] for k in range(1, n)]`.\n4.  Iterate through the `2n-2` input strings with their original indices `i` and string `val`.\n    *   If `val` is in `expected_prefixes` and `val` is not in `expected_suffixes` (unique prefix): `ans[i] = 'P'`. Remove `val` from `expected_prefixes` to mark it as used.\n    *   If `val` is in `expected_suffixes` and `val` is not in `expected_prefixes` (unique suffix): `ans[i] = 'S'`. Remove `val` from `expected_suffixes` to mark it as used.\n    *   If `val` is in both `expected_prefixes` and `expected_suffixes` (palindromic substring, `s[:k] == s[n-k:]`):\n        *   This means there are two identical strings of length `k` in the input. One should be 'P', one 'S'.\n        *   If `val` is still in `expected_prefixes`: `ans[i] = 'P'`. Remove `val` from `expected_prefixes`.\n        *   Else (it must be in `expected_suffixes`): `ans[i] = 'S'`. Remove `val` from `expected_suffixes`.\n\nThis approach ensures `n-1` 'P's and `n-1` 'S's. The `remove` operations should be careful (e.g., using `list.remove()` only removes the first occurrence). It's safer to use counts or copy lists and remove elements.\n\nLet's refine the output construction using counts:\n1.  Find the valid `s`.\n2.  Initialize `ans = [''] * (2n-2)`.\n3.  Keep track of how many prefixes and suffixes of each length we've assigned.\n    `prefix_assigned_count = [0] * n` (index `k` for length `k`)\n    `suffix_assigned_count = [0] * n`\n4.  Iterate through the original input strings with their indices `i` and string `val`.\n    Let `k = len(val)`.\n    If `val == s[:k]` and `prefix_assigned_count[k] < 1`:\n        `ans[i] = 'P'`\n        `prefix_assigned_count[k] += 1`\n    Else:\n        `ans[i] = 'S'`\n        `suffix_assigned_count[k] += 1`\nThis simple approach works because `prefix_assigned_count[k]` will be 0 for the first string of length `k` that matches `s[:k]`. If it's `s[:k]` and `s[n-k:]` are different, the other string of length `k` won't match `s[:k]`, so it will correctly be assigned 'S'. If `s[:k]` and `s[n-k:]` are the same, both strings of length `k` will match `s[:k]`. The first one encountered gets 'P', the `prefix_assigned_count[k]` becomes 1. The second one encountered will then go to the `else` branch and get 'S'. This correctly assigns one 'P' and one 'S' for palindromic substrings.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (with original indices):\n`[(0, 'ba'), (1, 'a'), (2, 'abab'), (3, 'a'), (4, 'aba'), (5, 'baba'), (6, 'ab'), (7, 'aba')]`\n\nStrings of length `n-1 = 4`: `(2, 'abab')` and `(5, 'baba')`.\nLet `str1 = 'abab'` (from index 2), `str2 = 'baba'` (from index 5).\n\n**Possibility 1:** `P_candidate = 'abab'`, `S_candidate = 'baba'`.\nCheck `P_candidate[1:] == S_candidate[:-1]`: `'bab' == 'bab'`. True.\nReconstruct `s = P_candidate[0] + S_candidate = 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa'`.\n\nVerify `s = 'ababa'`:\nExpected Prefixes: `a`, `ab`, `aba`, `abab`\nExpected Suffixes: `a`, `ba`, `aba`, `baba`\n\nLet's check input strings against these:\n`k=1`: Input: `(1, 'a')`, `(3, 'a')`. Expected: `s[:1]='a'`, `s[4:]='a'`. Both are `a`.\n`k=2`: Input: `(0, 'ba')`, `(6, 'ab')`. Expected: `s[:2]='ab'`, `s[3:]='ba'`.\n`k=3`: Input: `(4, 'aba')`, `(7, 'aba')`. Expected: `s[:3]='aba'`, `s[2:]='aba'`. Both are `aba`.\n`k=4`: Input: `(2, 'abab')`, `(5, 'baba')`. Expected: `s[:4]='abab'`, `s[1:]='baba'`.\n\nAll expected prefixes/suffixes are present in the input. So `s = 'ababa'` is valid.\nNow construct the output string:\n`ans = [''] * 8`\n`prefix_assigned_count = [0,0,0,0,0]`\n`suffix_assigned_count = [0,0,0,0,0]`\n\n1.  `(0, 'ba')`, `k=2`. `val='ba'`. `s[:2]='ab'`. Not 'P'.\n    `ans[0] = 'S'`. `suffix_assigned_count[2]=1`.\n2.  `(1, 'a')`, `k=1`. `val='a'`. `s[:1]='a'`. Is 'P'. `prefix_assigned_count[1]=0`.\n    `ans[1] = 'P'`. `prefix_assigned_count[1]=1`.\n3.  `(2, 'abab')`, `k=4`. `val='abab'`. `s[:4]='abab'`. Is 'P'. `prefix_assigned_count[4]=0`.\n    `ans[2] = 'P'`. `prefix_assigned_count[4]=1`.\n4.  `(3, 'a')`, `k=1`. `val='a'`. `s[:1]='a'`. Is 'P', but `prefix_assigned_count[1]=1`. So not 'P' for this one.\n    `ans[3] = 'S'`. `suffix_assigned_count[1]=1`.\n5.  `(4, 'aba')`, `k=3`. `val='aba'`. `s[:3]='aba'`. Is 'P'. `prefix_assigned_count[3]=0`.\n    `ans[4] = 'P'`. `prefix_assigned_count[3]=1`.\n6.  `(5, 'baba')`, `k=4`. `val='baba'`. `s[:4]='abab'`. Not 'P'.\n    `ans[5] = 'S'`. `suffix_assigned_count[4]=1`.\n7.  `(6, 'ab')`, `k=2`. `val='ab'`. `s[:2]='ab'`. Is 'P'. `prefix_assigned_count[2]=0`.\n    `ans[6] = 'P'`. `prefix_assigned_count[2]=1`.\n8.  `(7, 'aba')`, `k=3`. `val='aba'`. `s[:3]='aba'`. Is 'P', but `prefix_assigned_count[3]=1`. So not 'P' for this one.\n    `ans[7] = 'S'`. `suffix_assigned_count[3]=1`.\n\nFinal `ans`: `['S', 'P', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S']` which is `SPPSPSPS`.
