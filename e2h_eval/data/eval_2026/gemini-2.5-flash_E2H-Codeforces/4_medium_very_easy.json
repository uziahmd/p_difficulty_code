The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Plan to Conquer the Rock-Paper-Scissors Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got a competitive programming problem where two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, are locked in a Rock-Paper-Scissors battle for `n` rounds. Each player has a repeating strategy, defined by sequences `A` (for Nikephoros, length `m`) and `B` (for Polycarpus, length `k`). Our goal? Determine the total number of losses (red spots) for each player.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to efficiently simulate this, since directly running through `n` rounds (up to 2 billion!) would be a disaster. The key insight is that both players' moves cycle. Nikephoros repeats his `m`-length sequence, and Polycarpus repeats his `k`-length sequence. This creates a combined cyclic pattern, repeating every `LCM(m, k)` rounds.  `LCM(m,k)` will be <=10^6 because `m` and `k` are <= 1000.  This is much more manageable.\n\nMy strategy:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Cycle:** I'll determine the least common multiple (`LCM`) of `m` and `k`.  This represents the length of the repeating pattern, calculated as `(m * k) // GCD(m, k)`.  `GCD` is readily available via the `math` module in Python.\n\n2.  **Simulate One Cycle:** I'll simulate one full cycle of `LCM(m, k)` rounds. For each round within this cycle, I'll figure out what Nikephoros and Polycarpus play and determine the winner using a helper function called `get_round_result` which is going to be a dictionary lookup for speed (or if it's super fast, just an `if/elif` chain). I'll increment the respective loss counters (`nikephoros_losses_in_cycle` and `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`) within the cycle.\n\n3.  **Handle Full Cycles and Remainders:** After calculating losses for one complete cycle, I'll calculate `num_cycles = n // cycle_len` and `remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len`. The total losses for both players are `num_cycles * losses_in_cycle` for each player. Then, I'll simulate the `remaining_rounds` individually.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Finally, I'll add the losses from the remaining rounds to the totals. The final losses will be outputted.\n\nThe `get_round_result` function needs to correctly determine the winner of a single round. For this, I'm going to create a dictionary or use an `if/elif` chain to map the choices: Rock (R) beats Scissors (S), Scissors (S) beats Paper (P), and Paper (P) beats Rock (R).\n\nThis approach provides the optimal time complexity (`O(LCM(m,k))`), ensuring the solution executes swiftly even with the large input constraint of `n`. Space complexity will be around `O(m + k)` for storing sequence A and B. I'm confident in this strategy.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses (red spots) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both players use a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros repeats a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus repeats a sequence `B` of length `k`. The number of rounds `n` can be very large (`2 * 10^9`), while `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to `1000`).\n\nA direct simulation of `n` rounds would be too slow. We need to leverage the cyclic nature of the players' strategies.\n\n**Understanding the Cyclic Pattern:**\nNikephoros's choices repeat every `m` rounds.\nPolycarpus's choices repeat every `k` rounds.\nTherefore, the combined state of choices `(Nikephoros's choice, Polycarpus's choice)` will repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `LCM` is the Least Common Multiple.\nThe `LCM(m, k)` can be calculated as `(m * k) // GCD(m, k)`, where `GCD` is the Greatest Common Divisor.\nSince `m, k <= 1000`, `LCM(m, k)` will be at most `1000 * 1000 = 10^6`. This cycle length is small enough to simulate.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Get `n`, sequence `A`, and sequence `B`.\n2.  **Calculate Cycle Length:**\n    *   Determine `m = len(A)` and `k = len(B)`.\n    *   Calculate `common_divisor = math.gcd(m, k)`.\n    *   Calculate `cycle_len = (m * k) // common_divisor`.\n3.  **Simulate One Full Cycle:**\n    *   Initialize `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0` and `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `cycle_len - 1` (representing rounds `1` to `cycle_len`):\n        *   Nikephoros's choice for round `i+1` is `A[i % m]`.\n        *   Polycarpus's choice for round `i+1` is `B[i % k]`.\n        *   Determine the winner of the round using the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n            *   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n            *   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n            *   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n            *   Same choices result in a draw.\n        *   If Nikephoros wins, increment `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`.\n        *   If Polycarpus wins, increment `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`.\n4.  **Calculate Losses for Full Cycles:**\n    *   Determine how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds: `num_full_cycles = n // cycle_len`.\n    *   Initialize `total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`.\n    *   Initialize `total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`.\n5.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:**\n    *   Determine the number of remaining rounds: `remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`:\n        *   Get choices `A[i % m]` and `B[i % k]`.\n        *   Determine the winner for this round.\n        *   Update `total_nikephoros_losses` or `total_polycarpus_losses` accordingly.\n6.  **Print Results:** Output `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"` (`m=3`), `B = \"RSPP\"` (`k=4`)\n\n1.  `m=3, k=4`. `GCD(3,4) = 1`. `cycle_len = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`.\n2.  Simulate one cycle (rounds 0 to 11, 0-indexed):\n    *   `i=0`: A[0]='R', B[0]='R'. Draw.\n    *   `i=1`: A[1]='P', B[1]='S'. S beats P. Nikephoros loses. `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 1`.\n    *   `i=2`: A[2]='S', B[2]='P'. S beats P. Polycarpus loses. `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 1`.\n    *   `i=3`: A[0]='R', B[3]='P'. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 2`.\n    *   `i=4`: A[1]='P', B[0]='R'. P beats R. Polycarpus loses. `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 2`.\n    *   `i=5`: A[2]='S', B[1]='S'.

Nikephoros loses. `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 4`.\n    *   `i=9`: A[0]='R', B[1]='S'. R beats S. Polycarpus loses. `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 3`.\n    *   `i=10`: A[1]='P', B[2]='P'. Draw.\n    *   `i=11`: A[2]='S', B[3]='P'. S beats P. Polycarpus loses. `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 4`.\n    After full cycle: `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 4`, `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 4`.\n3.  `num_full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0`.\n    `total_nikephoros_losses = 0 * 4 = 0`.\n    `total_polycarpus_losses = 0 * 4 = 0`.\n4.  `remaining_rounds = 7 % 12 = 7`. Simulate first 7 rounds:\n    *   `i=0`: A[0]='R', B[0]='R'. Draw.\n    *   `i=1`: A[1]='P', B[1]='S'. Nikephoros loses. `total_nikephoros_losses = 1`.\n    *   `i=2`: A[2]='S', B[2]='P'. Polycarpus loses. `total_polycarpus_losses = 1`.\n    *   `i=3`: A[0]='R', B[3]='P'. Nikephoros loses. `total_nikephoros_losses = 2`.\n    *   `i=4`: A[1]='P', B[0]='R'. Polycarpus loses. `total_polycarpus_losses = 2`.\n    *   `i=5`: A[2]='S', B[1]='S'. Draw.\n    *   `i=6`: A[0]='R', B[2]='P'. Nikephoros loses. `total_nikephoros_losses = 3`.\n5.  Final result: `3 2`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the large `n` by reducing the problem to calculations over a much smaller cycle length.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the winning rules: key beats value\n# For example, 'R' (Rock) beats 'S' (Scissors)\nWINNING_MOVES = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\ndef get_round_result(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the outcome of a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n    Returns:\n    - 0 if it's a draw\n    - 1 if Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n    - -1 if Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n    \"\"\"\n    if nikephoros_choice == polycarpus_choice:\n        return 0  # Draw\n    \n    # Check if Nikephoros's choice beats Polycarpus's choice\n    if WINNING_MOVES[nikephoros_choice] == polycarpus_choice:\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins\n    else:\n        return -1 # Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input() # Nikephoros's sequence\n    B = input() # Polycarpus's sequence\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate the length of the cycle for both players' moves.\n    # The pattern of (Nikephoros's move, Polycarpus's move) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m, k)\n    cycle_len = (m * k) // common_divisor\n\n    nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0\n    polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0\n\n    # Simulate one full cycle to count losses within that cycle\n    for i in range(cycle_len):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n        \n        result = get_round_result(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        if result == 1: # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_losses_in_cycle += 1\n        elif result == -1: # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_losses_in_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Calculate initial total losses based on the number of full cycles\n    num_full_cycles = n // cycle_len\n    total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle\n    total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle\n\n    # Simulate the remaining rounds (which are less than one full cycle)\n    remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n\n        result = get_round_result(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        if result == 1: # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_polycarpus_losses += 1\n        elif result == -1: # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_nikephoros_losses += 1\n\n    # Print the final total losses for both players\n    print(total_nikephoros_losses, total_polycarpus_losses)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
