The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is calculating losses, and I need to do it efficiently.  Simulating every single round – given that *n* can be up to 2 billion – is a complete non-starter.  I need to find a more elegant solution.\n\nFirst, I break down the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. Draws are draws.  The sequences of the players, Nikephoros (N) and Polycarpus (P), are the key here.  N uses sequence *A* cyclically, and P uses sequence *B* cyclically. That's my big hint. I need to take advantage of these repeating patterns.\n\nThe input is *n*, the number of rounds, and strings *A* and *B*, representing the players' moves. The output will be the number of losses for each player. Constraints reveal that *n* is massive, but *A* and *B* are relatively small, which is key.\n\nMy focus immediately shifts to the cyclic nature of the players' moves. The combination of N's and P's moves will form a repeating cycle.  N's sequence repeats every *m* rounds, P's repeats every *k* rounds.  The combined pattern will repeat at the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of *m* and *k*.  LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k). The GCD, or Greatest Common Divisor, is easily found.\n\nSince *m* and *k* are at most 1000, the worst-case scenario for LCM is around a million, which is within a reasonable range for a single cycle simulation.  That's my breakthrough.\n\nMy algorithm will proceed like this:\n\n1.  **Calculate GCD and LCM**:  Use the Euclidean algorithm for GCD and then calculate the LCM.\n2.  **Simulate one cycle**:  I'll iterate through one cycle of length LCM(m,k), which is a manageable number. I'll determine the winner/loser in each round within that cycle and keep a running count of Nikephoros's losses (`n_losses_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`p_losses_cycle`).\n3.  **Compute total losses for n rounds**: I'll determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (*n*) and compute the losses for complete cycles. There will be a remainder.  I'll compute losses for this small remainder. Finally, I sum the losses.\n\nThis approach gives me a time complexity of O(LCM(m,k)), which is significantly faster than O(n). This is the efficient approach.\n",
