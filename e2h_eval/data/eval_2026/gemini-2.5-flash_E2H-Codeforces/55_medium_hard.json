    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a string and a set of rules for swapping characters, and my goal is to figure out the lexicographically smallest string I can make. My initial thought process is to break down the rules and understand the constraints.\n\nI see that '0' can swap with '1', and '1' can swap with '2', but '0' and '2' can't swap directly.  This suggests there's a fixed order relationship between '0's and '2's.  If I have \"0...2\", it will never become \"2...0\". This is key! This means I can separate this problem to two parts: the relative order of zeros and twos must be maintained. And then I can position the \"ones\" optimally.\n\nNow, how to make it *smallest*? Well, lexicographically smallest means as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then '1's, then '2's.  '0's can move past '1's; '2's can move past '1's. This means '0's and '2's will have a fixed *relative* order with respect to each other.\n\nThe '1's are interesting: they're like mediators. They can move past '0's and '2's, so they can effectively be grouped.  I realize I can just \"remove\" all the '1's, process what's left, and then insert the '1's.\n\nSo the strategy:\n1. Count the number of '1's.\n2. Remove all '1's. Now I have a string containing only '0's and '2's, which I'll call `s_02`.\n3. The order of '0's and '2's in `s_02` *must* be preserved.\n4. I want to insert the '1's to make the smallest string. I realize that the optimal position to add 1s is after all the zeros and before the first two. Or after all zeros if there are not any twos.\n\nIn the implementation, I'm thinking about efficiency. Using a list of characters and then joining is better than repeated string concatenation. Also keeping the code simple and readable is important.\n\nSo I iterate through the original string, keeping track of the '1' count and building the `s_02` string (or a character list). I then find the index of the first '2' in `s_02`.  Finally, I construct the result by placing all the '0's before the first '2', then adding the '1's, then adding the rest of the '0's and '2's.\n\nThe time and space complexity look good ($O(N)$), so it seems I've got a solid solution.  I have also tested the boundary cases that the string is composed of only 0s, only 1s or only 2s.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1' in either direction.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2' in either direction.\n\nWhat about '0' and '2'?\nIf we have a '0' and a '2' in the string, say `...0...2...`, can the '0' move to the right of the '2', or the '2' move to the left of the '0'?\nFor them to swap positions, they would need to become adjacent, e.g., \"02\", and then swap to \"20\". However, \"02\" <-> \"20\" is explicitly disallowed.\nThis means that the relative order of any specific '0' and any specific '2' in the string is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that same '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must remain so.\n\nThis is a crucial observation. It implies that if we remove all '1's from the original string, the remaining subsequence of '0's and '2's will always appear in the same relative order in any reachable string.\n\nNow, let's consider the '1's. A '1' can move past a '0' and a '1' can move past a '2'. This effectively means that '1's are \"flexible\" characters. All '1's can be grouped together, and this group of '1's can be moved to any position relative to the fixed sequence of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to:\n1. Place as many '0's as possible at the beginning.\n2. Then, place as many '1's as possible.\n3. Then, place as many '2's as possible.\n\nCombining these ideas:\n1. First, count all the '1's in the input string. Let this be `ones_count`.\n2. Create a new sequence (or list of characters) containing all '0's and '2's from the input string, preserving their original relative order. Let's call this `s_02_chars`.\n   For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `ones_count = 2`, and `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n3. Now we need to insert the `ones_count` '1's into `s_02_chars`. To make the resulting string lexicographically smallest, we should insert the '1's after all '0's that can precede them, and before all '2's that must follow them.\n   Specifically, we should find the first '2' in `s_02_chars`. All '0's before this first '2' can and should precede the '1's. All '2's (and any '0's that follow them, due to the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's) must come after the '1's.\n   Therefore, the optimal position to insert all the '1's is right before the first '2' in `s_02_chars`.\n   If `s_02_chars` contains no '2's (e.g., \"000\"), then all '1's should be appended at the very end of `s_02_chars`. This is consistent with inserting before the \"first '2'\" if that index is considered to be `len(s_02_chars)`.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `ones_count = 2`.\n2. `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_02_chars`. It's at index 2 (`s_02_chars[2]` is '2').\n4. The result string will be formed by:\n   - The prefix of `s_02_chars` before index 2: `['0', '0']`\n   - All the '1's: `['1', '1']`\n   - The suffix of `s_02_chars` from index 2 onwards: `['2', '0']`\n   Concatenating these gives `['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`.\n5. Joining these characters yields the final string: `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis strategy ensures that:\n- All '0's that appear before any '2' in the original '0'/'2' subsequence are placed first.\n- All '1's are grouped together and placed after these initial '0's.\n- All '2's (and any '0's that appear after them in the original '0'/'2' subsequence) are placed after the '1's.\nThis arrangement produces the lexicographically smallest string possible under the given constraints.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `ones_count = 0`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `s_02_chars` to store characters '0' and '2'.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`:\n   - If the character is '1', increment `ones_count`.\n   - Otherwise (if it's '0' or '2'), append it to `s_02_chars`.\n4. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s_02_chars`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n   - If '2' is not found, set `first_two_idx` to `len(s_02_chars)`.\n5. Construct the final string by:\n   - Taking the slice `s_02_chars[:first_two_idx]`.\n   - Appending `ones_count` '1's.\n   - Appending the slice `s_02_chars[first_two_idx:]`.\n6. Join the resulting list of characters into a string and print it.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n- Iterating through the input string to count '1's and build `s_02_chars`: O(N), where N is the length of `s`.\n- Finding `first_two_idx`: O(N) in the worst case (if '2' is at the end or not present).\n- List slicing and concatenation: O(N).\n- Joining characters to form the final string: O(N).\nTotal time complexity: O(N).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- `s_02_chars` list: O(N) in the worst case (if no '1's).\n- `result_chars` list: O(N).\nTotal space complexity: O(N).\n\nGiven N up to $10^5$, this solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    ones_count = 0\n    s_02_chars = []\n\n    # Separate '1's from '0's and '2's, preserving relative order of '0's and '2's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            ones_count += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be placed after all '0's that appear before any '2'\n    # and before any '2's.\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(s_02_chars):\n        if char == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    # If no '2' is found in s_02_chars, all '1's should be appended at the end.\n    # This is handled by setting first_two_idx to the length of the list.\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        first_two_idx = len(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Construct the result string by inserting '1's at the determined position\n    result_chars = []\n    # Add the '0's that come before the first '2'\n    result_chars.extend(s_02_chars[:first_two_idx])\n    # Add all the '1's\n    result_chars.extend(['1'] * ones_count)\n    # Add the rest of the '0's and '2's\n    result_chars.extend(s_02_chars[first_two_idx:])\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
