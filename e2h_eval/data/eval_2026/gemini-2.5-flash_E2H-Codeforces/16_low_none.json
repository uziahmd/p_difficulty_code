Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down \"Crazy Town\" - A Mental Walkthrough**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and I need a Python script to crack it. Let's think this through. The input seems straightforward: home and university coordinates, and a list of roads defined as linear equations. The core of it all is understanding how these roads partition the plane, which is classic computational geometry.\n\nThe goal is the minimal number of \"steps,\" meaning crossing roads to get from home to university. If they're in the same region, steps is zero; otherwise, it's the number of roads we must cross. No problem.\n\nNow, how do I determine if two points are on the *same side* of a road, or *opposite sides*? Simple: for a line `ax + by + c = 0`, plug in a point `(x, y)` to get `ax + by + c`. The sign of the result gives you the side. Same sign on both points means same side; different signs mean different sides. This is key to determining if a step across the road is needed.\n\nEssentially, I can go through each road equation. I plug in home and university coordinates, get the values, and check the sign comparison. If the signs are different, increment the \"steps\" counter. That gives me the answer. This is a very elegant solution, no fancy algorithms required. This is pretty much exactly the approach I'd take.\n",
