For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "**Analyzing a Competitive Programming Problem: Counting Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's got me thinking. The core is about counting the ways to select integer values, *c<sub>s</sub>*, for all binary strings, *s*, with lengths from 1 up to *n*. These *c<sub>s</sub>* values have to be between 0 and *k*. The ultimate goal? To find the number of configurations where the *maximum* size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly *f*.\n\nA \"beautiful multiset\" is defined by this prefix constraint: For any binary string, *s*, of any length from 1 to *n*, the number of strings in the multiset that have *s* as a prefix cannot exceed *c<sub>s</sub>*.\n\nMy mind immediately starts forming a conceptual binary trie. It's the natural structure for dealing with binary strings and prefixes. Each node represents a string: the root is the empty string, nodes at depth *L* are strings of length *L*. We've got internal nodes and leaves; the leaves are the strings of length *n*. The strings we can place in our multiset.\n\nNow, let *M* be our multiset, and *N(s)* the count of strings in *M* with *s* as a prefix. To be \"beautiful,\" *N(s)* must be less than or equal to *c<sub>s</sub>* for all *s*.\n\nMy brain's next question: what's the maximum possible size of this beautiful multiset, let's call it *S<sub>max</sub>*? This seems key. Since each string, *s*, of length less than *n* is the parent of its concatenation with 0 (*s0*) and 1 (*s1*), we have *N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)*. This also holds, essentially, for the empty string too, as *N(empty_string) = N(0) + N(1)* and the total size of the multiset is the total count of strings which is equal to *N(empty_string)*.\n\nIf we look at the trie again, let's represent each node by *u* and the string it represents by *s<sub>u</sub>*. Now, let *x<sub>u</sub>* be the number of strings with *s<sub>u</sub>* as a prefix. For internal nodes, the count is the sum of the child counts. At the leaves, *x<sub>u</sub>* is just the string count in *M*. This looks like a useful reformulation.\n\nThe relationships between the *x<sub>u</sub>* values and the *c<sub>s</sub>* values have to determine the \"beauty\" of the multiset. This looks like a dynamic programming problem in disguise, but I need to figure out how to efficiently calculate the valid configurations, given the constraint on the *f* parameter.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the chosen $c_s$ values.\nLet $S$ be a multiset of binary strings of length $n$. For any string $s$ of length $1 \\le |s| \\le n$, let $N(s)$ be the number of strings in $S$ that have $s$ as a prefix.\nA multiset $S$ is beautiful if $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$ with $1 \\le |s| \\le n$.\nWe want to maximize $\\sum_{|s|=n} N(s)$, which is the total size of $S$.\n\nConsider the binary trie where nodes represent binary strings. A node $u$ at depth $d$ represents a string $s_u$ of length $d$.\nFor any internal node $u$ (representing $s_u$ with $|s_u| < n$), the count $N(s_u)$ is the sum of counts for its children: $N(s_u) = N(s_u0) + N(s_u1)$.\nFor leaf nodes $u$ (representing $s_u$ with $|s_u| = n$), $N(s_u)$ is the number of times $s_u$ appears in the multiset.\nThe conditions are $N(s_u) \\le c_{s_u}$ for all $1 \\le |s_u| \\le n$.\n\nTo maximize the total size, we want to maximize $N(s_u)$ for all $s_u$. This can be done greedily from the leaves up.\nFor each string $s$ of length $n$, we can choose $N(s) = c_s$.\nThen, for a string $s$ of length $n-1$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1) = c_{s0} + c_{s1}$. This must satisfy $N(s) \\le c_s$. So, we are limited by $c_s$. Thus, $N(s) = \\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1})$.\nGeneralizing this, for any string $s$ of length $L < n$:\n$N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$.\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is $N(\\text{empty string})$, if we define $N(\\text{empty string})$ as the sum of counts for strings of length $n$. Since $c_s$ is only defined for $1 \\le |s| \\le n$, we define the maximum size as $N_{max} = N(0) + N(1)$.\nHere, $N(0)$ is the maximum count for strings starting with '0', and $N(1)$ is the maximum count for strings starting with '1'.\nEach $N(s)$ value depends only on $c_t$ values for strings $t$ that are prefixes of $s$ or extensions of $s$ (i.e., $s$ is a prefix of $t$).\nThe calculation of $N(s)$ can be viewed as a dynamic programming process on the trie.\nLet $dp(s)$ be the maximum possible count $N(s)$ given the $c_t$ values for $t$ that are $s$ or extensions of $s$.\nFor $|s|=n$, $dp(s) = c_s$.\nFor $|s|<n$, $dp(s) = \\min(c_s, dp(s0) + dp(s1))$.\nThe total maximum size is $dp(\\text{root}) = dp(0) + dp(1)$.\n\nNotice that all subtrees rooted at strings of the same length are isomorphic. For example, the subtree rooted at '0' is structurally identical to the subtree rooted at '1'. The choices for $c_s$ are independent for different $s$.\nThis suggests that we can use dynamic programming on the length of the strings.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $i$ to $n$ such that the maximum total count for strings in the subtree rooted at $s$ is $j$.\nThis DP state is for a single string $s$ of length $i$. Since there are $2^i$ such strings, and the choices for $c_s$ are independent, we can compute this for one such string and then combine.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ values for all strings $t$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s$ of length $i$ (including $s$ itself), such that the maximum possible count $N(s)$ for this subtree is exactly $j$.\nThe base case is for $i=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s) = c_s$. We need $N(s)=j$, so $c_s=j$. Since $0 \\le c_s \\le k$, there is 1 way if $0 \\le j \\le k$, and 0 ways otherwise.\nSo, $dp[n][j] = 1$ for $0 \\le j \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor $i < n$:\n$dp[i][j]$ is calculated based on $dp[i+1][\\cdot]$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $i$, $N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$.\nLet $N(s0)$ be $j_0$ and $N(s1)$ be $j_1$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $N(s0)=j_0$ is $dp[i+1][j_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $N(s1)=j_1$ is $dp[i+1][j_1]$.\nSince $s0$ and $s1$ are distinct strings, their choices for $c_t$ are independent. So, for a fixed $j_0, j_1$, there are $dp[i+1][j_0] \\times dp[i+1][j_1]$ ways.\nThe sum $N(s0) + N(s1)$ can range from $0$ to $2k \\cdot 2^{n-(i+1)}$. Let $S = j_0 + j_1$.\nThen $N(s) = \\min(c_s, S)$. We want this to be $j$.\nThis means $c_s$ must be at least $j$. If $S \\le j$, then $c_s$ must be exactly $j$. If $S > j$, then $c_s$ can be any value from $j$ to $k$.\nSo, for a fixed $S$:\n- If $S \\le j$: We need $c_s = j$. This is 1 way if $j \\le k$, 0 ways otherwise.\n- If $S > j$: We need $c_s \\ge j$. This gives $k-j+1$ ways if $j \\le k$, 0 ways otherwise.\n\nLet $P[i+1][S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[i+1][j_0] \\times dp[i+1][j_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$P[i+1][S]$ can be computed by squaring the polynomial represented by $dp[i+1]$ (i.e., $(dp[i+1][0] + dp[i+1][1]x + \\dots)^2$).\nThe maximum possible value for $S$ is $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-(i+1)}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $j$ at level $i$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-i}$.\nLet $K_i = k \\cdot 2^{n-i}$. This is the maximum possible value for $N(s)$ for a string $s$ of length $i$.\nThe maximum value for $S$ is $2K_{i+1}$.\nThe maximum value for $j$ at level $i$ is $K_i$.\n\nSo, for $dp[i][j]$:\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2K_{i+1}} P[i+1][S] \\times (\\text{ways to choose } c_s \\text{ for this } S \\text{ to get } j)$.\nIf $j > k$, $dp[i][j] = 0$.\nIf $j \\le k$:\n$dp[i][j] = P[i+1][j] \\times 1 \\quad (\\text{for } S=j, \\text{ must choose } c_s=j)$\n$+ \\sum_{S=j+1}^{2K_{i+1}} P[i+1][S] \\times (k-j+1) \\quad (\\text{for } S>j, \\text{ choose } c_s \\in [j, k])$\nThis can be rewritten:\n$dp[i][j] = P[i+1][j] + (k-j+1) \\sum_{S=j+1}^{2K_{i+1}} P[i+1][S]$.\nLet $SuffSum[i+1][j'] = \\sum_{S=j'}^{2K_{i+1}} P[i+1][S]$. This can be computed efficiently.\n$dp[i][j] = P[i+1][j] + (k-j+1) \\cdot SuffSum[i+1][j+1]$. (for $j \\le k$)\n$dp[i][j] = 0$ for $j > K_i$.\n\nThe total number of strings is $2^n - 2$ (length 1 to $n-1$) plus $2^n$ (length $n$).\n$N \\le 15$. $k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$K_n = k$. $K_{n-1} = 2k$. $K_1 = 2^{n-1}k$.\nFor $n=15$, $K_1 = 2^{14}k \\approx 1.6 \\cdot 10^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 = 3.2 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too large for the DP state.\n\nThe maximum possible size $f$ is limited by $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ (for string '0' or '1').\nThe maximum possible sum $N(0)+N(1)$ is $k \\cdot 2^n$.\nThe problem asks for $N(0)+N(1)=f$.\nThe $dp[i][j]$ state represents the number of ways for *one* string $s$ of length $i$.\nThe final answer is $P[1][f] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} dp[1][j_0] \\times dp[1][j_1]$.\n\nThe maximum value for $j$ in $dp[i][j]$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-i}$.\nWhen $i=1$, $j$ can go up to $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\nFor $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $k \\cdot 2^{n-1} = 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2^{14} \\approx 3.2 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too large for DP array size.\nHowever, $f$ is at most $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThis means that $N(s)$ for strings $s$ of length $i$ can only be at most $f$ if $i$ is small enough (or $f$ is small enough).\nSpecifically, if $f < k \\cdot 2^{n-i}$, then $j$ in $dp[i][j]$ cannot exceed $f$.\nSo, the maximum $j$ we need to consider for $dp[i][j]$ is $\\min(k \\cdot 2^{n-i}, f)$.\nLet $MAX\\_J = f$.\nThen the DP state becomes $dp[i][j]$ for $j \\le f$.\nThe maximum value for $S$ in $P[i+1][S]$ is $2f$.\nThis means the DP arrays will have size $f+1$ or $2f+1$. This is feasible. $f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nThe DP calculation:\n`dp_curr` is $dp[i]$, `dp_next` is $dp[i+1]$.\n1. Compute $P[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp\\_next[j_0] \\times dp\\_next[j_1]$. This is a convolution.\n   The length of `dp_next` array is $f+1$. The result $P$ will have length $2f+1$.\n   This can be done using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) for $O(F \\log F)$ time, where $F$ is $f$.\n   Or, since $n$ is small, we can use $O(F^2)$ convolution for small $n$ if $F$ is small.\n   $F=2 \\cdot 10^5$, so $F^2$ is too slow. NTT is required.\n\n2. Compute $SuffSum[j'] = \\sum_{S=j'}^{2f} P[S]$. This is $O(F)$.\n   $SuffSum[2f+1] = 0$.\n   $SuffSum[j'] = P[j'] + SuffSum[j'+1]$ for $j'$ from $2f$ down to $0$.\n\n3. Compute $dp\\_curr[j]$ for $j=0 \\dots f$.\n   $dp\\_curr[j] = P[j] + (k-j+1) \\cdot SuffSum[j+1]$.\n   Note: $k-j+1$ must be $\\max(0, k-j+1)$ to handle $j>k$.\n   If $j>k$, then $c_s=j$ is not allowed, $c_s \\ge j$ is not allowed. So $dp\\_curr[j]$ should be 0.\n   The formula $P[j] + (k-j+1) \\cdot SuffSum[j+1]$ naturally handles this if $k-j+1$ is taken as 0 for $j>k$.\n   So, we can say $dp\\_curr[j] = P[j] + \\max(0, k-j+1) \\cdot SuffSum[j+1]$.\n   All calculations are modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe overall time complexity would be $O(n \\cdot f \\log f)$ due to $n$ NTT convolutions.\n$n=15, f=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nLet's refine the range of $j$ for $dp[i][j]$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N(s)$ for a string $s$ of length $i$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-i}$.\nIf $f$ is smaller than this maximum, then $j$ cannot exceed $f$.\nSo, `max_val_for_j_at_level_i = min(f, k * (1 << (n - i)))`.\nThe size of `dp_next` array is `max_val_for_j_at_level_i+1`.\nThe size of $P$ array is `2 * max_val_for_j_at_level_i+1`.\n\nLet's trace for $n=1, k=42, f=2$.\n$dp[1][j]$ for $j=0 \\dots f=2$.\nBase case: $i=n=1$.\n$dp[1][j] = 1$ for $0 \\le j \\le k=42$.\nSo, $dp[1][0]=1, dp[1][1]=1, dp[1][2]=1$. (We only need up to $f=2$).\n\nFinal answer is $P[1][f]$.\n$P[1][f] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} dp[1][j_0] \\times dp[1][j_1]$.\nHere, $f=2$.\n$P[1][2] = dp[1][0] \\times dp[1][2] + dp[1][1] \\times dp[1][1] + dp[1][2] \\times dp[1][0]$\n$P[1][2] = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 = 3$.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nLet's consider $n=2, k=37, f=13$.\nBase case: $i=n=2$.\n$dp[2][j] = 1$ for $0 \\le j \\le k=37$.\nWe need $dp[2][j]$ for $j=0 \\dots f=13$. So $dp[2][j]=1$ for $0 \\le j \\le 13$.\n\nNow compute $dp[1][j]$ for $j=0 \\dots f=13$.\n`dp_next` is $dp[2]$. `dp_next` array has length $14$ (indices $0 \\dots 13$).\n1. Compute $P[S]$ using $dp[2]$. Max $S$ is $2f=26$.\n   $P[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[2][j_0] \\times dp[2][j_1]$.\n   Since $dp[2][j]=1$ for $j \\le 13$ and $0$ otherwise:\n   $P[S]$ is the number of pairs $(j_0, j_1)$ such that $j_0+j_1=S$ and $0 \\le j_0, j_1 \\le 13$.\n   For $0 \\le S \\le 13$: $j_0$ can be $0 \\dots S$. There are $S+1$ pairs. So $P[S] = S+1$.\n   For $14 \\le S \\le 26$: $j_0$ can be $(S-13) \\dots 13$. There are $13 - (S-13) + 1 = 27-S$ pairs. So $P[S] = 27-S$.\n   For $S > 26$: $P[S] = 0$.\n\n2. Compute $SuffSum[j']$. Max $j'$ is $2f+1=27$.\n   $SuffSum[27]=0$.\n   $SuffSum[26] = P[26] + SuffSum[27] = (27-26) + 0 = 1$.\n   $SuffSum[25] = P[25] + SuffSum[26] = (27-25) + 1 = 2+1=3$.\n   ...\n   $SuffSum[14] = P[14] + \\dots = (27-14) + \\dots = 13 + \\dots$.\n   $SuffSum[13] = P[13] + \\dots = (13+1) + \\dots = 14 + \\dots$.\n\n3.

This is a prime number and has $2^{23}$ as a factor of $MOD-1$, which is good for NTT.\nA standard NTT implementation can be used.\n\nHelper functions needed:\n- `mod_inv(x)`: modular inverse.\n- `ntt(a, invert)`: performs NTT or inverse NTT.\n- `poly_mul(a, b)`: multiplies two polynomials using NTT.\n\nThe overall structure:\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\n# NTT implementation (omitted for brevity, assume it's available)\n# It should include:\n# - power(base, exp)\n# - inv(n)\n# - ntt(a, invert)\n# - poly_mul(a, b)\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[j] will store dp[i][j]\n    # dp_next[j] will store dp[i+1][j]\n\n    # Base case: i = n\n    # dp_next represents dp[n][j]\n    # max_j_at_level_n = min(f, k * (1 << (n - n))) = min(f, k)\n    dp_next = [0] * (min(f, k) + 1)\n    for j in range(len(dp_next)):\n        dp_next[j] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from i = n-1 down to 1\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # max_j_at_level_i_plus_1 is the current length of dp_next\n        current_max_j_for_next_level = len(dp_next) - 1\n\n        # Calculate P[S] = convolution of dp_next with itself\n        # P will have length up to 2 * current_max_j_for_next_level\n        P = poly_mul(dp_next, dp_next)\n        \n        # Trim P to relevant length (up to 2*f)\n        P_len = min(len(P), 2 * f + 1)\n        P = P[:P_len]\n\n        # Calculate SuffSum\n        SuffSum = [0] * (len(P) + 1)\n        for s in range(len(P) - 1, -1, -1):\n            SuffSum[s] = (P[s] + SuffSum[s+1]) % MOD\n\n        # Calculate dp_curr (dp[i][j])\n        max_j_at_level_i = min(f, k * (1 << (n - i)))\n        dp_curr = [0] * (max_j_at_level_i + 1)\n        \n        for j in range(max_j_at_level_i + 1):\n            term1 = P[j] if j < len(P) else 0\n            \n            ways_for_cs = 0\n            if j <= k: # c_s can be j or more\n                ways_for_cs = k - j + 1\n            \n            term2 = (ways_for_cs * SuffSum[j+1]) % MOD\n            \n            dp_curr[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD\n        \n        dp_next = dp_curr # Move to next iteration\n\n    # Final step: calculate P[f] using dp[1] (which is dp_next now)\n    final_P = poly_mul(dp_next, dp_next)\n    \n    if f < len(final_P):\n        sys.stdout.write(str(final_P[f]) + '\\n')\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n\n```\n\nA small detail: $k-j+1$ for $j > k$ should be 0. My code `max(0, k-j+1)` handles this.\nThe maximum value for $j$ in `dp_next` (which is $dp[i+1]$) is $f$. So `len(dp_next)` is $f+1$.\nThe maximum index in `P` is $2f$. So `len(P)` is $2f+1$.\nThe maximum index in `dp_curr` (which is $dp[i]$) is $f$. So `len(dp_curr)` is $f+1$.\nThe `min(f, k * (1 << (n - i)))` is important.\nFor `i=1`, `max_j_at_level_1 = min(f, k * (1 << (n - 1)))`.\nIf $f$ is very small, say $f=1$, while $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ is huge, then `dp_next` will always have length $f+1=2$. This is correct.\n\nLet's check the constraints and potential issues.\n$n=1$ case: The loop `for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1)` will not run.\nInitial `dp_next` is for $i=n=1$. `dp_next = [1, 1, ..., 1]` of length `min(f, k)+1`.\nThen `final_P = poly_mul(dp_next, dp_next)`.\nThis is exactly what we need for $n=1$. The loop condition `range(n-1, 0, -1)` correctly handles $n=1$ by not executing.\n\nThe `poly_mul` function needs to handle polynomial sizes appropriately.\nIf `a` has length `A` and `b` has length `B`, `poly_mul(a, b)` should return a polynomial of length `A+B-1`.\nThe NTT should pad to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `A+B-1`.\n\nConsider $n=6, k=153, f=23699$.\n$f=23699$.\n$dp[6]$ has length $\\min(23699, 153)+1 = 154$.\n$i=5: max\\_j\\_at\\_level\\_5 = \\min(23699, 153 \\cdot 2) = \\min(23699, 306) = 306$. $dp[5]$ has length $307$.\n$i=4: max\\_j\\_at\\_level\\_4 = \\min(23699, 153 \\cdot 4) = \\min(23699, 612) = 612$. $dp[4]$ has length $613$.\n$i=3: max\\_j\\_at\\_level\\_3 = \\min(23699, 153 \\cdot 8) = \\min(23699, 1224) = 1224$. $dp[3]$ has length $1225$.\n$i=2: max\\_j\\_at\\_level\\_2 = \\min(23699, 153 \\cdot 16) = \\min(23699, 2448) = 2448$. $dp[2]$ has length $2449$.\n$i=1: max\\_j\\_at\\_level\\_1 = \\min(23699, 153 \\cdot 32) = \\min(23699, 4896) = 4896$. $dp[1]$ has length $4897$.\nThe final convolution will be `poly_mul(dp[1], dp[1])`. The result length will be $2 \\cdot 4896 + 1 = 9793$.\nThe $f=23699$ is larger than $9793$. This means `final_P[f]` will be 0.\nThis matches the example output '0'.\n\nThe solution seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3 # Primitive root modulo 998244353 (3 is a common choice)\n\n# Precompute powers of ROOT and its inverse\n# Max length for NTT is 2^19 = 524288, so we need up to 2^18-th root of unity\n# (MOD -
