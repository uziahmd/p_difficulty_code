For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Triad Classification: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify triads as major, minor, or \"strange.\"  This is a fun little problem, and the constraints make it straightforward.  Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes numerically.  12 notes, so C through H, mapping to 0 through 11. Easy.  Using modulo arithmetic for distance will make life simple, especially when considering the cyclical nature of the notes.  C to E is 4 semitones, E to C is 8 semitones, confirmed.\n\nThe input is a set of three notes, unordered. I like that.  I'll read them in as a string, split them, and convert them to their numerical representations.  Then it's all about permutations.\n\nSince it is unordered, I need to check all the possible orderings of the three notes. Three notes, 3! = 6 possibilities. I'll need a way to calculate the \"upward\" distance between two notes; `(note2 - note1 + 12) % 12` will do the trick.  This ensures I get the correct semitone distance, even when the order is reversed.\n\nNow, checking for major and minor triads.  A major triad has distances 4-3, and a minor triad is 3-4.  If I find one of these orderings, I know the answer.  Since it's unambiguous, the moment I find a major or minor ordering, I can return the result. No need to keep searching. If I exhaust all permutations and find neither, it's a \"strange\" triad.\n\nI will write a few helper functions to clean things up, of course: one for note-to-number conversion, one to calculate the distance, and the main function that handles the permutations and classification.  This shouldn't take long to code up. I am looking forward to getting the solution, and hopefully, I will have the test cases working without a problem.\n",
