The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this radio tower problem. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid signal power configuration, modulo 998244353. It's all about ensuring that towns 1 to n receive signals from exactly one tower each, while towns 0 and n+1 remain un-covered.\n\nLet's dissect the problem step by step: there are `n+2` towns, numbered from 0 to `n+1`. The towers can only be in towns 1 to `n`, and each tower has a 50% chance of being built. Each tower's signal strength can be any number from 1 to `n`. A tower in town `i` with power `p` covers towns from `i - p + 1` to `i + p - 1`.\n\nThe constraints are pretty clear: Towns 0 and `n+1` need to be completely isolated. That means the towers have to emit signals which don't affect them. The other requirement is that towns 1 to n must be receiving exactly one signal. This means no town should have a signal overlapping, they must be distinct.\n\nFirstly, if a tower is built in town `i` with signal power `p_i`, the constraint for town 0 means `i - p_i >= 0`, and the constraint for town `n+1` means `i + p_i <= n+1`. Combining these, it means the power `p_i` is bound by 1 to `min(i, n+1-i)`.\n\nSecondly, we need the exact coverage by towers. Let's say, `C(i, p_i)` is the set of towns a tower at `i` with power `p_i` covers. The intersection of any two towers must be empty, and their union must contain towns 1 to n exclusively. In other words, each town between 1 and `n` needs to have its unique tower.\nNow, if a tower at town `i` has a power of `p_i`, it covers the range `[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]`. The core problem now is to calculate this coverage probability. It seems the core part is how to determine the probability of valid configurations. I need to figure out an efficient way to determine that.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towns $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to build radio towers (each with probability $1/2$), it is possible to assign signal powers $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to each tower $i \\in S$ such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on signal powers. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the interval $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$.\n\nConstraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\nFor town $0$ not to be covered, for any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, we must have $i - p_i + 1 > 0$, which implies $p_i \\le i$.\nFor town $n+1$ not to be covered, for any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, we must have $i + p_i - 1 < n+1$, which implies $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nThus, for any tower at $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nConstraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\nThis implies that the intervals covered by the chosen towers must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, if $C(i, p_i) = [i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$ is the interval covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$:\n(a) $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} C(i, p_i) = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$\n(b) For any $i, j \\in S$ with $i \\ne j$, $C(i, p_i) \\cap C(j, p_j) = \\emptyset$.\n\nConsider the structure of these covered intervals. Each interval $C(i, p_i)$ is centered at $i$. The length of the interval is $2p_i - 1$.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ mean that the interval $C(i, p_i)$ cannot extend to $0$ or $n+1$.\nThe \"exactly one tower\" condition means these intervals must perfectly tile $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis is only possible if the intervals are disjoint and their union is $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet the chosen towers be $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThen the intervals must be $C(i_1, p_{i_1}) = [1, 2i_1-1]$, $C(i_2, p_{i_2}) = [2i_1, 2i_2-2i_1+1]$, etc.\nNo, this is wrong. $C(i, p_i)$ is centered at $i$.\nIf $C(i, p_i) = [L, R]$, then $i = (L+R)/2$. So $L+R$ must be even.\nAlso, $R-L+1 = 2p_i-1$. So $R-L$ must be even.\nThis means $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity.\nSince $i-p_i+1$ and $i+p_i-1$ always have the same parity, this condition is always met.\n\nLet's consider the boundaries of the covered intervals. The leftmost point covered is $i-p_i+1$, and the rightmost is $i+p_i-1$.\nFor the intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, they must \"meet\" at integer points.\nSpecifically, if we have towers at $i$ and $j$ ($i < j$), and their intervals are $C(i, p_i) = [L_i, R_i]$ and $C(j, p_j) = [L_j, R_j]$, then for them to be adjacent and partition the space, we must have $R_i = L_j - 1$.\nThe union of intervals must be $[1, n]$. This means the first interval must start at $1$ and the last interval must end at $n$.\nFor the first tower $i_1$, $L_{i_1} = i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\nFor the last tower $i_k$, $R_{i_k} = i_k + p_{i_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n - i_k + 1$.\nFor any intermediate tower $i_j$ and its successor $i_{j+1}$, we must have $R_{i_j} = L_{i_{j+1}} - 1$.\n$i_j + p_{i_j} - 1 = (i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}} + 1) - 1 \\implies i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $i_{j+1} - i_j = p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nAlso, for any tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must be $\\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nFor $p_{i_1} = i_1$, this is fine as $i_1 \\le i_1$. We also need $i_1 \\le n+1-i_1 \\implies 2i_1 \\le n+1$.\nFor $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$, this is fine as $n-i_k+1 \\le n+1-i_k$. We also need $n-i_k+1 \\le i_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\nFor intermediate towers $i_j$, $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$.\n\nLet $l_j = i_j - p_{i_j}$ and $r_j = i_j + p_{i_j}$. The covered interval is $[l_j+1, r_j-1]$.\nThe conditions become:\n1. $l_1 = 0$ (since $i_1 - p_{i_1} = 0 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$).\n2. $r_k = n+1$ (since $i_k + p_{i_k} = n+1 \\implies p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$).\n3. For $1 \\le j < k$, $r_j = l_{j+1}$.\n4. For all $j$, $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$. This means $l_j < i_j < r_j$.\n5. For all $j$, $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$. This means $l_j \\ge 0$ and $r_j \\le n+1$. (These are guaranteed by conditions 1, 2, 3 and $l_j < i_j < r_j$).\n\nFrom $l_1=0$ and $r_j=l_{j+1}$:\n$l_1=0$\n$r_1=l_2$\n$r_2=l_3$\n...\n$r_{k-1}=l_k$\n$r_k=n+1$\nSumming these equations: $r_k - l_1 = (r_k - r_{k-1}) + (r_{k-1} - r_{k-2}) + \\dots + (r_1 - l_1)$.\nAlso, $r_j - l_j = 2p_{i_j}$.\nSo, $n+1 = \\sum_{j=1}^k (r_j - l_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^k 2p_{i_j} = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^k p_{i_j}$.\nThis implies that $n+1$ must be an even number. If $n+1$ is odd, it's impossible.\nIf $n+1$ is odd (i.e., $n$ is even), the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's recheck the example for $n=2$. $n+1=3$ (odd). The output is $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nSo my deduction that $n+1$ must be even is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $r_j = l_{j+1}$. This means $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThe covered interval is $(i-p, i+p)$. The length is $2p-1$.\nThe towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be partitioned.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns where towers are built, sorted $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThere must exist powers $p_{i_j}$ such that:\n1. $i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n2. $i_k + p_{i_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n - i_k + 1$.\n3. For $1 \\le j < k$, $(i_j + p_{i_j} - 1) + 1 = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}} + 1 \\implies i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}} + 1$.\n4. For all $j$, $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nCondition 3 can be written as $i_{j+1} - i_j = p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} - 1$.\nThis implies that $i_{j+1} - i_j$ must be odd if $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}}$ is even, or even if $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}}$ is odd.\nMore simply, $i_{j+1} - i_j$ and $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}}$ must have different parities.\n\nLet's sum the conditions:\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$\n$p_{i_2} = i_2 - i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = i_2 - i_1 - i_1 + 1 = i_2 - 2i_1 + 1$\n$p_{i_3} = i_3 - i_2 - p_{i_2} + 1 = i_3 - i_2 - (i_2 - 2i_1 + 1) + 1 = i_3 - 2i_2 + 2i_1$\nThis pattern seems complicated.\nLet's define $x_0 = 0, x_1 = i_1, \\dots, x_k = i_k, x_{k+1} = n+1$.\nThe condition $i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}} + 1$ means that the right boundary of $C(i_j, p_{i_j})$ is $i_j+p_{i_j}-1$, and the left boundary of $C(i_{j+1}, p_{i_{j+1}})$ is $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$. These must be consecutive integers.\nLet $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$ and $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$.\nWe need $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$, and $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$ for $j=1,\\dots,k-1$.\nThis implies $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and $p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$.\nFor $j=1,\\dots,k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1+1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1 \\implies i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\nLet $S_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$. Then $S_j = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\nThe values $p_{i_j}$ are uniquely determined by $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ as follows:\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n$p_{i_j} = i_j - (i_{j-1} + p_{i_{j-1}} - 1)$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThis is $p_{i_j} = i_j - i_{j-1} - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1$.\nThis defines $p_{i_j}$ recursively.\nThe last condition $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$ must also hold.\nSubstituting the recursive definition into the last condition:\n$n-i_k+1 = p_{i_k} = i_k - i_{k-1} - p_{i_{k-1}} + 1$.\n$n-2i_k+i_{k-1} = -p_{i_{k-1}}$.\n$p_{i_{k-1}} = 2i_k - i_{k-1} - n$.\nThis is a constraint on $i_1, \\dots, i_k$.\n\nLet's look at the parity of $p_{i_j}$.\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n$p_{i_2} = i_2 - i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = i_2 - 2i_1 + 1$.\n$p_{i_3} = i_3 - i_2 - p_{i_2} + 1 = i_3 - i_2 - (i_2 - 2i_1 + 1) + 1 = i_3 - 2i_2 + 2i_1$.\nIn general, $p_{i_j} = i_j - 2i_{j-1} + 2i_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-1} 2i_1 + (-1)^j \\cdot \\text{stuff}$.\nMore precisely, $p_{i_j} = i_j - i_{j-1} - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1$.\nThis means $p_{i_j} \\equiv i_j - i_{j-1} - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1 \\pmod 2$.\n$p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j-1}} \\equiv i_j - i_{j-1} + 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j-1}}$ must have the same parity as $i_j - i_{j-1} + 1$.\nAlso, $p_{i_1} = i_1$.\nThe last condition is $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\nSo $p_{i_k} \\equiv n-i_k+1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe key observation is that the chosen towns $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ must have alternating parities.\nLet $A_j = i_j - p_{i_j}$ and $B_j = i_j + p_{i_j}$. The interval covered is $(A_j, B_j)$.\nThe conditions are $A_1 = 0$, $B_k = n+1$, and $B_j = A_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis implies $B_1 = A_2$, $B_2 = A_3$, ..., $B_{k-1} = A_k$.\nSo we have a sequence $0 = A_1 < B_1 = A_2 < B_2 = A_3 < \\dots < B_k = n+1$.\nFor each $j$, $A_j$ and $B_j$ must have different parities because $B_j - A_j = 2p_{i_j}$.\nTherefore, $A_1=0$ (even). Then $B_1$ must be odd.\nSince $A_2=B_1$, $A_2$ must be odd. Then $B_2$ must be even.\nThis continues: $A_j$ has parity $(-1)^{j-1} \\cdot \\text{even}$, $B_j$ has parity $(-1)^{j-1} \\cdot \\text{odd}$.\nMore precisely, $A_j$ has parity $j-1 \\pmod 2$ (0 for odd $j$, 1 for even $j$).\n$B_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$ (1 for odd $j$, 0 for even $j$).\nSo $A_j$ and $B_j$ are always of opposite parity.\nThis implies $A_1=0$ (even), $B_1$ (odd), $A_2$ (odd), $B_2$ (even), $A_3$ (even), $B_3$ (odd), ...\nAnd $B_k = n+1$. So $n+1$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nAlso, $i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2$.\nSince $A_j$ and $B_j$ have opposite parities, $A_j+B_j$ is always odd.\nSo $i_j = (A_j+B_j)/2$ can never be an integer. This is the issue with my earlier reasoning.\nThe problem states \"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\". This means their coordinates are strictly outside the open interval $(i-p, i+p)$.\nSo $i-p \\ge 0$ and $i+p \\le n+1$.\nThe covered towns are $c$ such that $i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\nLet $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $L_1 = 1$. This means $p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n2. $R_k = n$. This means $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\n3. For $1 \\le j < k$, $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$. This means $i_j+p_{i_j}-1+1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1 \\implies i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n4. For all $j$, $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\nThe conditions $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ are satisfied by $L_1=1$ and $R_k=n$ and $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$ for $j=1,\\dots,k-1$ because the intervals are contained within $[1,n]$.\n\nFrom $p_{i_1} = i_1$, we get $i_1 \\ge 1$.\nFrom $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$, we get $i_k \\le n$.\nFrom $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$:\n$i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nSince $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$, $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1 \\ge 1+1-1=1$. So $i_{j+1}-i_j \\ge 1$, which is true since $i_j$ are distinct and sorted.\nSumming $i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$:\n$(i_2-i_1) + (i_3-i_2) + \\dots + (i_k-i_{k-1}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1)$.\n$i_k-i_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1)$.\n$i_k-i_1 = (p_{i_1}+p_{i_2}-1) + (p_{i_2}+p_{i_3}-1) + \\dots + (p_{i_{k-1}}+p_{i_k}-1)$.\n$i_k-i_1 = p_{i_1} + 2p_{i_2} + \\dots + 2p_{i_{k-1}} + p_{i_k} - (k-1)$.\nSubstitute $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and $p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$:\n$i_k-i_1 = i_1 + 2p_{i_2} + \\dots + 2p_{i_{k-1}} + (n-i_k+1) - (k-1)$.\n$2i_k - 2i_1 - (n+1) + (k-1) = 2 \\sum_{j=2}^{k-1} p_{i_j}$.\nThis implies $2i_k - 2i_1 - (n+1) + (k-1)$ must be an even number.\nSo $-(n+1)+(k-1)$ must be even.\n$n+1 - (k-1)$ must be even.\n$n-k+2$ must be even.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity. ($n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$).\n\nIf $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$, then $p_{i_j}$ values are uniquely determined and satisfy $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$.\nThe specific values $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ must satisfy $i_j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $i_{j+1}-i_j \\ge 1$.\nThe condition $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ is the only constraint on the set of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nThis is a known result for partitioning an interval with \"centered\" intervals.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that if $S$ has $k$ elements, then $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\nThe total number of possible subsets $S$ is $2^n$. Each subset has probability $(1/2)^n$.\nWe need to count the number of subsets $S$ with $k$ elements where $k \\equiv n \\pmod 2$.\nLet $N_k$ be the number of subsets of size $k$. $N_k = \\binom{n}{k}$.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{k \\equiv n \\pmod 2} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even. We need $k$ to be even.\nThe sum is $\\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{2} + \\dots + \\binom{n}{n}$.\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. We need $k$ to be odd.\nThe sum is $\\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{3} + \\dots + \\binom{n}{n}$.\n\nIt is a known identity that $\\sum_{k \\text{ even}} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nAnd $\\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n(Proof: $(1+x)^n = \\sum \\binom{n}{k} x^k$. Set $x=1 \\implies 2^n = \\sum \\binom{n}{k}$. Set $x=-1 \\implies 0 = \\sum \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = \\sum_{k \\text{ even}} \\binom{n}{k} - \\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k}$. Adding these two equations gives $2^n = 2 \\sum_{k \\text{ even}} \\binom{n}{k}$, so $\\sum_{k \\text{ even}} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}$. Subtracting gives $2^n = 2 \\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k}$, so $\\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}$.)\n\nThis identity holds for $n \\ge 1$.\nSo, for any $n \\ge 1$, the number of valid configurations of towers is $2^{n-1}$.\nThe total number of ways to build towers is $2^n$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet's check the examples.\n$n=2$: Output is $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My result $1/2$ is incorrect.\n$n=3$: Output is $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My result $1/2$ is incorrect.\n$n=5$: Output is $842268673$. This is $5/32 \\pmod{998244353}$. My result $1/2$ is incorrect.\n\nWhat went wrong?\nThe derivation of $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ is correct.\nThe problem is that I assumed that *any* set of $k$ towers satisfying $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ would work. This is not true.\nThe values $p_{i_j}$ must be $\\ge 1$.\n$p_{i_1} = i_1 \\ge 1$. This is always true for $i_1 \\ge 1$.\n$p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1 \\ge 1$. This is always true for $i_k \\le n$.\nWhat about $p_{i_j} = i_j - i_{j-1} - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1 \\ge 1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k-1$?\nThis means $i_j - i_{j-1} - p_{i_{j-1}} \\ge 0$.\n$p_{i_{j-1}} \\le i_j - i_{j-1}$.\nThis is a crucial additional constraint.\nThe powers $p_i$ are uniquely determined by the set $S$. We need to count the sets $S$ for which these uniquely determined powers are all $\\ge 1$.\n\nLet $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nDefine $d_j = i_j - i_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$, and $d_1 = i_1$, $d_{k+1} = n+1-i_k$.\nThese $d_j$ are positive integers.\nThe conditions are:\n$p_{i_1} = d_1$.\n$p_{i_j} = d_j - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThe final check is $p_{i_k} = d_{k+1}$.\nThe conditions $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ must hold for all $j$.\n$d_1 \\ge 1$ (true).\n$d_j - p_{i_{j-1}} + 1 \\ge 1 \\implies d_j \\ge p_{i_{j-1}}$.\nSo, we need $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ and $p_{i_{j-1}} \\le d_j$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nAnd $p_{i_k} = d_{k+1}$.\n\nLet's trace the values of $p_j$ (using $p_j$ for $p_{i_j}$):\n$p_1 = d_1$\n$p_2 = d_2 - p_1 + 1 = d_2 - d_1 + 1$\n$p_3 = d_3 - p_2 + 1 = d_3 - (d_2 - d_1 + 1) + 1 = d_3 - d_2 + d_1$\n$p_4 = d_4 - p_3 + 1 = d_4 - (d_3 - d_2 + d_1) + 1 = d_4 - d_3 + d_2 - d_1 + 1$\nIn general, $p_j = d_j - d_{j-1} + d_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-1} d_1 + \\delta_j$, where $\\delta_j$ is $0$ if $j$ is odd, and $1$ if $j$ is even.\nThis can be written as $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + \\lceil j/2 \\rceil - \\lfloor j/2 \\rfloor$. (This is $0$ if $j$ even, $1$ if $j$ odd). No, it's $1$ if $j$ even, $0$ if $j$ odd.\nLet's use a simpler form: $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + (j \\pmod 2 \\text{ ? } 0 : 1)$. No, $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + (j \\pmod 2 == 0)$.\n$p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + (1 - (j \\pmod 2))$.\nNo. $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + (j \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0)$.\n$p_1 = d_1$.\n$p_2 = d_2 - d_1 + 1$.\n$p_3 = d_3 - d_2 + d_1$.\n$p_4 = d_4 - d_3 + d_2 - d_1 + 1$.\nThis is $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + \\mathbf{1}_{j \\text{ is even}}$. (where $\\mathbf{1}$ is indicator function).\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. $d_j \\ge 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k+1$. (This is true by definition of $d_j$).\n2. $p_j \\ge 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n3. $p_k = d_{k+1}$.\n\nLet's check $p_k = d_{k+1}$.\n$d_{k+1} = \\sum_{m=1}^k (-1)^{k-m} d_m + \\mathbf{1}_{k \\text{ is even}}$.\nThis means $d_{k+1} - \\sum_{m=1}^k (-1)^{k-m} d_m = \\mathbf{1}_{k \\text{ is even}}$.\nRearranging: $\\sum_{m=1}^{k+1} (-1)^{k-m} d_m = \\mathbf{1}_{k \\text{ is even}}$.\nIf $k$ is even: $d_{k+1} - d_k + d_{k-1} - \\dots - d_2 + d_1 = 1$.\nIf $k$ is odd: $d_{k+1} - d_k + d_{k-1} - \\dots + d_2 - d_1 = 0$.\n\nThis is a well-known problem related to compositions of $n+1$.\nWe need to find the number of sequences $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ such that $d_j \\ge 1$, $\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1} d_j = n+1$, and the conditions on $p_j$ are met.\nThe conditions $p_j \\ge 1$ are $d_1 \\ge 1$ and $d_j \\ge p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\n$p_1 = d_1$.\n$p_2 = d_2 - d_1 + 1$. So $d_2 \\ge d_1$.\n$p_3 = d_3 - d_2 + d_1$. So $d_3 \\ge d_2 - d_1 + 1$.\n$p_j \\ge 1$ means $d_j \\ge p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThe condition $p_k = d_{k+1}$ implies $d_{k+1} \\ge 1$.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting sequences $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ such that:\n1. $d_j \\ge 1$ for all $j$.\n2. $\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1} d_j = n+1$.\n3. $d_j \\ge p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$. (where $p_{j-1}$ is defined recursively)\n4. $d_{k+1} = p_k$.\n\nThe value $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} d_m + \\mathbf{1}_{j \\text{ is even}}$ can be rewritten as\n$p_j = d_j - p_{j-1} + 1$ (with $p_0=0$).\nThe condition $d_j \\ge p_{j-1}$ becomes $p_j \\ge 1$.\nSo we just need $p_j \\ge 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nAnd $p_k=d_{k+1}$.\n\nLet's try to interpret this.\nThe sequence $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ is a composition of $n+1$ into $k+1$ parts.\n$i_1 = d_1$.\n$i_2 = d_1+d_2$.\n$i_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j d_m$.\nThe towers are at $i_1, \\dots, i_k$.\nThe condition $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ is also implied by $p_k = d_{k+1}$.\nIf $k$ is even: $d_{k+1} - d_k + d_{k-1} - \\dots - d_2 + d_1 = 1$.\nIf $k$ is odd: $d_{k+1} - d_k + d_{k-1} - \\dots + d_2 - d_1 = 0$.\n\nThis is a problem about counting compositions of $N$ into $K$ parts with additional parity constraints, or conditions on partial sums.\nThis is a known result for counting \"alternating sums\" of parts.\nThe number of compositions of $n+1$ into $k+1$ parts $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ such that $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_k=d_{k+1}$\nis the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1, 0)$ using steps $(d_j, (-1)^j)$ that do not go below $y=0$.\nThis is related to Dyck paths, or paths on a grid.\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of valid subsets $S$.\nFor $n=1$: $S \\subseteq \\{1\\}$.\n$S=\\emptyset$: $k=0$. $n=1, k=0$. $n \\not\\equiv k \\pmod 2$. Invalid.\n$S=\\{1\\}$: $k=1$. $n=1, k=1$. $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$. Valid.\n$p_1=i_1=1$. $d_1=1, d_2=1$. $k=1$. $p_1=d_2$ is $1=1$. $p_1 \\ge 1$.\nSo for $n=1$, $S=\\{1\\}$ is the only valid set. Probability is $1/2$.\nExample gives $1/4$ for $n=2$, $1/4$ for $n=3$, $5/32$ for $n=5$.\nMy $1/2$ for $n=1$ is not consistent with $1/4$ for $n=2,3$.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of sequences $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ such that $d_j \\ge 1$, $\\sum d_j = n+1$, and $p_j \\ge 1$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k$, and $p_k=d_{k+1}$.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to partition a length $i$ segment using $j$ towers.\nThis is not standard DP.\n\nLet's look at the example cases.\n$n=2$: Total $2^2=4$ subsets.\n$S=\\emptyset$: $k=0$. $n=2, k=0$. $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n$p_0=0$. $d_1=n+1=3$. $p_k=d_{k+1}$ becomes $p_0=d_1$, which is $0=3$.

So the Fibonacci hypothesis is correct.\n\nThe proof of $F_n$ comes from a combinatorial argument counting such compositions.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ according to the rules.\nConsider the first tower $i_1$. $p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nThe interval is $[1, 2i_1-1]$.\nCase 1: $2i_1-1=n$. This means $i_1=(n+1)/2$. This is only possible if $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, and $i_1=(n+1)/2$, then the first tower covers the entire interval $[1,n]$. This means $k=1$.\nWe need $p_1=i_1$ and $p_1=n-i_1+1$. This means $i_1 = n-i_1+1 \\implies 2i_1=n+1 \\implies i_1=(n+1)/2$.\nThis requires $k=1$. We need $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$, so $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which is true.\nThis case contributes 1 if $n$ is odd, 0 if $n$ is even.\nCase 2: $2i_1-1 < n$. The first tower covers $[1, 2i_1-1]$. The remaining interval $[2i_1, n]$ must be partitioned.\nLet $n' = n - (2i_1-1)$. The problem is now to partition $[1, n']$ (by re-indexing).\nThe first tower $i_1$ is at $i_1$. It covers $[1, 2i_1-1]$.\nThe next tower $i_2$ must start at $2i_1$.\nThe condition $i_1+p_{i_1} = i_2-p_{i_2}+1$ means $2i_1 = i_2-p_{i_2}+1$.\nThe sequence $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ is a composition of $n+1$.\n$p_j = d_j - d_{j-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{j-1} d_1 + \\mathbf{1}_{j \\text{ is even}}$.\nThe conditions are $p_j \\ge 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$ and $p_k=d_{k+1}$.\nThis is a standard problem. The number of such compositions of $N$ is $F_N$.\nFor example, for $N=5$, $F_5=5$.\nThe compositions are:\n$k=0$: No towers. $d_1=N=5$. $p_0=0 \\ne d_1$. Invalid.\n$k=1$: $d_1, d_2$. $d_1+d_2=5$. $p_1=d_1 \\ge 1$. $p_1=d_2$.\n$d_1=d_2 \\implies 2d_1=5$. No integer solution.\n$k=2$: $d_1, d_2, d_3$. $d_1+d_2+d_3=5$. $p_1=d_1 \\ge 1$. $p_2=d_2-d_1+1 \\ge 1 \\implies d_2 \\ge d_1$. $p_2=d_3$.\n$d_1+d_2+(d_2-d_1+1)=5 \\implies 2d_2+1=5 \\implies d_2=2$.\n$d_1 \\ge 1, d_2 \\ge d_1 \\implies 2 \\ge d_1 \\implies d_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nIf $d_1=1, d_2=2 \\implies d_3=2-1+1=2$. $(1,2,2)$.\nIf $d_1=2, d_2=2 \\implies d_3=2-2+1=1$. $(2,2,1)$.\nThese are 2 ways.\n$k=3$: $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$. $d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4=5$. $p_1=d_1 \\ge 1$. $p_2=d_2-d_1+1 \\ge 1 \\implies d_2 \\ge d_1$. $p_3=d_3-d_2+d_1 \\ge 1 \\implies d_3 \\ge d_2-d_1+1$. $p_3=d_4$.\n$d_1+d_2+d_3+(d_3-d_2+d_1)=5 \\implies 2d_1+2d_3=5$. No integer solution.\n$k=4$: $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5$. $d_1+\\dots+d_5=5$. $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\ge 1$. $p_4=d_5$.\n$d_2=1, d_4=1, d_1=1, d_3=1$. This yields $(1,1,1,1,1)$. 1 way.\nTotal ways: $2+1=3$.\nThis is $F_4=3$. For $n=4$, the sum of parts is $n+1=5$. The number of towers $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$. So $k+1$ parts.\nThe number of valid sequences $d_1, \\dots, d_{k+1}$ summing to $N$ with the conditions is $F_N$.\nSo for $n$, the sum is $n+1$. The number of ways is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$. Prob $1/2$. Matches.\nFor $n=2$, $F_{2+1}=F_3=2$. Prob $2/4=1/2$. Example $1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_{3+1}=F_4=3$. Prob $3/8$. Example $1/4$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_{5+1}=F_6=8$. Prob $8/32=1/4$. Example $5/32$.\n\nMy interpretation of the Fibonacci number index is off.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of valid subsets for $n$.\n$a_1 = 1$ ($S=\\{1\\}$)\n$a_2 = 1$ ($S=\\{1,2\\}$)\n$a_3 = 2$ ($S=\\{2\\}, S=\\{1,2,3\\}$)\n$a_4 = 3$ ($S=\\{1,3\\}, S=\\{2,4\\}, S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$)\n$a_5 = 5$ (from example $5/32$)\nThis sequence $1,1,2,3,5$ is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$. ($F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$)\nSo the number of ways is $F_n$. (where $F_1=1, F_2=1$).\nThis means the Fibonacci sequence used in competitive programming where $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number.\n\nThe problem is to compute $F_n \\pmod{MOD}$.\nThe matrix exponentiation for $F_n$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$) gives $F_n$ as $R_{10}$ when computing $M^n$.\nThe base case for matrix exponentiation $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} F_2 & F_1 \\\\ F_1 & F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nIf we compute $M^n$, the $(1,0)$ element is $F_n$.\nThis is correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    MOD = 998244353\n    \n    # Modular exponentiation for a single number\n    def power(base, exp):\n        res = 1\n        base %= MOD\n        while exp > 0:\n            if exp % 2 == 1:\n                res = (res * base) % MOD\n            base = (base * base) % MOD\n            exp //= 2\n        return res\n\n    # Matrix multiplication\n    def mat_mult(A, B):\n        C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n        for i in range(2):\n            for j in range(2):\n                for k in range(2):\n                    C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n        return C\n\n    # Matrix exponentiation\n    def mat_pow(A, n_pow):\n        res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n        base = A\n        while n_pow > 0:\n            if n_pow % 2 == 1:\n                res = mat_mult(res, base)\n            base = mat_mult(base, base)\n            n_pow //= 2\n        return res\n\n    # Calculate F_n using matrix exponentiation\n    # [[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k\n    # We want F_n, so we need the (1,0) element of [[1,1],[1,0]]^n\n    if n == 0: # Though n >= 1 constraint\n        fib_n = 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        fib_n = 1\n    else:\n        fib_matrix = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n        result_matrix = mat_pow(fib_matrix, n)\n        fib_n = result_matrix[1][0] # F_n is at (1,0) position\n\n    # Calculate (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    # inv_2 = power(2, MOD - 2) # Modular inverse of 2\n    # inv_2_pow_n = power(inv_2, n) # (2^-1)^n = (2^n)^-1\n    # Simpler: (2^n)^-1 = 2^(MOD-1-n)\n    # No, it's (2^n)^-1 = 2^(MOD-2) * (2^(MOD-2))^(n-1)\n    # (2^n)^-1 = power(2, MOD - 1 - n) is wrong.\n    # It's power(2, MOD-2) to get 2^-1.
