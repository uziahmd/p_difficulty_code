A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's a classic resource allocation puzzle, and it boils down to figuring out how many toasts a group of friends can make, given limited supplies of drinks, limes, and salt.  I know I'll be working in Python for this, so I need to be mindful of integer division.\n\nLet's break this down. I need to take the following steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the toasts possible from each resource:**\n    *   **Drink:** I have `k` bottles, each with `l` milliliters. Each friend needs `nl` ml. So the total toasts possible from drink is `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division).\n    *   **Limes:** I have `c` limes, and each lime yields `d` slices. Each toast needs one slice, meaning I have `c * d` total slices.\n    *   **Salt:** I have `p` grams of salt, and each toast needs `np` grams. The total toasts possible from salt is `p // np`.\n\n2.  **Determine the limiting factor:**  The number of toasts is restricted by the *smallest* amount I can get from any of the resources. So, I need to take the minimum of the three values I just calculated.\n\n3.  **Divide by the number of friends:** Because each friend needs the same amount, I have to divide the `min_total_toasts` by the total number of friends `n` and round down (because you can't have fractional toasts) to find how many toasts each person can make.\n\n4.  I have to keep in mind that I'm using integer division (`//`) to prevent float output.\n\nSo, in Python, I'll need to calculate:\n\n1.  `total_drink_ml = k * l`\n2.  `toasts_from_drink = total_drink_ml // nl`\n3.  `total_lime_slices = c * d`\n4.  `toasts_from_limes = c * d`\n5.  `toasts_from_salt = p // np`\n6.  `max_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_limes, toasts_from_salt)`\n7.  `toasts_per_friend = max_toasts // n`\n\nAnd that should give me the final answer - the maximum number of toasts that each friend can make, given the available resources and the constraint that everyone has to drink the same amount. Let's see if this works!\n",
