Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Solving \"Vanya and Cards\"**\n\nI've been tasked with finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to add to make the total sum zero. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I'm given the number of cards, the maximum absolute value of a card's number, and a list of card values. The goal is to get the total sum to zero, given the constraint that any new cards must have a value within the specified range.\n\nI quickly realize that I need to calculate the sum of the existing cards. The required number of cards will be based on this sum. If the sum is zero, I'm done. Otherwise, the number of new cards I need depends on the absolute value of this sum and the maximum card value. To minimize the card count, I should make each new card contribute as much as possible to reach zero. That is, if the current sum is positive, I want to add negative cards and if it is negative, I want to add positive cards, within the allowed bounds. In other words, to compensate for the `S` found on the existing cards, I'll need new cards to sum to `-S`.\n\nTo minimize the card count, I see that adding cards with the maximum allowed absolute value is the most efficient way to achieve the target sum of -S. I need to calculate the *ceiling* of the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum allowed value to find the minimum number of cards.\n\nI also identify that I can use integer division to calculate `ceil(a/b)` efficiently using `(a + b - 1) // b`. I verify this trick for several sample values of `a` and `b`. This will allow me to write a streamlined solution.\n\nFinally, I design a Python script to do this. I'll read the input, calculate the sum, apply the formula to find the minimal card count, and then print the result. The critical step is using the `ceil` trick with integer division. This is fast, efficient, and is a clean way to find the smallest number of cards.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (initial `n` cards plus the newly found ones) equals zero. We are given `n` cards and their values, and a maximum absolute value `x` for any card. Vanya can find infinitely many cards with any integer value from `-x` to `x`.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:** First, we need to find the sum of the numbers on the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\n\n2.  **Determine the target sum for new cards:** Vanya wants the *total* sum of all cards to be zero. If the current sum is `S`, then the sum of the newly found cards must be `-S` to make the total sum `S + (-S) = 0`.\n\n3.  **Handle the trivial case:** If `S` is already zero, Vanya doesn't need to find any more cards. The answer is 0.\n\n4.  **Minimize the number of new cards:** If `S` is not zero, we need to find cards whose values sum up to `-S`. To minimize the number of cards, each new card should contribute the maximum possible absolute value towards reaching `-S`.\n    *   If `-S` is positive (meaning `S` was negative), we should add cards with value `x` (the largest positive value allowed).\n    *   If `-S` is negative (meaning `S` was positive), we should add cards with value `-x` (the largest negative value allowed, i.e., `x` in absolute value).\n    In both cases, each new card can contribute at most `x` to the absolute value of the sum.\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum cards needed:** We need to cover an absolute sum of `abs(-S)` (which is `abs(S)`) using cards that each contribute at most `x`. The minimum number of cards required is `ceil(abs(S) / x)`.\n    For positive integers `a` and `b`, `ceil(a / b)` can be calculated using integer division as `(a + b - 1) // b`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n*   **Input 1:** `n = 3, x = 2`, cards: `-1, 1, 2`\n    1.  Current sum `S = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n    2.  Absolute sum to compensate `abs(S) = abs(2) = 2`.\n    3.  `x = 2`.\n    4.  Minimum cards needed = `ceil(2 / 2) = ceil(1) = 1`.\n        (Using integer division: `(2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`).\n        Vanya needs to find 1 card (e.g., a card with value -2).\n\n*   **Input 2:** `n = 2, x = 3`, cards: `-2, -2`\n    1.  Current sum `S = -2 + (-2) = -4`.\n    2.  Absolute sum to compensate `abs(S) = abs(-4) = 4`.\n    3.  `x = 3`.\n    4.  Minimum cards needed = `ceil(4 / 3) = ceil(1.33...) = 2`.\n        (Using integer division: `(4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2`).\n        Vanya needs to find 2 cards (e.g., two cards with value 2, summing to 4).\n\nThis approach correctly handles all cases and minimizes the number of cards.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and x from the first line of input\n    n, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Read the n space-separated integers (numbers on found cards)\n    # and convert them to a list of integers.\n    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # We want the total sum of all cards (found + newly found) to be zero.\n    # This means the sum of the newly found cards must be -current_sum.\n    # Let's consider the absolute value of the sum we need to compensate.\n    abs_sum_to_compensate = abs(current_sum)\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n    if abs_sum_to_compensate == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # To minimize the number of additional cards, each new card should\n    # contribute the maximum possible absolute value towards the target sum.\n    # The maximum absolute value a card can have is 'x'.\n    # So, we effectively need to cover 'abs_sum_to_compensate' by adding\n    # cards, each contributing at most 'x' to the absolute sum.\n    # The minimum number of cards required is ceil(abs_sum_to_compensate / x).\n    #\n    # For positive integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be calculated using\n    # integer division as (a + b - 1) // b.\n    \n    min_cards_needed = (abs_sum_to_compensate + x - 1) // x\n    \n    # Print the calculated minimum number of cards.\n    print(min_cards_needed)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program.\nsolve()\n```",
