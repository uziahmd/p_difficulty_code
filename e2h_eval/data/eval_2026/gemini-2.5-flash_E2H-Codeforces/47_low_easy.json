    "thought": "**My Optimization Strategy for Minimizing LCM(a+k, b+k)**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling this problem where I need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. My thought process is to break this down using some core number theory principles.\n\nFirst, I recognize that the key lies in understanding the relationship between the LCM and the GCD.  `lcm(x,y) = (x*y) / gcd(x,y)`.  So, if I can manipulate the problem to control the GCD, I can indirectly influence the LCM.\n\nLet's rename `a+k` to `x` and `b+k` to `y`. I'm going to focus on minimizing `lcm(x, y)`. The crucial step here is realizing that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` can be simplified. I know that `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`. So, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` becomes `gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k))`, which simplifies to `gcd(a+k, b-a)`.  I'll call `b-a` as `d`. Without loss of generality, I'll ensure `a <= b` as order doesn't matter for LCM.\n\nNow, `gcd(a+k, d)` is really what I need to focus on. This means the GCD, which I'll call `g`, must be a divisor of `d`. This is a significant insight. If `d` is 0 then `a=b`, and the solution is trivial, `k=0`. So, let's look at the scenario where `d > 0`.\n\nThe relationship between `a+k` and `d` is now key. If `g` divides `d`, and also divides `a+k` then `a+k` needs to be some multiple of g; say `m1 * g` which means `a+k = m1 * g`, and then since `b+k = a+k+d`, `b+k = m2 * g`.\n\nGiven that `lcm(a+k,b+k) = (a+k)(b+k) / gcd(a+k,b+k)`, and I'm letting `g` represent `gcd(a+k, d)`, I need to find the `k` that minimizes this.\n\nThe plan is to iterate through all divisors, `g` of `d`. For each `g`, I'll find a `k` that makes `a+k` a multiple of `g`. That `k` would have to be calculated such that `k = ceil(a/g)*g - a`. And, since I'm going through all divisors of `d`, I can evaluate the LCM for each and pick the one with the smallest result. This should yield the optimal `k`. I'm confident that this strategy will efficiently pinpoint the desired minimum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\nUsing the property `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`, we have:\n`g = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nLet `d = |b-a|`. Without loss of generality, we can assume `a <= b`, so `d = b-a`. If `a > b`, we can swap `a` and `b` as `lcm` is symmetric.\nSo, `g = gcd(a+k, d)`. This implies that `g` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nThis observation is key: `g` must be a divisor of `d = |b-a|`.\nWe can iterate through all possible divisors `g` of `d`. For each `g`, we try to find the smallest `k` such that `gcd(a+k, d) = g` and `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized.\n\nFor a specific divisor `g` of `d`:\n1. We need `a+k` to be a multiple of `g`.\n   This means `a+k = m * g` for some integer `m`.\n   So, `k = m * g - a`.\n   Since `k` must be non-negative (`k >= 0`), we need `m * g >= a`.\n   The smallest multiple of `g` that is greater than or equal to `a` is `ceil(a/g) * g`.\n   Let `a_prime = ceil(a/g) * g`. This `a_prime` is the smallest value `a+k` can take for this `g` such that `k >= 0`.\n   The corresponding `k` is `k_candidate = a_prime - a`. This `k_candidate` is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\n\n2. With `k = k_candidate`, we have `a+k = a_prime`.\n   Then `b+k = a_prime + d`.\n   Now, we calculate `lcm(a_prime, a_prime + d) = (a_prime * (a_prime + d)) / gcd(a_prime, a_prime + d)`.\n   We know `gcd(a_prime, a_prime + d) = gcd(a_prime, d)`.\n   For `k_candidate` to be valid for this `g`, we must have `gcd(a_prime, d) = g`.\n   If `gcd(a_prime, d) != g`, then this `k_candidate` does not lead to `g` being the GCD of `a+k` and `b+k`. In this case, we need to find the next multiple of `g`, `a_prime + g`, and check its `gcd` with `d`, and so on.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to realize that `gcd(a+k, d)` *must* be a divisor of `d`.\nSo, for each divisor `g_val` of `d`:\nWe want `a+k` to be a multiple of `g_val`.\nThe smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this is `k = (g_val - (a % g_val)) % g_val`.\nWith this `k`, `a+k` becomes `a_new = a+k` and `b+k` becomes `b_new = b+k`.\nWe then calculate `current_lcm = lcm(a_new, b_new)`.\nWe keep track of the minimum `current_lcm` found so far and the smallest `k` that produced it.\n\nLet's trace this logic:\n1. Calculate `d = abs(b-a)`.\n2. If `d = 0`, then `a=b`. `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize this, we choose `k=0`. The answer is `0`.\n3. If `d > 0`:\n   Initialize `min_lcm = infinity` and `best_k = 0`.\n   Find all divisors of `d`. Let's call them `g_val`.\n   For each `g_val` in divisors of `d`:\n     `rem_a = a % g_val`\n     `k_candidate = (g_val - rem_a) % g_val`  (This ensures `a+k_candidate` is a multiple of `g_val`. If `rem_a` is 0, `k_candidate` is 0).\n     `val_a = a + k_candidate`\n     `val_b = b + k_candidate`\n     `current_lcm = (val_a // math.gcd(val_a, val_b)) * val_b` (This order avoids overflow for large `val_a * val_b` before division)\n     \n     If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n       `min_lcm = current_lcm`\n       `best_k = k_candidate`\n     Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n       `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)` (Choose the smallest `k`)\n\nExample: `a=6, b=10`\n`d = |10-6| = 4`.\nDivisors of 4 are `1, 2, 4`.\n\n- `g_val = 1`:\n  `rem_a = 6 % 1 = 0`\n  `k_candidate = (1 - 0) % 1 = 0`\n  `val_a = 6 + 0 = 6`\n  `val_b = 10 + 0 = 10`\n  `current_lcm = lcm(6, 10) = 30`\n  `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`\n\n- `g_val = 2`:\n  `rem_a = 6 % 2 = 0`\n  `k_candidate = (2 - 0) % 2 = 0`\n  `val_a = 6 + 0 = 6`\n  `val_b = 10 + 0 = 10`\n  `current_lcm = lcm(6, 10) = 30`\n  `min_lcm` is still 30. `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n- `g_val = 4`:\n  `rem_a = 6 % 4 = 2`\n  `k_candidate = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`\n  `val_a = 6 + 2 = 8`\n  `val_b = 10 + 2 = 12`\n  `current_lcm = lcm(8, 12) = 24`\n  `24 < 30`, so `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\nFinal answer for `(6, 10)` is `2`.\n\nThe number of divisors for `d` up to `2 * 10^9` is relatively small. The maximum number of divisors for a number less than or equal to `2 * 10^9` is for `1663200000 = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^5 * 7 * 11`, which has `7*4*6*2*2 = 1008` divisors. This is efficient enough.\n\nThe `gcd` function is in `math` module. `lcm` is not directly available, but `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`. To prevent overflow when `x*y` can exceed `2^63-1` (which is possible for `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`), we should compute it as `(x // gcd(x, y)) * y`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # If a and b are equal, lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, k must be 0.\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b to simplify d = b-a\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    d = b - a\n\n    min_lcm_val = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n\n    # Find all divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    \n    # Iterate through each divisor g_val of d\n    # For each g_val, we want a+k to be a multiple of g_val.\n    # The smallest non-negative k that achieves this is (g_val - (a % g_val)) % g_val.\n    for g_val in divisors:\n        # Calculate k such that (a + k) is a multiple of g_val\n        # If a % g_val is 0, k_candidate is 0.\n        # Otherwise, k_candidate is g_val - (a % g_val).\n        k_candidate = (g_val - (a % g_val)) % g_val\n        \n        val_a = a + k_candidate\n        val_b = b + k_candidate\n        \n        # Calculate LCM: lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n        # To prevent potential overflow if x*y is very large, compute as (x // gcd(x, y)) * y\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(val_a, val_b)\n        current_lcm = (val_a // current_gcd) * val_b\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm_val:\n            min_lcm_val = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm_val:\n            # If LCMs are equal, choose the smallest k\n            best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
