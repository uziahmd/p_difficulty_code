Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, which is basically a simulation challenge. Vasily starts with 'a' candles. Each burns for an hour, then becomes a \"went out\" candle. The trick is he can combine 'b' of these spent candles to get a new one.  I need to maximize the total burn time.\n\nMy thought process is breaking this down into a simulation. I need to keep track of a few key things:\n\n*   `total_hours`: This is the target, the final answer.\n*   `current_new_candles`: How many new, unburned candles are available right now.\n*   `burned_out_candles`: The pile of spent candles waiting to be recycled.\n\nHere's the algorithm I've devised:\n\n1.  Start with `total_hours = 0`, `current_new_candles = a`, and `burned_out_candles = 0`.\n2.  Loop while `current_new_candles > 0`:\n    a.  Add the current candles to the total time: `total_hours += current_new_candles`.\n    b.  All `current_new_candles` become `burned_out_candles`.\n    c.  Reset `current_new_candles = 0`.\n    d.  Calculate how many new candles are made from the spent ones: `new_candles_from_recycled = burned_out_candles // b`.\n    e.  Update the remaining spent candles: `burned_out_candles = burned_out_candles % b`.\n    f.  Add the new recycled candles to the pool: `current_new_candles += new_candles_from_recycled`.\n3.  The final value of `total_hours` is my solution.\n\nI went through an example with `a = 4` and `b = 2` to verify my logic. Each iteration correctly tracks the number of burning candles, how many become spent, and the number recycled. I'm pretty sure this iterative approach will get me the optimal solution. I can quickly translate this into Python for the implementation.\n",
