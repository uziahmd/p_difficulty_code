For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script that can tell me whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or something \"strange.\" I'm familiar with music theory, so the basic concepts are straightforward, but I need to translate them into a logical process.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes themselves. Using integers makes calculating semitone distances much easier. I'll map C to 0, C# to 1, and so on, up to H as 11.  A simple dictionary or list would work fine for this.\n\nNext, the distance calculation.  Remembering that the notes are cyclic, I'll use the modulo operator to correctly calculate the distance in semitones. So, the distance from note `n1` to `n2` will be `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`.  This handles the wraparound case perfectly.\n\nNow, the input. I'll get three note strings. The order doesn't matter since it's an unordered set.  To simplify the logic, I'll convert the strings to integers and *sort* them. Let's call them `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` where `n1 <= n2 <= n3`.\n\nNow for the core of the classification. I'll calculate the semitone distances between the notes.  Let's define:\n\n*   `d1 = (n2 - n1)`\n*   `d2 = (n3 - n2)`\n*   `d3 = (n1 - n3 + 12) % 12` (or simply `12 - (n3 - n1)`)\n\nI know these distances will *always* sum to 12.  So, I can use a set of conditions based on the distances to determine the triad type.\n\nIf either `d1` and `d2` match the major (4, 3) pattern or the minor (3, 4) pattern, I can classify the chord. If neither pattern matches, it's \"strange\".  Since the problem guarantees no ambiguity, I shouldn't need any complex logic to handle edge cases. It should be pretty straightforward. I think I'm ready to start writing the Python code now!\n",
    "response": "The problem requires classifying a three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" based on the semitone distances between its notes.\n\nFirst, we need to map the given note names to numerical values (0-11) to easily calculate semitone distances. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. We can assign C=0, C#=1, ..., H=11.\n\nThe distance between two notes `n1` and `n2` (where `n1` and `n2` are their numerical representations) going upwards is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`.\n\nA major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that `Distance(X, Y) = 4` semitones and `Distance(Y, Z) = 3` semitones.\nA minor triad has notes X, Y, Z such that `Distance(X, Y) = 3` semitones and `Distance(Y, Z) = 4` semitones.\n\nSince the input triad is an unordered set of three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of the notes to see if any of them fit the major or minor pattern. There are 3! = 6 permutations for three notes. However, a more efficient approach is to calculate the three cyclic distances between the notes.\n\nLet the three notes be `N1, N2, N3`.\n1. Convert these notes to their integer representations `n1, n2, n3`.\n2. Sort these integers: `a, b, c`.\n3. Calculate the three intervals:\n   * `interval1 = b - a`\n   * `interval2 = c - b`\n   * `interval3 = 12 - (c - a)` (this is the distance from `c` back to `a` cyclically)\n   These three intervals `(interval1, interval2, interval3)` represent the semitone distances between the notes when arranged in ascending order and wrapping around. The sum of these three intervals will always be 12.\n\nNow, we check if any permutation of these three intervals matches the major (4, 3, X) or minor (3, 4, X) pattern.\nA major chord has intervals (4, 3) between the root, third, and fifth. When considering the cyclic distances `(interval1, interval2, interval3)`, this means we are looking for the sequence (4, 3, 5) in some cyclic permutation.\nSimilarly, a minor chord has intervals (3, 4) between the root, third, and fifth. This means we are looking for the sequence (3, 4, 5) in some cyclic permutation.\n\nSo, we check if `(interval1, interval2, interval3)` (or its cyclic shifts) matches `(4, 3, 5)` for major or `(3, 4, 5)` for minor.\n\nExample: C E G\n* C=0, E=4, G=7\n* Sorted: (0, 4, 7)\n* `interval1 = 4 - 0 = 4`\n* `interval2 = 7 - 4 = 3`\n* `interval3 = 12 - (7 - 0) = 5`\n* Intervals: (4, 3, 5). This matches the major pattern.\n\nExample: C# B F\n* C#=1, B=10, F=5\n* Sorted: (1, 5, 10)\n* `interval1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n* `interval2 = 10 - 5 = 5`\n* `interval3 = 12 - (10 - 1) = 3`\n* Intervals: (4, 5, 3).\n* Check cyclic shifts: (4, 5, 3), (5, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5).\n* (3, 4, 5) matches the minor pattern.\n\nThe problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\n    # Mapping notes to integers (0-11)\n    note_to_int = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    # Convert input notes to integers and sort them\n    n_values = sorted([note_to_int[n] for n in notes_str])\n\n    # Calculate the three intervals between the sorted notes\n    # interval1: distance from first to second note\n    # interval2: distance from second to third note\n    # interval3: distance from third note back to first note (cyclically)\n    intervals = [\n        n_values[1] - n_values[0],\n        n_values[2] - n_values[1],\n        12 - (n_values[2] - n_values[0])\n    ]\n\n    # Define the characteristic interval patterns for major and minor chords\n    # These represent the distances (root-third, third-fifth, fifth-root_octave)\n    major_pattern = (4, 3, 5)\n    minor_pattern = (3, 4, 5)\n\n    # Check for major chord\n    # We check all cyclic permutations of the calculated intervals\n    # (i1, i2, i3), (i2, i3, i1), (i3, i1, i2)\n    if (tuple(intervals) == major_pattern or\n        (intervals[1], intervals[2], intervals[0]) == major_pattern or\n        (intervals[2], intervals[0], intervals[1]) == major_pattern):\n        print(\"major\")\n        return\n\n    # Check for minor chord\n    if (tuple(intervals) == minor_pattern or\n        (intervals[1], intervals[2], intervals[0]) == minor_pattern or\n        (intervals[2], intervals[0], intervals[1]) == minor_pattern):\n        print(\"minor\")\n        return\n\n    # If neither major nor minor, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
