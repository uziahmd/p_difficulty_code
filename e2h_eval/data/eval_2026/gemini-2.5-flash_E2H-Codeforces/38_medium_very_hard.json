    "thought": "**Algorithm for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this problem.  I'm trying to figure out two things: the minimum number of nodes (N) for a directed graph that has a specific reachability property, and then, given that minimum, how many unidirectional pairs I can jam into that graph.\n\nFirst, the reachability condition.  We're given 'p', which represents the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u is less than v, and u and v are reachable from each other. \"Reachable from each other\" means there's a path both *from* u *to* v, and from v *back to* u – they're in the same strongly connected component (SCC). So, the key is understanding how SCCs contribute to this count.\n\nIf I've got an SCC with 'k' nodes, every pair of distinct nodes within it contributes to 'p'. There are k*(k-1) such pairs. However, the problem specifies u < v, which halves this count when we consider unordered pairs.  So, each SCC of size 'k' contributes k*(k-1)/2 to our 'p' value.\n\nTo minimize 'N', the total number of nodes, I want to use the fewest, largest SCCs possible.  The function k*(k-1)/2 grows quadratically. The sum of fewer larger numbers adds to a smaller number than the sum of many small numbers for any fixed \"p\" value. Thus, I need to keep creating the largest SCC I can such that it does not exceed the allowed \"p\" value.\n\nLet's say I've got my minimum 'N'. Now I want maximum unidirectional pairs.  This means pairs (u, v) where there's a path from u to v, but *no* path from v to u.  To maximize this, I should arrange my SCCs in a chain: S1 -> S2 -> S3, etc.  This structure means any node in an earlier SCC (like S1) *can* reach any node in a later one (like S3), but nodes in S3 can't reach S1.  Therefore, I want my SCCs lined up to get all these unidirectional relationships going.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is then the sum of the product of the size of each pair of SCCs where i < j. Mathematically, it's something like (N^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2, where the k_i are the sizes of the SCCs.\n\nIn summary, the algorithm goes like this:  I figure out the SCC sizes using my greedy approach (always taking the largest size k such that k*(k-1)/2 <= p), calculate N, and then plug the SCC sizes into my unidirectional pairs formula to get the final answer. The edge case \"p=0\" should be handled as N=0; for all other cases, the logic handles the minimum and maximum properly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `N`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n- A pair `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there's a path from `u` to `v`, and there's no path from `v` to `u`.\n- A graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. The condition \"reachable from each other\" means there's a path `u -> v` AND a path `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). The condition `u < v` means we are counting unordered pairs `{u, v}` where `u` and `v` are in the same SCC.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `N`**\n\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nLet the graph consist of `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `N = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`. The total `p` value contributed by these SCCs is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` for `i = 1 to m`.\n\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we want to use the fewest possible nodes to generate `p` pairs. The function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` represents the number of pairs generated by an SCC of size `k`. This function grows quadratically with `k`. To minimize the sum `sum(k_i)` for a fixed `sum(f(k_i))`, we should make the `k_i` values as large as possible. This is a greedy approach:\n1. Start with `N_min = 0` and `current_p = p`.\n2. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p`. This `k` can be found by solving `k^2 - k - 2 * current_p <= 0` for `k`, which gives `k <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2`. We take `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)`.\n   b. Add `k` to `N_min`.\n   c. Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `current_p`.\n   d. Store `k` in a list of SCC sizes (e.g., `scc_sizes`) for Part 2.\n3. If `p = 0`, the loop won't run, and `N_min` will be 0. The problem example for `p=0` yields `0 0`, indicating that a graph with 0 nodes is considered valid for `p=0`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n- `current_p = 4`. Largest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 4` is `k=3` (`f(3)=3`).\n  `N_min = 3`. `scc_sizes = [3]`. `current_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n- `current_p = 1`. Largest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 1` is `k=2` (`f(2)=1`).\n  `N_min = 3 + 2 = 5`. `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`. `current_p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\nLoop terminates. Minimum `N = 5`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nWe have determined the minimum `N` and the list of SCC sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` (stored in `scc_sizes`). To maximize unidirectional pairs, we should arrange these SCCs in a chain (a directed acyclic graph, or DAG). For example, `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`.\nIn this configuration:\n- For any `u` in `S_i` and `v` in `S_j` where `i < j`: there is a path `u -> v` (via the chain of SCCs), and no path `v -> u` (because it's a DAG of SCCs). Thus, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair. There are `k_i * k_j` such pairs.\n- For any `u` in `S_j` and `v` in `S_i` where `i < j`: there is no path `u -> v`. Thus, `(u, v)` is not a unidirectional pair.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is the sum of `k_i * k_j` for all `1 <= i < j <= m`.\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently:\n`sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j) = ( (sum_{i=1 to m} k_i)^2 - sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i^2) ) / 2`.\nSince `sum_{i=1 to m} k_i = N_min`, this simplifies to `(N_min^2 - sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n- `N_min = 5`, `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\n- `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n- `max_unidirectional = (5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Use `math.sqrt` for square root calculation.\n- Integer division `//` should be used to ensure integer results.\n- Handle the `p = 0` edge case explicitly as per the problem example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    # Handle the special case p = 0\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    n_min = 0\n    scc_sizes = []\n    current_p = p\n\n    # Part 1: Calculate minimum N and the sizes of SCCs\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # This is equivalent to solving k^2 - k - 2 * current_p <= 0\n        # The positive root of k^2 - k - 2 * current_p = 0 is (1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2\n        # We take the floor of this value to get the largest integer k.\n        k_val = int(math.floor((1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2))\n        \n        # An SCC must have at least 2 nodes to contribute to p (k*(k-1)/2 > 0)\n        # If current_p is 1, k_val will be 2. f(2) = 1.\n        # If k_val turns out to be 0 or 1, it means current_p is 0, which is handled by the loop condition.\n        \n        n_min += k_val\n        scc_sizes.append(k_val)\n        current_p -= (k_val * (k_val - 1)) // 2\n    \n    # Part 2: Calculate maximum unidirectional pairs\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved by arranging SCCs in a chain.\n    # For SCCs S_1, S_2, ..., S_m with sizes k_1, k_2, ..., k_m,\n    # if we have S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m, then for any u in S_i and v in S_j (i < j),\n    # (u, v) is a unidirectional pair.
