A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Soft Drinking\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this.  It's a resource allocation problem, but cleverly disguised. The core is figuring out which resource limits how many toasts we can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: the number of friends (`n`), the drink-related stats (`k`, `l`, `nl`), the lime stats (`c`, `d`), and the salt stats (`p`, `np`). Each of these can act as a bottleneck.\n\nThe key is to think in \"toasts per friend\" or \"total portions.\"  How many toasts *could* be made with each resource if the others weren't a constraint?\n\nFor the drink, I'll calculate the total milliliters available (`k * l`) and then divide that by the milliliters needed per toast per friend (`nl`).  That gives me the theoretical *total* number of toasts that *could* be made with the drink. It's essentially the number of \"portions\" of drink, or the number of toasts *possible for one person from drink alone*.\n\nSimilarly, for limes, it's `c * d` (total slices), representing portions, and salt `p // np`.  Integer division is crucial here because we can't make fractions of toasts.\n\nThe *limiting factor* among these three calculations determines the maximum number of *total* toasts across all the friends.  It's the smallest of those three values, representing the total number of \"portions\" available.\n\nSince all `n` friends drink the same amount, I then need to divide this total by `n` to get the toasts per friend, again using integer division. That's the final answer.\n\nThe constraints are good: small integers, no division by zero issues, and no overflow problems. The input and output formats are simple. A Python script should be straightforward.  I'll read the input, split and convert to integers, do the calculations, and print the result. The sample cases confirm the overall logic, so I believe this approach is correct.\n",
