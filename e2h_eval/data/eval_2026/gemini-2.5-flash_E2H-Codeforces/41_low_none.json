There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to write a Python script that takes `n`, `h`, and `m` as input, followed by `m` lines of restrictions (`l_i`, `r_i`, `x_i`), and outputs the maximum achievable profit. The profit from a house of height `a` is simply `a^2`.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the problem.  The key constraints are the number of spots (`n`), the maximum height (`h`), and the number of restrictions (`m`), all of which are relatively small (<= 50). This suggests a polynomial time complexity solution is likely feasible, something like `O(n * h * m)` or `O(n * h^2)`.\n\nNow, let's analyze these restrictions. Each `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` means the tallest house within the range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.  But here's a crucial insight: if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the height of the house at that spot is constrained by the *minimum* of the `x_i` values associated with those restrictions.\n\nThis leads me to a strategy. I can create an array `max_allowed_height` of size `n`. Initially, I set all elements to `h`, the maximum possible height. Then, I iterate through each restriction. For each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, I iterate over the spots within the range `[l_i, r_i]` and update `max_allowed_height[j]` to be the minimum of its current value and `x_i`.  This ensures that after processing all restrictions, `max_allowed_height[j]` holds the absolute maximum height that house `j` can have while still satisfying *all* relevant restrictions.\n\nSince the profit function, `a^2`, is monotonically increasing, it's always optimal to build each house as tall as the restrictions allow. Therefore, the maximum profit is simply the sum of the squares of the `max_allowed_height[j]` values for each spot `j`.\n\nTo solidify this, let's trace through an example. Suppose `n=3, h=3, m=3` and the restrictions are `(1,1,1)`, `(2,2,3)`, and `(3,3,2)`.  I'd initialize `max_allowed_height` to `[3, 3, 3]`. Processing the first restriction, it updates `max_allowed_height[0]` to `1`, so it becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.  The second doesn't change `max_allowed_height`. The third updates `max_allowed_height[2]` to `2`, giving us `[1, 3, 2]`. The total profit is `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`. This should work!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house of integer height `a` between `0` and `h`, inclusive. The profit from a house of height `a` is `a^2`. We are also given `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that the tallest house in the range of spots from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and objective:\n1.  **Profit Maximization**: The profit `a^2` is a strictly increasing function for `a >= 0`. This means to maximize profit, we should always choose the largest possible height for each house, subject to all restrictions.\n2.  **Zoning Restrictions**: A restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` implies that for *every* spot `j` such that `l_i \\le j \\le r_i`, the height of the house at spot `j` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nConsider a single spot `j`. Its height, let's call it `H_j`, must satisfy several conditions:\n*   `0 \\le H_j \\le h` (general height limit).\n*   For every restriction `k` such that spot `j` falls within its range (`l_k \\le j \\le r_k`), `H_j` must be at most `x_k`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, its height `H_j` must be less than or equal to `h` and less than or equal to all `x_k` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`. Therefore, the maximum possible height for house `j` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_k` values from restrictions covering `j`.\n\nLet's denote `max_height_for_spot[j]` as the maximum allowed height for the house at spot `j`.\nWe can initialize `max_height_for_spot[j] = h` for all spots `j` from `1` to `n`. This accounts for the general height limit.\nThen, we iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\nFor every spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive), we update `max_height_for_spot[j] = min(max_height_for_spot[j], x_i)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_height_for_spot[j]` will contain the maximum permissible height for the house at spot `j` that satisfies all given conditions. Since we want to maximize profit and `a^2` is increasing, we simply choose `max_height_for_spot[j]` as the height for house `j`.\n\nThe total maximum profit will be the sum of `(max_height_for_spot[j])^2` for all spots `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Read `n`, `h`, `m`.\n2.  Create an array `max_height_for_spot` of size `n`, initialized with `h` for all elements. (Using 0-indexed internally, so spots `0` to `n-1` correspond to `1` to `n`).\n3.  For each of the `m` restrictions:\n    a.  Read `l_i`, `r_i`, `x_i`.\n    b.  Adjust `l_i` and `r_i` to be 0-indexed: `l_i = l_i - 1`, `r_i = r_i - 1`.\n    c.  Iterate `j` from `l_i` to `r_i`:\n        i.  `max_height_for_spot[j] = min(max_height_for_spot[j], x_i)`\n4.  Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n5.  Iterate `j` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    a.  `total_profit += max_height_for_spot[j] * max_height_for_spot[j]`\n6.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\n`max_height_for_spot = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 0, 1, 2)\n\nRestrictions:\n1.  `l=1, r=1, x=1` (0-indexed: `l=0, r=0, x=1`)\n    *   `max_height_for_spot[0] = min(max_height_for_spot[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    *   `max_height_for_spot` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`\n2.  `l=2, r=2, x=3` (0-indexed: `l=1, r=1, x=3`)\n    *   `max_height_for_spot[1] = min(max_height_for_spot[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`\n    *   `max_height_for_spot` remains `[1, 3, 3]`\n3.  `l=3, r=3, x=2` (0-indexed: `l=2, r=2, x=2`)\n    *   `max_height_for_spot[2] = min(max_height_for_spot[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`\n    *   `max_height_for_spot` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`\n\nCalculate total profit:\n`1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: `O(n)`\n*   Processing `m` restrictions: Each restriction involves iterating from `l_i` to `r_i`. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, `m` restrictions can take `O(m * n)` time.\n*   Calculating total profit: `O(n)`\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\nGiven `n, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(n)` for `max_height_for_spot` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_height_for_spot for each house.\n    # Initially, each house can be built up to height 'h'.\n    # We use 0-indexed array for convenience, so spot i corresponds to house_heights[i-1].\n    max_height_for_spot = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust to 0-indexed for array access\n        # The problem states spots are 1 to n, so l-1 to r-1 in 0-indexed\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            # For each spot in the range [l, r], its height must be at most x.\n            # We take the minimum of its current maximum allowed height and x.\n            max_height_for_spot[i] = min(max_height_for_spot[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_height_for_spot:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
