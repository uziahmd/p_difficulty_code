Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on the \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it looks like a straightforward simulation.  Vasily has some new candles, and he can trade burnt-out ones for new ones. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.  I need a Python script to solve this.\n\nI'm thinking I'll need to keep track of a few things: the total hours the room is lit, the number of new candles, and the accumulated burnt-out candles. The process is clear: burn the candles, add the burnt ones, craft new candles, repeat until there's nothing left to burn or craft.\n\nI worked through the provided example (a=4, b=2) to solidify the steps.  It looks like this iterative burning and crafting is the key.  I sketched out the variable updates at each stage.\n\nThe algorithm itself seems simple: a `while` loop that runs as long as there are candles to burn. Inside the loop, I'll update the number of total hours, the burnt-out candles, and the available new candles based on the candle crafting. I'll take care to use the floor division `//` and the modulo `%` operators to correctly handle the crafting and the remainder.\n\nThe constraints on `a` and `b` (up to 1000) mean the simulation will be fast enough, even for large inputs. I'll need to handle multiple test cases in the input, too.  That's easy; I'll use `sys.stdin` to read each input line and parse the numbers.\n\nI've tested the example (a=4, b=2) and another example (a=6, b=3) and verified that the output looks correct. I traced the execution flow to be sure that the loop and the candle creation are working correctly.  I've double-checked my work.\nFinally I'll write the code and remove all the unnecessary comments. The \"very hard\" tag seems a bit misleading here. It's a nice little simulation exercise, maybe tricky for beginners, but not \"very hard\" in the typical competitive programming sense.\n",
