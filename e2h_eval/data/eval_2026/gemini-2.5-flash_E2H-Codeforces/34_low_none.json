And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the average sleep time across all possible weeks for Polycarp.  A \"week\" here is simply `k` consecutive days, and I'm given `n` days of sleep records: `a1, a2, ..., an`. The core challenge is to efficiently compute this average.\n\nI recognize that there are `n - k + 1` weeks to consider. Each week, let's call it the *i*-th week, starts at day `i` and ends at day `i + k - 1`. The sum of sleep times for the *i*-th week, `S_i`, is the sum of the sleep times from `a_i` to `a_{i+k-1}`.  The overall goal is to find the average, which is simply `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nInitially, I thought of a brute-force approach: iterate through each possible week and sum the sleep times within that week. That would involve summing `k` values for each of the `n - k + 1` weeks.  This gives a time complexity of `O((n-k+1) * k)`, which could become `O(n^2)` in the worst case (when `k` is roughly `n/2`). Given the constraints of `n` being up to 2 * 10^5, `O(n^2)` is going to be far too slow, so I need to optimize.\n\nThen, I started thinking about ways to make the calculation of `S_i` more efficient.  I realized I could employ a sliding window sum or, more elegantly, prefix sums. The prefix sum method seems like the best approach here. If I calculate the prefix sums, `P`, where `P[j]` is the sum of `a[0]` through `a[j-1]`, I can then compute the sum for any subarray in constant time!\n\nWith prefix sums, `S_i` (the sum of elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` in `a`) becomes `P[i+k] - P[i]`. So, generating all `P` values takes `O(n)` time, and calculating each `S_i` is `O(1)`. The total sum of all weeks is still `O(n-k+1)`. Thus, I can achieve an `O(n)` solution overall.  This is much better than the naive approach. This looks quite promising! I should test it out with a small example to make sure the math checks out. I'm ready to code this up!\n",
