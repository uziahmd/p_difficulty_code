On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the LNDS Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's asking for the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence after a subsegment reversal in a sequence of 1s and 2s. The core challenge here is that by reversing a section, I'm essentially playing with the ordering of those 1s and 2s within that subsegment, which affects how they contribute to my longest non-decreasing sequence.\n\nI immediately see that since we're dealing with just 1s and 2s, the LNDS structure is pretty predictable: it'll look like a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s. That's the key. My goal is to maximize the number of 1s and 2s I can fit into that structure.\n\nThe reversal complicates things, but not by much. It effectively splits the sequence into three parts: a prefix, a reversed middle segment, and a suffix.  My brain goes to counting. I'm thinking I'll need some precomputed counts. I'll need to know the number of 1s and 2s in prefixes and suffixes to efficiently calculate potential LNDS lengths.  I'm envisioning arrays like `count1_prefix`, `count2_prefix`, `count1_suffix`, and `count2_suffix` to store this information. This precomputation will be crucial for quick lookups during my search for the optimal subsegment `[l, r]`.\n\nThe core logic then becomes: I need to pick some 1s from the prefix, then some 1s from the reversed segment, then some 2s from the reversed segment, and finally some 2s from the suffix. All the 1s must come *before* all the 2s, which is a classic observation to exploit.\nI can then use `ones_before[i]` and `twos_after[i]` to assist with finding this optimal subsegment. I'm beginning to see the outline of my dynamic programming or sliding window approach here... the goal is to systematically iterate through all possible subsegments `[l, r]` and track the maximum LNDS length achievable for each.  The precomputed counts will be essential for making this process efficient. Now, I need to figure out the best way to combine those counts into a concise algorithm.\n",
