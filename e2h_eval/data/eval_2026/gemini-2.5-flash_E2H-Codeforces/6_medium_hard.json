Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this competitive programming problem:**\n\nI need to find the minimum cost for two non-overlapping vouchers that sum to a target duration *x*. This seems like a search problem, with some geometric constraints. The straightforward approach, checking all pairs, is too slow, given the constraints.  I need something smarter.\n\nMy thought process is to first try a sweep-line approach. It's often effective with interval problems. I'll sort by start or end times, process events, and keep track of minimums seen so far. The challenge here is keeping the cost minimal while making sure the durations add up and the vouchers don't overlap.\n\nI start by looking at a naive O(N^2) solution to understand the problem. I iterate through all pairs and check if the non-overlapping condition is met. The conditions are ri < lj OR rj < li, along with a sum duration of x.\n\nI quickly realize the key to making this faster is fixing one voucher and seeing if I can find an efficient way to find the other voucher. Sorting seems like a good move. Sorting by start time (li) or end time (ri) is tempting, to try a sweep-line. \n\nI then consider sorting by the start day li. If I have sorted all vouchers by li, I need to consider cases where j is before i, and j is after i. To consider the case where j is before i, I have to efficiently query vouchers that have rj < li. \n\nI try to visualize and find a way to make the non-overlapping condition. I am trying to use a minimum cost for duration d that ends before r. I try many ideas such as creating tables that stores many conditions. This will lead to too much state. \n\nI come back to the sweep-line and come up with an approach. I have come up with two data structures: min_cost_ending_before_day and min_cost_starting_after_day. These data structures are still too much because the amount of space required is too big. \n\nI have now simplified to an approach that updates the costs of each voucher with a duration and processes vouchers that end and start on that day.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers `i` and `j` such that:\n1.  They do not intersect. This means either voucher `i` ends before voucher `j` begins (`ri < lj`), or voucher `j` ends before voucher `i` begins (`rj < li`).\n2.  The sum of their durations is exactly `x`. The duration of a voucher `k` is `rk - lk + 1`. So, `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x`.\n3.  Their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and conditions:\n*   `n, x <= 2 * 10^5`\n*   `li, ri <= 2 * 10^5`\n*   `costi <= 10^9`\n\nA naive `O(N^2)` approach of checking all pairs of vouchers would be too slow. We need a more efficient solution, likely `O(N log N)` or `O(N + MaxCoord)`, where `MaxCoord` is the maximum possible day (`2 * 10^5`).\n\nThe non-overlapping condition `ri < lj` or `rj < li` implies that there must be a gap between the two chosen vouchers. This structure often suggests a sweep-line algorithm.\n\nLet's fix one of the non-overlapping conditions, say `ri < lj`. The other condition `rj < li` is symmetric. If we find the minimum cost for `ri < lj`, we will implicitly find the minimum cost for `rj < li` because the roles of `i` and `j` are interchangeable.\n\nConsider a sweep-line approach iterating through days from `1` to `MAX_COORD` (where `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5` is the maximum possible `r` or `l` value).\nLet `min_cost_for_duration[d]` be an array that stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended*. That is, for a given `day` in the sweep, `min_cost_for_duration[d]` holds `min(cost_k)` for all vouchers `k` such that `rk < day` and `rk - lk + 1 = d`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Structures**:\n    *   `vouchers_by_start_day`: A list of lists, where `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` contains `(r, cost, duration)` for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_end_day`: A list of lists, where `vouchers_by_end_day[day]` contains `(l, cost, duration)` for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: An array of size `x + 1`, initialized to infinity. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has completed *before* the current sweep-line day.\n    *   `min_total_cost`: Initialize to infinity. This will store the overall minimum combined cost.\n\n2.  **Preprocessing**:\n    *   Read `n` and `x`.\n    *   Populate `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`. For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`, calculate its `duration = r - l + 1`. Add `(r, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_start_day[l]` and `(l, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_end_day[r]`.\n    *   The maximum coordinate `MAX_COORD` is `2 * 10^5`.\n\n3.  **Sweep Line**: Iterate `current_day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`:\n    *   **Step 1: Update `min_cost_for_duration` for vouchers ending on `current_day - 1`**:\n        For each voucher `(l, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[current_day - 1]`:\n            If `duration < x` (because the other voucher must have a positive duration), update `min_cost_for_duration[duration] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration], cost)`.\n            This step makes vouchers that have just ended available for selection as the first voucher `i` in a pair `(i, j)` where `ri < lj`.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Check for pairs with vouchers starting on `current_day`**:\n        For each voucher `(r, cost, duration_j)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n            Calculate the required duration for the first voucher: `duration_i = x - duration_j`.\n            If `1 <= duration_i < x` (ensuring `duration_i` is a valid positive duration):\n                If `min_cost_for_duration[duration_i]` is not infinity (meaning we found a suitable first voucher `i` that ended before `current_day`):\n                    Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost + min_cost_for_duration[duration_i])`.\n            This step considers vouchers starting on `current_day` as the second voucher `j` in a pair `(i, j)` where `ri < lj`.\n\n4.  **Result**:\n    After the sweep, if `min_total_cost` is still infinity, it means no valid pair was found, so print -1.
