The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face. It looks like a graph problem where I need to take `n`, `k`, and a bunch of edges as input and spit out `k` district numbers to remove. The core is really about optimizing the remaining fan count.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The problem tells me the districts and roads form a tree, which simplifies things. Each contestant has fans equal to `2^i`, and I need to strategically remove `k` districts, blocking their paths and leaving the rest connected. My objective? Maximize the total number of fans remaining. This boils down to maximizing the sum of `2^i` for the districts that survive.\n\nSince `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`, it's clear I want to keep the districts with the highest indices. The real challenge is satisfying the connectivity constraint - the remaining districts must form a connected component in the tree. This basically means I'm looking for the largest possible connected component in the original tree after removing `k` districts.\n\nSo I've got `n - k` districts to keep, and those need to form a connected group. The goal is to maximize the sum of `2^i` values for these districts. Keeping the highest-indexed districts is the key, because a single district with a large index will dominate the sum.\n\nI'm thinking a greedy approach might be viable. Let's start with the largest district, `n`. If I can keep it, great. Now I need to select `n - k - 1` more districts that stay connected to `n`. I'll grab `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, as long as adding them keeps the set connected. This feels promising - iteratively adding the highest-indexed districts that maintain connectivity. Seems like a solid plan.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree, such that the sum of `2^i` for these districts is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe total number of fans for a district `i` is `2^i`. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i` (e.g., `2^N > sum(2^1, ..., 2^(N-1))`), to maximize the total sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger numbers. This means we want to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, as much as possible, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach:\n1.  Initialize an empty set `kept_districts` and a list `removed_districts`.\n2.  Iterate through districts from `n` down to `1`.\n3.  For each district `i`:\n    *   If `len(kept_districts)` is already `n-k`, we must remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n    *   Otherwise, check if adding district `i` to `kept_districts` would maintain connectivity.\n        *   If `kept_districts` is empty, we can always add `i` (it becomes the first district in our component).\n        *   If `kept_districts` is not empty, `i` can be added if it is adjacent to at least one district already in `kept_districts`.\n    *   If `i` can be added while maintaining connectivity and `len(kept_districts) < n-k`, add `i` to `kept_districts`.\n    *   Otherwise (if `i` cannot be added while maintaining connectivity, or if `len(kept_districts)` is already `n-k`), we must remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n\nAfter iterating through all districts from `n` down to `1`, `removed_districts` will contain the `k` districts to be removed. Sort them in increasing order and print them.\n\nTo efficiently check adjacency and connectivity:\nWe can use a `set` for `kept_districts` for `O(1)` average time lookups. For each district `i`, we iterate through its neighbors. If any neighbor is in `kept_districts`, then `i` can connect to the component.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Build an adjacency list representation of the tree. Let `adj[u]` be a list of neighbors of district `u`.\n3.  Initialize an empty set `kept_districts_set`.\n4.  Initialize an empty list `removed_districts_list`.\n5.  Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   If `len(kept_districts_set) == n - k`:\n        *   Add `i` to `removed_districts_list`.\n        *   Continue to the next `i`.\n    *   `can_add_i = False`\n    *   If `len(kept_districts_set) == 0`:\n        *   `can_add_i = True` (The first district can always be added)\n    *   Else:\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `i` (i.e., `v` in `adj[i]`):\n            *   If `v` is in `kept_districts_set`:\n                *   `can_add_i = True`\n                *   Break from this inner loop (no need to check other neighbors)\n    *   If `can_add_i`:\n        *   Add `i` to `kept_districts_set`.\n    *   Else (`can_add_i` is false):\n        *   Add `i` to `removed_districts_list`.\n6.  Sort `removed_districts_list` in increasing order.\n7.  Print the elements of `removed_districts_list` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\nWe need to keep `n-k = 6-3 = 3` districts.\n\n1.  `i = 6`: `kept_districts_set` is empty. `can_add_i = True`. Add `6`. `kept_districts_set = {6}`.\n2.  `i = 5`: `kept_districts_set = {6}`. Neighbor `6` is in `kept_districts_set`. `can_add_i = True`. Add `5`. `kept_districts_set = {6, 5}`.\n3.  `i = 4`: `kept_districts_set = {6, 5}`. Neighbor `2` is *not* in `kept_districts_set`. No other neighbors. `can_add_i = False`. Add `4` to `removed_districts_list`. `removed_districts_list = [4]`.\n4.  `i = 3`: `kept_districts_set = {6, 5}`. Neighbor `2` is *not* in `kept_districts_set`. No other neighbors. `can_add_i = False`. Add `3` to `removed_districts_list`. `removed_districts_list = [4, 3]`.\n5.  `i = 2`: `kept_districts_set = {6, 5}`. Neighbor `6` is in `kept_districts_set`. `can_add_i = True`. Add `2`. `kept_districts_set = {6, 5, 2}`.\n6.  `i = 1`: `len(kept_districts_set)` is `3`, which is `n-k`. So, add `1` to `removed_districts_list`. `removed_districts_list = [4, 3, 1]`.\n\nAll districts processed.\nSort `removed_districts_list`: `[1, 3, 4]`.\nPrint: `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N)` for `N-1` edges.\n*   Loop `i` from `N` down to `1`: `N` iterations.\n    *   Inside the loop: `len(kept_districts_set)` check is `O(1)`.\n    *   Iterating neighbors: In total, for all `i`, this will iterate through each edge twice (once for each endpoint). So, `sum(degree(i))` is `2 * (N-1)`, which is `O(N)`.\n    *   Set lookup (`v in kept_districts_set`) and insertion (`add(i)`) are `O(1)` on average.\n*   Sorting `removed_districts_list`: `O(k log k)`. Since `k < N`, this is `O(N log N)` in the worst case.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting, or `O(N)` if `k` is small enough that `k log k` is dominated by `N`.\nTotal space complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, `kept_districts_set`, and `removed_districts_list`.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `O(N log N)` is acceptable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    kept_districts_set = set()\n    removed_districts_list = []\n\n    # Iterate districts from n down to 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        # If we have already kept n-k districts, all remaining (smaller indexed) districts must be removed.\n        if len(kept_districts_set) == n - k:\n            removed_districts_list.append(i)\n            continue\n\n        can_add_i = False\n        if not kept_districts_set:\n            # If no districts are kept yet, this is the first one, so it can always be added.\n            can_add_i = True\n        else:\n            # Check if district i is adjacent to any district already in the kept component.\n            for neighbor in adj[i]:\n                if neighbor in kept_districts_set:\n                    can_add_i = True\n                    break\n        \n        if can_add_i:\n            kept_districts_set.add(i)\n        else:\n            # If i cannot be added without breaking connectivity, remove it.\n            removed_districts_list.append(i)\n\n    # The problem asks for k removed districts.\n    # The greedy strategy ensures we keep n-k districts with highest possible indices\n    # that form a connected component.
