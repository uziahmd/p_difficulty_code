            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Card Sum Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the fewest extra cards Vanya needs to reach a zero sum, given his initial cards and the range of values we can add.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to get the sum of Vanya's existing cards, which I'll call `S`.  Then, since we want a final sum of zero, the sum of these new cards, `S_new`, must equal `-S`. The twist is that each new card's value has to be between `-x` and `x` (inclusive).\n\nMy focus here is on *minimizing* the count of these added cards.  To do this efficiently, I need to make each new card \"count\" as much as possible towards that target `-S`.  If `-S` is positive, I should add `x` cards; if it's negative, I use `-x` cards.  Basically, I have to ensure the fewest number of cards get me there.\n\nNow, let's look at `|S|`, the absolute value of the sum. Each card contributes at most `x` (in absolute value), so I can reduce `|S|` by at most `x` per card. This gives me a nice, simple formula: the minimum number of cards should be `ceil(|S| / x)`.\n\nLet's test this logic out. For a given example, let's say Vanya has cards -1, 1, 2. The sum S = 2, so S_new = -2. If x = 2, I can use a card with value -2. The formula gives `ceil(|2|/2)` which equals 1, just as I'd expect. In another example with cards -2, -2 and x = 3, S = -4, so I need S_new = 4. The formula `ceil(|-4|/3)` gives `ceil(1.33)` = 2, so I use a 3, and a 1. The approach seems to hold up. This seems like a pretty solid strategy.\n",
