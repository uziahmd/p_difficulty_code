He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The user wants me to solve a competitive programming problem involving prefixes and suffixes. I need to take a set of strings, identify the original string, and mark which of the input strings are prefixes ('P') and which are suffixes ('S').  The problem guarantees a solution exists, which is helpful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input. I have `n`, the length of the secret string `s`. I'm also given `2n-2` strings, which are all the \"improper\" prefixes and suffixes of `s`. This means, for each length from 1 up to `n-1`, I'm given one prefix and one suffix.  The strings come in a random order, but there's a trick: there are exactly two strings of length `n-1`.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's, matching each input string. The important constraint is that I must have the same number of 'P's and 'S's, that is `n-1`.\n\nThe core strategy revolves around those two special strings of length `n-1`.  One will be `s[0...n-2]` (the prefix) and the other will be `s[1...n-1]` (the suffix).  Since I don't know the full string `s` yet, I need to try to reconstruct it.  I'll explore two main possibilities: either the first `n-1` string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice-versa.\n\nI'll denote these length `n-1` strings as `str1` and `str2`. The key insight is that if I assume `str1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]`, then I can deduce the last character of `s`.  If `str1` is a prefix, the original string `s` can be formed either by adding the last character of `str2` (making `str1 + str2[-1]`) or the first character of `str2` to `str1`. The last character of this would be the same as taking the first character of str2 and appending it to str1 (that is, `str1 + str2[-1]` and `str2[0] + str1`). For this to be consistent, `str1[1:]` must equal `str2[:-1]`. If I find that `s1[1:] == s2[:-1]` it gives a way to reconstruct `s`.  If it turns out I can build a string from one assumption, then it's valid, and I'm done.\n\nOnce I have a candidate string `s`, I need to verify that it is consistent with the other given strings. I'll check each of the remaining input strings (the prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to `n-2`) against the candidate string. For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1` I expect to find one string that is the prefix of that length and one that's a suffix of that length. Because the inputs are not always unique, I need to keep a frequency count to ensure that I mark the correct prefix/suffix. If, for any length, the expected prefix or suffix isn't present, then the candidate `s` is incorrect, and I will try the other hypothesis.\n\nI will implement this by iterating through the input strings and, for each candidate string `s`, assigning 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it matches a prefix or suffix of `s`. If the counts of prefix / suffix assignment match, I have the correct result.\n\nAfter I have `s`, it seems pretty easy.  For each input string, compare with prefixes and suffixes.  If I find a match, I mark it with 'P' for prefix, 'S' for suffix. I need a robust method to track duplicate prefixes and suffixes, or it won't work correctly. The problem guarantees there is a consistent `s`, so I can just find one correct assignment. It must always be at least one working set, according to the problem statement.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of the given `2n-2` strings, whether it is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown original string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that the input strings are indeed all improper prefixes and suffixes of *some* string `s`, meaning for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one prefix of length `k` and one suffix of length `k`. We need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's corresponding to the input order.\n\nThe core idea is to reconstruct the original string `s`. We know that there are exactly two input strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `str1` and `str2`. One of them must be the prefix of `s` of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[0...n-2]`), and the other must be the suffix of `s` of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[1...n-1]`).\n\nWe can try two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Hypothesis 1**: `str1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n    *   If this is true, the full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str1 + str2[-1]`.\n    *   A consistency check is required: for `str1` to be `s[0...n-2]` and `str2` to be `s[1...n-1]`, their overlapping part `s[1...n-2]` must be identical. That is, `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. If this condition holds, we have a candidate string `s_cand1`.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis 2**: `str2` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str1` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n    *   Similarly, the full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str2 + str1[-1]`.\n    *   The consistency check is `str2[1:]` must be equal to `str1[:-1]`. If this holds, we have a candidate string `s_cand2`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these hypotheses (or both, possibly leading to the same `s` or different `s` values, but always a valid one) will lead to a valid string `s`.\n\nOnce we have a candidate `s` (e.g., `s_cand1`), we need to verify if all other input strings are consistent with it, and then assign 'P' or 'S'.\nThe verification process for a candidate `s_candidate`:\n1.  Generate all `n-1` prefixes of `s_candidate`: `P_k = s_candidate[0:k]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n2.  Generate all `n-1` suffixes of `s_candidate`: `S_k = s_candidate[n-k:n]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n3.  Group the original input strings by their length. For each length `k` (from `1` to `n-1`), there will be exactly two input strings. Let them be `input_str_A` and `input_str_B` with their original indices `idx_A` and `idx_B`.\n4.  We must have `{input_str_A, input_str_B}` as a multiset equal to `{P_k, S_k}`.\n    *   If `input_str_A == P_k` and `input_str_B == S_k`, then `input_str_A` is 'P' and `input_str_B` is 'S'.\n    *   If `input_str_A == S_k` and `input_str_B == P_k`, then `input_str_A` is 'S' and `input_str_B` is 'P'.\n    *   If `P_k == S_k` (i.e., the prefix and suffix of length `k` are identical, like \"a\" for \"ababa\"), then both `input_str_A` and `input_str_B` must be equal to `P_k`. In this case, we can arbitrarily assign one 'P' and one 'S' (e.g., `input_str_A` is 'P', `input_str_B` is 'S').\n    *   If none of these conditions hold, `s_candidate` is not valid.\n\nWe iterate through the candidate strings (`s_cand1`, `s_cand2`). The first one that passes this verification process is a valid solution. We then construct the 'P'/'S' string based on the assignments made during verification and print it.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough (`n=5`, input strings shown in problem statement):**\nInput strings of length `n-1 = 4`: `('abab', original_idx=2)` and `('baba', original_idx=5)`.\nLet `s1_val = 'abab'`, `s1_idx = 2`.\nLet `s2_val = 'baba'`, `s2_idx = 5`.\n\n**Hypothesis 1**: `s1_val` is prefix, `s2_val` is suffix.\n*   Check `s1_val[1:] == s2_val[:-1]`: `'bab'` == `'bab'`. This is true.\n*   Candidate `s = s1_val + s2_val[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'`.\n*   Now verify `s = 'ababa'` against all input strings:\n    *   `k=1`: `P_1='a'`, `S_1='a'`. Input strings of length 1 are `('a', 1)` and `('a', 3)`. Assign `ans[1]='P'`, `ans[3]='S'`.\n    *   `k=2`: `P_2='ab'`, `S_2='ba'`. Input strings of length 2 are `('ba', 0)` and `('ab', 6)`. Assign `ans[6]='P'`, `ans[0]='S'`.\n    *   `k=3`: `P_3='aba'`, `S_3='aba'`. Input strings of length 3 are `('aba', 4)` and `('aba', 7)`. Assign `ans[4]='P'`, `ans[7]='S'`.\n    *   `k=4`: `P_4='abab'`, `S_4='baba'`. Input strings of length 4 are `('abab', 2)` and `('baba', 5)`. Assign `ans[2]='P'`, `ans[5]='S'`.\n*   All checks pass. The resulting assignment string is `SPPSPSPS`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach guarantees finding a valid assignment because the problem guarantees at least one such string `s` exists. The time complexity will be `O(N^2)` due to string operations (slicing, comparisons) within loops proportional to `N`, which is efficient enough for `N=100`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Store input strings along with their original indices\n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((sys.stdin.readline().strip(), i))\n\n    # Group input strings by length for easier access during verification\n    strings_by_length = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    for s_val, original_idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n        strings_by_length[len(s_val)].append((s_val, original_idx))\n\n    # Get the two strings of length n-1\n    # These are crucial for reconstructing the original string 's'\n    str_n_minus_1_a_val, str_n_minus_1_a_idx = strings_by_length[n - 1][0]\n    str_n_minus_1_b_val, str_n_minus_1_b_idx = strings_by_length[n - 1][1]\n\n    # List to store potential (s_candidate, index_of_prefix_n-1, index_of_suffix_n-1) tuples\n    candidate_s_options = []\n\n    # Hypothesis 1: str_n_minus_1_a_val is the prefix of length n-1, str_n_minus_1_b_val is the suffix of length n-1\n    # Condition for consistency: the overlapping part s[1...n-2] must be identical\n    if str_n_minus_1_a_val[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b_val[:-1]:\n        s_candidate_1 = str_n_minus_1_a_val + str_n_minus_1_b_val[-1]\n        candidate_s_options.append((s_candidate_1, str_n_minus_1_a_idx, str_n_minus_1_b_idx))\n\n    # Hypothesis 2: str_n_minus_1_b_val is the prefix of length n-1, str_n_minus_1_a_val is the suffix of length n-1\n    # Condition for consistency: the overlapping part s[1...n-2] must be identical\n    if str_n_minus_1_b_val[1:] == str_n_minus_1_a_val[:-1]:\n        s_candidate_2 = str_n_minus_1_b_val + str_n_minus_1_a_val[-1]\n        candidate_s_options.append((s_candidate_2, str_n_minus_1_b_idx, str_n_minus_1_a_idx))\n    \n    final_ans_chars = None\n\n    # Iterate through candidate string options and verify\n    for s_candidate, prefix_n_minus_1_idx, suffix_n_minus_1_idx in candidate_s_options:\n        ans_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n        \n        # Assign 'P' and 'S' for the length n-1 strings based on the current hypothesis\n        ans_chars[prefix_n_minus_1_idx] = 'P'\n        ans_chars[suffix_n_minus_1_idx] = 'S'\n        \n        is_valid_candidate = True\n        \n        # Verify for all other lengths k from 1 to n-2\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            if k == n - 1: # Length n-1 strings are already handled\n                continue\n\n            # Get the two input strings of current length k\n            str1_val, str1_idx = strings_by_length[k][0]\n            str2_val, str2_idx = strings_by_length[k][1]\n\n            # Get the expected prefix and suffix of length k from s_candidate\n            expected_P_k = s_candidate[0:k]\n            expected_S_k = s_candidate[n-k:n]\n\n            # Check consistency and assign 'P'/'S'\n            if str1_val == expected_P_k and str2_val == expected_S_k:\n                ans_chars[str1_idx] = 'P'\n                ans_chars[str2_idx] = 'S'\n            elif str1_val == expected_S_k and str2_val == expected_P_k:\n                ans_chars[str1_idx] = 'S'\n                ans_chars[str2_idx] = 'P'\n            elif expected_P_k == expected_S_k and str1_val == expected_P_k and str2_val == expected_P_k:\n                # Case where prefix and suffix of length k are identical (e.g., \"a\" for \"ababa\")\n                # Both input strings must be equal to P_k (and S_k).
