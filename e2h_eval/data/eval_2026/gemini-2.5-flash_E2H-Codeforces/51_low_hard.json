Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the plan for this \"Amusing Joke\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and it's asking if a pile of letters can form a joke consisting of a guest's name and a host's name, rearranged.  Basically, I need to check if the letters in the pile are the same as the letters in the two names, when combined. The exact order doesn't matter, just the letter counts.\n\nMy first thought is, this is solvable. I need to make sure I understand the requirements completely. I've got three input strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters. I'm focusing on uppercase letters, and the length restriction (no more than 100 characters per string) is a factor, but not a significant performance hurdle.\n\nSo, here's how I see it:\n\n1. **Input:** I read the three strings. Simple enough.\n2. **Combine:** I just concatenate the guest and host names into a single string.\n3. **Count Frequencies:** Now, I'll count the frequency of each letter in the combined name string and in the pile of letters. `collections.Counter` looks like the perfect tool for the job. It handles this counting efficiently and is super easy to work with.\n4. **Compare:** Finally, I'll compare the two `Counter` objects. If they're identical (same letters, same counts), then the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThe constraints are pretty helpful: uppercase letters only, not empty strings, and reasonable lengths. No need for complex pre-processing or edge case handling other than the standard approach for this kind of problem.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into Python, using `collections.Counter` for efficient counting. It should be pretty straightforward. The example test cases will be a useful check. With that, I'm ready to write the code.\n",
