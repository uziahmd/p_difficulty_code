He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing a Competitive Programming Prefix/Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the original string, 's', based on a jumbled set of its prefixes and suffixes, excluding the whole string itself. We're given 2n-2 strings, which represent all the possible improper prefixes and suffixes of 's' (lengths 1 to n-1).  This feels like a puzzle more than anything.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent prefixes and suffixes more formally. Let's use P_k for the prefix of length k and S_k for the suffix of length k.  So, P_k is s[0...k-1] and S_k is s[n-k...n-1]. The key is that for each length, there's exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nNow, the really crucial part. We have two strings of length n-1, let's call them X and Y. One has to be P_{n-1} and the other S_{n-1}. Let's break this down into cases.\n\nIf X is the prefix P_{n-1} of length n-1, then 's' begins with X and is essentially X + c, where c is some character. Similarly, if Y is the suffix S_{n-1} , then s must have the form d + Y.\n\nIf X is a prefix and Y a suffix we have a nice setup. This tells us the structure of s is X...c or d...Y where X and Y are related because they are adjacent substrings.  So, if X and Y are the n-1 length prefix/suffix, then X = s[0...n-2] and Y = s[1...n-1]. This looks promising. The whole string is clearly X + s[n-1] and s[0] + Y.  Knowing this allows reconstruction.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify $2n-2$ given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are given that these are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to $n-1$), and for each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$, there are exactly two strings, one being the prefix of length $k$ and the other being the suffix of length $k$.\n\nLet $s$ be the unknown string of length $n$.\nIts prefixes are $s[0 \\dots k-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nIts suffixes are $s[n-k \\dots n-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThe key observation is to look at the two strings of length $n-1$. Let these be $str_1$ and $str_2$.\nOne of them must be $s[0 \\dots n-2]$ (the prefix of length $n-1$), and the other must be $s[1 \\dots n-1]$ (the suffix of length $n-1$).\n\nThere are two possibilities for which string is which:\n\n**Possibility 1:** $str_1 = s[0 \\dots n-2]$ and $str_2 = s[1 \\dots n-1]$.\nIn this case, the full string $s$ can be reconstructed.\nSince $s[0 \\dots n-2] = str_1$, $s$ must be $str_1 + s[n-1]$.\nSince $s[1 \\dots n-1] = str_2$, $s$ must be $s[0] + str_2$.\nFor these to be consistent, $str_1[1 \\dots n-2]$ must be equal to $str_2[0 \\dots n-3]$. In other words, $str_1$ without its first character must be equal to $str_2$ without its last character.\nIf this condition holds, then $s$ can be formed as $str_1 + str_2[n-2]$ (or equivalently, $str_1[0] + str_2$).\nLet's call this candidate string $S_A = str_1 + str_2[n-2]$.\n\n**Possibility 2:** $str_2 = s[0 \\dots n-2]$ and $str_1 = s[1 \\dots n-1]$.\nSimilar to Possibility 1, the full string $s$ can be reconstructed.\nHere, $str_2$ without its first character must be equal to $str_1$ without its last character.\nIf this condition holds, then $s$ can be formed as $str_2 + str_1[n-2]$ (or equivalently, $str_2[0] + str_1$).\nLet's call this candidate string $S_B = str_2 + str_1[n-2]$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that a valid string $s$ exists. This means at least one of these possibilities will lead to a valid string $s$ and a consistent set of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  Read $n$.\n2.  Store all $2n-2$ input strings along with their original indices. A list of tuples `(string, original_index)` or similar structure can be used.\n3.  Filter out the two strings of length $n-1$. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n4.  **Attempt Possibility 1:**\n    *   Assume `str_A` is $P_{n-1}$ and `str_B` is $S_{n-1}$.\n    *   Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, construct candidate string $s_A = str_A + str_B[-1]$.\n    *   Verify $s_A$:\n        *   Generate all prefixes of $s_A$: $s_A[0 \\dots k-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$. Store them in a set `expected_prefixes`.\n        *   Generate all suffixes of $s_A$: $s_A[n-k \\dots n-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$. Store them in a set `expected_suffixes`.\n        *   Create a frequency map for all input strings.\n        *   Iterate through `expected_prefixes`. For each prefix, check if it exists in the input strings' frequency map. If yes, decrement its count. If not, or count is zero, then $s_A$ is not valid.\n        *   Do the same for `expected_suffixes`.\n        *   If all expected prefixes and suffixes are found exactly once in the input strings (after accounting for the two strings of each length), then $s_A$ is a valid string.\n        *   If $s_A$ is valid, construct the answer string:\n            *   Initialize a result array `ans` of length $2n-2` with empty characters.\n            *   Iterate through the original input strings. If an input string `s_in` matches a prefix $s_A[0 \\dots k-1]$ that has not yet been \"assigned\", mark it as 'P' in `ans` at its original index and mark that prefix as assigned.\n            *   Do the same for suffixes, marking them 'S'. Since there are two strings of each length, we need to be careful. The simplest way is to use the `str_A` and `str_B` assignments. `str_A` (the P_n-1) and `str_B` (the S_n-1) are already assigned. For other lengths, one will be P and one will be S.\n            *   A more robust way for constructing the answer:\n                *   Create a list of `(string, original_index)` pairs for the input.\n                *   Initialize `ans_chars = [''] * (2*n - 2)`.\n                *   Keep track of which prefixes/suffixes have been matched to input strings.\n                *   For each input string `(s_in, original_idx)`:\n                    *   If `s_in` is in `expected_prefixes` AND `s_in` is NOT in `expected_suffixes` (this is only true if `s_in` is unique to prefixes, which is not generally true for all lengths), assign 'P'.\n                    *   If `s_in` is in `expected_suffixes` AND `s_in` is NOT in `expected_prefixes`, assign 'S'.\n                    *   If `s_in` is in both (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\"), this logic is tricky.\n                *   A better way for constructing the answer:\n                    *   We have $s_A$.\n                    *   We need to determine which input string is which.\n                    *   For each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$, there are two input strings. Let them be $X_k$ and $Y_k$.\n                    *   One must be $s_A[0 \\dots k-1]$ and the other must be $s_A[n-k \\dots n-1]$.\n                    *   We can iterate through the original input strings. For each input string `(s_val, original_idx)`:\n                        *   If `s_val` is $s_A[0 \\dots \\text{len}(s_val)-1]$ AND we haven't yet assigned a 'P' for this `s_val` (important for duplicates like \"a\" in \"aaa\"), assign 'P' to `ans_chars[original_idx]`.\n                        *   Else, it must be a suffix, assign 'S'.\n                    *   This is still tricky with duplicates. The most straightforward way is to collect all prefixes and suffixes derived from $s_A$. Then, for each input string, try to match it.\n                    *   Let's create a list of `(string, original_index)` for all inputs.\n                    *   Create a `matched_P` boolean array of size $2n-2$ and `matched_S` boolean array of size $2n-2$, initialized to `False`.\n                    *   Create `ans_chars = [''] * (2*n - 2)`.\n                    *   Iterate through the input strings `(s_val, original_idx)`:\n                        *   If `s_val` is $s_A[0 \\dots \\text{len}(s_val)-1]$ (i.e., `s_val == s_A[:len(s_val)]`):\n                            *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'P'`\n                        *   Else (it must be a suffix):\n                            *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'S'`\n                    *   This simple assignment strategy works because for each length $k$, there are two input strings. One of them *must* be $P_k$ and the other *must* be $S_k$. If $X_k = P_k$ and $Y_k = S_k$, then $X_k$ will match $s_A[:k]$ and $Y_k$ will not. If $X_k = S_k$ and $Y_k = P_k$, then $Y_k$ will match $s_A[:k]$ and $X_k$ will not. So for each pair of strings of the same length, exactly one will match the prefix derived from $s_A$.\n\n5.  **Attempt Possibility 2:**\n    *   If Possibility 1 did not yield a valid $s_A$, or if we want to find *any* valid answer, try Possibility 2.\n    *   Assume `str_B` is $P_{n-1}$ and `str_A` is $S_{n-1}$.\n    *   Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, construct candidate string $s_B = str_B + str_A[-1]$.\n    *   Verify $s_B$ using the same logic as for $s_A$.\n    *   If $s_B$ is valid, construct and print the answer string similarly.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that there is at least one consistent string, one of these two possibilities must work.\n\nLet's refine the verification and answer construction:\n\n**Verification for a candidate string `candidate_s`:**\n1.  Create two multisets (e.g., `collections.Counter`) from the input strings. Let's call it `input_strings_counts`.\n2.  Generate all prefixes of `candidate_s`: $P_k = \\text{candidate\\_s}[0 \\dots k-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n3.  Generate all suffixes of `candidate_s`: $S_k = \\text{candidate\\_s}[n-k \\dots n-1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n4.  For each $P_k$: decrement its count in `input_strings_counts`. If count becomes negative, `candidate_s` is invalid.\n5.  For each $S_k$: decrement its count in `input_strings_counts`. If count becomes negative, `candidate_s` is invalid.\n6.  After processing all $P_k$ and $S_k$, if all counts in `input_strings_counts` are zero, then `candidate_s` is valid. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\n**Answer construction for a valid `candidate_s`:**\n1.  Initialize `ans_chars = [''] * (2*n - 2)`.\n2.  Keep track of which input strings have been assigned as prefixes. Use a boolean list `is_prefix_assigned` of size $2n-2$, initialized to `False`.\n3.  Iterate through the original input strings `(s_val, original_idx)`:\n    *   If `s_val` is equal to `candidate_s[:len(s_val)]`:\n        *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'P'`\n        *   `is_prefix_assigned[original_idx] = True`\n    *   Else:\n        *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'S'`\n        *   This else branch is taken if `s_val` is not a prefix. Since we know `candidate_s` is valid and all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes, if it's not a prefix, it must be a suffix.\n\nThis simple assignment strategy works because for each length $k$, there are two input strings. One of them *must* be the prefix $P_k$ and the other *must* be the suffix $S_k$. If an input string `s_val` of length $k$ is $P_k$, then `s_val == candidate_s[:k]` will be true. If `s_val` is $S_k$, then `s_val == candidate_s[:k]` will be false (unless $P_k=S_k$, which is handled by the overall validity check). So, for each pair of strings of the same length, exactly one will satisfy the prefix condition.\n\nExample 1 walk-through:\nn=5\nInputs: (ba,0), (a,1), (abab,2), (a,3), (aba,4), (baba,5), (ab,6), (aba,7)\nStrings of length n-1=4: (abab,2), (baba,5)\nLet str_A = \"abab\" (original_idx=2), str_B = \"baba\" (original_idx=5)\n\n**Possibility 1:** str_A is P_4, str_B is S_4\nCheck `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`?\n`\"bab\"` == `\"bab\"` -> True.\nCandidate s_A = `str_A + str_B[-1]` = `\"abab\" + \"a\"` = `\"ababa\"`.\n\nVerify \"ababa\":\nPrefixes: \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\"\nSuffixes: \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\"\n\nInput strings counts:\n\"a\": 2\n\"ba\": 1\n\"ab\": 1\n\"aba\": 2\n\"abab\": 1\n\"baba\": 1\n\nDecrement for prefixes:\n\"a\": 2 -> 1\n\"ab\": 1 -> 0\n\"aba\": 2 -> 1\n\"abab\": 1 -> 0\n\nDecrement for suffixes:\n\"a\": 1 -> 0\n\"ba\": 1 -> 0\n\"aba\": 1 -> 0\n\"baba\": 1 -> 0\n\nAll counts are 0. So \"ababa\" is a valid string.\n\nConstruct answer:\nOriginal inputs: (ba,0), (a,1), (abab,2), (a,3), (aba,4), (baba,5), (ab,6), (aba,7)\n`candidate_s = \"ababa\"`\n`ans_chars = [''] * 8`\n\n1.  (ba,0): `s_val=\"ba\"`. `candidate_s[:2]=\"ab\"`. \"ba\" != \"ab\". So 'S'. `ans_chars[0] = 'S'`.\n2.  (a,1): `s_val=\"a\"`. `candidate_s[:1]=\"a\"`. \"a\" == \"a\". So 'P'. `ans_chars[1] = 'P'`.\n3.  (abab,2): `s_val=\"abab\"`. `candidate_s[:4]=\"abab\"`. \"abab\" == \"abab\". So 'P'. `ans_chars[2] = 'P'`.\n4.  (a,3): `s_val=\"a\"`. `candidate_s[:1]=\"a\"`. \"a\" == \"a\". So 'P'. `ans_chars[3] = 'P'`.\n    Wait, this is the tricky part. For length 1, \"a\" is P1 and \"a\" is S1.\n    The rule \"if `s_val` is `candidate_s[:len(s_val)]` then 'P', else 'S'\" implicitly assumes that for any length $k$, $P_k \\ne S_k$. But this is not always true (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\").\n    If $P_k = S_k$, then both input strings of length $k$ would satisfy `s_val == candidate_s[:k]`. This would incorrectly mark both as 'P'.\n\n    Let's refine the answer construction for the case where $P_k = S_k$.\n    When `candidate_s` is valid, we know which strings are its prefixes and which are its suffixes.\n    $P_k = \\text{candidate\\_s}[0 \\dots k-1]$\n    $S_k = \\text{candidate\\_s}[n-k \\dots n-1]$\n\n    We need to assign 'P' to one of the input strings of length $k$ and 'S' to the other.\n    If $P_k \\ne S_k$:\n        One input string will be $P_k$, the other $S_k$.\n        The input string matching $P_k$ gets 'P'. The other gets 'S'.\n    If $P_k = S_k$:\n        Both input strings of length $k$ are identical and equal to $P_k$.\n        In this case, it doesn't matter which one gets 'P' and which gets 'S', as long as there's one 'P' and one 'S' for that length. The problem statement says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\" and \"The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'.\" This means for each length $k$, one of the two input strings must be labeled 'P' and the other 'S'.\n\n    Revised Answer Construction:\n    1.  Create `ans_chars = [''] * (2*n - 2)`.\n    2.  Create a list of `(string_value, original_index)` for all input strings.\n    3.  Create a `used_as_prefix_for_length = set()` to track which lengths have already had one of their input strings assigned 'P'.\n    4.  Iterate through the input strings `(s_val, original_idx)`:\n        *   `k = len(s_val)`\n        *   If `s_val == candidate_s[:k]` AND `k` is not in `used_as_prefix_for_length`:\n            *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'P'`\n            *   `used_as_prefix_for_length.add(k)`\n        *   Else:\n            *   `ans_chars[original_idx] = 'S'`\n\n    Let's re-run Example 1 with `candidate_s = \"ababa\"`:\n    `ans_chars = [''] * 8`\n    `used_as_prefix_for_length = set()`\n\n    Inputs:\n    0: (ba,0) len=2. `candidate_s[:2]=\"ab\"`. \"ba\" != \"ab\". -> 'S'. `ans_chars[0] = 'S'`\n    1: (a,1) len=1. `candidate_s[:1]=\"a\"`. \"a\" == \"a\". len 1 not in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'P'. `ans_chars[1] = 'P'`. Add 1 to `used_as_prefix_for_length`.\n    2: (abab,2) len=4. `candidate_s[:4]=\"abab\"`. \"abab\" == \"abab\". len 4 not in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'P'. `ans_chars[2] = 'P'`. Add 4 to `used_as_prefix_for_length`.\n    3: (a,3) len=1. `candidate_s[:1]=\"a\"`. \"a\" == \"a\". len 1 IS in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'S'. `ans_chars[3] = 'S'`\n    4: (aba,4) len=3. `candidate_s[:3]=\"aba\"`. \"aba\" == \"aba\". len 3 not in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'P'. `ans_chars[4] = 'P'`. Add 3 to `used_as_prefix_for_length`.\n    5: (baba,5) len=4. `candidate_s[:4]=\"abab\"`. \"baba\" != \"abab\". -> 'S'. `ans_chars[5] = 'S'`\n    6: (ab,6) len=2. `candidate_s[:2]=\"ab\"`. \"ab\" == \"ab\". len 2 not in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'P'. `ans_chars[6] = 'P'`. Add 2 to `used_as_prefix_for_length`.\n    7: (aba,7) len=3. `candidate_s[:3]=\"aba\"`. \"aba\" == \"aba\". len 3 IS in `used_as_prefix_for_length`. -> 'S'. `ans_chars[7] = 'S'`\n\n    Result: SPPSPSPS. This matches the example output.\n\nThis refined approach seems correct.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n*   $n=2$: Two input strings, length 1. Let them be $X, Y$.\n    $P_1 = s[0]$, $S_1 = s[1]$.\n    Possibility 1: $X=P_1, Y=S_1$. `str_A=X, str_B=Y`.\n        `X[1:]` is empty, `Y[:-1]` is empty. So `X[1:] == Y[:-1]` is always true.\n        `s_A = X + Y[-1]`. This is $X[0] + Y[0]$.\n        Verify $s_A$: Prefixes: $P_1 = X$. Suffixes: $S_1 = Y$.\n        Input counts: $X:1, Y:1$. Decrement $X$ and $Y$. All zeros. Valid.\n        Answer: $X$ gets 'P', $Y$ gets 'S'.\n    Possibility 2: $Y=P_1, X=S_1$. `str_A=Y, str_B=X`.\n        `s_B = Y + X[-1]`. This is $Y[0] + X[0]$.\n        Verify $s_B$: Prefixes: $P_1 = Y$. Suffixes: $S_1 = X$. Valid.\n        Answer: $Y$ gets 'P', $X$ gets 'S'.\n    Both are valid. The problem says any answer is fine. My refined algorithm will pick the first one it tries.\n\nThe implementation should:\n1.  Read $n$.\n2.  Read $2n-2$ strings, storing them as `(string_value, original_index)`.\n3.  Separate strings of length $n-1$ into `str_A_obj` and `str_B_obj` (tuples `(value, index)`).\n4.
