Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Tackling the Colored Boots Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Colored Boots\" problem to solve.  Let's break it down.  Basically, I'm given two sets of boots, left and right, with each boot having a color (a lowercase letter or a '?'). The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs, where compatibility means the boots either have the same specific color or one or both are '?'. Sounds like a greedy approach might be the way to go.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the input and output.  `n` is the number of boots, and I'll get strings `l` and `r` representing the left and right boots' colors.  The output is the maximum number of pairs `k`, and then `k` lines with the indices of the matched boots.  Clear enough.\n\nNow, about the strategy.  I'm thinking, to maximize pairs, I should be as efficient as possible. The obvious move is to handle the *most* restrictive matches first. That is, the perfect color matches, for example a left 'a' and a right 'a'.  These are the most valuable pairings, since they only fit with themselves. If I match those up first, it minimizes the opportunity cost of matching.\n\nNext, I'll think about boots that are a specific color with a '?'.  If I have a left 'b' and a right '?', matching them seems like a decent choice, since the 'b' is guaranteed not to be compatible with any other existing 'b' left. It avoids a loss of future potential.\n\nFinally, the least restrictive matches are the '?'-'?' pairs.  Those can be paired if I have no other compatible options left.\n\nTo actually implement this, I need a good data structure.  Since `n` can be up to 150000, I need something efficient for lookups.  I'll probably use a data structure where I can store lists for each color, including '?'. This way, I can quickly find available boots for a given color.  An array of lists of length 27 should work, 26 for letters + 1 for '?'.  This is how I'll keep track of available boots and their original indices efficiently. Time to start coding this up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots and list them. We have `n` left boots and `n` right boots, each with a color (a lowercase letter or '?'). Compatibility rules are:\n1.  `(c, c)` is compatible (same specific color).\n2.  `(?, c)` or `(c, ?)` is compatible (indefinite color matches any color).\n3.  `(?, ?)` is compatible.\n4.  `(c1, c2)` where `c1 != c2` and neither is `?` is not compatible.\n\nTo maximize pairs, we should use a greedy strategy. The most restrictive matches should be prioritized because they consume boots that have fewer alternative matching options.\n\n1.  **Exact Specific Color Matches (`c`, `c`):**\n    These are the most restrictive. A left boot of color 'a' can only match a right boot of color 'a' (or a '?') without involving a '?'. If we have both a left 'a' and a right 'a', matching them is always optimal. It uses up two boots that are specific to 'a' and doesn't prevent any '?' boot from being used.\n\n2.  **Specific Color with Question Mark Matches (`c`, `?` or `?`, `c`):**\n    After matching all exact specific color pairs, any remaining specific color boot (e.g., left 'a') cannot find another specific color boot (right 'a'). Its only remaining option is to match a '?' boot. Similarly, a '?' boot can match any specific color boot. It's optimal to match these next. We prioritize using up specific color boots with '?' boots because '?' boots are highly flexible and can match other '?' boots if needed.\n\n3.  **Question Mark with Question Mark Matches (`?`, `?`):**\n    Finally, any remaining '?' left boots and '?' right boots can be paired together. This is the least restrictive match, so it's done last.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** We need to efficiently access boots of a particular color. A good way is to use a list of indices for each color. Since there are 26 lowercase letters and '?', we can use an array of 27 lists (e.g., `left_boots[0]` for 'a', `left_boots[1]` for 'b', ..., `left_boots[25]` for 'z', `left_boots[26]` for '?').\n\n2.  **Matching Process:**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the pairs.\n    *   **Phase 1: `(c, c)` matches:**\n        Iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z'. For each color `c`, while there are available left boots of color `c` AND right boots of color `c`, pop one index from each list and add the pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `result`.\n    *   **Phase 2: `(c, ?)` and `(?, c)` matches:**\n        Iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z'. For each color `c`:\n        *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND right boots of color '?', pop one index from each list and add the pair to `result`.\n        *   While there are available left boots of color '?' AND right boots of color `c`, pop one index from each list and add the pair to `result`.\n    *   **Phase 3: `(?, ?)` matches:**\n        While there are available left boots of color '?' AND right boots of color '?', pop one index from each list and add the pair to `result`.\n\n3.  **Output:** Print the total number of pairs (`len(result)`) followed by each pair on a new line. Remember to use 1-based indexing for output.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 10`\n`l = codeforces`\n`r = dodivthree`\n\nInitial lists (1-indexed):\n`left_boots`:\n  'c': [1, 7]\n  'o': [2, 8]\n  'd': [3]\n  'e': [4, 9]\n  'f': [5]\n  'r': [6]\n  's': [10]\n`right_boots`:\n  'd': [1, 4]\n  'o': [2]\n  'i': [3]\n  'v': [5]\n  't': [6]\n  'h': [7]\n  'r': [8]\n  'e': [9]\n\n**Phase 1: `(c, c)` matches**\n- 'c': `l_c=[1,7]`, `r_c=[]`. No matches.\n- 'd': `l_d=[3]`, `r_d=[1,4]`. Match (3,1). `result=[(3,1)]`. `l_d=[]`, `r_d=[4]`.\n- 'e': `l_e=[4,9]`, `r_e=[9]`. Match (4,9). `result=[(3,1), (4,9)]`. `l_e=[9]`, `r_e=[]`.\n- 'o': `l_o=[2,8]`, `r_o=[2]`. Match (2,2). `result=[(3,1), (4,9), (2,2)]`. `l_o=[8]`, `r_o=[]`.\n- 'r': `l_r=[6]`, `r_r=[8]`. Match (6,8). `result=[(3,1), (4,9), (2,2), (6,8)]`. `l_r=[]`, `r_r=[]`.\n(Other specific colors have no matches or only one side)\n\n**Phase 2: `(c, ?)` and `(?, c)` matches**\nNo '?' boots in this example, so no matches in this phase.\n\n**Phase 3: `(?, ?)` matches**\nNo '?' boots in this example, so no matches in this phase.\n\nFinal `result`: `[(3,1), (4,9), (2,2), (6,8)]`. Total 4 pairs.\nThe example output for this case is:\n```\n5\n7 8\n4 9\n2 2\n9 10\n3 1\n```\nMy manual trace got 4 pairs. Let's recheck the example.\n`l = codeforces`\n`r = dodivthree`\n\nL: c(1), o(2), d(3), e(4), f(5), o(6), r(7), c(8), e(9), s(10) (Oops, my indices for the example were wrong based on the input string, I used a 0-indexed interpretation for my string parsing and then 1-indexed for output. Let's re-parse with 1-indexed for clarity.)\n\nL: c(1), o(2), d(3), e(4), f(5), o(6), r(7), c(8), e(9), s(10)\nR: d(1), o(2), d(3), i(4), v(5), t(6), h(7), r(8), e(9), e(10)\n\n`left_boots`:\n  'c': [1, 8]\n  'o': [2, 6]\n  'd': [3]\n  'e': [4, 9]\n  'f': [5]\n  'r': [7]\n  's': [10]\n`right_boots`:\n  'd': [1, 3]\n  'o': [2]\n  'i': [4]\n  'v': [5]\n  't': [6]\n  'h': [7]\n  'r': [8]\n  'e': [9, 10]\n\n**Phase 1: `(c, c)` matches**\n- 'c': `l_c=[1,8]`, `r_c=[]`. No matches.\n- 'd': `l_d=[3]`, `r_d=[1,3]`. Match (3,1). `result=[(3,1)]`. `l_d=[]`, `r_d=[3]`.\n- 'e': `l_e=[4,9]`, `r_e=[9,10]`. Match (4,9), (9,10). `result=[(3,1), (4,9), (9,10)]`. `l_e=[]`, `r_e=[]`.\n- 'o': `l_o=[2,6]`, `r_o=[2]`. Match (2,2). `result=[(3,1), (4,9), (9,10), (2,2)]`. `l_o=[6]`, `r_o=[]`.\n- 'r': `l_r=[7]`, `r_r=[8]`. Match (7,8). `result=[(3,1), (4,9), (9,10), (2,2), (7,8)]`. `l_r=[]`, `r_r=[]`.\n\nTotal 5 pairs. This matches the example output's count. The specific pairs might differ in order or which specific index is chosen if multiple options exist (e.g., `l_d=[3]` and `r_d=[1,3]` could match (3,1) or (3,3); either is fine). My trace gives `(3,1), (4,9), (9,10), (2,2), (7,8)`. The example output is `(7,8), (4,9), (2,2), (9,10), (3,1)`. Same pairs, different order. This confirms the greedy strategy is correct.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by iterating through the input strings once to populate the lists (O(N)) and then iterating through the 27 possible colors and popping from lists. Each boot index is pushed and popped at most once. So, the total time complexity is O(N + 27 * M) where M is the maximum number of boots for a specific color, which simplifies to O(N). This is efficient enough for N = 150000.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices for each color.\n    # 0-25 for 'a' through 'z'\n    # 26 for '?'\n    \n    # Using lists to store indices for each color.\n    # Each list will store 1-based indices.\n    left_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n    right_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    # Populate lists for left boots\n    for i in range(n):\n        char_code = ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a') if l_str[i] != '?' else 26\n        left_boots[char_code].append(i + 1)\n\n    # Populate lists for right boots\n    for i in range(n):\n        char_code = ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a') if r_str[i] != '?' else 26\n        right_boots[char_code].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Phase 1: Match specific colors (c, c)\n    for char_code in range(26): # 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[char_code] and right_boots[char_code]:\n            left_idx = left_boots[char_code].pop()\n            right_idx = right_boots[char_code].pop()\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Match specific colors with question marks (c, ?) and (?, c)\n    for char_code in range(26): # 'a' through 'z'\n        # Match left specific color with right '?'\n        while left_boots[char_code] and right_boots[26]: # 26 is '?'\n            left_idx = left_boots[char_code].pop()\n            right_idx = right_boots[26].pop()\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n        # Match left '?' with right specific color\n        while left_boots[26] and right_boots[char_code]:\n            left_idx = left_boots[26].pop()\n            right_idx = right_boots[char_code].pop()\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: Match question marks ( ?, ? )\n    while left_boots[26] and right_boots[26]:\n        left_idx = left_boots[26].pop()\n        right_idx = right_boots[26].pop()\n        pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for left_idx, right_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{left_idx} {right_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
