His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to figure out the best and worst possible ranks for a participant named Vasya in an Olympiad. We're given the number of participants (`n`), a minimum total score Vasya achieved (`x`), and two sets of scores (`a` and `b`) from two rounds of the competition. The tricky part is we don't know which score in `a` corresponds to which score in `b` for any participant, including Vasya. The rule is that the ranking is based on the sum of the scores, with ties being broken by the jury.\n\nThis is fundamentally a matching problem. I need to find the optimal pairings between the scores in `a` and `b` to determine the best and worst ranks for Vasya, knowing his total score is at least `x`. There are a lot of possible pairings (n factorial, to be precise), so a brute-force approach is out of the question. Also, the problem states that Vasya was present.\n\n**Simplification and Rephrasing**\n\nSince names aren't given in the data, the focus should be on the point values. There exists at least one pair of scores from `a` and `b` that sums up to at least `x`. Also, how the jury decides ties is the important factor.\n\n**Finding the Best Rank**\n\nTo get the best rank (ideally, rank 1), I need to make Vasya's score as high as possible while keeping other participants' scores low. Due to the \"jury-decision on ties\" rule, it's beneficial for Vasya to have a uniquely high score.\n\n*   To get the highest score, I need to match Vasya with the biggest values in `a` and `b` such that his score is at least `x`.\n*   Let's consider sorting the scores: `a_1 <= ... <= a_n` and `b_1 <= ... <= b_n`. The greatest possible score is `a_n + b_n`.\n*   If `a_n + b_n >= x`, Vasya can have this score, and everyone else's scores will be less than or equal to this sum. Therefore, Vasya can take 1st place if `a_n+b_n >= x`.\n*   Therefore, Vasya's best possible rank is always 1.\n\n**Finding the Worst Rank**\n\nNow, to find the worst rank, I want to minimize Vasya's score (while still being at least `x`) and maximize the number of other participants who have a score at least as good as Vasya's. This is more complex because I'm trying to create a situation where as many people as possible score at least as well as Vasya.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1.  Make Vasya's score at a minimum of `x`. Let's assume his score is `S_V`.\n2.  Maximize the scores of everyone else relative to `S_V`. To do this, I try to make everyone else get scores >= `x` along with Vasya.\n\nLet's sort `a` and `b` as above. To make the ranking as bad as possible, I should aim to have as many scores above `S_V` as possible. So, I need to maximize the number of total sums greater than `S_V`. It means I pair the smaller values in `A` with large values in `B`.\n\nThe guaranteed condition helps: some sums are at least `x`. This condition seems to imply that Vasya can have that score. Therefore, by using binary search or a two-pointer approach, the minimum possible score is set up as `x`. We can pair the minimum to create a rank and proceed with the remaining people. However, this pairing might not produce the desired result.\n\nI need a concrete algorithm to accomplish this. The key is that there exists a pair of values such that the total sum is at least `x`. Also, I can create all pairings to compute and analyze the ranks. So, the rank will be `1 + (number of scores at least >= x) + ( number of values with the same score)`.\n\n**Key Idea**\n\nWe will build the pairs by setting the smallest a value for Vasya such that the total sum with some b score is at least `x`. Now we want as many sums >= `S_V` to count the rank.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` Vasya got, and two lists of `n` scores for Tour 1 (`a`) and Tour 2 (`b`). The scores in `a` and `b` are not associated with specific participants; we need to form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that each score from `a` and `b` is used exactly once. Vasya is one of these `n` participants, and his total score must be at least `x`. Participants are ranked by total score (higher is better). In case of ties, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n\nThe key insight is that we can choose the pairing of scores `(a_i, b_j)` to achieve the best and worst outcomes for Vasya.\n\nLet's sort both score lists `a` and `b` in ascending order:\n`a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n`\n`b_1 \\le b_2 \\le \\dots \\le b_n`\n\n### Best Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the best rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to have a total score `S_V` such that `S_V \\ge x`, and `S_V` is greater than or equal to the total score of every other participant. If there are ties, the jury can place Vasya first among them.\n\n1.  **Maximize Vasya's score:** The maximum possible total score any participant can achieve is `a_n + b_n` (by pairing the highest score from Tour 1 with the highest score from Tour 2).\n2.  **Ensure Vasya's score is valid:** The problem guarantees that \"there are two integers `i, j` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge x`\". Since `a_n + b_n` is the maximum possible sum, it must be that `a_n + b_n \\ge x`. So, Vasya can indeed be assigned `a_n` and `b_n`. His score would be `S_V = a_n + b_n`.\n3.  **Minimize other participants' scores:** The remaining `n-1` participants would be assigned scores from `a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}` and `b_1, \\dots, b_{n-1}`. To ensure Vasya's score `S_V` is the highest, we need to make sure no other participant scores higher than `S_V`. The maximum possible score any of the remaining `n-1` participants can get is `a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}` (by pairing the highest remaining `a` with the highest remaining `b`). Since `a_n \\ge a_{n-1}` and `b_n \\ge b_{n-1}`, it follows that `a_n + b_n \\ge a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}`. Therefore, Vasya's score `S_V` is greater than or equal to any other participant's score.\n4.  **Ties:** If `S_V` is tied with other participants, the jury can place Vasya first.\n\nThus, Vasya can always achieve rank 1.\n\n### Worst Rank for Vasya\n\nTo achieve the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of participants who score strictly higher than Vasya, and maximize the number of participants who tie with Vasya (and place Vasya last among ties). This means we want to maximize the count of participants `k` such that `S_k \\ge S_V`.\n\nThis is achieved by:\n1.  **Minimizing Vasya's score `S_V`** such that `S_V \\ge x`.\n2.  **Maximizing other participants' scores** relative to `S_V`.\n\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}`. This pairing strategy (sorting one list ascending and the other descending) tends to make the sums `a_i + b_{n-i+1}` more \"spread out\" or \"balanced\" rather than making one sum extremely high and others low.\nLet `A` be sorted ascending: `a_1, \\dots, a_n`.\nLet `B` be sorted ascending: `b_1, \\dots, b_n`.\nTo maximize the number of people who score higher than Vasya, we should try to make as many sums `a_i + b_j` as large as possible.\n\nLet's try to find a pairing such that Vasya's score `S_V` is just barely `\\ge x`, and many other people score `\\ge S_V`.\nWe can iterate through all possible `a_i` that Vasya could have for Tour 1. For each `a_i`, we need to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge x`. To minimize Vasya's score (and thus maximize his rank), we should pick the smallest `b_j` that satisfies this condition. This `b_j` would be `b_k` where `b_k \\ge x - a_i`.\n\nA more systematic approach for the worst rank:\nWe want to find a permutation `p` of `(1, \\dots, n)` and an index `k` (Vasya's position) such that `a_k + b_{p_k} \\ge x`, and the number of participants `j` for whom `a_j + b_{p_j} \\ge a_k + b_{p_k}` is maximized.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score to be `S_V`. We want to find the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can achieve a score of at least `S_V`.\nThis is a greedy matching problem.\nSort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for all `n` participants.\nTo maximize the count of people scoring `\\ge S_V`, we should pair the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j`, then the second largest `a_i` with the second largest `b_j`, and so on. This is the pairing `(a_i, b_i)` for all `i` (after sorting both `a` and `b` ascending). This pairing maximizes the minimum sum and minimizes the maximum sum.\nNo, that's not right. The pairing `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` (sorted `a` ascending, `b` descending) maximizes the sum `a_i + b_j`.\nThe pairing `(a_i, b_i)` (sorted `a` ascending, `b` ascending) minimizes the sum `a_i + b_j`.\n\nLet's use the standard approach for finding the maximum number of pairs that sum to at least `X`.\nSort `a` in ascending order. Sort `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j \\ge X`.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach. Let `L` be a pointer for `a` (starting at `a_1`) and `R` be a pointer for `b` (starting at `b_n`).\nIf `a_L + b_R \\ge X`, we can form a pair `(a_L, b_R)` that sums to at least `X`. We take this pair, increment `L`, and decrement `R`. This pair is \"good\".\nIf `a_L + b_R < X`, then `a_L` cannot form a good pair with any remaining `b_j` (since `b_j \\le b_R`). So, `a_L` must be paired with some `b_j` such that `a_L + b_j < X`. We discard `a_L` (increment `L`) and don't count it as a \"good\" pair for `X`.\nThis greedy strategy correctly finds the maximum number of pairs that sum to at least `X`.\n\nLet `count(S)` be the maximum number of participants that can achieve a total score of at least `S`.\nWe need to find the minimum `S_V \\ge x` such that `count(S_V)` is maximized.\nThe possible values for `S_V` are `a_i + b_j`. The range for `S_V` is `[0, 2 \\cdot 10^5]`.\nWe can iterate through all possible values `S` from `x` up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`. For each `S`, calculate `count(S)`. The maximum `count(S)` found will be Vasya's worst rank.\n\nThe `count(S)` function:\n1.  Sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n2.  Initialize `num_pairs = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = n-1`.\n3.  While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    a.  If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S`:\n        `num_pairs += 1`\n        `ptr_a += 1`\n        `ptr_b -= 1`\n    b.  Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S`):\n        `ptr_a += 1` (This `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a sum `\\ge S` with any remaining `b`s, so it's \"wasted\" for `S` but might be used in the actual pairing).\n\nThe worst rank is `max_{S \\ge x} count(S)`.\nThe range of `S` is up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`. `n` is up to `10^5`.\nCalculating `count(S)` for each `S` takes `O(N)` time.\nTotal time complexity `O(MAX_SCORE \\cdot N)`, which is `2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 10^5 = 2 \\cdot 10^{10}`, too slow.\n\nWe can optimize this. The `count(S)` function is monotonically non-increasing. If `S_1 < S_2`, then `count(S_1) \\ge count(S_2)`.\nThis means we are looking for `max_{S \\ge x} count(S)`. Since `count(S)` is non-increasing, this maximum will be `count(x)`.\nWhy? If Vasya gets score `S_V >= x`, and there are `k` people (including Vasya) with score `>= S_V`, then these `k` people also have score `>= x`. So, `count(S_V) \\le count(x)`.\nTherefore, the maximum `count(S)` for `S \\ge x` is simply `count(x)`.\n\nSo, the worst rank is `count(x)`.\n\nLet's re-verify this argument carefully.\nWe want to find a pairing `P = \\{(a_i, b_{p_i})\\}` and an index `k` (Vasya's pair) such that:\n1. `S_V = a_k + b_{p_k} \\ge x`\n2. The number of pairs `j` in `P` such that `a_j + b_{p_j} \\ge S_V` is maximized. This count is Vasya's worst rank.\n\nLet `max_count = 0`.\nFor each possible total score `S_target` that Vasya could achieve such that `S_target \\ge x`:\n  Calculate `current_count = count(S_target)`.\n  `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)`.\n\nThe `count(S_target)` function, as defined, finds the maximum number of participants whose scores *could be* at least `S_target` in *some* pairing. It doesn't mean that Vasya is one of these participants.\nThe problem statement implies that we can choose the pairing for all `n` participants, and then choose which pair is Vasya's.\n\nLet's sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\nThe `count(S)` function calculates the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` that can be formed such that `a_i + b_j \\ge S`. This is indeed `count_ge_S`.\n\nConsider the total scores `S_1, S_2, ..., S_n` generated by the pairing `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` (A ascending, B descending).\nThese scores are `a_1+b_n, a_2+b_{n-1}, ..., a_n+b_1`.\nLet's call this set of scores `Scores_desc`.\nIf Vasya is assigned `a_k + b_{n-k+1}` (from `Scores_desc`), then this sum must be `\\ge x`.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank, we want to maximize `N_{ge}` = number of scores `S_j \\in Scores_desc` such that `S_j \\ge S_V`.\nWe need to find `S_V = a_k + b_{n-k+1}` from `Scores_desc` such that `S_V \\ge x` and `N_{ge}` is maximized.\nSince `a_i + b_{n-i+1}` is not necessarily monotonic, we can't simply take the smallest `S_V \\ge x`.\nExample: `a = [1, 10], b = [2, 3]`.\n`a_1+b_2 = 1+3=4`, `a_2+b_1 = 10+2=12`.\nIf `x=5`, Vasya can get 12. Rank 1.\nIf `x=1`, Vasya can get 4. `N_{ge}` for 4 is 2. `N_{ge}` for 12 is 1. Worst rank is 2.\n\nThe two-pointer method for `count(S)` is correct for finding the maximum number of pairs that sum to at least `S`.\nLet `f(S)` be this count.\nWe want to find `max_{S \\ge x} f(S)`.\nThis is exactly `f(x)`.\nWhy? Let `S_0 \\ge x`. If we can form `k` pairs that sum to at least `S_0`, then these `k` pairs also sum to at least `x`. So, `f(S_0) \\le f(x)`.\nThus, `f(x)` is the maximum possible value of `f(S)` for `S \\ge x`.\nAnd this `f(x)` is the worst rank because:\n1.  We can construct a pairing that yields `f(x)` scores `\\ge x`.\n2.  Vasya can be assigned one of these `f(x)` scores (since `f(x) \\ge 1` due to problem guarantee).\n3.  With jury's choice for ties, Vasya is placed last among these `f(x)` participants.\n\nSo, the best rank is 1.\nThe worst rank is `count(x)` using the two-pointer method.\n\nLet's test with example 2:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nSort `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSort `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nBest rank: 1 (as discussed, always 1).\n\nWorst rank: `count(x)` where `x=7`.\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`ptr_a = 0` (`a[0]=3`)\n`ptr_b = 5` (`b[5]=8`)\n`a[0] + b[5] = 3 + 8 = 11 >= 7`. Count = 1. `ptr_a=1`, `ptr_b=4`.\n\n`ptr_a = 1` (`a[1]=4`)\n`ptr_b = 4` (`b[4]=6`)\n`a[1] + b[4] = 4 + 6 = 10 >= 7`. Count = 2. `ptr_a=2`, `ptr_b=3`.\n\n`ptr_a = 2` (`a[2]=4`)\n`ptr_b = 3` (`b[3]=4`)\n`a[2] + b[3] = 4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 3. `ptr_a=3`, `ptr_b=2`.\n\n`ptr_a = 3` (`a[3]=4`)\n`ptr_b = 2` (`b[2]=4`)\n`a[3] + b[2] = 4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 4. `ptr_a=4`, `ptr_b=1`.\n\n`ptr_a = 4` (`a[4]=5`)\n`ptr_b = 1` (`b[1]=3`)\n`a[4] + b[1] = 5 + 3 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 5. `ptr_a=5`, `ptr_b=0`.\n\n`ptr_a = 5` (`a[5]=6`)\n`ptr_b = 0` (`b[0]=0`)\n`a[5] + b[0] = 6 + 0 = 6 < 7`. `ptr_a=6`.\n\nLoop terminates because `ptr_a = 6` (which is `n`).\nFinal count = 5.\n\nSo, for example 2, output is `1 5`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis seems to be the correct logic. The \"very hard\" note might be a distraction or because the optimization for worst case `count(x)` is not immediately obvious.\n\nFinal check on constraints:\n`n` up to `10^5`. Sorting takes `O(N log N)`. Two-pointer `O(N)`. Total `O(N log N)`.\n`x` up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`. Scores `a_i, b_i` up to `10^5`. Sums up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nAll constraints are handled.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can take the highest score from tour 1 (max(a)) and highest from tour 2 (max(b)).\n    # The problem guarantees that at least one pair (a_i, b_j) sums to >= x.\n    # The maximum possible sum is max(a) + max(b).
