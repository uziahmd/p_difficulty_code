He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Competitive Programming Quest for Trailing Zeroes**\n\nAlright, so I've got this competitive programming problem that's got me thinking. It's all about factorials and the number of trailing zeroes. Specifically, they want me to find all the positive integers, let's call them *n*, where *n* factorial (*n*!) ends with exactly *m* zeroes.\n\nFirst, I had to understand how those zeroes come about.  It's all about the prime factors, and since 10 = 2 * 5, I realized it's really the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of *n*!. There are always more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of trailing zeroes is just the number of factors of 5. Legendre's formula pops into mind to make counting factors easy: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  where `Z(n)` is the number of trailing zeroes.\n\nNow, I'm given this *m* value, and I need to find the *n* values.  I started observing the behavior of `Z(n)` and realized a few key things. It's non-decreasing, obviously, and it only increases when *n* is a multiple of 5. It's also constant for values from `5k` to `5k+4`. Here's the key: if `Z(n) = m`, then we have the solution `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. *Z* only jumps at `5k`.\n\nI noticed a potential issue: there might be *m* values where no *n* produces exactly *m* zeroes! Like `m = 5`. It's possible to \"skip\" values of *m*. This meant I can't just find any *n* and assume it works.  I needed to devise a robust strategy.\n\nSo, I had the brilliant thought, let's *binary search* for the *smallest* *n* such that `Z(n)` is *greater than or equal to* *m*. This smallest *n*, if its `Z` value is exactly *m*, then I have my starting point. The solutions are `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. If the `Z` value is greater, it means *m* is skipped. No solutions.\n\nI defined a `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function using that Legendre's formula.  A reasonable range for the binary search would be `[1, 5 * m]`, because `Z(n)` roughly increases as `n/4`.  I will binary search the range to find this.\n\nThe real trick is: after binary search, there is an *n*, call it `n_candidate`. It could be the solution, but there might be a smaller *n*. I knew the solution should be a multiple of 5. I created `n_start = n_candidate - (n_candidate % 5)`. Now, this starts at a value that is a multiple of 5.  If `Z(n_start) == m`, then I just output the five numbers (`n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`). If `Z(n_start)` is greater than *m*, there is no such *n*. Output 0!\n\nI've tested it mentally, and the logic seems sound. So now I just code this up, and it should solve it!\n",
