    "thought": "**Understanding \"Tree Sum\" and the Constraints**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tree Sum\" problem. It's asking me to calculate the sum of distances, $d(1, n)$, across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353.  First thing's first, I need to understand what constitutes a \"good\" tree.\n\nThe conditions are pretty straightforward: edge weights can only be 1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its connected edges must be -1.  Thinking about it, that second condition can be written as  $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$ for each vertex *i*.\n\n**Deriving the Consistency Condition**\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive anything useful from these conditions.  I'm going to multiply all those vertex conditions together.  That gives me $\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) \\right) = (-1)^n$.  On the left side, each edge $(u, v)$ is counted twice, once for vertex *u* and once for vertex *v*.  So, the product of the edge weights squared, or $\\prod_{(u, v) \\in E} (w(u, v))^2$, must equal  $(-1)^n$.  Since edge weights are 1 or -1, the squared term is always 1. Thus, $1 = (-1)^n$.\n\nThis is crucial.  It gives me a consistency condition. If *n* is odd, the right side is -1, leading to the contradiction 1=-1. Therefore, no good trees are possible when *n* is odd. This also means if *n* is odd, the sum of distances will be zero because there's nothing to sum.  Looks like that's consistent with the given test case for *n=1* which is 0.\n\n**Analyzing the Case of Even *n***\n\nNow, if *n* is even, $(-1)^n = 1$, so the condition becomes 1=1. This means good trees *can* exist! That's the key. I can relax and move on, knowing there's something to compute in this case.\n\nNext step: Let's consider how to construct the answer in the case where *n* is even. I'm going to fix the underlying structure of the tree first (which edges are present).  There are $n^{n-2}$ possible tree structures. The next step is assigning the weights, where for each fixed tree, the edge weights are picked such that the condition $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$ is satisfied at each vertex.  I also have to choose a root so that it's easy to describe the construction of the tree.  Vertex 1 seems like a natural choice.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1, n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nAn edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if:\n1. Each edge weight is either $1$ or $-1$.\n2. For each vertex $i$, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n\nLet $w(u, v)$ denote the weight of the edge $(u, v)$. The second condition is $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\n**Condition for existence of good trees:**\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nIn the left-hand side, each edge $(u, v)$ appears exactly twice (once for $u$ and once for $v$). So, the product can be rewritten as:\n$\\prod_{(u, v) \\in E} (w(u, v))^2$.\nSince $w(u, v) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $(w(u, v))^2 = 1$ for all edges.\nThus, $\\prod_{(u, v) \\in E} (w(u, v))^2 = 1^{n-1} = 1$.\nCombining these, we must have $1 = (-1)^n$.\nThis implies that $n$ must be an even integer. If $n$ is odd, $1 = -1$ is a contradiction, meaning no good trees exist.\nTherefore, if $n$ is odd, the sum of $d(1, n)$ is $0$. This handles the $n=1$ case in the example.\n\n**Counting good trees for even $n$:**\nIf $n$ is even, good trees can exist. For a given tree structure:\nPick an arbitrary root, say vertex $1$. For any edge $(u, v)$, if $v$ is a child of $u$, we can express $w(u, v)$ in terms of $w(1, \\text{parent}(v))$.\nSpecifically, we can determine the weights of all edges uniquely up to a global sign.\nLet $s_i = \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j)$. We require $s_i = -1$ for all $i$.\nLet $x_i = \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E, j \\neq \\text{parent}(i)} w(i, j)$ for $i \\neq 1$.\nThen $s_i = w(i, \\text{parent}(i)) \\cdot x_i$. So $w(i, \\text{parent}(i)) = s_i \\cdot x_i^{-1} = -x_i$.\nThis means if we choose all edge weights $(i, j)$ where $j$ is a child of $i$ (i.e., edges not incident to parent), the remaining edge weights are determined.\nThere are $n-1$ edges. If we root the tree at an arbitrary vertex $r$, we can choose the weights for $n-1$ edges $(u, v)$ where $v$ is a child of $u$. Once these are chosen, the weights of all edges are determined by the condition $s_i=-1$ for all $i \\ne r$. The condition for vertex $r$ must then be satisfied automatically.\nLet's try a different approach. For $n$ vertices, pick an arbitrary vertex $k$. For any $n-2$ edges not incident to $k$, we can assign weights $1$ or $-1$ independently. For each such choice, the weights of the edges incident to $k$ are determined by the conditions for vertices $i \\ne k$. Then the condition for $k$ must also be satisfied.\nIt can be shown that for any fixed tree structure, there are exactly $2^{n-1-1} = 2^{n-2}$ ways to assign weights such that all conditions are met, provided $n$ is even. (This is because one condition is redundant).\nSo, the total number of good trees is $n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2}$.\n\n**Sum of $d(1, n)$ over good trees:**\nLet $P_{1,n}$ be the unique path from $1$ to $n$. $d(1, n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w(u,v)$.\nThe problem asks for $\\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} d_T(1, n)$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary edge $(u, v)$. What is the sum of its weight $w(u, v)$ over all good trees?\nThere are $n^{n-2}$ possible tree structures.\nFor a fixed tree structure, there are $2^{n-2}$ ways to assign weights if $n$ is even.\nLet's fix an edge $(u, v)$. We want to find the sum of $w(u, v)$ over all good trees.\nBy symmetry, for any two distinct edges $(u, v)$ and $(x, y)$, the sum of $w(u, v)$ will be the same as the sum of $w(x, y)$.\nLet $S_{uv} = \\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} w_T(u, v)$.\nLet $K = n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ be the total number of good trees.\nFor any fixed tree structure, there are $2^{n-2}$ ways to assign weights.\nLet's fix a tree structure. Consider an edge $(u, v)$. Is it possible that $w(u, v) = 1$ for some choices and $w(u, v) = -1$ for others, and they cancel out?\nYes. If we fix all edge weights except $w(u,v)$, then $w(u,v)$ is determined by the conditions.\nHowever, we can pick an arbitrary edge $(u,v)$ and assign it $1$. Then the remaining $n-2$ equations determine the remaining $n-2$ edges.\nIt turns out that for any fixed tree structure and any fixed edge $(u,v)$, $w(u,v)$ will be $1$ for exactly half of the $2^{n-2}$ weight assignments and $-1$ for the other half.\nSo, for a fixed tree structure, $\\sum_{\\text{weight assignments}} w(u,v) = 2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 + 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) = 0$.\nThis means that $S_{uv} = 0$ for any edge $(u, v)$.\n\nThis implies that $\\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} d_T(1, n) = \\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} \\sum_{\\text{good trees } T} w_T(u,v) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} S_{uv} = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} 0 = 0$.\n\nThis result seems too simple and contradicts the examples for $n=2$ and $n=4$.\nLet's re-evaluate the claim that $\\sum_{\\text{weight assignments}} w(u,v) = 0$.\n\nThe conditions are $\\prod_{j \\in N(i)} w(i, j) = -1$ for all $i$.\nLet $E_0$ be the set of edges whose weights are fixed to $1$. Let $E_1$ be the set of edges whose weights are fixed to $-1$. Let $E_? = E \\setminus (E_0 \\cup E_1)$ be the set of edges whose weights are yet to be determined.\nThe system of equations is $M \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{w}$ is a vector of edge weights (represented as $\\pm 1$), and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a vector of $-1$'s. If we take logarithms base 2, we get a system over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nLet $w(e) = (-1)^{x_e}$ where $x_e \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe conditions become $\\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ with $n-1$ variables.\nThe sum of all $n$ equations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left side is $\\sum_{e \\in E} 2 x_e \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe right side is $n \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $0 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. This implies $n$ must be even.\n\nIf $n$ is even, the system has rank $n-1$. This means there is one free variable.\nFor a fixed tree structure, we can choose the value of one edge weight freely, and the other $n-2$ edge weights are determined.\nFor example, choose $w(1,2)$ to be $1$. Then the other $n-2$ edge weights are determined.\nThe number of solutions for a fixed tree structure is $2^1 = 2$.\nLet $(x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1})$ be one solution. Then $(x_1+c_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}+c_{n-1})$ is another solution for some constants $c_j$.\nThe two solutions are $(x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1})$ and $(x_1+c, \\dots, x_{n-1}+c)$ for some $c$.\nLet's consider the two solutions for the weights $w(e)$. If $w_1(e)$ is one solution, the other solution is $w_2(e)$.\nIt's known that if $n$ is even, for any fixed tree, there are exactly two ways to assign weights. Let these be $W_1 = \\{w_1(e)\\}_{e \\in E}$ and $W_2 = \\{w_2(e)\\}_{e \\in E}$.\nIt can be shown that $w_2(e) = -w_1(e)$ for all $e \\in E$.\nTo see this, if $W_1$ is a valid assignment, then for each $i$, $\\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w_1(e) = -1$.\nIf we define $W_2$ by $w_2(e) = -w_1(e)$ for all $e$, then for each $i$:\n$\\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w_2(e) = \\prod_{e \\in N(i)} (-w_1(e)) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} \\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w_1(e) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} (-1)$.\nThis must be equal to $-1$. So $(-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} (-1) = -1$, which implies $(-1)^{\\text{deg}(i)} = 1$.\nThis means $\\text{deg}(i)$ must be even for all $i$.\nHowever, this is not true for all trees (e.g., a star graph with $n \\ge 3$ has a center with degree $n-1$, which is odd if $n$ is even).\nSo the claim $w_2(e) = -w_1(e)$ for all $e$ is incorrect.\n\nThe correct statement is that there are exactly two solutions. If we fix an arbitrary edge $e_0$, we can choose $w(e_0)=1$ or $w(e_0)=-1$. For each choice, the other $n-2$ edge weights are uniquely determined.\nLet $W_1$ be the assignment where $w(e_0)=1$, and $W_2$ be the assignment where $w(e_0)=-1$.\nFor any other edge $e \\ne e_0$, it is not necessarily true that $w_1(e) = -w_2(e)$.\nExample $n=2$: one edge $(1,2)$. $\\text{deg}(1)=1, \\text{deg}(2)=1$. $w(1,2)=-1$ for $s_1=-1$. $w(1,2)=-1$ for $s_2=-1$. Unique solution $w(1,2)=-1$. $d(1,2)=-1$.\nExample $n=4$:\nTotal good trees: $4^{4-2} \\cdot 2^{4-2} = 4^2 \\cdot 2^2 = 16 \\cdot 4 = 64$.\nThe problem states $16$ good trees for $n=4$. The problem statement says $n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ total trees.\nIf $n$ is even, there are $n^{n-2}$ tree structures. Each has $2^{n-1-(n-1)+1} = 2^1=2$ weight assignments.\nSo total good trees $n^{n-2} \\cdot 2$. For $n=4$, $4^2 \\cdot 2 = 16 \\cdot 2 = 32$.\nThe example states $16$ good trees for $n=4$. This suggests $2^{n-2}$ is the number of good trees for a fixed structure.\nThis implies for $n$ even, there are $n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ good trees. For $n=4$, $4^2 \\cdot 2^2 = 16 \\cdot 4 = 64$.\nThe problem example $n=4$ output $-10$.\nLet's re-read the problem: \"for each vertex $i$, the product of the edge weights of all edges having $i$ as one endpoint is $-1$\".\nThis is exactly $\\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w(e) = -1$.\nThe number of solutions for $n$ even is $2^{n-1 - (n-1)} = 2^0 = 1$ if the system has rank $n-1$.\nThis means for a fixed tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign weights.\nIf there is only one way to assign weights for each tree structure, then $w(u,v)$ is uniquely determined for each edge.\nThen $S_{uv} = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T} w_T(u,v)$. This is not necessarily 0.\n\nLet's check the rank:\nThe system of $n$ equations $\\sum_{e \\in N(i)} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ has $n-1$ variables $x_e$.\nThe sum of all equations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\sum_{e \\in N(i)} x_e) = \\sum_{e \\in E} 2x_e \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe sum of all right-hand sides is $\\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$.\nSo $0 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. This means if $n$ is odd, no solutions. If $n$ is even, the sum of equations is consistent.\nThis means the rank of the matrix is $n-1$.\nSince there are $n-1$ variables, the number of solutions is $2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} = 2^0 = 1$.\nSo for each tree structure, if $n$ is even, there is exactly one way to assign weights.\nTotal number of good trees: $n^{n-2} \\cdot 1 = n^{n-2}$.\nFor $n=4$, this is $4^{4-2} = 16$. This matches the example!\n\nOkay, so for $n$ even, there is exactly one way to assign weights for each tree structure.\nLet $w_T(u,v)$ be this unique weight for tree structure $T$.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThis can be rewritten as $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n} \\text{ and } T \\text{ is good}} w_T(u,v)$.\nSince $w_T(u,v)$ is uniquely determined by $T$, we just need to sum up $w_T(u,v)$ for trees where $(u,v)$ is on path $P_{1,n}$.\n\nLet's use the result from a similar problem (or derive it).\nConsider an edge $(u,v)$. How many trees contain this edge?\nBy Cayley's formula, there are $n^{n-2}$ trees.\nThe number of trees containing a specific edge $(u,v)$ is $2 \\cdot n^{n-3}$ (for $n \\ge 2$).\nThis is obtained by contracting $(u,v)$ into a single vertex, forming a tree on $n-1$ vertices, which has $(n-1)^{n-3}$ trees.\nMore directly: Delete edge $(u,v)$. This splits the tree into two components, one containing $u$ and one containing $v$. Let these components have sizes $k$ and $n-k$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ vertices where $u$ and $v$ are in different components of sizes $k$ and $n-k$ and are connected by an edge is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nSumming over all $k$: $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-3}(n-1)$.\nThis is the number of trees containing edge $(u,v)$.\n\nThe sum $d(1,n)$ is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w(u,v)$.\nThe path $P_{1,n}$ has length $L$.\nThere are $n^{n-3}(n-1)$ trees that contain a specific edge $(u,v)$.\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$. How many trees have $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$?\nThis means $u$ is in the component of $1$ when $(u,v)$ is removed, and $v$ is in the component of $n$ (or vice versa).\nSuppose $u$ is closer to $1$ and $v$ is closer to $n$.\nWhen $(u,v)$ is removed, the tree splits into two components. Let $C_u$ be the component containing $u$ (and $1$), and $C_v$ be the component containing $v$ (and $n$).\nLet $|C_u|=k$ and $|C_v|=n-k$.\nThe number of such trees is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nSumming over $k=1, \\dots, n-1$: $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-3}(n-1)$.\nThis is the number of trees where $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1,n}$ in the correct orientation.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} \\left( \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v) \\right)$.\n\nThis problem structure is similar to problems solvable using generating functions and Prufer sequences.\nLet's consider the value $w(u,v)$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$.\nThe condition $\\prod_{j \\in N(i)} w(i, j) = -1$ for all $i$.\nLet $x_e \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be such that $w(e) = (-1)^{x_e}$.\n$\\sum_{e \\in N(i)} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for all $i$.\nThis system has a unique solution for $x_e$ if $n$ is even.\nThe value of $x_e$ for an edge $e=(u,v)$ can be expressed as follows:\nRoot the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say $1$. For any vertex $i \\ne 1$, let $p(i)$ be its parent.\nThen $x_{(i, p(i))} \\equiv 1 + \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } i} x_{(i,j)} \\pmod 2$.\nThis allows us to determine $x_e$ for all edges recursively from leaves up to the root.\nThe value of $x_e$ for $e=(u,v)$ depends on the subtree rooted at $v$ (assuming $u$ is parent of $v$).\nSpecifically, $w(u,v) = (-1)^{x_{(u,v)}}$.\n$x_{(u,v)} \\equiv 1 + \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } v} x_{(v,j)} \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $x_{(u,v)} \\equiv 1 + \\sum_{i \\in \\text{subtree}(v), i \\ne v} x_{(\\text{parent}(i), i)} \\pmod 2$.\nThis is related to the parity of the number of vertices in the subtree rooted at $v$.\nIt can be shown that $x_{(u,v)} \\equiv \\text{size of subtree rooted at } v \\pmod 2$.\nSo $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|S_v|}$, where $S_v$ is the component containing $v$ if edge $(u,v)$ is removed, and $u$ is the parent of $v$.\nLet's verify this. If $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|S_v|}$ for all edges $(u,v)$ where $v$ is a child of $u$.\nFor any vertex $i$:\n$\\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w(e) = w(i, p(i)) \\prod_{j \\text{ child of } i} w(i, j)$\n$= (-1)^{|S_i|} \\prod_{j \\text{ child of } i} (-1)^{|S_j|}$\n$= (-1)^{|S_i| + \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } i} |S_j|}$.\nThe sum $|S_i| + \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } i} |S_j|$ is the size of the subtree rooted at $p(i)$ (if $i$ is not root) minus the size of the subtree rooted at $i$ plus the sum of sizes of subtrees rooted at children of $i$. This is not simple.\n\nLet's use the property that $x_e = \\text{size of component on one side of } e \\pmod 2$.\nFor an edge $e=(u,v)$, removing it splits the tree into two components $C_u$ (containing $u$) and $C_v$ (containing $v$).\nThe weight $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_u|} = (-1)^{|C_v|}$ is incorrect.\nThe sum $\\sum_{e \\in N(i)} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n$x_{(u,v)}$ is the unique solution to the system.\nLet $T_v$ be the subtree rooted at $v$ (assuming $u$ is parent of $v$).\nThen $x_{(u,v)} \\equiv 1 + \\sum_{j \\in \\text{children}(v)} x_{(v,j)} \\pmod 2$.\nThis is $x_{(u,v)} \\equiv \\text{deg}(v) + 1 \\pmod 2$ if $v$ is a leaf.\nIt can be shown that $w(u,v) = (-1)^{\\text{size of component that contains } v \\text{ when } (u,v) \\text{ is removed}}$.\nLet $C_v$ be the component containing $v$ when edge $(u,v)$ is removed.\nThen $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_v|}$.\nLet's check this. Suppose $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_v|}$ for all edges $(u,v)$.\nThen for any vertex $i$:\n$\\prod_{e \\in N(i)} w(e) = \\prod_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} (-1)^{|C_j|}$ where $C_j$ is the component containing $j$ when $(i,j)$ is removed.\n$= (-1)^{\\sum_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} |C_j|}$.\nWe need this to be $-1$. So $\\sum_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} |C_j|$ must be odd.\nNote that $\\sum_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} |C_j| = \\sum_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} (n - |C_i \\text{ w.r.t. } j|)$.\nLet $S_i$ be the set of vertices in the component containing $i$ when all edges incident to $i$ are removed.\nThis is not $n-|C_u|$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{e=(i,j) \\in N(i)} |C_j|$ is $\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} (n - |C_i^{(j)}|)$, where $C_i^{(j)}$ is the component containing $i$ when $(i,j)$ is removed.\n$\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} (n - |C_i^{(j)}|) = n \\cdot \\text{deg}(i) - \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} |C_i^{(j)}|$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} |C_i^{(j)}|$ is not simple.\nIt is known that the sum of sizes of components formed by removing edges incident to $i$ is $n \\cdot (\\text{deg}(i)-1) + 1$.\nSo $\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} |C_j| = n \\cdot \\text{deg}(i) - (n \\cdot (\\text{deg}(i)-1) + 1) = n - 1$.\nSo the condition becomes $(-1)^{n-1} = -1$.\nThis means $n-1$ must be odd, which implies $n$ must be even.\nThis formula $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_v|}$ (where $C_v$ is the component containing $v$ when $(u,v)$ is removed) correctly determines the unique weights if $n$ is even.\n\nSo, for each good tree $T$, $w_T(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_v|}$ where $C_v$ is the component containing $v$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{|C_v|}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{k_{(u,v)}}$ where $k_{(u,v)}$ is the size of the component containing $v$ (the one further from $1$) if $(u,v)$ is removed.\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$. We need to sum $(-1)^{k}$ over all trees where $(u,v)$ is on path $P_{1,n}$ and $v$ is $k$ nodes away from $n$.\nThe number of trees where $(u,v)$ is an edge, and $u$ is in the component of $1$ (size $k$) and $v$ is in the component of $n$ (size $n-k$) is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor such a tree, $w(u,v) = (-1)^{n-k}$.\nSo the sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$.\nThis is a known identity related to Abel's identity: $\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+ky)^{k-1} (z+(n-k)y)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{x+z}{xz} (x+z+ny)^{n-1}$.\nA related identity is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k} = -n^{n-3}(n-1)$.\nThis identity can be found in various sources, for example, \"Combinatorial Identities\" by H.W. Gould.\nSpecifically, it is a variation of the identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-3}(n-1)$.\nThe sign $(-1)^{n-k}$ implies that if $n-k$ is even, $w(u,v)=1$, if $n-k$ is odd, $w(u,v)=-1$.\nLet $j = n-k$. Then $k=n-j$.\nThe sum becomes $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{n-j-1} (n-j)^{n-j-1} j^{j-1} (-1)^{j}$.\nSince $\\binom{n-2}{n-j-1} = \\binom{n-2}{j-1}$, this is $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{j-1} (n-j)^{n-j-1} j^{j-1} (-1)^{j}$.\nThis is exactly the expression for the sum of $w(u,v)$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$.\nThis sum is equal to $-n^{n-3}(n-1)$ if $n$ is even. (This is a known result for specific $w(u,v)$ assignments).\n\nThe sum of $d(1,n)$ for all good trees is $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThe path $P_{1,n}$ has length $L$.\nThe number of edges on the path $P_{1,n}$ is $L$. $L$ can range from $1$ to $n-1$.\nLet $N_L$ be the number of good trees where the path $P_{1,n}$ has length $L$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{L=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } |P_{1,n}|=L} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThis can be written as $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nBy symmetry, the sum $\\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$ is the same for all edges $(u,v)$.\nLet this sum be $S_E$.\nThen the total sum is $S_E \\times (\\text{number of edges})$.\nBut the number of edges is $n-1$. This means the sum is $(n-1) \\cdot S_E$.\n$S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$.\nAs stated above, this sum is $-n^{n-3}(n-1)$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nSo the total sum is $(n-1) \\cdot (-n^{n-3}(n-1)) = -(n-1)^2 n^{n-3}$.\n\nLet's check the examples.\n$n=1$: Output $0$. Formula $-(1-1)^2 1^{1-3} = 0$. Correct.\n$n=2$: Output $998244352 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nFormula $-(2-1)^2 2^{2-3} = -(1)^2 2^{-1} = -1 \\cdot (1/2)$.\nModulo $998244353$, $1/2 = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\nSo $-(1/2) \\equiv -499122177 \\pmod{998244353} \\equiv 499122176 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThis does not match $-1$.\n\nWhat went wrong?\nThe sum $S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$ is for an edge $(u,v)$ where $u$ is in component of size $k$ and $v$ in component of size $n-k$.\nThe formula $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_v|}$ means the component further from $1$.\nSo if $u$ is closer to $1$, $v$ is further from $1$, then $|C_v| = n-k$.\nThe formula is correct.\n\nLet's re-check the $n=2$ case.\nOnly one tree: $1-2$. $w(1,2)=-1$. $d(1,2)=-1$.\nOur formula $-(n-1)^2 n^{n-3}$ gives $-(2-1)^2 2^{2-3} = -1 \\cdot 2^{-1} = -1/2$.\nModulo $998244353$, this is $499122177$.\nThis is not $-1$.\n\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k} = -n^{n-3}(n-1)$ is correct for $n \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=2$:\nThe sum is $\\binom{0}{0} 1^{1-1} 1^{1-1} (-1)^{2-1} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nThe formula $-n^{n-3}(n-1)$ for $n=2$: $-2^{2-3}(2-1) = -2^{-1} \\cdot 1 = -1/2$.\nSo the identity does not hold for $n=2$.\nFor $n=2$, $S_E = -1$.\nThe total sum is $(n-1) \\cdot S_E = (2-1) \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nThis matches the $n=2$ example!\n\nSo the result is:\nIf $n$ is odd, the answer is $0$.\nIf $n=2$, the answer is $-1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nIf $n$ is even and $n \\ge 4$, the answer is $-(n-1)^2 n^{n-3} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check $n=4$:\nOutput $998244343 \\equiv -10 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nFormula $-(4-1)^2 4^{4-3} = -(3)^2 4^1 = -9 \\cdot 4 = -36$.\nThis does not match $-10$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sum $S_E$ for $n=4$.\n$S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\binom{2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (4-k)^{4-k-1} (-1)^{4-k}$.\n$k=1: \\binom{2}{0} 1^{0} 3^{2} (-1)^{3} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot (-1) = -9$.\n$k=2: \\binom{2}{1} 2^{1} 2^{1} (-1)^{2} = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 8$.\n$k=3: \\binom{2}{2} 3^{2} 1^{0} (-1)^{1} = 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = -9$.\n$S_E = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10$.\nThis value $S_E = -10$ is the sum of $w(u,v)$ over all good trees where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$.\nThe total sum is $(n-1) \\cdot S_E$ if $S_E$ is the sum over all edges.\nBut $S_E$ is the sum for a specific edge $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThe number of edges on $P_{1,n}$ is not fixed.\nThe number of good trees is $n^{n-2}$.\nThe sum $S_E$ is for a specific edge $(u,v)$ assuming it is on $P_{1,n}$.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\text{ is an edge}} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nBy symmetry, the value $\\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$ is the same for all edges $(u,v)$.\nLet $S_{1,n}$ be the answer we are looking for.\n$S_{1,n} = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThe $S_E$ calculated above is the sum for a fixed edge $(u,v)$ which is part of $P_{1,n}$.\nThe number of edges is $n-1$.\nThe sum $S_E$ is for an arbitrary edge $(u,v)$, which is on the path from $1$ to $n$.\nSo $S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$.\nThis is indeed the answer for $n=4$, $S_E = -10$.\nThis means the sum of $d(1,n)$ for all good trees is $S_E$.\nThis would imply that the sum of $d(1,n)$ for all good trees is the value $S_E$.\nThis would mean $d(1,n)$ is always the same for all good trees, which is not true.\n$d(1,n)$ is specific to each tree.\n\nIs the sum $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$ the same for all trees $T$? No.\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$ is the sum of $w(u,v)$ over all trees where $u$ is in component of size $k$ (containing 1) and $v$ is in component of size $n-k$ (containing $n$).\nThis is the sum of $w(u,v)$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$.\nSo the sum $S_E$ is the sum of $w(u,v)$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$ over ALL trees where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$.\nThe question asks for $\\sum_{T} d_T(1,n)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{(u,v)} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(u,v)$.\nThe inner sum is $S_E$.\nThe outer sum is over all possible edges $(u,v)$ that could be on path $P_{1,n}$.\nBut $P_{1,n}$ is unique for each tree.\nThis means we are summing $S_E$ for all possible edges.\nThe problem is that the set of edges on $P_{1,n}$ varies from tree to tree.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\nLet $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the tree, where $A_{ij} = w(i,j)$ if $(i,j)$ is an edge, and $0$ otherwise.\n$d(u,v)$ is the sum of weights on the path from $u$ to $v$.\nThis is a standard problem type for generating functions on trees.\nThe sum $\\sum_{T} d_T(1,n)$ can be rephrased as $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(e)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } e \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(e)$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } e \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(e)$ is precisely $S_E$.\nThe sum is $S_E \\times (\\text{number of distinct edges } (u,v) \\text{ that can be on } P_{1,n})$.\nThe path $P_{1,n}$ consists of edges $(u,v)$ such that $u$ is in the component of $1$ and $v$ is in the component of $n$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nAny edge $(u,v)$ can be on the path $P_{1,n}$ for some tree.\nSo there are $n(n-1)/2$ possible edges.\nThis is incorrect. The sum is over distinct good trees.\nThe sum $\\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{T \\text{ good, } e \\in P_{1,n}} w_T(e)$ means we are summing $w(e)$ for each edge $e$ that is on the path $P_{1,n}$ in a good tree $T$.\nSo we sum $S_E$ for each possible edge $(u,v)$.\nBut this should be $S_E$ multiplied by the count of edges in $P_{1,n}$ averaged over all trees.\nThe average length of a path between two nodes $u,v$ in a random tree is $n-1$.\nThe expected length of the path $P_{1,n}$ is $n-1$.\nThis means the sum is $(n-1) \\cdot S_E$.\nThis is the result I got earlier.\n\nLet's re-check $n=4$:\nThe formula $-(n-1)^2 n^{n-3}$ gives $-36$.\nThe example output is $-10$.\nSo the formula must be $S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$.\nThis sum is $-10$ for $n=4$.\nThis sum is $-1$ for $n=2$.\nThis sum is $0$ for $n=1$.\n\nThis matches all examples. So the answer is $S_E$.\nWhy is it $S_E$?\nThe sum is $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n)$.\n$d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_T(e)$.\nSo the total sum is $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_T(e)$.\nLet $P_{1,n}(T)$ denote the path from $1$ to $n$ in tree $T$.\nWe can swap the summation order: $\\sum_{e} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_T(e)$.\nHere $e$ ranges over all possible edges $(u,v)$ for $1 \\le u < v \\le n$.\nLet $S(e) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_T(e)$.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{e} S(e)$.\nBy symmetry, $S(e)$ should be the same for all edges $e=(u,v)$ where $u,v$ are distinct from $1,n$.\nAnd maybe different if $e$ involves $1$ or $n$.\nBut the problem is symmetric with respect to all vertices.\nThe condition $e \\in P_{1,n}(T)$ means that $e$ separates $1$ from $n$.\nIf $e=(u,v)$ is an edge, and $e$ separates $1$ from $n$, it means $1$ and $u$ are in one component, and $n$ and $v$ are in the other (or vice versa).\nThe number of such trees is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor any edge $(u,v)$, it is equally likely to be on the path $P_{1,n}$ as any other edge $(x,y)$.\nSo $S(e)$ should be the same for all edges $e$.\nLet $S(e) = S_0$.\nThen the total sum is $\\binom{n}{2} S_0$. This is still not matching.\n\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$ is exactly the sum of $d(1,n)$ over all rooted trees where $1$ is the root and $n$ is a leaf. No, this is not it.\n\nThe sum is $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n)$.\nLet $f(n)$ be the answer.\n$f(1) = 0$.\n$f(2) = -1$.\n$f(4) = -10$.\n\nThe formula for $S_E$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k}$.\nThis sum is denoted by $A_n$.\nThis is exactly the value that matches the examples.\nSo the answer is $A_n$.\n\nLet's verify the identity $A_n = -n^{n-3}(n-1)$ for $n \\ge 3$ for $n$ even.\nFor $n=4$: $-4^{4-3}(4-1) = -4^1 \\cdot 3 = -12$.\nBut $A_4 = -10$. So this identity is wrong.\nThe identity is for $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$. This is $n^{n-3}(n-1)$.\nThe $(-1)^{n-k}$ term makes it different.\n\nWe need to compute $A_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^{n-k} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThis involves powers $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\n$n$ can be up to $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\nWe need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials for combinations.\nWe also need to compute powers $a^b \\pmod M$.\n$k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ can be computed using modular exponentiation.\nThe sum has $n-1$ terms.
