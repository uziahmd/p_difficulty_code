Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this problem. I'm tasked with counting non-degenerate triangles with integer sides, given some constraints on the range of the sides. Essentially, I need to find how many valid triples (x, y, z) exist, where A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D, and x + y > z.**\n\nFirst, I observe that the triangle inequality simplifies to x + y > z because of the ordered nature of the sides (x <= y <= z). This significantly reduces the complexity. Now, the main challenge is to efficiently count these valid triples within the given bounds.\n\nA naive approach of iterating through all possible x, y, and z values would be too slow, given the range of the inputs. So, I need a more clever strategy.\n\nThe core idea is to fix x and y and then figure out the valid range for z.  For fixed values of `x` and `y`, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`. This means that `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`. The number of possible values for z is then determined by the range of allowed z values (which comes out to be `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`).\n\nNow, if I try to iterate over all x and y values, this still seems too inefficient (quadratic time).  I need to be smart and change the order of iteration. I can try to fix `x` and iterate `y`, calculate the number of z values and sum them up.\n\nHowever, after some careful thought, I figured out that this could be further optimized by changing the iteration logic.\nIt's more efficient to iterate through possible sums `k = x + y` (where `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`) and count the number of pairs (x, y) that sum up to k. I can count these pairs using two variables `L_x` and `R_x`, which determine a valid range of x values, given k. For each `k`, I can calculate the count of valid x, y pairs with sum `k`. I multiply this count by the number of valid `z` values, given `k`. `z` values can range from C to `min(D, k - 1)`.\n\nThis leads to the crucial equation to calculate the result:\n`Total = sum_{k=C+1 to B+C} count_xy(k) * (min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`\nwhere `count_xy(k)` represents the number of (x,y) pairs such that `A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, x + y = k`.\n\nEssentially, I'm precomputing the number of valid (x,y) pairs for a given sum `k`.  This turns out to be a much more efficient approach. `count_xy(k)` changes its value at two points which can be computed in constant time.\n\nOverall, it looks like a single loop from `k = A + B` to `B + C` should be sufficient, with constant time operations inside the loop.  The time complexity seems to be roughly O(B+C), which should be fast enough. This avoids the quadratic time of the naive solution and provides an efficient way to count these triangles.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nThe conditions for a non-degenerate triangle are the triangle inequalities:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, it implies `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z` and `x >= A >= 1`:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This condition is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= x`, `y + z >= x + x = 2x`. Since `x >= 1`, `2x > x`. This condition is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, we only need to satisfy the first condition: `x + y > z`.\n\nCombining all conditions, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` such such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nFrom condition 4, `z` must be at most `x + y - 1`.\nCombining with condition 3, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nFor a fixed pair `(x, y)`, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nNote that `min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1` must be positive, which means `min(D, x + y - 1) >= C`.\nSince `D >= C` is given, this simplifies to `x + y - 1 >= C`, or `x + y >= C + 1`. If `x + y <= C`, there are no valid `z` values.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x` from `A` to `B`, and `y` from `B` to `C`. For each `(x, y)` pair, calculate the number of `z` values. This would be `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1))` which can be up to `(5 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}` operations in the worst case, too slow.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over the sum `k = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `k` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum possible value for `k` is `B + C`.\nSo `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value of `B + C` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`. This range for `k` is manageable.\n\nFor a fixed `k = x + y`, we need to find the number of pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `x + y = k`\n\nFrom `y = k - x`, substitute into condition 2:\n`B <= k - x <= C`\nThis gives two inequalities for `x`:\n- `B <= k - x`  =>  `x <= k - B`\n- `k - x <= C`  =>  `x >= k - C`\n\nCombining all conditions for `x`:\n`max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)`\n\nLet `L_x(k) = max(A, k - C)` and `R_x(k) = min(B, k - B)`.\nThe number of valid `x` values for a fixed `k` is `max(0, R_x(k) - L_x(k) + 1)`. Let's call this `count_xy(k)`.\nIf `count_xy(k) > 0`, then for each such `x`, `y = k - x` is uniquely determined and satisfies `B <= y <= C`.\n\nNow, the total count of triangles is the sum over all possible `k`:\n`Total = sum_{k=A+B}^{B+C} count_xy(k) * max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`\n\nAs established earlier, `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)` is non-zero only if `k >= C + 1`.\nSo the sum can be restricted to `k` from `max(A+B, C+1)` to `B+C`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n3. For each `k`:\n    a. Calculate `L_x(k) = max(A, k - C)`.\n    b. Calculate `R_x(k) = min(B, k - B)`.\n    c. Calculate `num_xy_pairs = max(0, R_x(k) - L_x(k) + 1)`.\n    d. If `num_xy_pairs > 0` and `k >= C + 1`:\n        i. Calculate `num_z_values = min(D, k - 1) - C + 1`.\n        ii. Add `num_xy_pairs * num_z_values` to `total_triangles`.\n4. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` is `B + C`, which is `10^6`. The loop runs `O(B+C)` times. Inside the loop, operations are constant time. This makes the overall complexity `O(B+C)`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\nThe maximum possible `total_triangles` can be up to `(10^6) * (5 \\cdot 10^5) * (5 \\cdot 10^5) = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{17}`, which fits in a 64-bit integer type (Python handles large integers automatically).\n\nExample 1: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`k` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n- `k = 3`: `L_x(3)=max(1, 3-3)=1`, `R_x(3)=min(2, 3-2)=1`. `num_xy_pairs = 1-1+1 = 1`.
