    "thought": "**Analyzing Integer Triangles Within Defined Bounds**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of counting non-degenerate integer triangles. The core of it is finding triangles with sides `x`, `y`, and `z`, but there are specific bounds on these sides: `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`.  These bounds are the real constraint here, so I need to keep those at the forefront of my thinking.\n\nMy initial thought is that the triangle inequality states `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`. Since the side lengths are positive integers, I can reason that some of these inequalities will always hold true given the imposed bounds. Specifically, with `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, I realize that `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` will always be satisfied because I'm essentially adding a positive value to a larger value, or a combination of larger values, compared to a smaller one. So, that leaves me with `x + y > z` as the critical condition.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the implications of the bounds.  We know `x <= y <= z` doesn't strictly have to be true, although generally this pattern emerges. By looking at the ranges, I can confidently state that `x <= y` and `y <= z` must always be true under these conditions. If `x = B` and `y = B` the constraint holds, and we are working our way up. Because of that, `x <= y <= z` simplifies my analysis because now I just have to focus on `x + y > z`.\n\nWith the bounds simplified, and knowing `x <= y <= z`, the number of possible values for the sides can be counted. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D` holds.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nAnd the given constraints on the sides:\n`A <= x <= B`\n`B <= y <= C`\n`C <= z <= D`\nAlso, `A <= B <= C <= D`.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the relative order of `x`, `y`, and `z`:\n- Since `x <= B` and `y >= B`, it implies `x <= y`.\n- Since `y <= C` and `z >= C`, it implies `y <= z`.\nCombining these, we have `x <= y <= z`.\n\nWith `x <= y <= z`, the triangle inequalities simplify:\n- `x + z > y`: This is always true because `z >= y` (from `y <= z`) and `x >= A >= 1`. So `x + z >= 1 + y > y`.\n- `y + z > x`: This is always true because `y >= x` (from `x <= y`) and `z >= C >= B >= A >= 1`. So `y + z >= x + 1 > x`.\n- `x + y > z`: This is the only critical inequality we need to satisfy.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, count the valid `z` values.\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`:\n- `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D`.\n- `z` must satisfy `z < x + y`.\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z < x + y` and `z <= D`.\nSo, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive triple loop for `x`, `y`, `z` would be too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`.\nThe outer loops for `x` and `y` would be `(B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)`, which can be up to `5 * 10^5 * 5 * 10^5 = 2.5 * 10^{11}` in the worst case (e.g., `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=5e5`). This is also too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's fix `x` and iterate `y`.\nFor a fixed `x` (where `A <= x <= B`), we need to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` over `y` (where `B <= y <= C`).\nLet `k = x + y - 1`. The term is `max(0, min(D, k) - C + 1)`.\nThe value `k` ranges from `x + B - 1` to `x + C - 1`.\n\nThe expression `min(D, k) - C + 1` depends on `k`.\n- If `k <= C`, then `min(D, k) - C + 1 = k - C + 1`. Since `k <= C`, `k - C + 1 <= 1`. If `k < C`, this term is `0` or negative, so `max(0, ...)` makes it `0`. If `k = C`, the term is `1`.\n- If `C < k <= D`, then `min(D, k) - C + 1 = k - C + 1`. This term is positive.\n- If `k > D`, then `min(D, k) - C + 1 = D - C + 1`. This term is positive.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `x + y > z` means `S > z`.\nSo for fixed `x, y`, we need to count `z` such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < S`.\nThis means `C <= z <= min(D, S - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet's iterate over `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, we need to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` for `y` from `B` to `C`.\nLet `f(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`. We need to calculate `sum_{y=B}^{C} f(x+y)`.\nThe sum is over `S = x+y`. The minimum `S` is `x+B`, and maximum `S` is `x+C`.\nThe range of `S` is `[x+B, x+C]`.\n\nThe function `f(S)` has a specific structure:\n- If `S - 1 < C` (i.e., `S <= C`), `f(S) = 0`. (Because `min(D, S-1) <= S-1 < C`, so `min(D, S-1) - C + 1 <= 0`).\n- If `C <= S - 1 <= D` (i.e., `C+1 <= S <= D+1`), `f(S) = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`.\n- If `S - 1 > D` (i.e., `S > D+1`), `f(S) = D - C + 1`.\n\nThis means `f(S)` is:\n- `0` for `S <= C`.\n- `S - C` for `C < S <= D + 1`.\n- `D - C + 1` for `S > D + 1`.\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums of `f(S)` or use a technique called \"sum over ranges\".\nThe maximum value for `S = x + y` is `B + C`. The maximum value for `B + C` is `5e5 + 5e5 = 10^6`.\nThis suggests we can iterate `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, we need to sum `f(S)` for `S` in `[x+B, x+C]`.\n\nLet's define `count_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThe total count is `sum_{x=A}^{B} (sum_{y=B}^{C} count_z(x+y))`.\nLet `S_min = B+C`, `S_max = B+D`. (This is not quite right, `S_max` is `B+C`).\nThe maximum value `S = x+y` can take is `B+C`.\nThe minimum value `S = x+y` can take is `A+B`.\nThe range of `S` is `[A+B, B+C]`.\n\nLet's try to fix `S = x+y`.\nFor a fixed `S`, we need to count pairs `(x, y)` such that `x+y=S`, `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nFrom `x+y=S`, we have `y = S-x`.\nSubstitute `y` into its constraints: `B <= S-x <= C`.\nThis gives:\n`S-x >= B` => `x <= S-B`\n`S-x <= C` => `x >= S-C`\nSo, for a fixed `S`, `x` must be in `[max(A, S-C), min(B, S-B)]`.\nThe number of such `x` values is `max(0, min(B, S-B) - max(A, S-C) + 1)`. Let this be `num_pairs(S)`.\n\nThe total count is `sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} num_pairs(S) * count_z(S)`.\nThe maximum value for `S` is `B+C`, which is `5e5 + 5e5 = 10^6`.\nThis sum iterates `S` up to `10^6` times. Inside the loop, `num_pairs(S)` and `count_z(S)` are `O(1)` operations.\nThis approach would be `O(B+C)`, which is `O(D_max + D_max) = O(2 * 5 * 10^5) = O(10^6)`. This is efficient enough.\n\nLet's define the terms more precisely:\n`S_low = A + B`\n`S_high = B + C`\n`total_triangles = 0`\n\nFor `S` from `S_low` to `S_high`:\n  `x_lower_bound = max(A, S - C)`\n  `x_upper_bound = min(B, S - B)`\n  `count_x_for_S = max(0, x_upper_bound - x_lower_bound + 1)`\n\n  `count_z_for_S = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`\n\n  `total_triangles += count_x_for_S * count_z_for_S`\n\nLet's check the example `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`.\n`S_low = 1+2 = 3`\n`S_high = 2+3 = 5`\n\n`count_z_for_S` definition: `max(0, min(4, S-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, S-1) - 2)`\n- `S=3`: `count_z_for_S = max(0, min(4, 2) - 2) = max(0, 2 - 2) = 0`\n- `S=4`: `count_z_for_S = max(0, min(4, 3) - 2) = max(0, 3 - 2) = 1`\n- `S=5`: `count_z_for_S = max(0, min(4, 4) - 2) = max(0, 4 - 2) = 2`\n\n`num_pairs(S)` definition: `max(0, min(B, S-B) - max(A, S-C) + 1)`\n`num_pairs(S) = max(0, min(2, S-2) - max(1, S-3) + 1)`\n\n- `S=3`:\n  `x_upper_bound = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1`\n  `x_lower_bound = max(1, 3-3) = max(1, 0) = 1`\n  `count_x_for_S = max(0, 1 - 1 + 1) = 1` (This corresponds to `x=1, y=2`)\n  `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`\n\n- `S=4`:\n  `x_upper_bound = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2`\n  `x_lower_bound = max(1, 4-3) = max(1, 1) = 1`\n  `count_x_for_S = max(0, 2 - 1 + 1) = 2` (This corresponds to `x=1, y=3` and `x=2, y=2`)\n  `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2` (For `S=4`, `z` must be `3`. Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`)\n\n- `S=5`:\n  `x_upper_bound = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n  `x_lower_bound = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2`\n  `count_x_for_S = max(0, 2 - 2 + 1) = 1` (This corresponds to `x=2, y=3`)\n  `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2` (For `S=5`, `z` can be `3, 4`. Triangles: `(2,3,3)`, `(2,3,4)`)\n\nTotal `total_triangles = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach seems correct and efficient enough.\n\nFinal check on constraints and edge cases:\n`1 <= A <= B <= C <= D <= 5 * 10^5`\nMaximum value of `S` is `B+C = 5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nThe loop runs `B+C - (A+B) + 1 = C-A+1` times in the worst case, but it's actually `S_high - S_low + 1` iterations.\n`S_high - S_low + 1 = (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1`. Max `C-A+1` is `5*10^5`.\nThis is `O(D_max)` complexity.\nThe total count can be large, so `long long` in C++ or Python's arbitrary precision integers are needed. Python handles large integers automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Iterate over possible values of S = x + y\n    # Minimum S is A + B (when x=A, y=B)\n    # Maximum S is B + C (when x=B, y=C)\n    S_min = A + B\n    S_max = B + C\n\n    for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n        # Calculate count_x_for_S: number of pairs (x, y) such that x+y=S and A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C\n        # y = S - x\n        # B <= S - x <= C\n        # S - x >= B  =>  x <= S - B\n        # S - x <= C  =>  x >= S - C\n        \n        # So, x must satisfy:\n        # A <= x <= B\n        # S - C <= x <= S - B\n        \n        # Combine bounds for x:\n        x_lower_bound = max(A, S - C)\n        x_upper_bound = min(B, S - B)\n        \n        count_x_for_S = max(0, x_upper_bound - x_lower_bound + 1)\n\n        if count_x_for_S == 0:\n            continue # No valid (x,y) pairs for this S, so no triangles.\n\n        # Calculate count_z_for_S: number of z values such that C<=z<=D and z < S\n        # This means C <= z <= min(D, S - 1)\n        \n        z_lower_bound = C\n        z_upper_bound = min(D, S - 1)\n        \n        count_z_for_S = max(0, z_upper_bound - z_lower_bound + 1)\n        \n        total_triangles += count_x_for_S * count_z_for_S\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
