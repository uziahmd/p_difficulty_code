And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Calculating Average Sleep Times**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem where I need to find the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" for Polycarp. A \"week\" here is defined as a consecutive set of `k` days, and I have `n` days of sleep data.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many weeks there are. That's simply `n - k + 1`.  Then, for each week, I need to sum the sleep times.  I'll call the sum for the `i`-th week `S_i`.  The total sum I'm looking for is the sum of all these individual week sums: `TotalSum = S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}`.  The final answer will be `TotalSum` divided by the number of weeks.\n\nI'm thinking a sliding window approach will be the most efficient.  Instead of recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, I can reuse the previous week's sum.  For the first week, I'll calculate the sum directly.  Then, for subsequent weeks, I can just subtract the sleep time of the day leaving the window and add the sleep time of the day entering the window. This reduces the time complexity to O(n), which is good.\n\nI'll need to be careful to implement this sliding window correctly, making sure the indices are right.  I'll initialize `current_week_sum` with the sum of the first `k` days. Then, in the loop, I'll update it by subtracting the first element and adding the next element.\n\nI'll check the edge case where `k` equals `n` (only one week), and the case where `k` equals 1 (each day is a week).  And I will make sure the output is formatted correctly to the required precision using an f-string. I believe this will provide a complete solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A \"week\" is defined as `k` consecutive days. Given `n` days of sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`, there will be `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nLet's denote the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (days `a_i` through `a_{i+k-1}`) as `S_i`. The problem requires us to calculate the average of these `S_i` values. Specifically, we need to sum all `S_i` from `i=1` to `n-k+1`, and then divide this grand total sum by the number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n`Average = (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n - k + 1)`\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through each of the `n - k + 1` weeks and, for each week, sum its `k` days. This would result in a time complexity of `O((n - k + 1) * k)`, which simplifies to `O(n*k)`. Given `n` up to `2 * 10^5`, `n*k` could be up to `(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}`, which is too slow for typical competitive programming time limits.\n\nTo solve this efficiently, we can use a sliding window technique.\n1. Calculate the sum of the first `k` days (`a_0` to `a_{k-1}`). This will be `S_1`.\n2. Initialize a `total_sum_of_weeks` with `S_1`.\n3. For subsequent weeks (from `S_2` to `S_{n-k+1}`), we can calculate the sum of the current week `S_i` from the sum of the previous week `S_{i-1}` in `O(1)` time.\n   `S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`\n   This means we subtract the element that leaves the window and add the element that enters the window.\n4. Add each `S_i` calculated in this manner to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n\nThis approach involves an initial sum calculation taking `O(k)` time, and then `n - k` updates, each taking `O(1)` time. The total time complexity becomes `O(k + (n - k)) = O(n)`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `a_i` is `10^5`, and `n` is `2 * 10^5`.\nThe sum of a single week (`current_week_sum`) can be up to `k * 10^5`, which is `2 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 2 * 10^{10}`.\nThe `total_sum_of_weeks` can be up to `(n - k + 1) * (k * 10^5)`. In the worst case, `n - k + 1` is about `n` (when `k=1`) and `k` is `n` (when `k=n`). A more precise analysis shows that each `a_j` contributes to at most `k` weekly sums. So, `total_sum_of_weeks` can be roughly `n * k * max(a_i) = 2 * 10^5 * 2 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^{15}`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle such large numbers without overflow.\n\nFinally, the result should be a floating-point number with sufficient precision. Python's `/` operator performs float division, and f-strings can format the output to the required precision (e.g., `:.10f`).\n\nExample Walkthrough (`n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`):\n1. `n=3, k=2`. `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n2. Initial `current_week_sum` for `a[0:2]` (`[3, 4]`) is `3 + 4 = 7`.\n3. `total_sum_of_weeks = 7`.\n4. Loop for `i` from `1` to `n - k` (i.e., `1` to `1`):\n   - `i = 1`:\n     - `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n     - `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n     - `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n     - `current_week_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`. (This is `S_2` for `[4, 7]`)\n     - `total_sum_of_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks + current_week_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n5. Loop finishes.\n6. `average_over_all_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and k from the first line of input\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the list of sleep times a from the second line of input\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum for the first week (days a[0] to a[k-1])\n    # This is the initial window sum.\n    current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\n    # Initialize the total sum of all week sums.\n    # The first week's sum is already calculated, so add it.\n    total_sum_of_weeks = current_week_sum\n\n    # Use a sliding window to calculate sums for subsequent weeks.\n    # The loop runs for i from 1 up to (n - k).\n    # Each iteration calculates the sum for a week starting at index i.\n    # The last week starts at index n - k.\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # To get the sum of the current week (starting at index i) from the previous week's sum (starting at index i-1):\n        # Subtract the element that is leaving the window (a[i-1]).\n        # Add the element that is entering the window (a[i+k-1]).\n        current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        \n        # Add the sum of the current week to the grand total.\n        total_sum_of_weeks += current_week_sum\n\n    # The total number of weeks considered is n - k + 1.\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n    # Calculate the final average.\n    average_over_all_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks\n\n    # Print the result formatted to at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n    print(f\"{average_over_all_weeks:.10f}\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
