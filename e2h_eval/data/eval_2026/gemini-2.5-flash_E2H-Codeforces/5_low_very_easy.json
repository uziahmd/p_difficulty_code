Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Colored Boots Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The core is finding the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots, given their colors. The output has to be the number of pairs and the indices of those paired boots.\n\nMy immediate thought is, let's go greedy here. We want to maximize pairings, so let's try to match the most \"restrictive\" pairs first. The problem gives us the compatibility rules, and I can categorize them like this:\n\n*   **Exact Match:** This is the strongest case where both boots have the *same* specific color (e.g., 'f' and 'f'). This is the best match.\n*   **Wildcard Match:** One boot has a specific color and the other has a wildcard '?' (e.g., 'a' and '?').\n*   **Double Wildcard:** Both boots are '?'. This is the weakest match.\n\nThe greedy approach suggests prioritizing exact matches. Matching specific colors together is the most impactful and guarantees a valid match. We don't want to use them to match wildcards early and then find later that they cannot pair with their counterpart.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.  **Store the boots and their Indices:** I'm thinking of using a `defaultdict(list)` for both left and right boots. Something like `left_boots[color]` will hold a list of the 1-based indices of left boots with that specific color. I'll need to do the same for right boots. This will allow fast lookups and removal.\n2.  **Iterate and Match:** I'll loop through the possible specific colors from 'a' to 'z' (or their integer equivalents). For each color:\n    *   While there are *both* left and right boots available with that exact color, I'll pair them up. I'll pop the indices from the lists and add those pairs to a `pairs` list.\n3.  **Handle the Remaining:** After matching all the exact colors, I'll deal with the wildcards. Any left boot with a wildcard '?' can pair with any right boot, and any left boot with a specific color can pair with any right boot that has a wildcard, and vice-versa. And finally, wildcard can pair with a wildcard. I'll continue to greedily match based on whatever available.\n\nLet's see, the algorithm should look something like:\n\n```python\n# Create dictionaries to store boot indices\nleft_boots = defaultdict(list)\nright_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n# Populate the dictionaries with boot indices\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_boots[l[i]].append(i + 1)\n    right_boots[r[i]].append(i + 1)\n\npairs = []\n\n# Match exact colors first\nfor color in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    while left_boots[color] and right_boots[color]:\n        idx_l = left_boots[color].pop()\n        idx_r = right_boots[color].pop()\n        pairs.append((idx_l, idx_r))\n\n# Match wildcards with remaining boots\n# The order here doesn't matter much.\n# Could also implement as different function to improve readability and avoid too much nesting.\n\n# Count the remaining, so we know what to print later\nk = len(pairs)\nprint(k)\nfor pair in pairs:\n    print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\n# After implementing and testing I'll see how the performance is and improve\n```\n\nThis greedy approach seems to be the right way to optimize the pairings. I feel confident about the strategy. Now it's time to translate this into code and make it work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to output these pairs. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors represented by characters in strings `l` and `r`. A specific color (lowercase letter) is compatible only with the exact same specific color. A question mark '?' (indefinite color) is compatible with any specific or indefinite color.\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should use a greedy strategy that prioritizes the most restrictive matches first. This ensures that boots with specific colors are matched optimally before their options are \"wasted\" on less specific matches.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color**: First, we need to efficiently access boots of a particular color. We'll create two dictionaries (or lists of lists, one for left boots and one for right boots) where keys are colors and values are lists of 1-based indices of boots having that color.\n    `left_boots[color]` will store indices of left boots.\n    `right_boots[color]` will store indices of right boots.\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors (`c`, `c`)**: Iterate through all specific colors 'a' through 'z'. For each color `c`, while there are available left boots of color `c` and available right boots of color `c`, form a pair. Pop an index from `left_boots[c]` and `right_boots[c]` and add the pair to our results. This step uses up specific-colored boots in the most direct way, preventing them from being used with a '?' if a perfect match exists.\n\n3.  **Match Specific Color with Wildcard (`c`, `?` or `?`, `c`)**:\n    *   **Specific Left, Wildcard Right (`c`, `?`)**: Iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z'. While there are available left boots of color `c` and available right boots of color '?', form a pair. Pop an index from `left_boots[c]` and `right_boots['?']` and add the pair to results.\n    *   **Wildcard Left, Specific Right (`?`, `c`)**: Iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z'. While there are available left boots of color '?' and available right boots of color `c`, form a pair. Pop an index from `left_boots['?']` and `right_boots[c]` and add the pair to results.\n    It's important to note that the order of these two sub-steps (specific left with wildcard right, vs. wildcard left with specific right) doesn't significantly impact the final count, as long as both are done before the double wildcard match. We just need to ensure that the specific-colored boots (that didn't find a perfect `c,c` match) get a chance to pair with a `?`.\n\n4.  **Match Double Wildcard (`?`, `?`)**: Finally, while there are available left boots of color '?' and available right boots of color '?', form a pair. Pop an index from `left_boots['?']` and `right_boots['?']` and add the pair to results. These are the least restrictive matches and should be done last, as '?' boots are highly versatile.\n\nBy following this greedy approach, we prioritize matches that consume specific-colored boots first, then matches that consume one specific and one wildcard, and finally matches that consume two wildcards. This ensures that we make the most compatible pairs.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Conceptual):**\nSuppose `l = \"ab?\"`, `r = \"a?c\"`\n`left_boots = {'a': [1], 'b': [2], '?': [3]}`\n`right_boots = {'a': [1], '?': [2], 'c': [3]}`\n\n1.  **`c, c` matches**:\n    *   For 'a': `left_boots['a']` has `[1]`, `right_boots['a']` has `[1]`. Pair (1, 1).\n        `pairs = [(1, 1)]`\n        `left_boots = {'b': [2], '?': [3]}`\n        `right_boots = {'?': [2], 'c': [3]}`\n    *   For 'b', 'c', etc.: No more `c,c` matches.\n\n2.  **`c, ?` and `?, c` matches**:\n    *   For 'b': `left_boots['b']` has `[2]`. `right_boots['?']` has `[2]`. Pair (2, 2).\n        `pairs = [(1, 1), (2, 2)]`\n        `left_boots = {'?': [3]}`\n        `right_boots = {'c': [3]}`\n    *   For 'c': `left_boots['?']` has `[3]`. `right_boots['c']` has `[3]`. Pair (3, 3).\n        `pairs = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]`\n        `left_boots = {}`\n        `right_boots = {}`\n\n3.  **`?, ?` matches**: No more '?' boots left.\n\nTotal pairs: 3.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nWe use `collections.defaultdict(list)` to store indices. `list.pop()` is efficient for removing the last element.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices of boots for each color\n    # Using defaultdict(list) to easily append indices\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
