    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this competitive programming problem. I need a Python script to find all positive integers 'n' where n! ends with exactly 'm' zeroes.  First, let's break down how to count those trailing zeroes. It's all about prime factorization, specifically the factors of 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5 in n!.\n\nLegendre's formula comes to mind:  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` – this goes on as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to 'n'.  This `Z(n)` function, it's the heart of the problem.\n\nLet's look at `Z(n)`'s behavior. It's clearly a non-decreasing function.  I can quickly run through some examples... Z(1) to Z(4) are zero. Z(5) is 1, Z(10) is 2, Z(15) is 3, and so on.  Ah, I'm seeing a pattern!  `Z(n)` increases *only* when 'n' is a multiple of 5. It *might* increase when moving from 5k-1 to 5k. Specifically, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one to the sum. Multiples of 25 add another one, multiples of 125 another one, and so on.\n\nThe main idea here is that `Z(n)` *can only take on certain values*. I think that's the key to this solution. This limited range is what I'll need to exploit when constructing the Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, and then the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`, the number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nThis can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThe sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the function `Z(n)`:\n1. `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function.\n2. `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n3. For `n` values between `5k` and `5k+4` (inclusive), `Z(n)` will have the same value. For example, `Z(5) = Z(6) = Z(7) = Z(8) = Z(9) = 1`.\n4. The value of `Z(n)` increases by at least 1 when `n` increments from `5k-1` to `5k`. Specifically, `Z(5k) - Z(5k-1)` is the number of factors of 5 in `5k`. This value is `1 + floor(5k/25) + floor(5k/125) + ...`.\n   For example:\n   `Z(4) = 0`\n   `Z(5) = 1` (increase of 1)\n   `Z(9) = 1`\n   `Z(10) = 2` (increase of 1)\n   `Z(24) = 4`\n   `Z(25) = 6` (increase of 2, because 25 has two factors of 5: 5*5)\n\nThe problem asks for `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\nSince `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, if `Z(n_0) = m` for some `n_0`, then `Z(n_0-1)` must be either `m` or less than `m`.\nIf `Z(n_0-1) < m` and `Z(n_0) = m`, then `n_0` is the smallest integer for which `Z(n_0) = m`.\nDue to property 3, if `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n_0+1)`, `Z(n_0+2)`, `Z(n_0+3)`, `Z(n_0+4)` will also be `m`.\nHowever, `Z(n_0+5)` will be greater than `m` (unless `m=0`, but `m >= 1`).\nSpecifically, `Z(n+5) = Z(n) + (1 + floor((n+5)/25) - floor(n/25) + ...)`.\nSince `Z(n)` increases by at least 1 when `n` becomes a multiple of 5, `Z(n+5)` will always be strictly greater than `Z(n)` for any `n >= 1`.\nThus, if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` will also be `m`.\nBut `Z(n+5)` will be `Z(n) + (some value >= 1)`. More precisely, `Z(n+5) = Z(n) + (number of factors of 5 in (n+1), (n+2), (n+3), (n+4), (n+5))`.\nNo, this is not correct. `Z(n+5) = Z(n) + 1` if `n+5` is not a multiple of 25. If `n+5` is a multiple of 25, say `n+5 = 25k`, then `Z(n+5) = Z(n) + 1 + 1`.\n\nLet's re-examine `Z(n+5)`.\n`Z(n+5) = floor((n+5)/5) + floor((n+5)/25) + ...`\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ...`\nWe know `floor(x+y) >= floor(x) + floor(y)`.\n`floor((n+5)/5) = floor(n/5 + 1) = floor(n/5) + 1`.\nSo, `Z(n+5) = (floor(n/5)+1) + floor((n+5)/25) + floor((n+5)/125) + ...`\n`Z(n+5) - Z(n) = 1 + (floor((n+5)/25) - floor(n/25)) + (floor((n+5)/125) - floor(n/125)) + ...`\nEach term `floor((n+5)/5^k) - floor(n/5^k)` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether there's a multiple of `5^k` in `(n, n+5]`.\nFor example, if `n=20`, `Z(20)=4`. `Z(25)=6`. `Z(25)-Z(20) = 2`.\n`1 + (floor(25/25) - floor(20/25)) + ... = 1 + (1 - 0) = 2`.\nSo, `Z(n+5) - Z(n)` is always `1 + (number of multiples of 25 in (n, n+5]) + (number of multiples of 125 in (n, n+5]) + ...`.\nThis difference is always at least 1.\n\nTherefore, if `Z(n_0) = m`, then `Z(n_0+1), Z(n_0+2), Z(n_0+3), Z(n_0+4)` will also be `m`.\nHowever, `Z(n_0+5)` will be strictly greater than `m`.\nThis means that if there is any `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, there must be exactly 5 such values of `n`. These values would be `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`, where `n_0` is the smallest integer for which `Z(n_0) = m`.\n\nTo find `n_0`, we can use binary search because `Z(n)` is a monotonically increasing function.\nThe maximum value for `m` is 100,000.\nIf `Z(n) = m`, then approximately `n/5 = m`, so `n = 5m`.\nFor `m = 100,000`, `n` would be around `500,000`.\nA safe upper bound for binary search would be `5 * m + a few terms` like `5m + m/5 + m/25`, maybe `5*m + 5*m/25 = 5m + m/5`. A loose upper bound like `5 * m + 100` or `5 * m + 1000` is usually enough. For `m=100000`, `n` could be around `400000`. `Z(400000)` is `400000/5 + 400000/25 + 400000/125 + 400000/625 + 400000/3125 + 400000/15625 + 400000/78125 = 80000 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 = 99918`.\nSo `n` needs to be slightly larger than `5m`. A safe upper bound for `n` can be `5 * m + (m/5) + (m/25) + ...` which is `5m + m/4` approximately. For `m=100000`, `n` could be up to `500000 + 25000 = 525000`. Let's use `5 * m + 1000` as a generous upper bound.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Define a function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` that implements Legendre's formula.\n2. Read `m` from input.\n3. Perform a binary search to find the smallest `n_0` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n_0) = m`.\n   - Set `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m + 1000` (or a sufficiently large upper bound like `5 * 100000 + 1000 = 501000`).\n   - Initialize `ans = -1`.\n   - While `low <= high`:\n     - `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n     - `zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)`\n     - If `zeroes == m`:\n       - We found a potential `n`. We want the *smallest* such `n`, so store `mid` in `ans` and try to find an even smaller `n` by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n     - If `zeroes < m`:\n       - `mid` is too small, need more factors of 5. Set `low = mid + 1`.\n     - If `zeroes > m`:\n       - `mid` is too large, it produces too many zeroes. Set `high = mid - 1`.\n4. After binary search:\n   - If `ans == -1` or `count_trailing_zeroes(ans)` is not equal to `m`:\n     - No `n` produces exactly `m` zeroes. Print `0`.\n   - Else (`ans` is the smallest `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) = m`):\n     - The five values are `ans, ans+1, ans+2, ans+3, ans+4`.\n     - Print `5`.\n     - Print these five values separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: m = 1**\n1. `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`:\n   `Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, ...`\n2. `m = 1`.\n3. Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) = 1`.\n   - `low = 1`, `high = 5*1 + 1000 = 1005`. `ans = -1`.\n   - Iteration 1: `mid = 503`. `Z(503)` is very large (approx `503/5 = 100`). `Z(503) > 1`. `high = 502`.\n   - ... (binary search converges to the range around 5)\n   - Suppose `low = 1`, `high = 10`.\n     - `mid = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. `ans = 5`. `high = 4`.\n     - `low = 1`, `high = 4`. `mid = 2`. `Z(2) = 0`. `low = 3`.\n     - `low = 3`, `high = 4`. `mid = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. `low = 4`.\n     - `low = 4`, `high = 4`. `mid = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. `low = 5`.\n     - `low = 5`, `high = 4`. Loop ends.\n   - `ans = 5`.\n4. `count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`, which equals `m`.\n   - Print `5`.\n   - Print `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Edge Case: `m` for which no `n` exists.**\nConsider `m = 5`.\n`Z(20) = 4`\n`Z(21) = 4`\n`Z(22) = 4`\n`Z(23) = 4`\n`Z(24) = 4`\n`Z(25) = 6`\nThere is no `n` such that `Z(n) = 5`.\nBinary search for `m=5`:\n- `low = 1`, `high = 5*5+1000 = 1025`.\n- ... (binary search will eventually converge)\n- Suppose `low = 21`, `high = 25`.\n  - `mid = 23`. `Z(23) = 4 < 5`. `low = 24`.\n  - `low = 24`, `high = 25`. `mid = 24`. `Z(24) = 4 < 5`. `low = 25`.\n  - `low = 25`, `high = 25`. `mid = 25`. `Z(25) = 6 > 5`. `high = 24`.\n  - `low = 25`, `high = 24`. Loop ends.\n- `ans` remains `-1` (or if it was updated, `count_trailing_zeroes(ans)` would not be `m`).\n  - For example, if `ans` was updated to `25` when `Z(25)=6` was checked, the final check `count_trailing_zeroes(ans) == m` would fail (`6 != 5`).\n- So, the condition `ans == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans) != m` will be true.\n- Print `0`. This is correct.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `5 * 100000 + 1000 = 501000`.\n`count_trailing_zeroes` for `n=501000`:\n`501000/5 = 100200`\n`501000/25 = 20040`\n`501000/125 = 4008`\n`501000/625 = 801`\n`501000/3125 = 160`\n`501000/15625 = 32`\n`501000/78125 = 6`\n`501000/390625 = 1`\nSum = `100200 + 20040 + 4008 + 801 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 125248`.\nThis shows the upper bound is sufficient. The binary search will be very fast (logarithmic in `5m`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! using Legendre's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0 # Factorial not defined for negative numbers, or 0 zeroes.\n    \n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that n! has m zeroes.\n    # The number of zeroes is roughly n/5, so n is roughly 5*m.\n    # A safe upper bound for n is 5*m + small_constant (e.g., 1000)\n    # For m=100_000, n could be around 400_000.\n    # 5 * 100_000 + 1000 is a safe upper limit.\n    low = 1\n    high = 5 * m + 1000 # Sufficiently large upper bound\n    ans_n = -1 # Stores the smallest n found that produces m zeroes\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n\n        if zeroes == m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            # Try to find an even smaller n\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif zeroes < m:\n            # Not enough zeroes, need a larger n\n            low = mid + 1\n        else: # zeroes > m\n            # Too many zeroes, need a smaller n\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    # After binary search, if ans_n is not -1, it holds the smallest n\n    # such that count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m.\n    # We must verify this, as the binary search might have ended with ans_n\n    # being a value that produced 'm' zeroes, but a smaller value 'mid-1'\n    # produced 'm-1' zeroes, and then 'mid' was the smallest.\n    # The check `count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m` handles cases where 'm'\n    # is not achievable.\n    \n    if ans_n != -1 and count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m:\n        # If Z(n) = m, then Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4) also equal m.\n        # Z(n+5) will be greater than m.\n        # So there are exactly 5 such values of n.\n        results = [ans_n, ans_n + 1, ans_n + 2, ans_n + 3, ans_n + 4]\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"5\\n\")\n        sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n    else:\n        # No n produces exactly m zeroes.\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
