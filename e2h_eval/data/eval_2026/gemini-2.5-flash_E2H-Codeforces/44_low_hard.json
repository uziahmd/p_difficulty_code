He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The goal is to maximize the sum of maximum difficulties across several contiguous segments.  Let's see, I'm given `n` problems, need to split them into `k` segments, and the difficulty of each problem is in the array `a`.  The sum of the maximum difficulty in each segment needs to be as high as possible. And I have to output both this max sum and the length of each segment.\n\nRight, so to maximize the sum, the intuition is clear: I need to somehow make the maximum values in each segment as large as possible. If I were to pick the *k* largest difficulties from the given array and ensure each became the max for its own segment, that would be ideal. I sort of get the feeling that this strategy is *always* achievable.\n\nLet's sort the input difficulties `a` in descending order: `a'_1 >= a'_2 >= ... >= a'_n`. The sum of the `k` largest difficulties, `a'_1 + a'_2 + ... + a'_k`, is my target. I should be able to always achieve this maximum possible sum.\n\nSo, I need to do the following:\n\n1.  Find the `k` largest values within `a`. Call them `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`.\n2.  The maximum total profit is then `sum(v_1, ..., v_k)`.\n3.  Next, I need to split the original array `a` into segments. The max of each segment must be one of `v_1, ..., v_k`. I can find the *original indices* of these `k` largest values, which might come in handy.\nFor example, if the array has duplicate values, I should simply pick distinct indices for these values.\n\nLet's use the example they've shown me. `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` The `3` largest values are `9, 6, 5`. The sum is `20`. Perfect, looks like my plan is on track. Now it's the tricky part: splitting the segments so that these values *are* the maxes in their respective segments...\n",
    "response": "The core idea to maximize the total profit is to ensure that the `k` largest problem difficulties in the entire list `a` each become the maximum difficulty of one of the `k` daily practice sessions. If we can achieve this, the total profit will be the sum of these `k` largest difficulties, which is the maximum possible.\n\nHere's why:\nSuppose the `k` largest difficulties are `v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k`. If we assign these `k` values as the maximums for our `k` days, the total profit will be `sum(v_i)`. If we pick any other set of `k` maximums for the days, at least one of them must be smaller than some `v_i` (unless it's the same set of values), so the sum would be less than or equal to `sum(v_i)`. Therefore, the maximum possible total profit is indeed the sum of the `k` largest difficulties in the array `a`.\n\nOnce we've identified these `k` largest difficulties, say `max_val_1, \\dots, max_val_k`, we need to find a way to partition the problems into `k` contiguous segments such that each `max_val_j` is the maximum of one segment.\nWe can do this by finding the original indices of these `k` largest values in the input array `a`. Let these indices be `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k`. It's crucial to use distinct indices if there are duplicate maximum values. For example, if `a = [20, 10, 20]` and `k=2`, the two largest values are `20` and `20`. We should pick indices `0` and `2` (or `0` and `1`, or `1` and `2`).\n\nAfter collecting the `k` indices of the chosen largest values, we sort these indices in ascending order. These sorted indices will serve as the \"split points\" for our segments.\nLet the sorted indices be `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k`.\nThe first segment will end at `s_1`.\nThe second segment will end at `s_2`.\n...\nThe `k-1`-th segment will end at `s_{k-1}`.\nThe `k`-th segment must end at the last problem, which is index `n-1`.\n\nSo, the segments will be:\n1.  Problems from index `0` to `s_1`. The length is `s_1 - 0 + 1`.\n2.  Problems from index `s_1 + 1` to `s_2`. The length is `s_2 - (s_1 + 1) + 1`.\n3.  ...\n4.  Problems from index `s_{k-2} + 1` to `s_{k-1}`. The length is `s_{k-1} - (s_{k-2} + 1) + 1`.\n5.  Problems from index `s_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. The length is `(n-1) - (s_{k-1} + 1) + 1`.\n\nThis strategy guarantees that each of the `k` largest values `a[s_j]` falls into exactly one segment and is the maximum of that segment (because `a[s_j]` is one of the `k` largest values overall, and we've strategically placed segment boundaries around its original position).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a` of difficulties.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for each problem.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty. If difficulties are equal, the order of indices doesn't matter for finding the maximum profit, but for segment splitting, we just need `k` distinct indices.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These correspond to the `k` largest difficulties.\n6.  Calculate the `total_profit` by summing the difficulties of these `k` elements.\n7.  Extract the `original_index` for each of these `k` elements. Store them in a list, say `split_indices`.\n8.  Sort `split_indices` in ascending order. These are the indices where we will place the segment boundaries.\n9.  Initialize an empty list `segment_lengths`.\n10. The first segment starts at index `0` and ends at `split_indices[0]`. Its length is `split_indices[0] + 1`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n11. For `j` from `1` to `k-1`:\n    The `j`-th segment (0-indexed) starts at `split_indices[j-1] + 1` and ends at `split_indices[j]`. Its length is `split_indices[j] - (split_indices[j-1] + 1) + 1`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n12. The last segment (the `k`-th one, 0-indexed `k-1`) is special. It starts at `split_indices[k-2] + 1` and goes until the end of the array `n-1`. Its length is `(n-1) - (split_indices[k-1] + 1) + 1`. **Correction**: The last segment starts at `split_indices[k-2] + 1` and ends at `split_indices[k-1]`. The problem states `k` segments, so we need `k-1` split points to define `k` segments. The `split_indices` list contains `k` indices.\n    A better way to define segments:\n    - The first `k-1` split points will define the end of the first `k-1` segments.\n    - The `k`-th segment will then take all remaining problems.\n    - So, we use `split_indices[0], split_indices[1], ..., split_indices[k-2]` as the end points of the first `k-1` segments.\n    - `current_pos = 0`\n    - For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        - `end_pos = split_indices[j]`\n        - `length = end_pos - current_pos + 1`\n        - Add `length` to `segment_lengths`.\n        - `current_pos = end_pos + 1`\n    - The last segment's length is `n - current_pos`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n13. Print `total_profit`.\n14. Print the `segment_lengths` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example dry run:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  `a_with_indices = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  Sorted by difficulty (descending):\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  Top `k=3` elements: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n4.  `total_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n5.  `split_indices = [6, 3, 0]`\n6.  Sorted `split_indices`: `[0, 3, 6]`\n\nNow, determine segment lengths:\n`current_pos = 0`\n`segment_lengths = []`\n\n-   `j = 0`: `split_indices[0] = 0`. This is the index of the problem with difficulty `5`.\n    `end_pos = 0`.\n    `length = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    `segment_lengths = [1]`.\n    `current_pos = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n\n-   `j = 1`: `split_indices[1] = 3`. This is the index of the problem with difficulty `6`.\n    `end_pos = 3`.\n    `length = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. (Problems at indices 1, 2, 3: `4, 2, 6`)\n    `segment_lengths = [1, 3]`.\n    `current_pos = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n-   `k-1 = 2`. Loop finished for `j` up to `k-2=1`.\n    The remaining problems are from `current_pos = 4` to `n-1 = 7`.\n    `last_segment_length = n - current_pos = 8 - 4 = 4`. (Problems at indices 4, 5, 6, 7: `5, 1, 9, 2`)\n    `segment_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\nThe example output is `20` and `3 2 3`. My calculation gives `1 3 4`. Both are valid distributions yielding `20`.\nLet's re-evaluate the segment splitting. The crucial part is that `k-1` split points define `k` segments. If `split_indices` has `k` elements, say `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-1}`, these are the *indices of the problems that will be the maximums of their respective segments*.\nThe first `k-1` elements in `split_indices` (after sorting) are used to determine where segments *end*. The last element `s_{k-1}` will be the maximum of the *last* segment, which naturally ends at `n-1`.\n\nRevised segment splitting logic:\n1.  `split_indices` sorted: `[s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}]`.\n2.  `t_1 = s_0 + 1` (Problems `0` to `s_0`)\n3.  `t_2 = s_1 - s_0` (Problems `s_0+1` to `s_1`)\n4.  ...\n5.  `t_j = s_{j-1} - s_{j-2}` (Problems `s_{j-2}+1` to `s_{j-1}`)\n6.  ...\n7.  `t_k = n - s_{k-1}` (Problems `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`)\n\nLet's re-run example `n=8, k=3, a=[5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` with `split_indices = [0, 3, 6]`.\n-   `s_0 = 0`, `s_1 = 3`, `s_2 = 6`.\n-   `t_1 = s_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Problems `[5]`)\n-   `t_2 = s_1 - s_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`. (Problems `[4, 2, 6]`)\n-   `t_3 = n - s_2 = 8 - 6 = 2`. (Problems `[5, 1]`. Wait, this is wrong. `n - s_2` means problems from index `s_2+1` to `n-1`. This would be `a[7]` which is `2`. This is not correct. The index `s_2=6` means `a[6]` (`9`) is in the *last* segment. So the last segment starts at `s_1+1` and ends at `n-1`. Its length is `n - (s_1+1)`.)\n\nThe `k` largest difficulties are at indices `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}`.\nWe need to use `k-1` of these indices to define the split points, and the *last one* will simply be part of the last segment which goes until `n-1`.\nSo, we take `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-2}` as the end points for the first `k-1` segments.\nThe `k`-th largest value in `a` (which is `a[s_{k-1}]`) will automatically be the maximum of the last segment, which starts at `s_{k-2}+1` and ends at `n-1`.\n\nLet's use `split_indices_sorted = [0, 3, 6]` for `k=3`.\nThe first `k-1=2` indices are `0, 3`. These are the end points of the first two segments.\n-   Segment 1: `[0 ... 0]`. Length `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n-   Segment 2: `[1 ... 3]`. Length `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\n-   Segment 3: `[4 ... 7]`. Length `7 - 4 + 1 = 4`.\nThis yields `[1, 3, 4]`. This is a valid solution.\n\nThe example output `3 2 3` implies different split points.\n`[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`\n-   Segment 1: `[5, 4, 2]`. Max is `5`. Ends at index `2`.\n-   Segment 2: `[6, 5]`. Max is `6`. Ends at index `4`.\n-   Segment 3: `[1, 9, 2]`. Max is `9`. Ends at index `7`.\nThe indices of the maximums are `2, 3, 6`.\nIf we select `a[2]=2, a[3]=6, a[6]=9` as our `k` maximums, the sum is `2+6+9 = 17`. This is not `20`.\nThe example output `3 2 3` uses `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9` as the maximums.\nTheir indices are `0, 3, 6`. These are the same indices that my algorithm came up with `[0, 3, 6]`!\nThe only difference is how the segments are formed.\nMy algorithm: `s_0=0, s_1=3, s_2=6`.\n-   `t_1 = s_0 + 1 = 1`. Problems `[0]`. Max `a[0]=5`.\n-   `t_2 = s_1 - s_0 = 3`. Problems `[1,2,3]`. Max `a[3]=6`.\n-   `t_3 = n - (s_1+1) = 8 - (3+1) = 4`. Problems `[4,5,6,7]`. Max `a[6]=9`.\nThis gives `[1, 3, 4]`. The total profit is `5+6+9=20`.\n\nThe example output `3 2 3` implies:\n-   `t_1=3`. Problems `[0,1,2]`. Max `a[0]=5`.\n-   `t_2=2`. Problems `[3,4]`. Max `a[3]=6`.\n-   `t_3=3`. Problems `[5,6,7]`. Max `a[6]=9`.\nThis also gives `5+6+9=20`.\n\nThe difference is how `split_indices` are used. My algorithm uses `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-2}` as end points of segments `1, \\dots, k-1`. The `k`-th segment takes everything else.\nThe example output suggests that `s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}` are *all* contained within their respective segments, and the segment *boundaries* are determined by these indices.\n\nLet's reconsider the `split_indices` as just a set of `k` indices that must fall into different segments and be the maximum for that segment.\n`split_indices_sorted = [s_0, s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}]`.\nWe need `k-1` actual \"cut points\" to divide `n` problems into `k` segments.\nThese `k-1` cut points must be chosen from the `n-1` possible positions between problems.\nTo maximize profit, we want each `a[s_j]` to be the max of its segment.\nThe simplest way to achieve this is to make cuts *just after* `s_0`, *just after* `s_1`, ..., *just after* `s_{k-2}`.\nThis means:\n-   Segment 1 ends at `s_0`. Length `s_0 + 1`.\n-   Segment 2 ends at `s_1`. Length `s_1 - (s_0 + 1) + 1`.\n-   ...\n-   Segment `k-1` ends at `s_{k-2}`. Length `s_{k-2} - (s_{k-3} + 1) + 1`.\n-   Segment `k` ends at `n-1`. Length `(n-1) - (s_{k-2} + 1) + 1`.\n\nLet's try this with `split_indices_sorted = [0, 3, 6]` for `k=3`.\n-   `s_0 = 0, s_1 = 3, s_2 = 6`.\n-   First `k-1=2` splits: `s_0` and `s_1`.\n-   Segment 1: `[0 ... s_0] = [0 ... 0]`. Length `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n-   Segment 2: `[s_0+1 ... s_1] = [1 ... 3]`. Length `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\n-   Segment 3 (last): `[s_1+1 ... n-1] = [4 ... 7]`. Length `7 - 4 + 1 = 4`.\nThis still gives `[1, 3, 4]`.\n\nThe problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\" So `[1, 3, 4]` is a perfectly valid output for the example. My algorithm is correct. The key is to select the `k` largest values, sum them for maximum profit, and then find *any* valid segmentation that makes these `k` values the maximums of their respective segments. The strategy of using the first `k-1` sorted indices as segment end points (and the last segment taking the rest) is a simple and valid way to achieve this.\n\nFinal check on constraints and edge cases:\n-   `1 <= k <= n <= 2000`: `n` and `k` are small enough for sorting.\n-   `1 <= a_i <= 2000`: Values fit in standard integers.\n-   `k=1`: `split_indices` will have one element `s_0`. `segment_lengths` will be `[n]`. Correct.\n-   `k=n`: `split_indices` will be `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`.\n    -   `s_0=0`. `t_1 = 0-0+1 = 1`.\n    -   `s_1=1`. `t_2 = 1-0+1 = 1`.\n    -   ...\n    -   `s_{n-1}=n-1`. `t_n = (n-1)-(n-2)+1 = 1`.\n    All segment lengths will be `1`. Correct.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) tuples\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the original index doesn't matter for sorting order here.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Select the top k problems\n    top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Calculate total profit\n    total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n\n    # Get the original indices of these top k problems\n    # These will be our split points (or rather, points that must be included in a segment and be its max)\n    split_indices = [p[1] for p in top_k_problems]\n\n    # Sort these indices to determine the order of segment ends\n    split_indices.sort()\n\n    # Determine segment lengths\n    segment_lengths = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n\n    # The first k-1 split_indices define the end points of the first k-1 segments\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The current segment ends at split_indices[i]\n        # Its length is (split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1)\n        segment_lengths.append(split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1)\n        # The next segment starts right after this one ends\n        current_start_index = split_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last segment takes all remaining problems\n    # It starts at current_start_index and ends at n-1\n    segment_lengths.append(n - current_start_index)\n\n    # Print results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_profit) + '\\n')\n    sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, segment_lengths)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
