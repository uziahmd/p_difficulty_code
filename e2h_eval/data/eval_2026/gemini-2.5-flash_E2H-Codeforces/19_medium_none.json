The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**A Strategic Dance with Districts: The Heart of a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with this fascinating problem in competitive programming, where I need to strategically select districts in a tree-like structure to maximize a particular sum. The core of the problem is this: given a tree with districts, I need to choose a connected group of districts – keeping a specific number (n-k) and removing the rest (k districts). The catch? I want the sum of `2^i` for the chosen districts (where `i` is the district index) to be as large as possible.  This naturally means I want to keep districts with larger indices, since the `2^i` grows very rapidly.\n\nThe challenge is the connectivity requirement – the chosen districts must form a single connected component.  I started by exploring greedy approaches, prioritizing the larger indices first, but quickly realized that a naive greedy approach could lead to disconnected results.  Then, I turned to the logic of the constraints: the sum needs to be maximized, the districts must be a connected component, and the number of removed districts must equal k.\n\nAfter playing around with different ideas, the core strategy crystallized:  remove as many low-indexed districts as possible, because we need to maximize the sum of kept ones. This can be viewed as the same thing: keep the maximum number of high-indexed districts possible while still keeping the selected districts connected.  We can do this by iteratively picking districts starting from the largest index, `n`, down to `1`. If the node can be added to the current set of chosen nodes while still making it a connected component, add it to the set. Otherwise, remove it.\n\nThe tricky part here is efficiently maintaining the connectivity constraint – how to make sure we're never creating isolated pockets of chosen districts. To check the connectivity, I maintain the set of kept districts, using a hash set. With each new district, I check if it's adjacent to the current set; or if the set is empty, in which case the district can be picked because we need a starting point. If the candidate is adjacent to the selected districts, the new district can be added and the set remains connected; otherwise, the district needs to be removed. The process keeps the set always connected! The key insight is if, at any point, a district isn't connected to the existing districts, it *must* be excluded to preserve the connected component.\n\nMy solution prioritizes the greedy removal, making sure to remove the minimum-indexed contestants to maintain the greatest sum. This method correctly generates the set of removed contestants, ensuring a connected component with maximum fan total, and gives the output of the removed districts in the required increasing order. This solution has a time complexity of `O(N log N)`, making it efficient enough for the given problem constraints. I tested various edge cases and now I'm pretty confident in the approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts to participate in The Number Games such that these districts form a connected component in the given tree structure, and the total number of fans (sum of `2^i` for selected districts `i`) is maximized. We need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding the Objective:**\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)` for the `n-k` selected districts, we should prioritize districts with larger indices. This is because `2^i` grows exponentially, so `2^i` is always greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < i` (e.g., `2^5 = 32`, while `2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 2+4+8+16 = 30`). Therefore, we want to include the largest possible district indices in our selection.\n\n**Greedy Strategy:**\nWe can iterate through the districts from `n` down to `1`. For each district `i`, we decide whether to keep it or remove it.\nLet `s_kept` be the set of districts we have decided to keep so far, and `r_removed` be the list of districts we have decided to remove. We need to keep `num_to_keep = n - k` districts in total.\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `s_kept = set()` (to store kept districts, using a set for efficient `O(1)` average-time lookups)\n    *   `r_removed = []` (to store removed districts)\n    *   `num_to_keep = n - k`\n\n2.  **Iteration:** For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   **Case 1: `len(s_kept) == num_to_keep`**\n        If we have already selected `n-k` districts, we cannot keep any more. So, district `i` must be removed. Add `i` to `r_removed`.\n    *   **Case 2: `len(s_kept) < num_to_keep`**\n        We still need to select more districts. We try to keep district `i` because it has the highest index among the remaining undecided districts.\n        *   **Subcase 2.1: `s_kept` is empty**\n            This is the very first district we are considering (which will be `n` if `n-k > 0`). We must keep it to start forming our connected component. Add `i` to `s_kept`.\n        *   **Subcase 2.2: `s_kept` is not empty**\n            To keep `i` and ensure `s_kept` remains a single connected component, `i` must be adjacent to at least one district already in `s_kept`.\n            *   Check if any neighbor of `i` is in `s_kept`. If such a neighbor exists, it means `i` can be connected to the current component `s_kept`. Since `i` is the largest index available, we greedily add `i` to `s_kept`.\n            *   If `i` has no neighbors in `s_kept`, adding `i` would make `s_kept U {i}` disconnected. Since the problem requires the selected districts to form a single connected component, we cannot keep `i`. Thus, `i` must be removed. Add `i` to `r_removed`.\n\n**Correctness Argument:**\nThe strategy prioritizes keeping districts with larger indices, which is optimal for maximizing `sum(2^i)`. The connectivity constraint is handled by only adding a district `i` to `s_kept` if it is adjacent to an already-kept district (or if it's the first district). By induction, `s_kept` always remains a connected component. When `s_kept` reaches size `n-k`, any further districts `i` (which are necessarily smaller than all districts currently in `s_kept`) must be removed. If a district `i` cannot be added to `s_kept` because it's not connected, it's removed; this is the best choice as we are forced to remove it, and it's the largest index we're forced to remove at that point. This greedy approach ensures that we obtain the connected component with the highest possible sum of `2^i`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`N=6, K=3`. We need to keep `N-K = 3` districts.\nEdges: `2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3`.\nAdjacency list:\n`1: [2]`\n`2: [1, 6, 4, 3]`\n`3: [2]`\n`4: [2]`\n`5: [6]`\n`6: [2, 5]`\n\n`s_kept = set()`, `r_removed = []`\n\n*   **i = 6:** `len(s_kept) = 0 < 3`. `s_kept` is empty. Add `6` to `s_kept`. `s_kept = {6}`.\n*   **i = 5:** `len(s_kept) = 1 < 3`. Neighbors of `5`: `[6]`. `6` is in `s_kept`. Add `5` to `s_kept`. `s_kept = {6, 5}`.\n*   **i = 4:** `len(s_kept) = 2 < 3`. Neighbors of `4`: `[2]`. `2` is not in `s_kept` (`s_kept` is `{6, 5}`). Remove `4`. `r_removed = [4]`.\n*   **i = 3:** `len(s_kept) = 2 < 3`. Neighbors of `3`: `[2]`. `2` is not in `s_kept`. Remove `3`. `r_removed = [4, 3]`.\n*   **i = 2:** `len(s_kept) = 2 < 3`. Neighbors of `2`: `[1, 6, 4, 3]`. `6` is in `s_kept`. Add `2` to `s_kept`. `s_kept = {6, 5, 2}`.\n*   **i = 1:** `len(s_kept) = 3 == num_to_keep`. We have enough districts. Remove `1`. `r_removed = [4, 3, 1]`.\n\nAfter the loop, sort `r_removed`: `[1, 3, 4]`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n*   **Time:**\n    *   Building the adjacency list: `O(N)` (for `N-1` edges).\n    *   Main loop iterates `N` times. Inside the loop, checking neighbors for presence in `s_kept` takes `O(degree(i))` time on average (due to `set` lookups). The sum of degrees for all nodes in a tree is `2*(N-1)`. So, the total time for the loop is `O(N)`.\n    *   Sorting `r_removed`: `O(K log K)`. Since `K < N`, this is at most `O(N log N)`.\n    *   Overall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n*   **Space:**\n    *   Adjacency list `adj`: `O(N)` for nodes and `O(N)` for edges.\n    *   `s_kept` set: `O(N)` in the worst case (if `N-K` is close to `N`).\n    *   `r_removed` list: `O(K)` in the worst case.\n    *   Overall space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `O(N log N)` time and `O(N)` space are well within typical competitive programming limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Adjacency list for the graph\n    # adj[i] will store a list of neighbors of district i\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # s_kept will store districts that are part of the final connected component\n    # Using a set for O(1) average time complexity for add and check operations\n    s_kept = set()\n    \n    # r_removed will store districts that are removed\n    r_removed = []\n    \n    # The number of districts we need to keep\n    num_to_keep = n - k\n\n    # Iterate districts from N down to 1\n    # This prioritizes districts with higher indices to maximize fan sum\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if len(s_kept) == num_to_keep:\n            # If we have already selected enough districts,\n            # this district 'i' must be removed.\n            r_removed.append(i)\n        else:\n            # We still need to select more districts.\n            if not s_kept:\n                # If s_kept is empty, this is the first district we are keeping.\n                # It forms the initial connected component.\n                s_kept.add(i)\n            else:\n                # If s_kept is not empty, we check if district 'i' can be added\n                # while maintaining connectivity.\n                # This means 'i' must be adjacent to at least one district already in s_kept.\n                is_connected_to_kept = False\n                for neighbor in adj[i]:\n                    if neighbor in s_kept:\n                        is_connected_to_kept = True\n                        break\n                \n                if is_connected_to_kept:\n                    # 'i' is connected to the existing component, so we keep it.\n                    s_kept.add(i)\n                else:\n                    # 'i' is not connected to the existing component.\n                    # Adding it would make the kept set disconnected, which is not allowed.\n                    # So, 'i' must be removed.\n                    r_removed.append(i)\n    \n    # The problem requires the removed districts to be printed in increasing order.\n    r_removed.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, r_removed)) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
