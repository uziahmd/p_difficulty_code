Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find the length of the longest substring that shows up at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, but the key is finding *distinct* starting positions for those substrings. The input string will only have lowercase Latin letters and a length no more than 100.\n\nLet's break this down. My initial approach is to iterate through all possible substring lengths. The maximum length will be the length of the string minus one. Then, for each length, I'll need to check if there are two non-overlapping substrings of that length within the string. I think a brute-force approach will be fast enough since the string length is small.\n\nMy algorithm will look like this. I'll initialize a `max_len` to zero. I’ll start by checking the longest possible substring lengths first. This saves time because if I find a long substring, I can immediately return its length. So I'll go from `n-1` down to 1 (because if a substring of length `n` appears twice, it's just the entire string, which means no substrings in the usual understanding). Then, for each length `L`, I'll iterate through all the starting positions of possible substrings.  I'll compare each possible substring `s[i:i+L]` with all other substrings `s[j:j+L]` where `j > i` and see if they match. If I find a match, then I can immediately return `L` because that's the longest length found so far, and I am going from the longest possible substring down.\n\nIf no matching substrings are found for any of the tested lengths, I'll just return 0, since that means no substrings appeared twice.\n\nLet's walk through an example like \"ababa.\" The algorithm would start by checking if there's a substring of length 4 that appears twice. There isn't. Then it tries substrings of length 3 (\"aba\"). Comparing it to the substring starting at index 2 (\"aba\") results in a match! So it would return 3. I am confident that is correct.\n",
