    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to arrange a ternary string (made of 0s, 1s, and 2s) into its lexicographically smallest form, given these very specific swap rules. My goal is to determine the optimal strategy.\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward: I can swap a '0' with a '1' (like \"01\" <-> \"10\") and a '1' with a '2' (like \"12\" <-> \"21\"), but I *cannot* directly swap a '0' and a '2'.  This seems like a constraint to pay attention to.\n\nLet's break down the implications of these rules. A '0' can freely move past a '1', and a '2' can also freely move past a '1'. A '1' can move past both a '0' and a '2'.\n\nBut what about the interaction between '0's and '2's?  They can't directly swap. So, I need to look at what *cannot* happen.  If I start with a string containing \"0...2\", can those two characters ever reverse their relative positions? No, and that's the key.\n\nConsider the \"02\" case. I can't turn it into \"20\" directly. The only way is by using a '1', but even so, the relative positions don't change.  So, if I start with \"0...2\" in the string, a '0' to the left of a '2', that order will be preserved.\n\nFor example, starting with \"012\", I can get \"102\" or \"021\". I can try to use these intermediary strings. It is impossible to make it \"20...\" This is a crucial insight.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy must involve preserving the *relative order of '0's and '2's*. The key observation is that the order of the 0's and 2's is fixed. I can then sort the 1's based on their current positions, effectively clustering the 1's between the 0's and 2's to minimize the lexicographical value. I can minimize the string simply by sorting them in relation to one another.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are:\n1. '0' and '1': \"01\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"10\"\n2. '1' and '2': \"12\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"21\"\nThe swap \"02\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"20\" is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the movement of characters:\n- A '0' can swap with an adjacent '1'. This means a '0' can move past any '1'.\n- A '1' can swap with an adjacent '0' or '2'. This means a '1' can move past any '0' or '2'.\n- A '2' can swap with an adjacent '1'. This means a '2' can move past any '1'.\n\nConsider the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nIf we have a '0' followed by a '2' (e.g., \"02\"), they cannot swap directly. Can they swap indirectly?\nSuppose we have \"012\".\n- We can swap '0' and '1' to get \"102\".\n- We can swap '1' and '2' to get \"021\".\nFrom \"102\", we can swap '1' and '0' to get \"012\". We cannot swap '0' and '2'.\nFrom \"021\", we can swap '2' and '1' to get \"012\". We cannot swap '0' and '2'.\nThis demonstrates that a '0' cannot move to the right of a '2' that was initially to its right, and similarly, a '2' cannot move to the left of a '0' that was initially to its left.\nIn other words, the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If we have characters $s_i = '0'$ and $s_j = '2'$ with $i < j$, then in any reachable string, the '0' that originated from $s_i$ will always appear before the '2' that originated from $s_j$.\n\nSince '1's can swap with both '0's and '2's, '1's are \"freely movable\" with respect to '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string:\nWe want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning of the string.\nSince '0's can move past '1's, all '0's can move to the left past any '1's.\nHowever, '0's cannot move past '2's.\nSo, any '0' can move to the left until it hits another '0' or a '2'.\n\nThis suggests the following strategy:\n1. All '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the string, before any '1's.\n2. All '2's can be moved to the very end of the string, after any '1's.\n3. All '1's can be grouped together.\n\nCombining these observations:\nThe relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\nAll '1's can essentially \"pass through\" any '0's or '2's.\nConsider the string without '1's. For example, if the input is \"0020120\", the '0's and '2's without '1's are \"002020\". Their relative order must be preserved.\nAll '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put all '0's first.\nThen, we want to put '1's.\nThen, we want to put '2's.\n\nLet's count the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's.\nSuppose the input string `s` has `count0` zeros, `count1` ones, and `count2` twos.\n\nAll '0's can move to the front.\nAll '2's can move to the back.\nThe '1's can be placed anywhere.\n\nHowever, the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's is crucial.\nAny '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string must appear before that same '2' in the final string.\nThis means that if we have a '2' at some position $i$ in the original string, any '0's that appear after this '2' (i.e., at positions $j > i$) can never move to the left of this '2'.\nTherefore, all '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning of the result string.\nAll '0's that appear after the first '2' cannot move before it.\n\nLet's identify the position of the first '2' in the string. If there are no '2's, all '0's can move to the front.\nIf there are '2's:\n1. Count all '0's in the input string. Let this be `num_zeros`.\n2. Count all '1's in the input string. Let this be `num_ones`.\n3. Construct the result string.\n   - First, append all '0's that appear *before* the first '2' in the original string.\n   - Then, append all '1's (all `num_ones` of them).\n   - Finally, append all '0's that appear *after* the first '2' (if any), followed by all '2's.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n1. Extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their relative order. Let this be `s_without_ones`.\n   Example: \"100210\" -> \"0020\"\n2. Count the total number of '1's in the original string. Let this be `num_ones`.\n3. Construct the result:\n   - Iterate through `s_without_ones`.\n   - Append each '0' to the result.\n   - When the first '2' is encountered in `s_without_ones`, append all `num_ones` '1's to the result *before* appending this '2' and any subsequent characters from `s_without_ones`.\n   - Then append the rest of `s_without_ones` (from the first '2' onwards).\n\nExample 1: \"100210\"\n- `s_without_ones` = \"0020\"\n- `num_ones` = 2\n- Result:\n  - '0' (from \"0020\") -> \"0\"\n  - '0' (from \"0020\") -> \"00\"\n  - '2' (from \"0020\") is encountered. Append all '1's: \"0011\"\n  - Append '2': \"00112\"\n  - Append '0' (remaining from \"0020\"): \"001120\"\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 2: \"11222121\"\n- `s_without_ones` = \"2222\"\n- `num_ones` = 4\n- Result:\n  - '2' (from \"2222\") is encountered. Append all '1's: \"1111\"\n  - Append '2': \"11112\"\n  - Append '2': \"111122\"\n  - Append '2': \"1111222\"\n  - Append '2': \"11112222\"\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 3: \"20\"\n- `s_without_ones` = \"20\"\n- `num_ones` = 0\n- Result:\n  - '2' (from \"20\") is encountered. Append all '1's (0 of them): \"\"\n  - Append '2': \"2\"\n  - Append '0' (remaining from \"20\"): \"20\"\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis logic seems correct. The '1's can freely move past '0's and '2's. To make the string lexicographically minimal, we want to put '0's first, then '1's, then '2's. But the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. So, any '0' that appears after a '2' in the original string cannot move before that '2'. The best we can do is to place all '1's immediately after all '0's that *can* move to the front (i.e., those not blocked by a preceding '2'), and then place the '2's and the '0's that were blocked by '2's. This strategy effectively pushes all '1's to the \"first available\" position where they don't block any '0's from moving forward. Since '1's are greater than '0's, we want to avoid putting '1's before '0's if possible. The optimal position for '1's is after all '0's that can be moved to the front.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars`.\n2. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Store it in `num_ones`.\n3. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s`. If '2' is not found, `first_two_idx = -1`.\n4. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '2' and this is the first '2' encountered (i.e., `i == first_two_idx`):\n     - Append `num_ones` '1's to `result_chars`.\n     - Append '2' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '2' but not the first '2' (i.e., `i > first_two_idx`):\n     - Append '2' to `result_chars`.\n5. If no '2' was found in the string (`first_two_idx == -1`):\n   - After processing all '0's, append `num_ones` '1's to `result_chars`.\n6. Join `result_chars` to form the final string.\n\nLet's refine step 4 and 5 for clarity:\n1. Initialize `result_chars = []`.\n2. Count `num_ones = s.count('1')`.\n3. Initialize `found_first_two = False`.\n4. Iterate through each character `char` in `s`:\n   - If `char == '0'`:\n     - Append '0' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `char == '1'`:\n     - Do nothing for now (we will add all '1's later).\n   - If `char == '2'`:\n     - If `not found_first_two`:\n       - Append `num_ones` '1's to `result_chars`.\n       - Set `found_first_two = True`.\n     - Append '2' to `result_chars`.\n5. After the loop, if `not found_first_two` (meaning there were no '2's in the string):\n   - Append `num_ones` '1's to `result_chars`.\n6. Return `\"\".join(result_chars)`.\n\nThis approach ensures that all '0's that appear before any '2's are placed at the beginning. Then, all '1's are placed. Then, the '2's and any '0's that appeared after them are placed, maintaining their relative order. This is the lexicographically smallest arrangement.\n\nConsider string \"000\".\n`num_ones = 0`. `found_first_two = False`.\nLoop:\n- '0': `result_chars = ['0']`\n- '0': `result_chars = ['0', '0']`\n- '0': `result_chars = ['0', '0', '0']`\nEnd loop. `not found_first_two` is true. Append `0` '1's. `result_chars` remains `['0', '0', '0']`.\nResult: \"000\". Correct.\n\nConsider string \"111\".\n`num_ones = 3`. `found_first_two = False`.\nLoop:\n- '1': do nothing.\n- '1': do nothing.\n- '1': do nothing.\nEnd loop. `not found_first_two` is true. Append `3` '1's. `result_chars = ['1', '1', '1']`.\nResult: \"111\". Correct.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) for counting '1's and O(N) for iterating and building the result string, where N is the length of the input string. The space complexity will be O(N) for storing the result string. This is efficient enough for N up to $10^5$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    result_chars = []\n    \n    # Find the characters that are not '1' and store them,\n    # and count the number of '1's.\n    # The '1's will be inserted at a specific point.\n    \n    # Build the part of the string before the first '2' (if any)\n    # and the part after the first '2'.\n    # All '0's before the first '2' can move to the very beginning.\n    # All '1's can effectively move anywhere.\n    # All '2's and '0's after the first '2' must maintain their relative order.\n\n    # We want to put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n    # But '0's cannot move past '2's.\n    # So, all '0's that appear before the first '2' can be moved to the front.\n    # All '1's can then be grouped together.\n    # Then, the first '2' and any subsequent '0's or '2's (maintaining their relative order).\n\n    # This means the '1's should be inserted right before the first '2'\n    # (if a '2' exists), or at the very end (if no '2' exists).\n\n    has_two = False\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        elif char_s == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n        else: # char_s == '2'\n            has_two = True\n            # When we encounter the first '2', we insert all '1's here.\n            # Then we append this '2' and continue with other '0's and '2's.\n            # This is tricky if we are building result_chars directly.\n            # A better way is to build a string of '0's and '2's first,\n            # then insert '1's.\n\n    # Let's count '0's and '1's and build the '0'/'2' skeleton\n    non_one_chars = []\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            non_one_chars.append(char_s)\n    \n    final_result = []\n    inserted_ones = False\n    for char_no in non_one_chars:\n        if char_no == '2' and not inserted_ones:\n            final_result.extend(['1'] * num_ones)\n            inserted_ones = True\n        final_result.append(char_no)\n    \n    # If no '2' was found in the original string, '1's go at the very end\n    if not inserted_ones:\n        final_result.extend(['1'] * num_ones)\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(final_result) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
