            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Problem: Finding the Minimum Extra Tiles for a Mentsu**\n\nOkay, so I'm given three tiles and need to figure out the fewest *extra* tiles to draw to make a \"mentsu,\" which is either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the starting hand already forms a mentsu.  That's straightforward: check for three of a kind (koutsu) or a sequential run of the same suit (shuntsu).\n\nIf not, I consider drawing one tile. With this new tile in hand, I need to check if any combination of three tiles can form a mentsu.  I can think about it as checking if any *pair* of my original tiles can be completed by drawing one more.  Specifically, if I have two of the same tile (a pair for koutsu) or a pair of tiles that are just one number apart (shuntsu potential), then one draw is enough. For shuntsu, if the difference in the number of the two tiles is 1, and the numbers are within the range, I can draw the tile to complete the sequence. If the difference in the numbers is 2, then one tile is also enough.\n\nFinally, if one draw doesn't do it, then two draws are always guaranteed to work. The reason is because I can always choose a tile from my original hand, and with two more draws of that same tile, I'll have a koutsu.  So, if zero and one draws fail, two draws is the answer.\n\nHere's the detailed logic:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Turn the tile strings into a usable format, like `(number, suit)`.\n\n2. **`check_mentsu()` Function**: This function checks if a set of three tiles is already a koutsu or shuntsu.  Easy peasy.\n\n3. **Check 0 Draws**: If `check_mentsu()` returns `True` for the starting hand, the answer is 0.\n\n4. **Check 1 Draw**: If 0 draws isn't enough, I need to see if one draw will work. My optimized approach involves,\n    *   For any pair of tiles from the hand, I can create the `[t_a, t_b, t_draw]` with `t_a` and `t_b` from original hand. If `t_a` and `t_b` are the same (koutsu), one draw will complete it. If the difference between `t_a` and `t_b` is 1 or 2 and the numbers are in the range, a shuntsu is possible by drawing the missing tile. I need to iterate over all possible `t_draw` to see if it is enough.\n    * I use a function `check_one_draw_possible(t1, t2)` which checks if a pair of tiles can form a koutsu or shuntsu with one more tile. It is the core of finding a tile.\n\n5. **Check 2 Draws**: If both 0 and 1 draws fail, the answer is 2. The reason is that, in the worst-case scenario, I can pick a tile, and draw two more of it to make a koutsu.\n\nThis solution ensures the minimum number of tiles are found. It does have several edge conditions but the logic looks sound for all 3 cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. The number of each type of tile she can draw is infinite.\n\nWe need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are sufficient. The maximum number of draws needed is 2, because she can always pick any tile from her hand (say, `X`) and draw two more `X` tiles to form a koutsu `[X, X, X]`.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`, e.g., '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\n**1. Check for 0 Draws:**\nWe check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\nA mentsu `[t1, t2, t3]` can be:\n- **Koutsu:** `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`.\n- **Shuntsu:** All three tiles must have the same suit. Let their numbers be `n1, n2, n3`. If, after sorting, `n1 + 1 == n2` and `n2 + 1 == n3`, then they form a shuntsu.\n\nIf a mentsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not enough, we check if 1 draw is sufficient. This means we need to find a tile `X` such that by adding `X` to the hand, we can form a mentsu using any three of the four tiles (`t1, t2, t3, X`).\nSince `t1, t2, t3` alone do not form a mentsu, the mentsu must involve `X`. This implies that two of the original tiles, say `ta` and `tb`, can be combined with `X` to form a mentsu `[ta, tb, X]`.\n\nWe iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand `(t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)` and check if they can be completed into a mentsu with one additional tile:\n- **Koutsu completion:** If `ta == tb`, we can draw `ta` (or `tb`) to form `[ta, ta, ta]`.\n- **Shuntsu completion:** If `ta` and `tb` have the same suit:\n    - Let their numbers be `na` and `nb`. Sort them: `n_min = min(na, nb)`, `n_max = max(na, nb)`.\n    - If `n_max - n_min == 1` (e.g., `[2m, 3m]`): We can draw `(n_min - 1, suit)` (if `n_min > 1`) or `(n_max + 1, suit)` (if `n_max < 9`). If either of these is possible, 1 draw is enough.\n    - If `n_max - n_min == 2` (e.g., `[2m, 4m]`): We can draw `(n_min + 1, suit)` to form `[2m, 3m, 4m]`. This is always possible as `n_min + 1` will be between 1 and 9.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**3. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws must be enough. This is because we can always take any tile `t_i` from the initial hand and draw two more identical tiles (`t_i`) to form a koutsu `[t_i, t_i, t_i]`. This requires 2 draws. Thus, the maximum number of draws needed is 2.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n*   **Input: `1s 2s 3s`**\n    Tiles: `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]`\n    - **0 Draws Check:**\n        - Not a koutsu.\n        - Same suit ('s'). Numbers `[1, 2, 3]`. `1+1=2`, `2+1=3`. Forms a shuntsu.\n    - Output: `0`\n\n*   **Input: `9m 9m 9m`**\n    Tiles: `[(9, 'm'), (9, 'm'), (9, 'm')]`\n    - **0 Draws Check:**\n        - All tiles are `(9, 'm')`. Forms a koutsu.\n    - Output: `0`\n\n*   **Input: `3p 9m 2p`**\n    Tiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`. Sorted for consistency: `[(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]`.\n    - **0 Draws Check:**\n        - Not a koutsu (tiles are different).\n        - Not a shuntsu (suits are `m, p, p`, not all same).\n        - 0 draws is not enough.\n    - **1 Draw Check:**\n        Pairs:\n        1.  `((9, 'm'), (2, 'p'))`: Different suits, not identical. Cannot complete with 1 draw.\n        2.  `((9, 'm'), (3, 'p'))`: Different suits, not identical. Cannot complete with 1 draw.\n        3.  `((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'))`: Same suit ('p'). Numbers are `2, 3`.\n            `n_max - n_min = 3 - 2 = 1`.\n            `n_min = 2 > 1` (can draw `1p`) OR `n_max = 3 < 9` (can draw `4p`).\n            Since `n_min > 1`, we can draw `1p` to form `[1p, 2p, 3p]`.\n            Alternatively, since `n_max < 9`, we can draw `4p` to form `[2p, 3p, 4p]`.\n            So, 1 draw is enough.\n    - Output: `1`\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(tile_str):\n    \"\"\"Converts a tile string (e.g., '1s') to a (number, suit) tuple.\"\"\"\n    num = int(tile_str[0])\n    suit = tile_str[1]\n    return (num, suit)\n\ndef check_mentsu(t1, t2, t3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if three tiles form a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu).\n    Tiles are expected as (number, suit) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for koutsu (triplet of identical tiles)\n    if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n        return True\n\n    # Check for shuntsu (sequence of same-suited tiles)\n    if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]: # Same suit\n        nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n        if nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    tiles_str = line\n    \n    tiles_hand = [parse_tile(t) for t in tiles_str]\n    \n    # Sort tiles to handle shuntsu checks more easily later, though not strictly needed for the current logic\n    # For example, sorting by suit then number.\n    # tiles_hand.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- 0 Draws Check ---\n    # Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu\n    if check_mentsu(tiles_hand[0], tiles_hand[1], tiles_hand[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- 1 Draw Check ---\n    # Check if any pair from the initial hand can be completed to a mentsu with one draw.\n    # We consider all unique pairs: (t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)\n    \n    # Helper function to check if a pair can form a mentsu with one draw\n    def can_complete_with_one_draw(ta, tb):\n        # Koutsu completion: if two tiles are identical, draw one more.\n        if ta == tb:\n            return True\n        \n        # Shuntsu completion: if two tiles are of the same suit.\n        if ta[1] == tb[1]: # Same suit\n            na, nb = ta[0], tb[0]\n            n_min, n_max = min(na, nb), max(na, nb)\n\n            # Case 1: Adjacent numbers, e.g., (2m, 3m).
