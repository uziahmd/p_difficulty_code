The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nAlright, I'm going to create a Python script to calculate the total gilded cells on a rectangular plate, keeping in mind I'm an expert in this, so I need to make this as efficient as possible. The plate has a width `w` and height `h`, and we have `k` gilded rings.  Each ring surrounds an inner rectangle. The `i`-th ring sits on a rectangle with dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`, which is pretty straightforward.  Each ring, as it's defined, has a width of one cell.\n\nMy first thought is to break down the calculation for each ring. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring are `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. The number of cells in that ring is just the perimeter of that rectangle, minus the overlaps in the corners, which is neatly expressed as `2 * (W_i + H_i) - 4`.\n\nSo, the plan is to iterate from `i = 1` up to `k`, calculating the number of cells in each ring and summing them up. Before I get too carried away coding, I'll need to double-check the constraints. I'm seeing `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. That constraint on `k` is crucial. It ensures that my calculations of `W_i` and `H_i` will always yield positive dimensions. It also ensures that the inner rectangles have at least a minimum size. I need to make sure the rings make sense.\n\nWith that in mind, my Python script will loop from `i = 1` to `k`. Within the loop, I'll calculate `W_i` and `H_i`, then calculate the perimeter and add it to a running total. Finally, I'll return the total number of gilded cells. This looks straightforward, and I can probably optimize it further if needed, but this is my core strategy to start.\n",
