After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this \"Marks\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this competitive programming question. The core of it seems to be determining which students are \"successful,\" which means they got the highest mark in at least one subject.  I'm breaking this down step-by-step to be systematic.\n\nFirst, I see the input format: `n` students, `m` subjects, and then `n` lines of marks, each line representing a student's marks across the subjects. A list of strings is a natural representation here. I'll read the input into a 2D structure, probably a list of strings, where each inner string represents a student's marks.\n\nNow, I understand the definitions: being \"best at a subject\" means having the maximum mark in that subject. A \"successful student\" is someone who is best at *at least one* subject.  This suggests I need a way to track whether a student is successful or not. A boolean list, `is_successful`, seems perfect for this, initialized to `False` for everyone.\n\nThe overall strategy is clear: I'll iterate through each subject. For each subject, I'll find the maximum mark achieved. Then, I'll iterate through all the students again, and if a student's mark matches the maximum mark for that subject, I'll mark them as successful in the `is_successful` list. Finally, I'll just count how many students are marked as successful.\n\nI'm thinking of the specific steps. I need to read `n` and `m`, create the `gradebook` list of strings, and then the `successful_students` boolean list. The core of the logic is a nested loop: the outer loop iterates through subjects (columns), and the inner loop finds the maximum mark for the current subject (column). A second inner loop then marks any student who matches that max mark as successful.\n\nI'll use the example walkthrough provided to verify my logic. That's a solid way to make sure the algorithm works correctly on a concrete case. The constraints are `n, m <= 100`, which means an O(n*m) solution is going to be perfectly efficient. Since each student's grade is inputted as a String, I'll need to convert the grades to integers for comparisons. I can initialize the max mark to 0, which will always be less than any possible score (which is 1 to 9). This will prevent errors with negative values.\n\nI'll also keep in mind the details: how to read input efficiently in Python, which is often using `sys.stdin.readline()`. No need for complex data structures or helper functions; I can keep the code clean and focused.  Finally, after testing it, I'll remove comments to create a production ready script.\n",
