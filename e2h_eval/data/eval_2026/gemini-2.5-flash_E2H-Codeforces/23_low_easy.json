            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to figure out the fewest extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make at least one \"mentsu\" - either a \"koutsu\" (three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (three sequential tiles of the same suit).  I'm starting with just three tiles.  The answer will be either 0, 1, or 2, because with three tiles to start, I need at most two more to make a set of three tiles.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent the tiles in a structured way. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s).  I'll probably use tuples or objects, something like `('1', 's')` to store the data.\n\nFirst, I need to check if I can achieve a mentsu with the tiles I *already* have. If I already have a mentsu, the answer is 0.\n\n*   **For Koutsu:** Are all three tiles the same?  If `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`, then I'm done.\n*   **For Shuntsu:**  I need to make sure the tiles are the same suit and the numbers are sequential. I can sort the numbers within each suit to make checking for consecutive numbers easier.  If the sorted numbers are `n1`, `n2`, and `n3`, then `n2 == n1 + 1` and `n3 == n2 + 1` (after ensuring the suits are the same) and I have a shuntsu.\n\nIf neither of those conditions hold, then I need to draw some tiles.\n\nNow, if I have to draw at least one tile, let's see if I can make a mentsu by drawing *just one* tile. This means I need to figure out if there's a tile I can draw that will complete a \"koutsu\" with two existing tiles, OR that completes a \"shuntsu\" with two existing tiles. The goal is a *mentsu* involving the drawn tile. I should consider sets of my initial tiles (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) and test each possibility of drawing one more tile (`t_draw`). If, after drawing one tile, I can make a \"koutsu\" or \"shuntsu\" using that drawn tile, then the answer is 1.\n\nFinally, if I can't form a mentsu with zero or one extra tiles, then I definitely need to draw two extra tiles (the answer is 2).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. We need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are required.\n\nFirst, we parse the input tiles into a more usable format. Each tile is represented by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). We can store them as a list of tuples `(number, suit)`. For easier comparison and sorting, it's beneficial to convert the number character to an integer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for s in tiles_str:\n        tiles.append((int(s[0]), s[1]))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier shuntsu checks\n    # Sorting by suit then number groups similar tiles together\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a koutsu\n    def is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a shuntsu\n    def is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]: # Same suit\n            nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]]) # Sort numbers\n            return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n        return False\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # Case 0: No draws needed\n    # Check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    # We check all permutations (though sorting helps simplify for shuntsu)\n    \n    # Check for koutsu\n    if is_koutsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for shuntsu\n    if is_shuntsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # Case 1: One draw needed\n    # We need to find if by drawing one tile, we can form a mentsu.\n    # This means two of the initial tiles, plus one drawn tile, form a mentsu.\n    # Or, one initial tile, plus two drawn tiles, form a mentsu.\n    # The latter is not possible with only one draw.\n    # So, we check all pairs from the initial three tiles.\n    \n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of initial tiles\n    # (tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    \n    # For each pair (t_a, t_b), check what tile t_draw would complete a mentsu.\n    # If such a t_draw exists, then 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n    # Check for koutsu with one draw:\n    # If two tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile forms a koutsu.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2]: # tiles[0] == tiles[2] is covered by the other two if tiles are sorted\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for shuntsu with one draw:\n    # We need to find if any pair (t_a, t_b) can form a shuntsu with one additional tile.\n    # This means t_a and t_b must be of the same suit.\n    # Let their numbers be n_a, n_b.\n    # Possible shuntsu forms: (n_a, n_b, n_b+1), (n_a-1, n_a, n_b), (n_a-1, n_b, n_b+1) etc.\n    # More simply, their numbers must be consecutive (n_a, n_a+1) or separated by one (n_a, n_a+2).\n    \n    # Iterate through all pairs\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n            t_a = tiles[i]\n            t_b = tiles[j]\n\n            if t_a[1] == t_b[1]: # Same suit\n                n_a, n_b = t_a[0], t_b[0]\n                \n                # If numbers are consecutive (e.g., 1m, 2m), drawing 3m or 0m (invalid) would form a shuntsu.\n                # Or 2m, 3m, drawing 1m or 4m.\n                # Or 1m, 3m, drawing 2m.\n                \n                # Case 1: (n, n+1) -> draw (n+2)\n                # Example: (1m, 2m) -> draw 3m\n                if abs(n_a - n_b) == 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n                \n                # Case 2: (n, n+2) -> draw (n+1)\n                # Example: (1m, 3m) -> draw 2m\n                if abs(n_a - n_b) == 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # Case 2: Two draws needed\n    # If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws must be sufficient.\n    # Why?
