He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to maximize profit from solving problems over `k` days, given `n` problems with difficulties `a`.  I need to write a Python script that takes these inputs (`n`, `k`, and the difficulty list `a`) and outputs the maximum profit and a breakdown of problems solved per day.\n\nLet's break this down systematically. I see the key constraints are: a fixed number of days (`k`), all problems *must* be solved, and they must be solved in order with contiguous daily sets.  The profit on a day is simply the maximum difficulty of the problems solved on that day. My gut tells me I should focus on maximizing these daily maximums.\n\nIf I think about it, to get maximum profit I need to make each day's maximum as big as possible. So, what problems are going to contribute to that? They're clearly the ones with the *highest* difficulties. Since there are only `k` days, it makes sense that I'd want the `k` highest difficulty problems to be the maximums for those days.\n\nThis is starting to clarify. If I sort the problems by difficulty, I can select the `k` largest difficulties and assign each one as the maximum for a given day. That means I need to split the original problem sequence into `k` contiguous segments, with each segment's maximum difficulty *being* one of the selected `k` highest values. The total profit will be the sum of these maximums.\n\nTo prove this, let's look at the cuts. We need `k-1` cuts to split the `n` problems into `k` groups. Let's see... if I pick the largest `k` values, I can indeed arrange the cuts so that each of those values becomes a daily maximum. Take for example `n=8` and `k=3`. If the three largest values are, say, in positions 3, 5, and 8, I can split the sequence like `[..., 3, ... | ..., 5, ... | ..., 8]`.\n\nSo, it seems I need to pick the `k` largest problems from the input list `a`, calculate the total profit as their sum, and then construct a day breakdown that ensures each of those `k` values become a maximum. It looks like dynamic programming is overkill here. This is a greedy approach. Now I need to implement this in Python, focusing on picking the `k` largest elements and efficiently determining the number of problems for each day.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous subsegments. Each subsegment represents problems solved on a single day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits. We also need to output the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Understanding the Profit Maximization:**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should try to make each daily maximum as large as possible. Intuitively, the `k` largest problem difficulties in the entire list `a` are the best candidates to be these daily maximums.\n\nLet's say the `k` largest difficulties in the array `a` are `M_1, M_2, ..., M_k`. If we can arrange the daily partitions such that each of these `k` problems `M_j` becomes the maximum for one of the `k` days, then the total profit will be `M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_k`. This is the maximum possible sum because any other choice of `k` daily maximums would involve at least one problem whose difficulty is not among the `k` largest, thus resulting in a smaller or equal sum.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties:** Find the `k` largest values in the input array `a`. Store their values and their original indices.\n2.  **Calculate maximum total profit:** Sum these `k` largest difficulties. This will be our maximum total profit.\n3.  **Determine day partitions:** To ensure each of these `k` problems serves as a daily maximum, we can make cuts *after* each of the first `k-1` problems that correspond to these largest difficulties. The last problem corresponding to a largest difficulty will naturally be part of the last day's segment.\n\n    More precisely:\n    *   Get the original indices of the `k` largest difficulties.\n    *   Sort these indices in ascending order. Let them be `idx_1 < idx_2 < ... < idx_k`.\n    *   The first day's problems will be from index 0 up to `idx_1`.\n    *   The second day's problems will be from `idx_1 + 1` up to `idx_2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   The `j`-th day's problems will be from `idx_{j-1} + 1` up to `idx_j`.\n    *   The `k`-th day's problems will be from `idx_k + 1` up to `n-1`.\n\n    To form the `k` segments, we need `k-1` cut points. These cut points will be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\n    The number of problems for each day will be:\n    *   Day 1: `idx_1 + 1` problems (from index 0 to `idx_1`)\n    *   Day 2: `idx_2 - idx_1` problems (from index `idx_1 + 1` to `idx_2`)\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j`: `idx_j - idx_{j-1}` problems (from index `idx_{j-1} + 1` to `idx_j`)\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `k-1`: `idx_{k-1} - idx_{k-2}` problems (from index `idx_{k-2} + 1` to `idx_{k-1}`)\n    *   Day `k`: `n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)` problems (from index `idx_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`)\n\n    This strategy ensures that each of the `k` chosen problems `a[idx_j]` falls into a distinct day's segment, and since it's one of the `k` largest overall, it will be the maximum for its respective day (or tie with another problem of equal difficulty in its segment).\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Identify `k` largest difficulties:**\n    Problems with difficulties and their original indices: `(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)`\n    Sorted by difficulty (descending) and then by index (ascending for tie-breaking):\n    `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)`\n    The top `k=3` difficulties are `9, 6, 5`. Their original indices are `6, 3, 0`.\n\n2.  **Maximum total profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n3.  **Determine day partitions:**\n    The indices of these `k` largest problems are `0, 3, 6`.\n    Sorted indices: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n    We need `k-1 = 2` cut points. These are `idx_1 = 0` and `idx_2 = 3`.\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index 0 up to `idx_1 = 0`. This is `a[0]`. Number of problems: `0 - (-1) = 1`. (This is `idx_1 + 1` if we consider `idx_0 = -1` as a virtual start).\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `idx_1 + 1 = 1` up to `idx_2 = 3`. This is `a[1], a[2], a[3]`. Number of problems: `idx_2 - idx_1 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    *   Day 3: Problems from index `idx_2 + 1 = 4` up to `n-1 = 7`. This is `a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]`. Number of problems: `n - (idx_2 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`.\n\n    The problem statement's example output is `3 2 3`. This means my chosen indices `0, 3, 6` for cuts are not exactly the same as the example.\n    Example: `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`\n    Daily maxes: `5, 6, 9`. Total profit `20`.\n    The cuts are after index 2 and after index 4.\n    The indices of the daily maximums are `0` (for `5`), `3` (for `6`), `6` (for `9`).\n    These are exactly the `k` problems with largest difficulties. The key insight is that *any* set of `k-1` cut points such that each of the `k` largest problems falls into a different segment will yield the maximum total profit. The specific choice of cut points can vary.\n\n    My strategy:\n    1. Collect `(difficulty, original_index)` pairs.\n    2. Sort them by difficulty descending. If difficulties are equal, sort by original index ascending (or descending, it doesn't matter for correctness, just for determinism).\n    3. Take the top `k` pairs.\n    4. Extract their original indices. Sort these `k` indices `p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k`.\n    5. The cuts will be *after* `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}`.\n    6. Calculate segment lengths:\n        `t_1 = p_1 + 1`\n        `t_2 = p_2 - p_1`\n        ...\n        `t_{k-1} = p_{k-1} - p_{k-2}`\n        `t_k = n - (p_{k-1} + 1)`\n\n    Let's re-apply with `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `n=8, k=3`.\n    1. Pairs: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n    2. Sorted by difficulty desc: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    3. Top `k=3`: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n    4. Original indices: `[6, 3, 0]`. Sorted: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n    5. Cut points (after these indices): `0, 3`.\n    6. Segment lengths:\n        `t_1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n        `t_2 = 3 - 0 = 3`\n        `t_3 = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`\n    Output: `20` and `1 3 4`. This is a valid solution, different from the example but achieves the same maximum profit. The problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\"\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   Store `(difficulty, index)` pairs.\n*   Sort them.\n*   Sum `k` largest difficulties.\n*   Collect the indices of these `k` largest difficulties.\n*   Sort these indices.\n*   Calculate the differences to get segment lengths.\n\n**Constraints Check:**\n`n, k <= 2000`.\nSorting `n` pairs takes `O(n log n)`.\nSumming `k` values takes `O(k)`.\nSorting `k` indices takes `O(k log k)`.\nCalculating segment lengths takes `O(k)`.\nOverall complexity is dominated by `O(n log n)`, which is efficient enough for `n=2000`. `2000 log 2000` is roughly `2000 * 11 = 22000` operations, very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) pairs\n    # This is important to keep track of original positions after sorting\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort problems by difficulty in descending order.\n    # If difficulties are equal, the order of indices doesn't matter for total profit,\n    # but a consistent order helps in determining specific cuts.\n    # Python's sort is stable, so original relative order of equal elements is preserved.\n    # If we need a specific tie-breaking (e.g., by index), we can add it to the tuple:\n    # problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i)) and sort by (difficulty, index)\n    # However, for just finding the k largest values, sorting by difficulty is enough.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # The k largest difficulties will be the first k elements after sorting\n    top_k_difficulties = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Calculate the maximum total profit\n    total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_difficulties)\n\n    # Get the original indices of these k problems\n    # These indices will serve as the \"peak\" problem for each day\n    peak_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_difficulties])\n\n    # Determine the number of problems for each day\n    # We need k-1 cut points.
