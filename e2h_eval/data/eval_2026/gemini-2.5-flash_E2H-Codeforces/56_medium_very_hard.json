Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem, a competitive programming classic. The core challenge is to figure out if it's possible to connect rebel spaceships to bases without any of the connecting lines crossing. First, I need to make sure I understand the givens:  I've got `R` rebel spaceships, `B` bases, and I must connect each spaceship to exactly one base and vice versa.  If `R` doesn't equal `B`, it's an immediate \"No\" – a perfect matching isn't possible.\n\nA vital constraint is that these straight paths, or line segments, mustn't intersect.  We're given coordinates `(x, y)` for these points, and the really nice part is that `R` and `B` are small (1 to 10), which means a brute-force approach, maybe checking all permutations, is likely feasible. Crucially, the problem guarantees no duplicate points or collinearity of three points, making the geometric checks easier.\n\n**Delving into the Geometry:  The Intersection Problem**\n\nThe crux of this problem is the intersection check. When do two line segments cross? I remember the standard condition: two segments `(S1, B1)` and `(S2, B2)` intersect if their endpoints are \"straddling\" each other. `S1` and `S2` must be on opposite sides of the line `B1B2`, and `B1` and `B2` must be on opposite sides of the line `S1S2`.\n\nOften, for this type of problem, convexity or ordering properties can be leveraged.  For example, with points on a line, a simple sorted matching would work.  But here, we're in 2D with arbitrary points.\n\nA key property of non-intersecting matchings is often the convex hull. If you're going to connect a set of red and blue points without segments crossing, the convex hull of all the points has to include points from both colors.\n\nBecause `R` and `B` are small, a brute-force check of all permutations might be manageable, even if it's computationally intensive. There are `N!` possible ways to assign spaceships to bases; for `N=10`, that's a bit over 3.6 million, and then for each permutation I have to check for any intersecting pairs, and with 10 segments there's approximately 45 such pairs. That makes the running time roughly `10! * 10^2`.\n\n**Intersection Check Implementation: Orientation Test**\n\nTo check for intersections, I'll need to define how to efficiently test whether two line segments intersect. This hinges on the *orientation* test, often performed using a cross product. The orientation test of three points (A, B, C) tells whether C is clockwise, counterclockwise or collinear to the line AB.\n\n*   0: Points are collinear (which is not allowed here thanks to the problem statement).\n*   1: Points are clockwise.\n*   -1: Points are counterclockwise.\n\nTwo segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect *if and only if* `P1Q1` straddles `P2Q2` and `P2Q2` straddles `P1Q1`.  With the guarantee of no collinearity, this simplifies: `segments_intersect` becomes `(orientation(P1, Q1, P2) != orientation(P1, Q1, Q2)) and (orientation(P2, Q2, P1) != orientation(P2, Q2, Q1))`.\n\n**Implementation Plan: Brute Force with Permutations**\n\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and return.\n3.  Read the coordinates of the spaceships and the bases.\n4.  Use a `namedtuple` called `Point` to store the coordinates of the spaceships and the bases.\n5.  Implement the `orientation` and `segments_intersect` functions using the orientation test based on the cross product.\n6.  Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible assignments (permutations) of the bases to the spaceships.\n7.  For each assignment:\n    *   Form a list of segments.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of segments and call `segments_intersect` on them.\n    *   If any segments intersect, this assignment is invalid; try the next.\n    *   If no intersections are found, this assignment is valid; print \"Yes\" and stop.\n8.  If all permutations are checked and no valid assignment is found, print",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and no two paths (straight line segments) between an assigned spaceship and its base intersect.\n\n**1. Basic Constraint:**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible, and we should output \"No\".\n\n**2. Non-intersecting Segments:**\nThe core of the problem is the non-intersection constraint. Given `N` spaceships and `N` bases (where `N = R = B`), we need to find a permutation of bases `(B_{p_0}, B_{p_1}, ..., B_{p_{N-1}})` such that if we connect `S_i` to `B_{p_i}` for all `i`, no two segments `(S_i, B_{p_i})` and `(S_j, B_{p_j})` intersect.\n\n**3. Small Constraints and Brute Force:**\nThe maximum number of spaceships/bases is `N=10`. This is a very small number, which suggests that a brute-force approach iterating through all possible assignments might be feasible.\n*   There are `N!` ways to assign `N` spaceships to `N` bases. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`.\n*   For each assignment, we form `N` segments. We then need to check every pair of these segments for intersection. The number of pairs is `N * (N-1) / 2`. For `N=10`, this is `10 * 9 / 2 = 45` pairs.\n*   Each intersection check takes constant time using geometric orientation tests (cross products).\n\nThe total operations would be roughly `N! * N^2`. For `N=10`, this is `3.6 * 10^6 * 45`, which is approximately `1.6 * 10^8`. This might be on the edge of typical time limits (usually around `10^8` operations per second for Python, or `10^9` for C++), but it's often acceptable for problems with small `N`.\n\n**4. Geometric Intersection Test:**\nTwo line segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect if and only if:\n*   `P1` and `Q1` are on opposite sides of the line `P2Q2`, AND\n*   `P2` and `Q2` are on opposite sides of the line `P1Q1`.\n\nThis can be determined using the `orientation` of triplets of points. The `orientation(p, q, r)` function returns:\n*   `1` if `r` is counter-clockwise (left turn) from vector `pq`.\n*   `-1` if `r` is clockwise (right turn) from vector `pq`.\n*   `0` if `p, q, r` are collinear.\n\nThe problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", so `orientation` will never return `0`.\nThus, segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect if:\n`orientation(P1, Q1, P2) != orientation(P1, Q1, Q2)` (meaning `P2` and `Q2` are on opposite sides of `P1Q1`) AND\n`orientation(P2, Q2, P1) != orientation(P2, Q2, Q1)` (meaning `P1` and `Q1` are on opposite sides of `P2Q2`).\n\n**5. Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and return.\n3.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `spaceships`.\n4.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n5.  Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible orderings of the `bases` indices.\n6.  For each permutation `p = (p_0, p_1, ..., p_{N-1})`:\n    a.  Form `N` segments: `(spaceships[0], bases[p_0]), (spaceships[1], bases[p_1]), ..., (spaceships[N-1], bases[p_{N-1}])`.\n    b.  Check all unique pairs of these `N` segments for intersection using the `segments_intersect` function.\n    c.  If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid; move to the next permutation.\n    d.  If no pair intersects after checking all `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs, then a valid assignment has been found. Print \"Yes\" and terminate.\n7.  If all permutations are checked and none lead to a valid assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`R=3, B=3`\nSpaceships: `S0(0,0), S1(2,0), S2(3,1)`\nBases: `B0(-2,1), B1(0,3), B2(2,2)`\n\nOne permutation of bases is `(B0, B1, B2)`.

No intersection.\n\nChecking `L0` and `L2`: (similar calculation) no intersection.\nChecking `L1` and `L2`: (similar calculation) no intersection.\n\nSince this permutation `(B0, B1, B2)` results in no intersecting segments, the algorithm would find this and print \"Yes\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define a Point namedtuple for cleaner coordinate handling\nPoint = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    To find the orientation of an ordered triplet (p, q, r).\n    The function returns:\n    1  -> Counterclockwise (r is to the left of vector pq)\n    -1 -> Clockwise (r is to the right of vector pq)\n    0  -> Collinear (p, q, r are on the same line) - This case is guaranteed not to happen\n          by the problem statement (\"no three points are on the same line\").\n    \"\"\"\n    val = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - \\\n          (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)\n    \n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # Collinear (not expected based on problem constraints)\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1 # Counterclockwise or Clockwise\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if line segment p1q1 and p2q2 intersect.\n    Assumes no three points are collinear, which simplifies checks\n    as we don't need to handle collinear overlaps or shared endpoints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the four orientations needed for the general case\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if all four orientations are non-zero\n    # and points are on opposite sides of each other's lines.\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # The problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\",\n    # so we don't need to check for special collinear cases (e.g., segments\n    # overlapping or sharing an endpoint).
