After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with solving the \"Marks\" problem. First, I need to thoroughly understand the problem's requirements. We've got `n` students, `m` subjects, and marks from 1 to 9. The crucial concept here is a \"successful\" student: they must be the best at *at least one* subject, meaning they got the maximum mark for that subject. The input is clear: `n`, `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` marks each. The output is a single integer: the count of successful students. The constraints, `1 <= n, m <= 100`, are important for choosing an efficient algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm Design: A Step-by-Step Approach**\n\nMy plan is to read the input, calculate the maximum mark for each subject, and then identify the successful students. I'll need appropriate data structures to store the data and perform comparisons.\n\n1.  **Input Reading:** I'll read `n` and `m` using `input().split()`. Then, I'll read the marks for each student. A list of lists or a list of strings will be suitable for storing the marks. Each element of the list will represent a student. Since marks are single characters, a list of strings is convenient, where each string represents a student's marks in all subjects.\n\n2.  **Max Marks Calculation:** I'll iterate through each subject (column). For each subject `j` (from `0` to `m-1`), I'll find the maximum mark among all students. I'll store these maximums in a list `max_marks_per_subject` of size `m`. I will initialize it with zeros (as marks are at least 1).\n\n3.  **Successful Student Identification:** Now, I'll iterate through each subject again and check if a student has the maximum mark for that subject. If a student's mark in a subject equals the maximum mark for that subject, they are \"best\" in that subject. I will use a `set` called `successful_students_indices` to store the indices of successful students; a set will ensure no duplicates, as a student can be best at multiple subjects.\n\n4.  **Result Reporting:** Finally, the size of the `successful_students_indices` set will be the number of successful students. I'll output this count using `print()`.\n\n**Data Structure Considerations**\n\nFor the grades, a list of strings is most efficient, where each string represents a student's marks. For the maximum marks, a simple list is sufficient.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm Walkthrough**\n\nLet's say `grades = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]`. To access student `i`'s mark for subject `j`, I would use `grades[i][j]`. Remember that I will have to convert this character to an integer. The complete code implementation will look like the following:\n\n**Implementation Details and Refinements**\n\n1.  Read `n`, `m`.\n2.  Read grades.\n3.  Calculate `max_marks_per_subject`.\n4.  Identify `successful_students` and store the indices (student numbers).\n5.  Print the length of the successful student set.\n\n**Performance Analysis and Optimization**\n\nThe critical part is the nested loops in steps 3 and 4. The nested loops run `m * n` times (n= number of students and m = number of subjects). Since `1 <= n, m <= 100`, this becomes `100 * 100 = 10,000` operations, which is efficient for an online judge. The overall complexity is `O(n * m)`.\n\nFor extra speed, instead of iterating over rows and columns separately, I could combine the grade reading with the max finding, but that might not matter a lot. Furthermore, I can add a `break` within the nested loop to improve performance a bit on average by making it stop checking subjects if a student is already marked as successful.\n\nI'll check for edge cases like only one student, only one subject, and marks being all the same. The logic covers all these cases.\n\nFinally, I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for input/output to gain extra speed on competitive programming.\n\nThe code seems complete and well-structured, ready for submission!\n",
