Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Unraveling the Morse Code Conundrum**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this competitive programming problem. The goal is to count unique sequences of English letters that can be derived from substrings of a growing Morse code string, all the while keeping the counts within the bounds of a modulo operation. My initial thoughts are that this screams dynamic programming, with a need for careful optimization to avoid exceeding the time limits.\n\nFirst, I established the foundation: valid Morse code mappings. I know there are 26 letters represented by strings of '0's and '1's, with lengths between 1 and 4, and there are a few invalid codes to weed out. That gives us a starting set of 26 valid representations.\n\nThe real challenge lies in efficiently tracking these sequences as the Morse code string grows. A naive approach of iterating through every substring, decoding it, and storing unique sequences seems prohibitively slow, given the string's potential length. The substrings's calculations will be `O(L^2)`. Decoding the substrings and generating all possible sequences can be exponential as well.\n\nI then realized we are asked to count only *distinct* sequences. This means that if the same letter combination appears from multiple locations, we only count it once. This leads me to think about dynamic programming. The state `dp[i]` could store the number of ways to decode `S[0...i]`, but this doesn't capture the substrings, so it doesn't give me what I need.\n\nMy next line of thought focuses on all substrings `S[i...j]`, which generates new sequences of letters. Let `count_decodings(text)` be the number of ways to decode the `text`. I can use DP to calculate `count_decodings`. The challenge is that doing this `O(L^2)` times would result in the complexity of `O(L^3)`, which is still too slow.\n\nThen, the focus shifted to the core issue: distinctness. I considered using a set to store unique sequences, but this becomes problematic since sequences can grow to be long.\n\nThe phrasing \"non-empty sequences represented with *some* substring\" emphasized the distinct nature. For example, if \"111\" decodes into \"O\", and also as \"TM\", it should count as only two unique sequences: \"O\" and \"TM\".\n\nThis led me to explore a Trie structure, to represent all sequences. Each node in the Trie represents a letter, and the total number of nodes in the Trie (excluding the root) would be the number of distinct sequences. This seems promising. Each time a new character is appended, the algorithm calculates the sequences that end in this new character, and adds them to the Trie. I calculated the complexity of this method. But it seems to take too much memory.\n\nFinally, I got to the idea of storing sequences by `TrieNodes`, and `dp[j]` is a set of `TrieNodes`. However, I realized the problem is that at each step, `dp[j]` needs to be calculated for all `j` from `L-1` down to `0`, and the size of `dp[j]` is bounded by the total number of sequences. Even though I thought this might work, the computational complexity would be too great to meet the time constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by *any* substring of a growing string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet's first understand the Morse code mapping:\n*   English letters are represented by strings of '0' (dot) and '1' (dash).\n*   These strings have lengths from 1 to 4.\n*   There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` such strings.\n*   Four strings do not correspond to any English letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n*   The remaining `30 - 4 = 26` strings correspond to distinct English letters.\nLet `VALID_CODES` be the set of these 26 valid Morse code strings.\n\nThe core challenge is to count *distinct* sequences of English letters. For example, if \"1\" maps to 'T', \"11\" maps to 'M', and \"111\" maps to 'O', then the substring \"111\" can represent:\n*   \"O\" (from \"111\")\n*   \"TM\" (from \"1\" then \"11\")\n*   \"MT\" (from \"11\" then \"1\")\n*   \"TTT\" (from \"1\" then \"1\" then \"1\")\nThese are 4 distinct sequences. If \"1\" also appeared as a substring elsewhere, leading to \"T\", we only count \"T\" once.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming combined with a Trie (prefix tree) to keep track of unique sequences.\n\n**Trie for Sequences:**\nWe'll maintain a global Trie where each node represents a prefix of an English letter sequence. For example, if 'A' maps to \"0\" and 'B' maps to \"1\", then a path from the root representing 'A' followed by 'B' means the sequence \"AB\". The total number of unique sequences found so far is simply the total number of nodes in this Trie (excluding the root).\n\n**Dynamic Programming State:**\nLet `S` be the current string of length `L`. When a new character is appended to `S`, say `S` becomes `S' = S + char`, we need to consider all new substrings that end at the newly appended character. These are `S'[L-1]`, `S'[L-2...L-1]`, ..., `S'[0...L-1]`.\n\nFor each step `i` (where `i` is the current length of `S` after `i` appends, 1-indexed):\nLet `S` be `s_0 s_1 ... s_{i-1}`.\nWe need to calculate the number of unique sequences formed by substrings `s_j ... s_{i-1}` for `j = 0, ..., i-1`.\n\nLet `dp[j]` be a `set` of `TrieNode`s. Each `TrieNode` in `dp[j]` represents the *end* of a unique sequence that can be formed by decoding the suffix `s_j ... s_{i-1}`.\nWe initialize `dp[i]` with a set containing only the `root` of our global sequence Trie. This represents the empty sequence.\n\nWe iterate `j` from `i-1` down to `0`:\nFor each `j`, we want to compute `dp[j]`. A sequence starting at `s_j` must begin with a valid Morse code `s_j ... s_{j+k-1}` (where `k` is length 1 to 4).\n1.  Initialize `dp[j]` as an empty set.\n2.  For `k` from `1` to `4`:\n    a.  Check if `j+k <= i` (i.e., `s_j ... s_{j+k-1}` is a valid substring).\n    b.  Let `code_str = s_j ... s_{j+k-1}`.\n    c.  If `code_str` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n        i.   Let `letter_idx` be the unique identifier (e.g., 0-25) for the English letter corresponding to `code_str`.\n        ii.  For each `prev_node` in `dp[j+k]` (these are the nodes representing the end of sequences formed by `s_{j+k} ... s_{i-1}`):\n            *   If `prev_node` does not have a child for `letter_idx`:\n                *   Create a new `TrieNode` as `prev_node.children[letter_idx]`.\n                *   Increment our global `total_unique_sequences` count by 1 (modulo `10^9 + 7`).\n            *   Add `prev_node.children[letter_idx]` to `dp[j]`.\n\nAfter computing `dp[j]` for all `j` from `i-1` down to `0`, `total_unique_sequences` will hold the current answer.\n\n**Data Structures:**\n*   **`TrieNode`**: Each node needs a dictionary `children` mapping `letter_idx` to another `TrieNode`.\n*   **`VALID_CODES`**: A precomputed set of valid Morse code strings. For efficient lookup, we can use a hash set.\n*   **`dp` array**: `dp[j]` stores a `set` of `TrieNode` objects. Using `id()` of `TrieNode` objects for set membership/hashing is crucial for efficiency.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   The outer loop runs `m` times (for each character appended). `m <= 3000`.\n*   Inside the outer loop, we iterate `j` from `i-1` down to `0`. This is `O(i)`.\n*   Inside the `j` loop, we iterate `k` from `1` to `4`. This is `O(4)`.\n*   Inside the `k` loop, we iterate over `prev_node` in `dp[j+k]`.\n    *   The total number of `TrieNode`s in our global Trie is at most `m * 26` (if every single character forms a distinct letter and all letters are length 1).\n    *   The size of `dp[j+k]` can be at most `m * 26`.\n    *   So, the inner loop can run up to `O(m * 26)` times.\n*   Operations like `dict` lookup/insertion and `set` add/membership test are `O(1)` on average.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(m * i * 4 * (size of dp set))`. In the worst case, `O(m * m * 4 * m * 26) = O(m^3)`.\n`3000^3` is too slow.\n\n**Optimization: State Compression (or rather, State Merging)**\nThe issue is that `dp[j]` contains `TrieNode` objects. If we have many `prev_node`s in `dp[j+k]`, we iterate many times.\nA crucial observation for this problem is that `dp[j]` for `S[j...i-1]` is identical to `dp[j']` for `S[j'...i'-1]` if `S[j...i-1]` and `S[j'...i'-1]` are the same string, and `dp[i]` and `dp[i']` (the sets of nodes representing sequences for empty string) are equivalent.\nHowever, `dp[j]` for `S[j...i-1]` is a set of nodes. These nodes are specific instances in the Trie.\n\nThe `dp[j]` values are sets of `TrieNode`s. Instead of iterating `prev_node` by `prev_node`, we can merge the sets.\n`dp[j]` = `union_{k=1 to 4, code_str valid for S[j...j+k-1]} {node.children[letter_idx] for node in dp[j+k]}`.\nThis union operation is still potentially slow if `dp[j+k]` are large sets.\n\nLet's look at the constraints again. `m <= 3000`. `O(m^2)` is usually acceptable. `3000^2 = 9 * 10^6`.\nThe `O(m^3)` analysis came from `size of dp set` being `O(m * 26)`. This is the total number of nodes in the Trie, not necessarily the size of a *single* `dp[j]` set.\nThe actual size of `dp[j]` (number of sequences that can *start* at `j` and *end* at `i-1`) is bounded by `26^4` (since a sequence of 4 letters is about the max length if all are 1-char codes).\nNo, `dp[j]` is the set of *final nodes* in the Trie for sequences formed from `S[j...i-1]`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of length `k` is `26^k`.\nThe maximum number of letters in a sequence for a substring of length `i` is `i`. So `26^i`. This is too large.\n\nThe sum of sizes of `dp[j]` sets over all `j` is the issue.\nLet `current_S` be the string of length `i`. We are calculating `dp[j]` for `j=i-1, ..., 0`.\n`dp[j]` depends on `dp[j+1], dp[j+2], dp[j+3], dp[j+4]`.\nThe total number of `TrieNode`s across all `dp[j]` for a fixed `i` is bounded by `i * (max_length_of_sequence_from_substring * 26)`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed by a *suffix* of `S` is not that large.\nFor a suffix `S[j...i-1]`, its length is `i-j`. The number of letters in a sequence is at most `i-j`.\nThe number of distinct sequences that can be formed from any suffix `S[j...i-1]` is at most `26 * (i-j)`.\nSo, `|dp[j]|` is at most `26 * (i-j)`.\nThe total operations for a single `i` step: `sum_{j=0 to i-1} (4 * |dp[j+k]|)`.\n`sum_{j=0 to i-1} (4 * 26 * (i-(j+k)))` which is roughly `sum_{j=0 to i-1} (104 * (i-j))`.\nThis is `O(i^2)`.\nSo total complexity `sum_{i=1 to m} (O(i^2)) = O(m^3)`. Still `3000^3`.\n\nThe key insight for this type of problem is often to realize that we don't need to store the actual `TrieNode` objects in the `dp` array. Instead, we can use a hash value or a canonical representation for the *set* of `TrieNode`s.\nHowever, in Python, `set` of objects is okay if objects are hashable. `TrieNode` objects are hashable by default (using `id()`).\n\nThe crucial optimization is that `dp[j]` can be seen as a mapping from `TrieNode` in `dp[j+k]` to `TrieNode` in `dp[j]`.\nThe number of states `dp[j]` can be reduced.\nLet `dp[j]` store `(current_node, length_of_code_so_far)`.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's re-verify the bounds for `|dp[j]|`.\nThe number of distinct sequences formed from *any* substring `S[j...i-1]` is what we are tracking.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code for a single letter is 4.\nThis means that `S[j...i-1]` can be decoded into a sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` where each `L_x` corresponds to a code of length `l_x` where `1 <= l_x <= 4`.\nThe total length `sum(l_x) = i-j`.\nThe number of sequences generated from `S[j...i-1]` is bounded by `(26)^((i-j)/1)`. This is too loose.\n\nThe actual number of *distinct* sequences that can be formed from a string of length `N` is much smaller.\nFor a string of length `N`, the number of ways to parse it into `p` parts is `Catalan_N`.\nBut here, we are counting distinct sequences of letters, not distinct parse trees.\nThe number of nodes in the Trie for a single substring is bounded by `N * 26`.\nSo `|dp[j]|` (the set of final nodes for `S[j...i-1]`) is bounded by `(i-j) * 26`.\n\nThis means the `O(m^3)` analysis is correct. This implies the `m=3000` constraint is too high for this approach.\nHowever, `m=3000` problems often pass with `O(m^2)` or `O(m^2 log m)`.\n`9 * 10^6` operations is acceptable. `9 * 10^8` is not.\n\nThe example outputs are small: `1, 3, 7` for `m=3`. `1, 4, 10, 22, 43` for `m=5`.\nThis suggests the number of unique sequences is not growing exponentially, but rather quadratically or cubically.\nThe total number of nodes in the Trie will not exceed `m * 26`.\nThe total number of operations performed in the inner loop `for prev_node in dp[j+k]` across all `j` and `k` for a single `i` step:\n`sum_{j=0}^{i-1} sum_{k=1}^4 |dp[j+k]|`.\nThis sum is `sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (|dp[j+1]| + |dp[j+2]| + |dp[j+3]| + |dp[j+4]|)`.\nEach `|dp[x]|` represents the number of distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[x...i-1]`.\nThis is bounded by `26 * (i-x)`.\nSo the sum is `sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (26*(i-(j+1)) + ... + 26*(i-(j+4)))`.\nThis is roughly `sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (104 * (i-j))`.\nThis sum is `104 * (i + (i-1) + ... + 1) = 104 * i * (i+1) / 2 = O(i^2)`.\nSo, for each `i`, the work is `O(i^2)`.\nTotal work over `m` appends: `sum_{i=1}^{m} O(i^2) = O(m^3)`.\n\nThis `O(m^3)` complexity is problematic.\nIs there an error in the `|dp[j]|` bound?\n`|dp[j]|` is the number of distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[j...i-1]`.\nThis is precisely the number of nodes in a Trie constructed for `S[j...i-1]`.\nThe number of nodes in a Trie for a string of length `N` is `O(N * C)` where `C` is the alphabet size.\nHere, `N = i-j`, `C=26`. So `|dp[j]| <= (i-j) * 26`. This bound seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the constant factor is small enough, or average case performance is much better.\n`3000^3 = 2.7 * 10^{10}` operations. This is definitely too slow.\n`3000^2 * 104 = 9 * 10^6 * 104 = 9.36 * 10^8`. This is still too slow for typical 1-2 seconds time limit.\nUsually `10^8` operations is the limit.\n\nLet's check the Python `set` implementation. It uses hash tables. `set.add()` and `x in set` are `O(1)` average.\nThe issue is the number of iterations, not the complexity of set operations.\n\nWhat if we don't store `TrieNode` objects in `dp[j]` directly, but rather their `id()` values? This is already how Python `set` works for objects.\n\nCould it be that the number of reachable Trie nodes from `dp[j+k]` is small on average?\nThe problem is hard. The `O(m^3)` approach is the most straightforward interpretation.
