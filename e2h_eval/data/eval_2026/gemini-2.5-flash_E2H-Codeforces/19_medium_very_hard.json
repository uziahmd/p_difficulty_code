The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to solve a competitive programming problem where I'm given a tree representing districts and need to remove a certain number of districts (`k`) to maximize the total \"fan\" count of the remaining districts. The fan count is based on the district number (higher number = more fans, exponentially so).  Crucially, the remaining districts must stay connected.\n\nMy initial thought is that since larger district numbers contribute *much* more to the sum, I should try to keep the largest possible districts. The connectivity constraint hints that this might involve finding a specific subtree.\n\nI reason that a greedy approach is likely optimal. Because the fan count is exponential, any potential connected component *must* include district `n`. If it doesn't, I could always replace the smallest district in the component with `n` for a guaranteed increase in the total.\n\nI settle on an algorithm: I'll root the tree at district `n` and greedily grow a subtree. I start with node `n` and then iteratively add the highest-numbered adjacent nodes, maintaining connectivity. This should maximize the sum of remaining fan counts because this strategy selects the largest district numbers first. I can do a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on this tree to solve this problem.\n\nBecause this greedy strategy looks sound, I will implement it. The key implementation points are to root the tree at the last element, create a max-heap that will be used to prioritize the districts to be connected, then to use a `visited` set to avoid infinite loops and redundancies in the implementation. This greedy approach should be fast enough to solve this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts to keep, such that they form a connected subgraph in the given tree, and the sum of fans (where district `i` has `2^i` fans) is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that are removed, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`. This means that including a district with a larger index `i` is overwhelmingly more beneficial than including multiple districts with smaller indices. For example, `2^X > sum_{j=1}^{X-1} 2^j = 2^X - 2`. Therefore, to maximize the total number of fans, we must prioritize keeping districts with the largest possible indices.\n\nLet `S` be the set of `n-k` districts we choose to keep. To maximize `sum_{i in S} 2^i`, the district with the largest index, `n`, must be in `S`.\n**Proof:** Assume for contradiction that an optimal set `S'` does not contain `n`. Let `m = max(S')`. Then `m < n`. The sum of fans for `S'` is `sum_{i in S'} 2^i < sum_{j=1}^{m} 2^j = 2^{m+1} - 2`.\nNow, consider a set `S''` formed by taking `n` and `n-k-1` other districts. If we can form a connected component of size `n-k` containing `n`, then the sum of fans for `S''` will be at least `2^n`. Since `2^n > 2^{m+1} - 2` (because `n > m`), `S''` would yield a strictly greater sum than `S'`. This contradicts the optimality of `S'`. Therefore, the optimal set `S` must contain district `n`.\n\nNow we know that district `n` must be part of our connected component.\n**Further Proof:** Any connected subgraph `S` of a tree `T` that contains a specific node `R` (in our case, `R=n`) must be a subtree when `T` is rooted at `R`.\nAssume `S` is a connected subgraph containing `R`. If `S` is not a subtree rooted at `R`, then there must exist a node `u \\in S` such that its parent `p` (in the tree rooted at `R`) is `p \\notin S`. However, since `S` is connected and `R \\in S`, there must be a path from `u` to `R` entirely within `S`. In a tree, the path from `u` to `R` is unique. This path must include `p`. If `p \\notin S`, then this path cannot be entirely within `S`, which contradicts the assumption that `S` is connected and `u, R \\in S`. Therefore, `S` must be a subtree rooted at `R`.\n\nCombining these two points: the optimal set of `n-k` districts must form a subtree rooted at district `n`.\nTo maximize the sum of `2^i` within this subtree, we should greedily add nodes with the largest possible indices, starting from `n`, until we have `n-k` nodes.\n\nThis leads to the following algorithm:\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `kept_nodes`: A set to store the districts we decide to keep. Initially, it contains only district `n`.\n    *   `pq`: A max-priority queue (implemented using Python's `heapq` as a min-heap with negative values) to store candidate districts to add. Initially, add all neighbors of `n` to `pq` with their district number as priority (larger number = higher priority).\n3.  **Greedy Selection:**\n    *   While the number of `kept_nodes` is less than `n-k` and `pq` is not empty:\n        *   Extract the district `u` with the highest priority (largest district number) from `pq`.\n        *   If `u` is already in `kept_nodes` (this can happen if `u` was added to `pq` via multiple paths or already processed), skip it.\n        *   Add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` is not in `kept_nodes` (i.e., it hasn't been chosen yet):\n                *   Add `v` to `pq` with priority `v`.\n4.  **Identify Removed Districts:** After the loop, `kept_nodes` will contain the `n-k` districts that maximize the fan sum. Iterate from `1` to `n`. If a district `i` is not in `kept_nodes`, add it to a list `removed_nodes`.\n5.  **Output:** Print the districts in `removed_nodes`, sorted in increasing order.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=6, k=3`):**\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\nWe need to keep `n-k = 6-3 = 3` districts.\n1.  `kept_nodes = {6}`.\n2.  Neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. `pq = [(-5, 5), (-2, 2)]` (using `(-priority, value)` for min-heap).\n3.  **Iteration 1:** `len(kept_nodes) = 1 < 3`.\n    *   Pop `(-5, 5)` from `pq`. `u = 5`.\n    *   Add `5` to `kept_nodes`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5}`.\n    *   Neighbors of 5: `6`. `6` is in `kept_nodes`. No new additions to `pq`.\n    *   `pq = [(-2, 2)]`.\n4.  **Iteration 2:** `len(kept_nodes) = 2 < 3`.\n    *   Pop `(-2, 2)` from `pq`. `u = 2`.\n    *   Add `2` to `kept_nodes`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5, 2}`.\n    *   Neighbors of 2: `1, 6, 4, 3`.\n        *   `1` not in `kept_nodes`: add `(-1, 1)` to `pq`.\n        *   `6` in `kept_nodes`.\n        *   `4` not in `kept_nodes`: add `(-4, 4)` to `pq`.\n        *   `3` not in `kept_nodes`: add `(-3, 3)` to `pq`.\n    *   `pq = [(-4, 4), (-3, 3), (-1, 1)]`.\n5.  **Stop:** `len(kept_nodes) = 3`, which equals `n-k`.\n6.  `kept_nodes = {2, 5, 6}`.\n7.  Identify removed:\n    *   1 not in `kept_nodes` -> add 1.\n    *   2 in `kept_nodes`.\n    *   3 not in `kept_nodes` -> add 3.\n    *   4 not in `kept_nodes` -> add 4.\n    *   5 in `kept_nodes`.\n    *   6 in `kept_nodes`.\n    `removed_nodes = [1, 3, 4]`.\n8.  Print `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N)` for `N-1` edges.\n*   Priority queue operations: Each node is added to `pq` at most once (when its parent is processed) and extracted at most once. Each edge is traversed twice (once for each endpoint). So, `N` extractions and up to `2*(N-1)` insertions. Each operation takes `O(log N)`. Total: `O(N log N)`.\n*   Identifying removed nodes: `O(N)` to iterate and `O(1)` average for set lookup.\n*   Sorting removed nodes: `O(k log k)`, which is `O(N log N)` in worst case.\n\nOverall time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, `kept_nodes` set, and `pq`.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Set of nodes to keep\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    \n    # Priority queue for nodes to consider adding.\n    # We use a min-heap, so we store (-priority, node_id) to get max_priority.\n    # Priority is the node_id itself, as larger node_id means more fans.\n    pq = []\n\n    # Start with node n, as it guarantees maximum fans.\n    kept_nodes.add(n)\n\n    # Add neighbors of n to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        # Only add if not already kept (which for n's neighbors means not n itself)\n        if neighbor != n:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # Number of nodes we need to keep\n    nodes_to_keep_count = n - k\n\n    # Greedily add nodes with highest values until we have enough\n    while len(kept_nodes) < nodes_to_keep_count and pq:\n        # Get the node with the highest value (largest district number)\n        neg_val, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        # If u is already in kept_nodes, skip it (can happen if added via multiple paths)\n        if u in kept_nodes:\n            continue\n\n        kept_nodes.add(u)\n\n        # Add neighbors of u to the priority queue if they are not already kept\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v not in kept_nodes:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-v, v))\n\n    # Collect the nodes that were removed\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n            \n    # Print the removed nodes in increasing order\n    print(*(sorted(removed_nodes)))\n\n# Call the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
