Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to apply a series of string substitutions and then calculate the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 10^9 + 7. The initial string, 's', consists of digits, and there are 'n' queries. Each query is in the form of 'di -> ti', meaning I replace all occurrences of digit 'di' with the string 'ti'. The order of these queries is critical. After applying all the queries, I need to interpret the final 's' as a decimal number, handle leading zeros appropriately, and find the result modulo 10^9 + 7.  The string 's' can be at most 10^5 characters, the number of queries is at most 10^5 and the queries introduce new strings that can have a length up to 10^5 in total, per the constraint of the problem.\n\nThe initial string, the sum of lengths of replacement strings and the queries themselves are all constrained to size 10^5.  This tells me that it's important to be efficient. The length of the string could grow exponentially, especially if I have substitutions like '1 -> 11111'. So, if I start with '1' and have the above substitution multiple times, the final string can get huge.  The order in which the queries are applied matters. A key insight is that applying the queries in forward order will likely be inefficient due to the length growth.  If I apply the rules in reverse, I can process the substitution rules and then transform the original string. This is the optimal strategy.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nI'll use a dynamic programming approach, working backward through the queries.  I'll maintain two arrays: `current_val[digit]` to store the numerical value (modulo 10^9 + 7) that a digit transforms into after applying subsequent queries and `current_len[digit]` to store the length of the string (modulo 10^9 + 6) that a digit transforms into, also considering subsequent queries.  Initially, each digit's value is the digit itself, and its length is 1.\n\nWhen I encounter a query 'di -> ti', I update `current_val[di]` and `current_len[di]` based on the string 'ti'.  For each digit 'c' in 'ti', I compute the new value and length based on `current_val[c]` and `current_len[c]`.  The `current_len` array is also taken `mod(10^9 + 6)` to handle the potentially huge lengths that might arise.  The final result is obtained by processing the original string 's' using the final `current_val` and `current_len` values. The time complexity of calculating the answers is O(sum(|ti|) + |s|) and O(log(10^9)) due to the power operation.\n\nThis reverse processing prevents exponential growth and allows me to compute the substitutions efficiently. The final computation takes place in the initial string of size 10^5 so it will be easy to calculate. So, I will process the queries in reverse.\n\n**Implementation Details and Edge Case Handling**\n\nI'll use a standard modular exponentiation function (`pow(base, exp, mod)`) to handle calculations efficiently, especially for large exponents and to stay within the modulo. I need to take `current_len[digit_t]` modulo `10^9 + 6` to avoid any overflow when raising `10` to this power. Also, I need to take care of the edge case of an empty string, which should be interpreted as 0 when computing the final value. Empty queries will be handled automatically, so I do not need to worry about any special conditions.\n\n**Efficiency Analysis and Confidence**\n\nThe total time complexity is O((sum of lengths of 'ti' + length of 's') * log(MOD)).  The space complexity is O(sum of lengths of 'ti' + length of 's' + 10) for the `current_val`, `current_len` and queries. With 10^5 for each element (the sum of query lengths and the initial string length), I'm confident that this approach will handle the given constraints.  I've carefully considered the length growth issue and used the modulo arithmetic and reverse processing to overcome this. The analysis of the empty string substitution also confirms that this strategy is safe.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string substitutions on an initial string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The substitutions are of the form `di -> ti`, meaning all occurrences of digit `di` are replaced by string `ti`. The order of queries matters.\n\nThe main challenge is that the length of the string `s` can grow exponentially. A naive simulation by directly manipulating the string would be too slow and memory-intensive. For example, if `s = \"1\"` and we have 10^5 queries of `1 -> \"11\"`, the string length would become 2^(10^5), which is astronomically large.\n\nThe key insight to solve this problem efficiently is to process the queries in reverse order. Let's define `val[d]` as the numerical value that digit `d` ultimately transforms into, and `length[d]` as the length of the string that `d` ultimately transforms into. These values are considered modulo 10^9 + 7 for `val` and modulo (10^9 + 6) for `length` (due to Fermat's Little Theorem for exponents in `10^L mod M`).\n\nHere's the detailed approach:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Set `MOD = 1000000007`.\n    *   Initialize `val[d] = d` and `length[d] = 1` for each digit `d` from 0 to 9. These represent the base case where no transformations have occurred yet. `length[d]` is initialized to 1 because a single digit has length 1.\n\n2.  **Store Queries**: Read all `n` queries and store them, for example, in a list of tuples `(di, ti)`.\n\n3.  **Process Queries in Reverse**: Iterate through the stored queries from the last one to the first one (`n-1` down to `0`). For each query `(di, ti)`:\n    *   We need to determine what `di` transforms into *considering all subsequent queries*. Since we are processing in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` for `d` in `ti` already reflect the transformations from subsequent queries.\n    *   Calculate `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` based on `ti`:\n        *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n        *   For each character `c` in `ti`:\n            *   Convert `c` to an integer `digit_c`.\n            *   Update `new_val_di`: `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD`. This formula correctly concatenates the numerical values. `pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD)` shifts the existing `new_val_di` to the left by `length[digit_c]` places.\n            *   Update `new_len_di`: `new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit_c]) % (MOD - 1)`. We take the sum of lengths modulo `MOD - 1` because `10^L mod MOD` depends on `L mod (MOD - 1)` (since `MOD` is prime).\n    *   After iterating through `ti`, update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `length[di] = new_len_di`.\n    *   **Special case for empty `ti`**: If `ti` is an empty string, the loop won't run. `new_val_di` will remain 0 and `new_len_di` will remain 0. This correctly represents that `di` transforms into an empty string, which has a numerical value of 0 and a length of 0.\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Result**: After processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d` (0-9) now store its ultimate transformed value and length.\n    *   Initialize `final_ans = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through the *original* input string `s` from left to right:\n        *   For each character `c` in `s`:\n            *   Convert `c` to an integer `digit_s`.\n            *   Update `final_ans`: `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, length[digit_s], MOD) + val[digit_s]) % MOD`. This is the same logic as used for `new_val_di`.\n\n5.  **Output**: Print `final_ans`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`s = \"222\"`\n`n = 2`\n`Q1: \"2->0\"`\n`Q2: \"0->7\"`\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    `MOD = 1000000007`\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (all modulo `MOD-1`)\n\n2.  **Queries**: `queries = [(2, \"0\"), (0, \"7\")]`\n\n3.  **Process in Reverse**:\n    *   **Query 2 (`0 -> 7`)**: `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n        *   `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`\n        *   For `c = '7'`: `digit_c = 7`\n            *   `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, length[7], MOD) + val[7]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n            *   `new_len_0 = (0 + length[7]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n        *   Update: `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n        *   Current state: `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n    *   **Query 1 (`2 -> 0`)**: `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n        *   `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`\n        *   For `c = '0'`: `digit_c = 0`\n            *   `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7 from the previous query)\n            *   `new_len_2 = (0 + length[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n        *   Update: `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n        *   Current state: `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Result for `s = \"222\"`**:\n    *   `final_ans = 0`\n    *   For `c = '2'` (first): `digit_s = 2`\n        *   `final_ans = (0 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    *   For `c = '2'` (second): `digit_s = 2`\n        *   `final_ans = (7 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (7 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 77`\n    *   For `c = '2'` (third): `digit_s = 2`\n        *   `final_ans = (77 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (77 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 777`\n\n5.  **Output**: `777`\n\nThis approach correctly handles the problem constraints and logic, including leading zeros (they are naturally handled by the modular arithmetic calculation) and empty string substitutions. The time complexity is dominated by processing queries `O(sum(|ti|) * log(MOD))` and processing the initial string `O(|s| * log(MOD))`, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di_str, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((int(di_str), ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    \n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value that digit 'd' transforms into\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit 'd' transforms into\n    # These are updated in reverse order of queries.\n    # length is modulo (MOD - 1) for exponentiation (Fermat's Little Theorem).\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n        \n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n        \n        # Calculate the value and length for the new string ti\n        # based on the current transformations for its constituent digits\n        for char_t in ti:\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            \n            # The new value is accumulated from left to right\n            # new_val_di * (10 ^ current_len[digit_t]) + current_val[digit_t]\n            # pow(10, current_len[digit_t], MOD) handles large exponents by taking modulo MOD-1 implicitly\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[digit_t], MOD) + current_val[digit_t]) % MOD\n            \n            # The new length is the sum of lengths of constituent digits\n            # We take modulo MOD - 1 because exponents for powers of 10 are taken modulo MOD - 1\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_t]) % (MOD - 1)\n\n        current_val[di] = new_val_di\n        current_len[di] = new_len_di\n\n    # Calculate the final number from the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Accumulate the value from left to right\n        # final_ans * (10 ^ current_len[digit_s]) + current_val[digit_s]\n        final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, current_len[digit_s], MOD) + current_val[digit_s]) % MOD\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
