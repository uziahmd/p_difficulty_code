After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem.  It's a competitive programming challenge, and my goal is to come up with an efficient Python script to solve it.  Let's break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem.  We have `n` students, and each takes `m` subjects.  The marks are all single digits, from 1 to 9.  A student is \"best\" in a subject if they achieved the *highest* mark compared to everyone else in that subject.  A student is deemed \"successful\" if they are \"best\" in *at least one* subject.  The goal is to count how many students are successful.\n\nThe input is given in a specific format: the first line tells us `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The following `n` lines contain the marks for each student, one subject at a time, without spaces.  The output will be a single integer, the number of successful students.  The constraints are `1 <= n, m <= 100`, which is helpful, meaning this is not a computationally intensive task.\n\nNow I need to clarify what a \"best\" student is. The example gives the best illustration. This looks like a perfect example of what I need.\n\nLooking at the example input, I'll need to process the data subject by subject. For each subject, I need to figure out the maximum mark achieved across all students. The students that got that maximum mark are the \"best\" students for that subject. Then I need to identify which students are \"best\" in at least one subject. So, the output will simply be a count of those \"successful\" students.\n\nBased on that, I'm thinking about the algorithm I need to implement in Python.  \n\n1.  **Input Reading:** I'll read `n` and `m` from the first line. Then, I can read the marks for each student. I believe I can efficiently store this marks data as a list of strings, or perhaps a list of lists of integers. I'll need to quickly iterate through subjects and find the max mark for each subject.\n\n2.  **Subject-by-Subject Analysis:** I'll need a nested loop.  The outer loop will iterate through the subjects (`m` times). The inner loop will iterate through the students (`n` times). Inside the inner loop, I'll compare each student's mark in the current subject to the maximum mark seen so far for that subject, finding the maximum. If a student's mark matches this max, they are the \"best\" for that subject.\n\n3.  **Determining \"Success\":** I'll keep track of which students are \"best\" in at least one subject.  I could use a boolean list, where the index corresponds to the student number, and the value indicates whether they are successful or not. Or, I could update a set of \"best\" student IDs.\n\n4.  **Counting Successful Students:** Once I've identified all the successful students, I'll just count them (by checking the boolean list or finding the length of the \"best student\" set) and print the result.\n",
