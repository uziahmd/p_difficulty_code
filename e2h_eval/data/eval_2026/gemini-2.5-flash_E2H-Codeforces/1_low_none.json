    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Gilded Cell Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate.  Let's break this down systematically. I have width `w`, height `h`, and the number of rings `k` to consider.\n\nEach ring is essentially a border around a shrinking inner rectangle. The `i`-th ring sits on a rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The ring itself is 1 cell wide, encompassing all the cells on the perimeter of this inner rectangle.\n\nThe dimensions of the `i`-th ring are clearly `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`.  To calculate the number of cells in the `i`-th ring, it's just the perimeter of that rectangle minus the corner cells, as we're counting them twice in a simple perimeter calculation: `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`.\n\nThe key is that the rings are concentric and progressively shrink. The constraint `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is crucial to prevent the inner rectangle from shrinking to a point where it doesn't even have a defined border. Let's make sure this is the case.\n\nI can write out that: `W_k = w - 4(k - 1) >= 1` and `H_k = h - 4(k - 1) >= 1`.  From this, it looks like `k <= (min(w, h) + 3) / 4`. So the given constraint `floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is a sensible, slightly tighter bound. I can see why the problem author chose that version, as it's cleaner to implement in the code. I need to make sure, for a given set of `w` and `h` values, I iterate over the number of rings correctly to get the total number of gilded cells. Now it's a matter of translating this logic to Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nEach ring `i` (1-indexed, from 1 to `k`) is defined as the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of this inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring are `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. The ring itself consists of all bordering cells of this `W_i` by `H_i` rectangle. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nThe number of cells in the border of a rectangle with dimensions `W` by `H` is given by the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`. This formula accounts for all perimeter cells, subtracting 4 because the four corner cells are counted twice (once for a horizontal side and once for a vertical side). This formula is valid as long as `W >= 1` and `H >= 1`. The problem constraints on `k` ensure that `W_i >= 3` and `H_i >= 3` for all rings, so this formula is always applicable and the dimensions are always positive.\n\nTo find the total number of gilded cells, we need to sum the number of cells for each of the `k` rings.\n\nWe can iterate from `i = 1` to `k`:\n1. For each `i`, calculate the current rectangle's width `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)` and height `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n2. Calculate the number of cells in the border of this rectangle: `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n3. Add this amount to a running total.\n\nFinally, print the total sum.\n\nLet's trace an example: `w = 7, h = 9, k = 2`\n*   **Ring 1 (i=1):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 7 - 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 9 - 0 = 9`\n    *   Cells for Ring 1 = `2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28`\n    *   Total gilded cells = 28\n\n*   **Ring 2 (i=2):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 9 - 4 = 5`\n    *   Cells for Ring 2 = `2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12`\n    *   Total gilded cells = 28 + 12 = 40\n\nThe final answer is 40.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read w, h, k from a single line of input\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each ring from 1 to k\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        # Calculate the effective width and height for the current ring\n        # The i-th ring (1-indexed) is on an inner rectangle of size\n        # (w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n\n        # Calculate the number of cells in the border of the current rectangle\n        # The formula for the perimeter cells of a WxH rectangle is 2*W + 2*H - 4\n        # This works for W, H >= 1.
