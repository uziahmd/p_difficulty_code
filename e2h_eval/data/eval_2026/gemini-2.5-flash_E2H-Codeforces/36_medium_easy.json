The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.

    "thought": "**My Analysis of a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my main goal is to figure out the probability of a valid signal power assignment, specifically modulo 998244353. It's all about towns and radio towers, and there are some specific rules I need to follow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic setup: towns are positioned at coordinates from 0 to n+1. Towers are randomly built in towns 1 to n, and each tower has a signal power. The power determines how many towns it covers.  There are a couple of crucial constraints: the towns at 0 and n+1 can't receive any signal, and all the towns from 1 to n have to receive signals from exactly one tower.\n\nMy initial thought is to let ‘S’ represent the towns where towers are built.  For each town 'i' in 'S', I need to assign a signal power ‘pi’.  Constraint 1 means I need to make sure that none of the towers cover towns 0 or n+1.  This leads to the condition that 'pi' has to be less than or equal to the minimum of 'i' and 'n+1-i'.  Essentially, towers can't reach the edge towns.\n\nConstraint 2 is where things get interesting. All towns 1 to n must be covered by precisely one tower. This means I need to make sure that the coverage intervals created by the towers perfectly \"tile\" the interval from 1 to n.  The coverage interval of a tower at 'i' with power 'pi' is from 'i-pi+1' to 'i+pi-1'. These intervals must be disjoint and collectively cover the whole range from 1 to n.\n\nSo now I’m looking for the situation where the intervals generated by 'i' and 'pi' form a complete tiling of the segment. The math shows the first interval must start at 1, the last one ends at n, and for two neighboring towers, their coverage intervals just touch each other without overlapping. Now the math starts to emerge. I realize the power ‘pi’ can be described using these split points, using terms of inequalities.\n\nLet's assume the towers are built at i1, i2,... ik, I can make some equations that the solution must follow, such as i1-p1+1 = 1, i_k + pk - 1 = n. The consecutive intervals must adjoin. Each point must satisfy the interval 1, n. \n\nThe conditions can be summarized like this: i1 has to be less or equal to n+1-i1, since both endpoints are in the range. \n\nI then consider the \"reach\" of a tower and the concept of adjacent intervals. If the tower in i1 cover interval [1, Ri], etc, then I need to find Ri such that these adjacent intervals, each covered by a single tower, forms the interval.\n\nFrom here, I start thinking about endpoints and intervals: Let's denote li=i-pi+1, Ri=i+pi-1, and write the equations and inequalities. After trying many approaches, I arrive at this point. I need to count the configuration with certain properties.\n\nThe problem comes down to finding a specific ordering, as the placement will determine the next power assignment. I have to find a set of p_i values that are correctly ordered to tile the interval of 1,n. \n\nI realized my approach of \"split points\" is necessary. With split points, this now transforms into an even deeper problem of interval tiling. My goal is to find sets of towers so that each element is even. All the towers must be even as well. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, given a set of towers built with probability $1/2$ in towns $1, \\dots, n$, we can assign integer signal powers $p_i \\in [1, n]$ to meet certain conditions. The conditions are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ do not get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p$. This means it covers integer towns in the interval $(i-p, i+p)$, which are $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$. Let $C_i = [i-p+1, i+p-1]$ be the set of towns covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p$.\n\nCondition 1 implies that for any tower $i$ with power $p_i$:\n- $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n- $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nThus, for any tower $i$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. If this holds, $C_i \\subseteq [1, n]$.\n\nCondition 2 implies that the set of intervals $\\{C_i \\mid i \\in S\\}$ must form a partition of the set of towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be exactly $[1, n]$.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns where towers are built, with $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nFor the intervals to partition $[1, n]$:\n- The first interval $C_{i_1}$ must start at $1$: $i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n- The last interval $C_{i_k}$ must end at $n$: $i_k + p_{i_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n - i_k + 1$.\n- For any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, the interval $C_{i_j}$ must end immediately before $C_{i_{j+1}}$ begins: $i_j + p_{i_j} - 1 = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$. This can be rewritten as $i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}} + 1$.\n\nLet's check the validity of these $p_i$ values against $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$:\n- For $p_{i_1} = i_1$: We need $i_1 \\le \\min(i_1, n+1-i_1)$, which simplifies to $i_1 \\le n+1-i_1 \\implies 2i_1 \\le n+1$.\n- For $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$: We need $n-i_k+1 \\le \\min(i_k, n+1-i_k)$, which simplifies to $n-i_k+1 \\le i_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\n- For $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, we have $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - i_j + 1$. Let $d_j = i_{j+1} - i_j$. Then $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = d_j+1$.\n  Since $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ and $p_{i_{j+1}} \\ge 1$, we must have $d_j+1 \\ge 2 \\implies d_j \\ge 1$, which is true since $i_{j+1} > i_j$.\n  Also, $p_{i_j} \\le d_j$ and $p_{i_{j+1}} \\le d_j$.\n  The condition $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ becomes $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$.\n  The condition $p_{i_{j+1}} \\le \\min(i_{j+1}, n+1-i_{j+1})$ becomes $p_{i_{j+1}} \\le i_{j+1}$ and $p_{i_{j+1}} \\le n+1-i_{j+1}$.\n\nLet's define a sequence of \"split points\" $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_k$ such that $x_0=0$ and $x_k=n+1$.\nThe interval covered by tower $i_j$ is $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$.\nLet $x_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$. Then $C_{i_j}$ covers $[(2i_j-x_j)+1, x_j-1]$.\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ means $x_j-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nSo, the interval covered by tower $i_j$ is $[x_{j-1}+1, x_j-1]$.\nThe center of this interval is $i_j = (x_{j-1}+1 + x_j-1)/2 = (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2$.\nThe power is $p_{i_j} = ((x_j-1) - (x_{j-1}+1) + 1 + 1)/2 = (x_j - x_{j-1})/2$.\nFor $i_j$ to be an integer, $x_{j-1}+x_j$ must be even, meaning $x_{j-1}$ and $x_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $x_0=0$ (even), all $x_j$ must be even.\nFor $p_{i_j}$ to be an integer, $x_j-x_{j-1}$ must be even, which is also guaranteed if all $x_j$ are even.\nThe condition $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ implies $x_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 2$.\nThe conditions $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ are automatically satisfied if $x_0=0$ and $x_k=n+1$.\n$p_{i_j} \\le i_j \\implies (x_j-x_{j-1})/2 \\le (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2 \\implies x_j-x_{j-1} \\le x_{j-1}+x_j \\implies 0 \\le 2x_{j-1} \\implies x_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is true.\n$p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (x_j-x_{j-1})/2 \\le n+1-(x_{j-1}+x_j)/2 \\implies x_j-x_{j-1} \\le 2(n+1)-(x_{j-1}+x_j) \\implies 2x_j \\le 2(n+1) \\implies x_j \\le n+1$. This is true.\n\nSo, a configuration of towers $S$ is valid if and only if there exists a sequence of even integers $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n+1$ such that $x_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 2$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k$, and $S = \\{(x_{j-1}+x_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nThis means that for each $j$, the town $i_j = (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2$ must be in $S$, and no other towns should be in $S$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that the set of towns $S$ must be exactly the set of midpoints of these intervals $(x_{j-1}, x_j)$.\n\nLet $N = n+1$. We need $N$ to be even. If $N$ is odd (i.e., $n$ is even), then $x_k=N$ cannot be even, so no such sequence exists. In this case, the probability is $0$.\nExample $n=2$ (even), $N=3$. My logic says probability is $0$. But example output is $1/4$. This shows my current reasoning is flawed.\n\nThe flaw is in assuming $x_0=0$ and $x_k=n+1$ are part of the *same* parity sequence.\nThe definition of $C_i = [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ means that $i-p_i+1$ and $i+p_i-1$ are the integer boundaries.\nLet's consider the points $0.5, 1.5, \\dots, n+0.5$. These are the \"boundaries\" between towns.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p$ covers an interval $(i-p, i+p)$.\nThe condition that towns $0$ and $n+1$ are not covered means $i-p \\ge 0$ and $i+p \\le n+1$.\nThe covered segment is $[i-p, i+p]$ (real line).\nThe towns are integers. So this covers integer points $c$ such that $i-p < c < i+p$.\nThe interval of towns is $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\nThe condition $i-p \\ge 0$ means $p \\le i$.\nThe condition $i+p \\le n+1$ means $p \\le n+1-i$.\nSo $p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This is what I had.\n\nLet $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ must partition $[1,n]$.\nThis means $L_1=1, R_k=n$, and $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n$p_{i_j} = i_j-L_j+1 = R_j-i_j+1$. So $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThis means $L_j+R_j$ must be even, so $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nIf $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, then $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}-1$ have the same parity.\nThis implies $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\nSo $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_k$ must alternate in parity.\nSimilarly $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_k$ must alternate in parity.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $L_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\n$R_k=n$. So $R_j$ is odd if $k-j$ is even, and even if $k-j$ is odd.\nAlso, $R_j$ and $L_j$ must have the same parity.\nIf $j$ is odd, $L_j$ is odd. Then $R_j$ must be odd.\nIf $j$ is even, $L_j$ is even. Then $R_j$ must be even.\nThis means $R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nThis implies $n=R_k$ must have the same parity as $k$.\nSo $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe set of towns where towers are built is $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nFor each $j$, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\n$L_1=1$. $R_1=2i_1-1$.\n$L_2=R_1+1=2i_1$. $R_2=2i_2-L_2=2i_2-2i_1$.\n$L_j=R_{j-1}+1$. $R_j=2i_j-L_j$.\nThe powers are $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\nThe conditions $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ are:\n$p_{i_j} \\le i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 1 \\le 2L_j$. This is true since $L_j \\ge 1$.\n$p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n+1 \\implies R_j \\le n$. This is true since $R_k=n$.\n\nSo the conditions for a set $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ to be valid are:\n1. $i_1 = 1 + (R_1-1)/2$. (This is $p_{i_1}=i_1$)\n2. $i_k = n - (n-R_{k-1})/2$. (This is $p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$)\n3. For $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, $i_j = (R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$.\n4. $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n5. All towns $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ must NOT have a tower.\n\nThis means the set $S$ must be of the form $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j$ are centers of a sequence of intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ that partition $[1,n]$, and $L_j, R_j$ alternate parity.\nThis implies that the sequence of $i_j$ must be such that $i_1 \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $i_k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$ are \"connected\" by the split point $R_j$.\n$R_j-i_j+1 = i_{j+1}-R_j$. No, this is $p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-R_j$.\n$R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\n$L_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n$R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nSo $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\n$p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\nThis is the same relation as before.\nThe sequence $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ must satisfy:\n$p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$.\n$p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nAnd for each $j$, $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$.\nThis system uniquely determines all $p_{i_j}$ given the set $S$.\nLet $x_0 = 0, x_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nThen $x_j = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\nThe values $x_j$ are the right boundary of $C_{i_j}$ plus one.\n$x_0=0$. $x_1=i_1+p_{i_1}=2i_1$. $x_2=i_2+p_{i_2}$.\n$x_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$. $x_j-1 = R_j$.\n$x_j$ must be $L_{j+1}$.\nSo $x_0=0, x_1=L_2, x_2=L_3, \\dots, x_k=L_{k+1}$ (where $L_{k+1}$ would be $n+1$).\nThe sequence of values $0, L_2, L_3, \\dots, L_k, n+1$ must satisfy $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ have different parities.\n$L_1=1$ (odd).\n$L_2$ must be even. $L_3$ must be odd. Etc. $L_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even.\nThe value $n+1$ must have the same parity as $k+1$. So $n+1 \\equiv k+1 \\pmod 2 \\implies n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\nThis is the same condition as before.\nThe values $i_j$ are $(L_j+R_j)/2$.\n$L_1=1$. $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$.\n$i_1=(1+L_2-1)/2 = L_2/2$.\n$i_2=(L_2+L_3-1)/2$.\n...\n$i_k=(L_k+n)/2$.\n\nThis is a known pattern. The sequence of $i_j$ corresponds to a \"Fibonacci-like\" structure.\nA configuration $S$ is valid if and only if:\n1. All towers in $S$ are present.\n2. All towers not in $S$ are absent.\n3. The set $S$ must be such that if $i \\in S$, then $i$ is the midpoint of an interval $[L, R]$ where $L, R$ have the same parity. And these intervals partition $[1,n]$.\nThis implies that $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$, where $k=|S|$.\nAlso, $i_1 = L_2/2$, $i_j = (L_j+L_{j+1}-1)/2$ for $j=2, \\dots, k-1$, and $i_k=(L_k+n)/2$.\n$L_1=1$. $L_j$ are alternating parity.\n$L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). $L_2$ must be even. $L_3$ must be odd. $L_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even.\nAnd $n+1$ must have the same parity as $L_{k+1}$, which means $n+1 \\equiv k+1 \\pmod 2 \\implies n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nConsider the sequence $F_m$ defined by $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_m = F_{m-1}+F_{m-2}$.\nThe number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks is $F_{n+1}$.\nHere, the total length $n$ is covered by $k$ intervals $C_{i_j}$, each of length $2p_{i_j}-1$.\n$p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$. Length $R_j-L_j+1$.\nThe total length is $\\sum_{j=1}^k (R_j-L_j+1) = n$.\nThis is like tiling the interval $[1,n]$ with blocks of odd length.\nThe centers $i_j$ must be the locations of towers.\nThe requirement that $L_j, R_j$ have same parity means $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd.\nSo we are tiling $[1,n]$ with blocks of odd length.\nIf we have a block of length $2x-1$, its center is $x$.\nFor example, $n=5$. $k=3$. $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2 \\implies 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $L_1=1, R_1=3$. $L_2=4, R_2=4$. $L_3=5, R_3=5$.\n$i_1=(1+3)/2=2$. $i_2=(4+4)/2=4$. $i_3=(5+5)/2=5$.\nParities: $L_1=1$ (odd), $R_1=3$ (odd). $L_2=4$ (even), $R_2=4$ (even). $L_3=5$ (odd), $R_3=5$ (odd).\nThis is a valid configuration.\n\nThe sequence of $i_j$ values are the chosen towers.\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ that satisfies these conditions is exactly $F_{n+1}$.\nThis is a known result in combinatorics. The number of ways to partition an interval $[1, n]$ into disjoint segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity is $F_{n+1}$.\nEach such partition uniquely determines the set $S = \\{(L_j+R_j)/2\\}$.\nEach such $S$ is valid.\n\nSo, there are $F_{n+1}$ valid sets $S$.\nEach set $S$ has $k$ towers. The probability of a specific set $S$ occurring is $(1/2)^k (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis is incorrect. The probability is $(1/2)^k$ for the towers in $S$ to be present and $(1/2)^{n-k}$ for the towers not in $S$ to be absent. This is $(1/2)^n$.\nSo, the total probability is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nWe need to compute $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^{-1})^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe Fibonacci numbers can be computed using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, F_8=21, \\dots$\nFor $n=2$, $F_{2+1} = F_3 = 2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nExample output for $n=2$ is $1/4$.\nMy $F_{n+1}$ count must be off by a factor of 2.\n\nWhat if $n=1$?\nTowns $0, 1, 2$. Tower in $1$.\n$S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. $C_1=[1,1]$. $0,2$ not covered. $1$ covered by exactly one tower. Valid.\n$k=1$. $n=1, k=1$. $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2 \\implies 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n$F_{1+1}=F_2=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=1$ is $748683265$, which is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThis means my logic for $F_{n+1}$ is off by a factor of 2 for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\nLet's carefully check the definition of $F_n$.\nUsually $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nNumber of ways to tile $1 \\times n$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks.\nFor $n=1$: $1 \\times 1$ block. 1 way. ($F_2$)\nFor $n=2$: $1 \\times 1, 1 \\times 1$ or $1 \\times 2$. 2 ways. ($F_3$)\nFor $n=3$: $1 \\times 1, 1 \\times 1, 1 \\times 1$; $1 \\times 1, 1 \\times 2$; $1 \\times 2, 1 \\times 1$. 3 ways. ($F_4$)\nSo the number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ board is $F_{n+1}$. This is correct.\n\nThe problem is related to Dyck paths or compositions.\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into $k$ odd parts is $\\binom{(n+k-1)/2-1}{k-1}$ if $n+k$ is even.\nThis is not what we want.\n\nLet's re-examine the $n=2$ case.\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. This is valid. Probability $1/4$.\n$F_3=2$. My formula gives $2/4 = 1/2$.\nThe example output is $1/4$.\nThis means either $F_{n+1}$ is not the correct count, or there's an additional factor.\nMaybe the problem states \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\", but it's possible no towers are built.\nNo, \"you want to choose signal powers... such that... towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\" This implies that towers *must* be built to cover all towns $1, \\dots, n$. So $S$ cannot be empty.\n\nLet's consider the problem from a different angle.\nA set of towers $S$ is valid if and only if there's a way to assign powers.\nThis is equivalent to finding a partition of $[1,n]$ into intervals $C_i = [L_i, R_i]$ such that $i=(L_i+R_i)/2$ and $i \\in S$.\nThis means $L_i, R_i$ must have the same parity.\n$L_1=1$. $R_k=n$. $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$.\nThis implies $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_k$ alternate parity, and $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_k$ alternate parity.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $L_j$ is odd for odd $j$, even for even $j$.\n$R_1$ must be odd. $R_2$ must be even. $R_j$ is odd for odd $j$, even for even $j$.\nSo $n=R_k$ must have the same parity as $k$.\nThe number of such partitions is $F_{n+1}$.\nWait, this is the number of ways to compose $n$ into parts where each part has an odd length.\nFor example, $n=5$.\nPartitions into odd length blocks:\n1. $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5]$ (lengths 1,1,1,1,1). $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. $k=5$. $n=5, k=5$. $5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n2. $[1,1], [2,2], [3,5]$ (lengths 1,1,3). $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$. $k=3$. $n=5, k=3$. $5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n3. $[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]$ (lengths 3,1,1). $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $k=3$. $n=5, k=3$. $5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n4. $[1,1], [2,4], [5,5]$ (lengths 1,3,1). $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$. $k=3$. $n=5, k=3$. $5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n5. $[1,3], [4,5]$ (lengths 3,2). Not valid, length 2 is even.\n6. $[1,5]$ (length 5). $S=\\{3\\}$. $k=1$. $n=5, k=1$. $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. OK.\nThese are $F_{n+1}$ ways to partition $n$ into parts of length $1$ or $2$.\nThis requires $R_j-L_j+1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nBut $R_j-L_j+1$ must be odd. So it must be $1$.\nThis means $p_{i_j}=1$.\nThis implies $i_j=1, i_j=n-i_j+1 \\implies i_j=n/2+1/2$.\nAnd $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}=i_{j+1}-i_j+1 \\implies 1+1=i_{j+1}-i_j+1 \\implies i_{j+1}-i_j=1$.\nSo all towers must have power 1, and be adjacent. $S=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$.\nThis gives only 1 valid configuration. Probability $1/2^n$. This is $F_2$ not $F_{n+1}$.\n\nThe example $n=5$, $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$, $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\n$C_2=[1,3]$ (length 3). $C_4=[4,4]$ (length 1). $C_5=[5,5]$ (length 1).\nLengths are $3,1,1$. These are all odd.\nThe number of ways to compose $n$ into odd parts is $F_n$ (if $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$). Using $F_0=0, F_1=1$ convention, it's $F_n$ or $F_{n+1}$ depending on definition.\nLet $A_n$ be the number of ways to partition $[1,n]$ into segments of odd length.\n$A_0=1$ (empty partition of empty interval).\n$A_1$: $[1,1]$ (length 1). $A_1=1$.\n$A_2$: $[1,1],[2,2]$ (lengths 1,1). $A_2=1$.\n$A_3$: $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$ (1,1,1); $[1,3]$ (3). $A_3=2$.\n$A_4$: $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]$ (1,1,1,1); $[1,3],[4,4]$ (3,1); $[1,1],[2,4]$ (1,3). $A_4=3$.\n$A_5$: $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]$ (1,1,1,1,1); $[1,3],[4,4],[5,5]$ (3,1,1); $[1,1],[2,4],[5,5]$ (1,3,1); $[1,1],[2,2],[3,5]$ (1,1,3); $[1,5]$ (5). $A_5=5$.\nThis sequence $A_n$ is $F_{n+1}$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nSo the number of valid sets $S$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nThis is exactly what I had before.\n\nWhy does $n=2$ example give $1/4$ instead of $1/2$?\nFor $n=2$, $A_2 = F_3=2$.\nThe two partitions are:\n1. $[1,1], [2,2]$. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $k=2$. $n=2, k=2$. $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$. OK.\n   $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is a valid assignment. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n2. There is no other partition of $2$ into odd length parts. Lengths must be $1,1$.\n   If $n=2$, $A_2=1$.\n   $A_n$ = number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\n   $A_1$: (1). $A_1=1$.\n   $A_2$: (1,1). $A_2=1$.\n   $A_3$: (1,1,1), (3). $A_3=2$.\n   $A_4$: (1,1,1,1), (1,3), (3,1). $A_4=3$.\n   $A_5$: (1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1), (5). $A_5=5$.\nThis sequence $A_n$ is $F_n$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1$. So $A_n = F_n$.\nSo the number of valid sets $S$ is $F_n$.\nLet's check $n=2$. $F_2=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example!\nLet's check $n=3$. $F_3=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. This matches the example!\nLet's check $n=5$. $F_5=5$. Probability $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. This matches the example!\n\nSo the logic is:\n1. A set $S$ of towers is valid if and only if there exists a partition of $[1,n]$ into disjoint intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that for each $j$:\n    a. $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity (so $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd).\n    b. The center $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is in $S$.\n    c. All towns $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ are not centers of any such interval. (This is implied by $S$ being exactly the set of centers).\n2. The number of such partitions of $[1,n]$ where each segment has odd length is $F_n$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\n3. Each such partition uniquely determines the set $S$ of towers and their powers $p_i$.\n4. For each such valid set $S$, the probability of it occurring is $(1/2)^{|S|} \\cdot (1/2)^{n-|S|} = (1/2)^n$.\n5. Therefore, the total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nThis seems correct and matches all examples.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ using matrix exponentiation.\n   The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} & F_k \\\\ F_k & F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   We need $F_n$, so compute $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$ to get $F_n$ (top-right or bottom-left element).\n   For $n=1$, $F_1=1$. Matrix exponentiation to power $0$ gives identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives $F_1=0$.\n   If $n=1$, $F_1=1$. The formula $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$ yields $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\n   My $F_n$ sequence is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\n   If $n=1$, we need $F_1$.\n   $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_2 & F_1 \\\\ F_1 & F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $F_1$ is correct.\n   We need $F_n$. So compute matrix power $n-1$.\n   The result $(M^{n-1})_{01}$ will be $F_n$.\n   Base cases:\n   If $n=0$, $F_0=0$.\n   If $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\n   If $n=2$, $F_2=1$.\n   If $n=3$, $F_3=2$.\n   The matrix power should be $n$. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   So we need to compute $M^n$ and take $F_n = (M^n)_{01}$.\n   For $n=1$: $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} F_2 & F_1 \\\\ F_1 & F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $F_1=1$.\n   For $n=2$: $M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $F_2=1$.\n   This convention works.\n\n2. Compute $(1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This is $2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n   Use modular exponentiation for $2^{-1}$ to power $n$. $2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$ is $(998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\n   So compute $499122177^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n3. Multiply $F_n$ and $2^{-n}$ modulo $998244353$.\n\nMax $n = 2 \\cdot 10^5$. Matrix exponentiation is $O(\\log n)$. Modular exponentiation is $O(\\log n)$. Total time complexity is $O(\\log n)$. This is efficient enough.\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nHelper for matrix multiplication:\n```python\ndef mat_mul(A, B, mod):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % mod\n    return C\n```\n\nHelper for matrix exponentiation:\n```python\ndef mat_pow(A, n, mod):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mul(res, base, mod)\n        base = mat_mul(base, base, mod)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n```\n\nModular inverse and power:\n```python\ndef mod_pow(base, exp, mod):\n    res = 1\n    base %= mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef mod_inv(n, mod):\n    return mod_pow(n, mod - 2, mod)\n```\n\nMain logic:\n```python\nn = int(input())\nMOD = 998244353\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0) # F_0 = 0\nelse:\n    # Compute F_n using matrix exponentiation\n    # M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    # M^n = [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]]\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    Tn = mat_pow(T, n, MOD)\n    Fn = Tn[0][1] # F_n is at (0,1) or (1,0)\n    \n    # Compute (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    inv_2 = mod_inv(2, MOD)\n    inv_2_pow_n = mod_pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Result is F_n * (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    ans = (Fn * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\n```\nTest with edge case $n=1$:\n$F_1=1$. $(1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\n$1 \\cdot 499122177 = 499122177$.\nExample output for $n=1$ is $748683265$.

Correct.\nFor $n=5$, the answer is $5/32$. $F_5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5 \\cdot (1/32) = 5/32$. Correct.\nThe formula $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$ seems to be universally correct for $n \\ge 2$.\n\nWhat about $n=1$? The problem statement says $1 \\le n$.\nIf $n=1$, towns are $0,1,2$. Tower in town $1$ with prob $1/2$.\nIf tower in town $1$ is built ($1/2$ prob), set $p_1=1$. Covers town $1$. $0,2$ not covered. Valid.\nIf tower in town $1$ is not built ($1/2$ prob), town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\nSo for $n=1$, probability is $1/2$.\nMy code with $n=1$ yields $499122177$, which is $1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=1$ is not given, but based on the problem statement, it implies $n=2$ is the first example.\nSo my code should be correct for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nFinal check on $n=0$ (though not allowed by constraints).\nIf $n=0$, towns $0,1$. No towers $1, \\dots, n$. So $S=\\emptyset$.\nCan't cover towns $1, \\dots, n$ (which is empty set). Valid.\n$F_0 = 0$. So my formula gives $0$. This is incorrect.\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$. $F_0 \\cdot (1/2)^0 = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\nThe number of ways to partition $[1,0]$ (empty interval) into odd length segments is 1 (the empty partition).\nSo $F_0$ should be 1 for this problem.\nThis means for $n=0$, $A_0=1$.\nMy $F_n$ sequence is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$. This is $A_n=F_n$.\nBut if $A_0=1$, then $A_n$ is $F_{n+1}$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nLet's check $A_n = F_{n+1}$:\n$A_0=F_1=1$.\n$A_1=F_2=1$.\n$A_2=F_3=2$. (This matches $1/2$ for $n=2$, not $1/4$)\n\nIt seems the $F_n$ vs $F_{n+1}$ convention for \"number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts\" is tricky.\nLet $C(n)$ be the number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\n$C(0)=1$ (empty composition).\n$C(1)=1$ (1).\n$C(2)=1$ (1+1).\n$C(3)=2$ (1+1+1, 3).\n$C(4)=3$ (1+1+1+1, 1+3, 3+1).\n$C(5)=5$ (1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+3, 1+3+1, 3+1+1, 5).\nThis sequence $C(n)$ is $F_{n+1}$ if $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nThen for $n=1$, $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$. Prob $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_{2+1}=F_3=2$. Prob $2 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. (Example: $1/4$)\nThis is where the discrepancy is.\n\nThe number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ tiles is $F_{n+1}$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThis is equivalent to number of compositions of $n$ into $1$s and $2$s.\nThe problem is about compositions of $n$ into *odd* parts.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to compose $n$ into odd parts.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + \\dots + a_1 (\\text{if } n \\text{ is even}) + a_0 (\\text{if } n \\text{ is odd})$.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ is not true for compositions into odd parts.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ is for compositions into $1$s and $2$s.\n\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts is indeed $F_n$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of ways to partition $[1,n]$ into segments of odd length.\n$f(0)=1$ (empty partition)\n$f(1)=1$ ($[1,1]$)\n$f(2)=1$ ($[1,1],[2,2]$)\n$f(3)=2$ ($[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$ or $[1,3]$)\n$f(4)=3$\n$f(5)=5$\nThis is exactly $F_{n+1}$ for $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nSo for $n=2$, the number of ways is $F_3=2$.\nThe two ways are:\n1. $C_1=[1,1], C_2=[2,2]$. Towers at $1,2$. Powers $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is valid. Prob $1/4$.\n2. $C_1=[1,2]$. This is not allowed, length is even.\nThe only possible way for $n=2$ is $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This is one way. Prob $1/4$.\nThe example output is $1/4$.\nMy sequence $A_n$ was correct for $n=2$, it gave $A_2=1$.\nSo the sequence $F_n$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$) is the correct one.\nThis means my code is correct. The $F_n$ is $(M^n)_{01}$.\nThe $n=1$ output in example is what's confusing me. But the problem examples start from $n=2$.\nSo my code should be perfectly fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo constant\nMOD = 998244353\n\n# Function to multiply two 2x2 matrices\ndef mat_mul(A, B, mod):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = (A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]) % mod\n    C[0][1] = (A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]) % mod\n    C[1][0] = (A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]) % mod\n    C[1][1] = (A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]) % mod\n    return C\n\n# Function to compute matrix power A^n\ndef mat_pow(A, n, mod):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mul(res, base, mod)\n        base = mat_mul(base, base, mod)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute (base^exp) % mod\ndef mod_pow(base, exp, mod):\n    res = 1\n    base %= mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem\ndef mod_inv(n, mod):\n    return mod_pow(n, mod - 2, mod)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Fibonacci sequence: F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n    # We need F_n.\n    # The number of ways to partition [1, n] into segments of odd length\n    # is F_n (using F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, ...).\n    #\n    # Matrix for Fibonacci:\n    # M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    # M^k = [[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]]\n    # So, to get F_n, we need to compute M^n and take the (0,1) or (1,0) element.\n\n    if n == 0:\n        # For n=0, the empty interval [1,0] can be partitioned in 1 way (empty partition).\n        # This implies F_0 should be 1, but standard F_0=0.\n        # The problem constraints say 1 <= n, so n=0 is not an issue.\n        # If n=0 were allowed, the answer would be 1 * (1/2)^0 = 1.\n        # However, for n=0, there are no towns 1..n to cover, so it's trivially true.\n        # The problem states towers are built in towns 1..n.

The constraints for signal power assignment are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ do not get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$, which corresponds to the integer interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$. Let $C_i = [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\nConstraint 1 implies that for any $i \\in S$:\n- $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n- $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nSo, each $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. If this condition holds, then $C_i \\subseteq [1, n]$.\n\nConstraint 2 implies that the set of intervals $\\{C_i \\mid i \\in S\\}$ must form a partition of the set of towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This means the intervals must be disjoint and their union must be exactly $[1, n]$.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$. For the intervals to partition $[1, n]$:\n- The first interval $C_{i_1}$ must start at $1$: $i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n- The last interval $C_{i_k}$ must end at $n$: $i_k + p_{i_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n - i_k + 1$.\n- For any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, $C_{i_j}$ must end immediately before $C_{i_{j+1}}$ begins: $i_j + p_{i_j} - 1 = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$. This can be rewritten as $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - i_j + 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of these intervals $C_i = [L_i, R_i]$.\nThe center of $C_i$ is $i = (L_i+R_i)/2$. For $i$ to be an integer, $L_i+R_i$ must be even, meaning $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\nThe length of $C_i$ is $R_i-L_i+1$. Since $L_i$ and $R_i$ have the same parity, $R_i-L_i$ is even, so $R_i-L_i+1$ is odd. This means all covered segments must have an odd length.\n\nThe partitioning conditions imply:\n- $L_1 = 1$. Since $L_1$ and $R_1$ must have the same parity, $R_1$ must be odd.\n- $R_k = n$. Since $L_k$ and $R_k$ must have the same parity, $L_k$ must have the same parity as $n$.\n- For $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$. Since $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}-1$ must have the same parity. This means $L_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), $L_2$ must be even, $L_3$ must be odd, and so on. $L_j$ has the same parity as $j$.\nSimilarly, $R_j$ must have the same parity as $j$.\nTherefore, $n=R_k$ must have the same parity as $k$.\n\nThe conditions $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ are automatically satisfied by this construction:\n- $p_i \\le i \\iff (R_i-L_i+1)/2 \\le (L_i+R_i)/2 \\iff R_i-L_i+1 \\le L_i+R_i \\iff 1 \\le 2L_i$. This is true since $L_i \\ge 1$.\n- $p_i \\le n+1-i \\iff (R_i-L_i+1)/2 \\le n+1-(L_i+R_i)/2 \\iff R_i-L_i+1 \\le 2(n+1)-(L_i+R_i) \\iff 2R_i \\le 2n+1 \\iff R_i \\le n+1/2$. This is true since $R_k=n$.\n\nThus, a set $S$ of towers is valid if and only if it is precisely the set of centers $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ for a partition of $[1,n]$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ of odd length.\nThe number of ways to partition an integer $n$ into a sum of odd positive integers (i.e., compositions of $n$ into odd parts) is given by the Fibonacci number $F_n$ (using the standard definition $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$).\nFor example:\n- $n=1$: One partition: $[1,1]$. $S=\\{1\\}$. $F_1=1$.\n- $n=2$: One partition: $[1,1], [2,2]$. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $F_2=1$.\n- $n=3$: Two partitions: $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$ or $[1,3]$. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ or $S=\\{2\\}$. $F_3=2$.\n- $n=5$: Five partitions: $F_5=5$.\n\nEach such valid set $S$ has $k$ towers. The probability of this specific set $S$ occurring (towers in $S$ are built, towers not in $S$ are not built) is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nSince each valid set $S$ has the same probability $(1/2)^n$, the total probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nWe need to compute $F_n \\cdot (2^{-1})^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe can compute $F_n$ using matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci matrix is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$. So $F_n$ is the element at $(0,1)$ or $(1,0)$ of $M^n$.\nThe modular inverse of $2$ modulo $998244353$ is $499122177$. We can compute $499122177^n$ using modular exponentiation.\n\nThe time complexity will be $O(\\log n)$ for matrix exponentiation and $O(\\log n)$ for modular exponentiation. Given $n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, this is efficient enough.\n\nExample trace:\n- $n=2$: $F_2=1$. Probability $= 1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n- $n=3$: $F_3=2$. Probability $= 2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n- $n=5$: $F_5=5$. Probability $= 5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. Matches example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo constant\nMOD = 998244353\n\n# Function to multiply two 2x2 matrices\ndef mat_mul(A, B, mod):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = (A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]) % mod\n    C[0][1] = (A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]) % mod\n    C[1][0] = (A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]) % mod\n    C[1][1] = (A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]) % mod\n    return C\n\n# Function to compute matrix power A^n\ndef mat_pow(A, n, mod):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mul(res, base, mod)\n        base = mat_mul(base, base, mod)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute (base^exp) % mod\ndef mod_pow(base, exp, mod):\n    res = 1\n    base %= mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem\ndef mod_inv(n, mod):\n    return mod_pow(n, mod - 2, mod)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Fibonacci sequence: F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n    # The number of ways to partition [1, n] into segments of odd length is F_n.\n    # We use matrix exponentiation to calculate F_n.\n    # M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    # M^k = [[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]]\n    # To get F_n, we compute M^n and take the element at (0,1) (or (1,0)).\n\n    if n == 0:\n        # Constraint 1 <= n, so this case is not strictly necessary for competitive programming.\n        # However, if n=0, the answer is 1 (empty set of towns 1..n to cover, empty set of towers).\n        # F_0=0, so F_0 * (1/2)^0 = 0, which is incorrect for n=0.\n        # But this problem is for n >= 1.\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\") # This line would not be reached for valid inputs.\n        return\n\n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    Tn = mat_pow(T, n, MOD)\n    Fn = Tn[0][1]  # F_n is the (0,1) element of M^n\n\n    # Compute (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    inv_2 = mod_inv(2, MOD)\n    inv_2_pow_n = mod_pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n\n    # Result is (F_n * (1/2)^n) % MOD\n    ans = (Fn * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    sys.stdout.write(str(ans) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
