He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the String Construction Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  It's about this string construction process, and I need to figure out if a given string *could* have been made that way.  Let's break it down...\n\nFirst, I need to understand the process.  It looks like this:  A starts with some number of lowercase 'a's, at least one, so something like \"aaa...\". Then B appends some number of 'b's to the end, again, at least one, so now it's \"aaa...bbb...\". Finally, C appends some number of 'c's to the end.  The critical condition here is that the number of 'c's added has to be *exactly* the same as either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both).\n\nSo, in the end, the string will look like \"aaa...bbb...ccc...\" where the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nAlright, let's analyze the properties of a valid string `S`. The order of the characters has to be strict: 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. There can't be any 'b' before an 'a', or any 'c' before an 'a' or 'b', and no 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', or no 'b' after a 'c'.  Also, each of these characters must appear at least once (i.e., `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, `count_c >= 1`).\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to translate this into an algorithm.  I can probably do this by iterating through the string `S`. I can locate the positions where the characters change. The index of the last `a`, the last `b`, and the last `c`. Let's define the counts from the input string `S`.\n",
