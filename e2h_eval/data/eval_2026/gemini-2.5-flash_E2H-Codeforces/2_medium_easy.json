Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this 'X' pattern problem.** My initial thought is, I need a Python script to validate if a character grid forms a specific 'X' shape. The rules are pretty straightforward: the diagonals must be identical, and all the non-diagonal cells must share the same, different character.\n\nFirst, I'll grab the input `n` which is the grid's dimension and it's always an odd number. Next, I'll read the grid into a 2D list. Now, here's where it gets interesting: I'll initialize two variables. One to hold the expected diagonal character (`diag_char`) and the other for the expected non-diagonal character (`non_diag_char`).\n\nEfficiency is key, so I'll grab my initial characters from specific guaranteed positions. `paper[0][0]` gets me that main diagonal character, and `paper[0][1]` gets me that sweet non-diagonal one, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 3. A crucial step: I need to quickly determine if `diag_char` and `non_diag_char` are different *right away*. If they are the same, it is not an 'X', and it's a quick exit.\n\nNow, for the validation, I'll iterate through the grid. For each cell, I'll determine if it's on a diagonal using `row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`. If it's on a diagonal, the character *must* match `diag_char`. If not on a diagonal, it *must* match `non_diag_char`. I'll set a flag initially `is_x = True`, that only changes to `False` if any character mismatch is found. I will also make the nested loop `break` if it does, as there's no need to continue checking once it's proven false.\n\nThe core of the logic is in that efficient iteration and these checks. If I reach the end of the iterations and `is_x` is still `True`, then I'll print \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThe crucial part is identifying the diagonals and ensuring the characters adhere to the given constraints. The examples solidify the logic. The time complexity is O(N^2), since I'm essentially traversing the matrix once. The input size is `n < 300`, so runtime is not a concern. The space complexity is also O(N^2) to hold the matrix, and the memory usage is within reason. And remember to use `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for potentially faster I/O. Looks robust and ready to go.\n",
