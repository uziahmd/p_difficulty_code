The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tricky Tree Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and need to build a Python script. It seems pretty straightforward on the surface - take inputs `n`, `k`, edges, and spit out `k` district numbers to remove.  But let's dive into what this actually *means* and how to tackle it.\n\nFirst, I see the graph is a tree.  Each district has a single path to any other district. Perfect, trees are a bit easier to handle than general graphs.  Then there's the fan count.  Contestant `i` brings `2^i` fans.  That's important. Exponential growth!\n\nThe core constraint: removing `k` districts, leaving a connected subgraph of `n-k` districts.  Since it's a tree, *any* connected subgraph is just another tree (or a single node), so no surprises there.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the *remaining* fans. Hold on, the total fans are constant, right? So maximizing the remaining fans is the same as *minimizing* the fans of the removed districts! Clever. Let's stick with that minimization angle, it might be easier to think about.\n\nSo now, I need to figure out how to pick `k` districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a tree and the total fan count of the removed districts is the *smallest* possible.  I want to keep districts with the *largest* `i` values, and remove the ones with the smallest ones to minimize the loss.\n\nThis screams \"greedy\" approach, but it might get tricky.  The largest fan counts are `2^n`, `2^(n-1)`, etc.  Seems like I should try to keep districts `n`, then `n-1`, and so on, *if* they maintain the connected subgraph property.  But can I just pick them in order?\n\nI need to explore a greedy strategy to see how to proceed.  I will have to check if adding a district keeps the graph connected. That is the constraint I have to work around. The core idea is to find the minimum cut set to remove the minimum number of fans. I'll need to explore some graph algorithms, starting with depth-first search or breadth-first search.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected subgraph (a subtree) and maximize the total number of fans. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`. Since `2^i` grows exponentially, `2^n` is much larger than `2^(n-1)`, and `2^(n-1)` is much larger than `2^(n-2)`, etc. This means that to maximize the sum of fans, we should always prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. Specifically, if we have two sets of districts `S1` and `S2` that both form connected subgraphs of size `m`, and the largest index in `S1` is greater than the largest index in `S2`, then `sum(2^i for i in S1)` will almost certainly be greater than `sum(2^i for i in S2)`. This strong dominance implies a greedy strategy based on district indices.\n\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. The optimal strategy is to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest possible indices, such that they form a connected component.\nThis means we should try to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on. We can formalize this by performing a traversal starting from the largest index node that we *must* include.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `n-k` districts.\nThe district `n` has the largest fan count `2^n`. It is always optimal to keep district `n` if we can form a connected component of size `n-k` including it. In fact, due to the exponential weights, we *must* include district `n` unless `n` is one of the `k` smallest-indexed nodes in the optimal subtree. But we are trying to maximize the sum, so we always want to keep `n`.\n\nLet's fix district `n` as one of the `n-k` chosen districts. We then need to choose `n-k-1` more districts such that they, along with `n`, form a connected component, and their indices are as large as possible. This suggests a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from district `n`, prioritizing neighbors with larger indices.\n\nHowever, the problem is about removing `k` nodes, which is equivalent to keeping `n-k` nodes. Minimizing the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes is equivalent to maximizing the sum for kept nodes.\nThe chosen `n-k` nodes must form a connected subgraph. This means they must form a subtree of the original tree.\n\nThe greedy strategy is:\n1. Initialize an empty set `kept_nodes` and `removed_nodes`.\n2. Iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n3. If we have already selected `n-k` nodes, stop.\n4. If district `i` is not yet removed:\n   Try to add `i` to `kept_nodes`. If `len(kept_nodes) < n-k`, we can potentially add `i`.\n   The crucial insight is that we want to keep the `n-k` largest indices that form a connected component.\n   This can be achieved by finding the \"root\" of the desired subtree.\n   If we pick a district `r` as the \"root\" of our desired subtree, we can then perform a traversal (BFS/DFS) starting from `r` and greedily add nodes with largest possible indices until we have `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's rephrase: we want to find a connected component of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that contains the largest possible indices.\nThe node `n` is always the most valuable. We must include it.\nThen `n-1`, then `n-2`, etc.\nThis implies we should perform a traversal (like BFS) starting from node `n`, and explore nodes in decreasing order of their indices.\n\nThe approach:\n1.  Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n2.  Initialize a set `kept_nodes` with `n`.\n3.  Initialize a min-priority queue `pq` to store nodes to be explored. Add `n` to `pq`.\n4.  Initialize a set `visited` to keep track of nodes added to `kept_nodes` or currently in `pq`. Add `n` to `visited`.\n5.  While `len(kept_nodes) < n-k`:\n    a. Extract the node `u` with the largest index from `pq`. (Since `pq` is a min-priority queue, we store `-index` to get max index).\n    b. Add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\n    c. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i. If `v` has not been `visited`:\n           Add `v` to `pq` (as `-v`).\n           Add `v` to `visited`.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we always pick the available node with the highest index that is adjacent to our current connected component. This is optimal because `2^i` dominates `sum(2^j for j < i)`.\n\nAfter running this process, `kept_nodes` will contain the `n-k` districts with the largest possible sum of fans that form a connected component.\nThe remaining `k` districts are the ones to be removed.\nWe can find these by iterating from `1` to `n` and checking if a district is in `kept_nodes`. If not, add it to `removed_nodes`.\nFinally, print the `removed_nodes` in increasing order.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\n1. `kept_nodes = {}`, `pq = []`, `visited = {}`\n2. Add `n=6` to `kept_nodes`, `pq` (as `-6`), `visited`.\n   `kept_nodes = {6}`, `pq = [-6]`, `visited = {6}`.\n   `len(kept_nodes) = 1`. Need `3` nodes.\n3. Loop: `len(kept_nodes) = 1 < 3`.\n   a. Pop max from `pq`: `u = 6`. (This step is slightly off in my description. `u` should be the largest index *available* in `pq`. If `u` is already in `kept_nodes` we skip. Let's refine: `pq` stores candidates *not yet in kept_nodes*).\n   Let's refine the PQ usage:\n   `kept_nodes = {}`, `pq = []`, `visited = {}`\n   Add `n` to `kept_nodes`, `visited`.\n   For each neighbor `v` of `n`: if `v` not `visited`, add `v` to `pq` (as `-v`), add `v` to `visited`.\n   `kept_nodes = {6}`.\n   Neighbors of 6: 2, 5.\n   `pq = [-5, -2]`, `visited = {6, 5, 2}`.\n   `len(kept_nodes) = 1`. Need `3` nodes.\n\n4. Loop: `len(kept_nodes) = 1 < 3`.\n   a. Pop max from `pq`: `u = 5`.\n   b. Add `u=5` to `kept_nodes`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5}`.\n   c. Neighbors of `u=5`: `6`. `6` is `visited`. No new neighbors to add to `pq`.\n   `pq = [-2]`.\n   `len(kept_nodes) = 2`. Need `3` nodes.\n\n5. Loop: `len(kept_nodes) = 2 < 3`.\n   a. Pop max from `pq`: `u = 2`.\n   b. Add `u=2` to `kept_nodes`. `kept_nodes = {6, 5, 2}`.\n   c. Neighbors of `u=2`: `1, 6, 4, 3`.\n      `6` is `visited`.\n      `1` not `visited`: add `1` to `pq` (as `-1`), `visited` (`{6,5,2,1}`).\n      `4` not `visited`: add `4` to `pq` (as `-4`), `visited` (`{6,5,2,1,4}`).\n      `3` not `visited`: add `3` to `pq` (as `-3`), `visited` (`{6,5,2,1,4,3}`).\n   `pq = [-4, -3, -1]`. (Order depends on PQ implementation, but for max, it will be `-1` then `-3` then `-4`).\n   `len(kept_nodes) = 3`. Stop.\n\nFinal `kept_nodes = {2, 5, 6}`.\nRemoved nodes: Iterate from 1 to 6.\n1 not in `kept_nodes` -> remove 1.\n2 in `kept_nodes`.\n3 not in `kept_nodes` -> remove 3.\n4 not in `kept_nodes` -> remove 4.\n5 in `kept_nodes`.\n6 in `kept_nodes`.\nRemoved: `[1, 3, 4]`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis greedy approach works because `2^i` is so dominant. We always want to pick the largest possible index `i` that extends our current connected component. A priority queue naturally handles this by always providing the highest indexed available neighbor.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: O(N+M) = O(N) since M=N-1 for a tree.\n*   BFS/PQ part: Each node is added to `kept_nodes` once. Each node is added to `pq` at most once. Each edge is traversed at most twice.\n    *   `heapq` operations (push, pop) take O(log N). There are O(N) such operations.\n    *   Total time for BFS/PQ: O(N log N).\n*   Finding removed nodes: O(N) to iterate and check `kept_nodes` (using a set for O(1) average lookup).\n*   Sorting removed nodes: O(k log k). Max `k` is `N-1`, so O(N log N).\n\nOverall time complexity: O(N log N).\nSpace complexity: O(N) for adjacency list, `kept_nodes` set, `visited` set, and `pq`.\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, O(N log N) is efficient enough (`10^6 * log(10^6)` is roughly `10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7` operations).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # We want to keep n-k nodes.\n    # The strategy is to start from node 'n' (highest fan count)\n    # and greedily expand to neighbors with the highest possible indices.\n\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    # Min-priority queue to store candidates to explore.\n    # We store -node_id to simulate a max-priority queue (largest node_id first).\n    pq = [] \n    \n    # Start with node 'n'\n    kept_nodes.add(n)\n    \n    # Add neighbors of 'n' to the priority queue\n    # These are candidates to be added next, if we need more nodes\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, -neighbor) # Add as negative for max-heap behavior\n            kept_nodes.add(neighbor) # Mark as visited/considered to avoid duplicates in PQ\n\n    # Keep expanding until we have n-k nodes\n    # The 'kept_nodes' set effectively acts as 'visited' for the BFS\n    while len(kept_nodes) < n - k and pq:\n        current_node_neg = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        current_node = -current_node_neg\n        \n        # This node is already added to kept_nodes when it was pushed to PQ\n        # We just process its neighbors\n        \n        # Add neighbors of current_node to the priority queue\n        for neighbor in adj[current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in kept_nodes:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, -neighbor)\n                kept_nodes.add(neighbor) # Mark as visited/considered\n\n    # Collect the nodes to be removed\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # The problem asks for k removed nodes.\n    # If len(kept_nodes) < n - k, it means pq became empty before we collected n-k nodes.\n    # This scenario should not happen if the graph is connected and n-k >= 1.\n    # We must have collected exactly n-k nodes.\n    # The number of nodes to remove is k.\n    # If the above loop finishes, len(kept_nodes) will be exactly n-k.\n    # So len(removed_nodes) will be exactly k.\n\n    print(*(sorted(removed_nodes)))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
