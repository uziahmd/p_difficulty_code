            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task at hand is to determine the minimum number of additional tiles required to transform an initial hand of three tiles into a valid *mentsu*, which is either a *koutsu* (three identical tiles) or a *shuntsu* (three consecutive tiles of the same suit).  My first instinct is to realize that we can check for solutions with zero, one, or two draws. The reasoning is that with two draws, we'll always be able to form a *koutsu* with one of the initial tiles and the two draws, and so it can't possibly need *more* than two draws.  So the strategy unfolds: start by checking if a *mentsu* can be formed with the initial three tiles (zero draws).  If not, try with one additional tile, and if that doesn't work, the answer must be two.\n\n**Data Structuring and Representation**\n\nTo facilitate this analysis, I'm going to represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. This way, a '1m' becomes `(1, 'm')`, a '9s' is `(9, 's')`, and so on. Let's call the initial hand `T = [t1, t2, t3]`.  This structured format will be invaluable when checking for *koutsu* and *shuntsu*.\n\n**Zero Draw Analysis**\n\nFor zero draws, the question is simple: can we form a *mentsu* directly using `t1, t2, t3`?\n\n*   **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical?  `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu Check:** Are the three tiles of the same suit *and* do their numbers form a sequence?  Sort them (by suit, then number) and verify that the numbers are consecutive: `n2 == n1 + 1 and n3 == n2 + 1`.\n\nIf either of these checks passes, the answer is zero draws.\n\n**One Draw Analysis**\n\nIf the zero-draw check fails, it's time to consider one draw. Here, the core concept is, with the drawn tile (`t_new`), can we form a *mentsu* by combining `t_new` with two of the original tiles? This is equivalent to checking if adding `t_new` to the initial tiles will create a *mentsu*.  We need to look at every possible combination of two tiles from the initial hand, and see if drawing a single tile can create a valid *koutsu* or *shuntsu* with those two and the new tile.\n\nLet's look at pairs `(ti, tj)` for all pairs in our initial set of tiles `T`.\n\n*   **Koutsu Potential:** If `ti == tj`, draw `ti`. This makes a *koutsu*: `[ti, ti, ti]`.\n*   **Shuntsu Potential:** If `ti` and `tj` are of the same suit, we check if we are close to a *shuntsu*:\n    *   Sort the numbers: `n_min`, `n_max`. If they're consecutive (`n_max == n_min + 1`), drawing either `(n_min - 1, suit)` or `(n_max + 1, suit)` would complete a shuntsu.\n    *   If the numbers are two apart (`n_max == n_min + 2`), we need `(n_min + 1, suit)`.\n\nIf *any* of the conditions above are met for any pair of the initial tiles `(ti, tj)`, one draw is sufficient.\n\n**Two Draw Scenario**\n\nIf both the zero-draw and one-draw checks fail, we're guaranteed to need two draws. This is because, as previously mentioned, drawing two tiles allows us to form a *koutsu* with at least one of the original tiles.\n\n**Implementation Structure**\n\nTo translate this approach into code, I'll need these functions:\n\n1.  `parse_tile(s)`:  Takes a string like '1m' and converts it into a `Tile` object.\n2.  `check_0_draws(tiles)`:  Takes a list of `Tile` objects and checks if a *mentsu* can be formed without any draws.\n3.  `check_1_draw(tiles)`: Takes a list of `Tile` objects and checks if a *mentsu* can be formed with *one* additional draw.\n4.  `solve()`: Handles the input, calls the `check` functions, and outputs the result.\n\nThe `Tile` will be",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three consecutive numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any tiles, including those already in her hand.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, which implies checking for 0 draws first, then 1 draw, and finally 2 draws. The maximum answer can be 2, because with 2 draws, she will have 5 tiles. She can always form a mentsu by drawing two tiles that complete a koutsu with one of her existing tiles (e.g., if she has '1m', she can draw two more '1m's to form [1m, 1m, 1m]).\n\nLet's represent each tile as a `(number, suit)` pair for easier processing. For example, '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nThe solution proceeds in steps:\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Convert the three input strings into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws:** Determine if a mentsu can be formed with the initial three tiles.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Check if all three tiles are identical (e.g., `[1m, 1m, 1m]`).\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Check if all three tiles are of the same suit and their numbers are consecutive (e.g., `[1m, 2m, 3m]`). To efficiently check for shuntsu, it's helpful to sort the tiles first by suit, then by number.\n    If a mentsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw:** If no mentsu is found with 0 draws, determine if a mentsu can be formed by drawing one additional tile.\n    After drawing one tile (`t_new`), Tokitsukaze will have four tiles: `[t1, t2, t3, t_new]`. A mentsu needs three tiles. This means we are looking for a mentsu formed by `t_new` and two of the original tiles (`t1, t2, t3`).\n    We iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the original hand: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, and `(t2, t3)`. For each pair `(A, B)`:\n    *   **Koutsu potential:** If `A` and `B` are identical (`A == B`), we can draw a third tile identical to `A` (i.e., `t_new = A`) to form a koutsu `[A, A, A]`.\n    *   **Shuntsu potential:** If `A` and `B` are of the same suit:\n        *   If their numbers are consecutive (e.g., `[2m, 3m]`), we can draw a tile to complete the sequence. This could be `(n_min - 1, suit)` (e.g., `1m` for `[2m, 3m]`) or `(n_max + 1, suit)` (e.g., `4m` for `[2m, 3m]`). The existence of *any* such tile is sufficient.\n        *   If their numbers differ by 2 (e.g., `[2m, 4m]`), we can draw the middle tile `(n_min + 1, suit)` (e.g., `3m` for `[2m, 4m]`) to form a shuntsu.\n    If any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n4.  **Default to 2 Draws:** If neither 0 draws nor 1 draw results in a mentsu, the answer must be 2. As discussed, it's always possible to form a mentsu with two draws (e.g., by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles to form a koutsu).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (3p 9m 2p):**\n1.  **Parse:** `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`.\n    Sort for convenience: `[(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]`.\n2.  **Check 0 Draws:**\n    *   Koutsu: `(9,'m')`, `(2,'p')`, `(3,'p')` are not all identical. False.\n    *   Shuntsu: Suits are not all the same (`'m'` vs `'p'`). False.\n    Result: No mentsu with 0 draws.\n3.  **Check 1 Draw:** Consider pairs from `[(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]`:\n    *   Pair `((9, 'm'), (2, 'p'))`: Tiles are different, suits are different. No mentsu potential.\n    *   Pair `((9, 'm'), (3, 'p'))`: Tiles are different, suits are different. No mentsu potential.\n    *   Pair `((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'))`:\n        *   Koutsu potential: `(2,'p')` is not equal to `(3,'p')`. False.\n        *   Shuntsu potential: Suits are the same (`'p'`). Numbers are 2 and 3. They are consecutive (`3 == 2 + 1`). This means we can draw `(1, 'p')` or `(4, 'p')` to form a shuntsu (`[1p, 2p, 3p]` or `[2p, 3p, 4p]`). True.\n    Result: A mentsu can be formed with 1 draw. The answer is 1.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Define a Tile namedtuple for better readability and structure\nTile = collections.namedtuple('Tile', ['num', 'suit'])\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string (e.g., '1s') into a Tile object.\"\"\"\n    return Tile(int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef check_0_draws(tiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a mentsu can be formed with the current three tiles.\n    Tiles are assumed to be sorted by suit, then number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Koutsu check: all three tiles are identical\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n\n    # Shuntsu check: all three tiles are of the same suit and consecutive numbers\n    if tiles[0].suit == tiles[1].suit and tiles[1].suit == tiles[2].suit:\n        if tiles[1].num == tiles[0].num + 1 and tiles[2].num == tiles[1].num + 1:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef check_1_draw(tiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a mentsu can be formed by drawing one additional tile.\n    This means we need to find if any pair of the current tiles can be\n    extended to a mentsu with one drawn tile.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand\n    # (t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)\n    pairs = [(tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])]\n\n    for t_a, t_b in pairs:\n        # Koutsu potential: if two tiles are identical, drawing a third makes a koutsu\n        if t_a == t_b:\n            return True\n        \n        # Shuntsu potential: if two tiles can form a sequence with one drawn tile\n        if t_a.suit == t_b.suit:\n            n_a, n_b = t_a.num, t_b.num\n            n_min, n_max = min(n_a, n_b), max(n_a, n_b)\n\n            # Case 1: n_min, (n_min+1), n_max (e.g., 2m, 4m -> draw 3m)\n            # This forms a sequence with a missing middle tile.\n            if n_max == n_min + 2:\n                return True\n            \n            # Case 2: (n_min-1), n_min, n_max OR n_min, n_max, (n_max+1)\n            # (e.g., 2m, 3m -> draw 1m or 4m)\n            # This forms a sequence with a missing tile at either end.\n            # We don't need to check boundary conditions (num > 0 or num < 10)\n            # because the problem states \"She can draw any tiles she wants\".\n            if n_max == n_min + 1:\n                return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Main function to read input, process, and print the result.\"\"\"\n    s = input().split()\n    tiles = [parse_tile(t_str) for t_str in s]\n\n    # Sort tiles to simplify shuntsu checks in check_0_draws.\n    # Sorting by suit then number ensures tiles of the same suit are grouped\n    # and ordered numerically.\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda t: (t.suit, t.num))\n\n    # Check for 0 draws\n    if check_0_draws(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    if check_1_draw(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # If neither 0 nor 1 draw works, then 2 draws are always sufficient.\n    print(2)\n\n# Call the solver function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
