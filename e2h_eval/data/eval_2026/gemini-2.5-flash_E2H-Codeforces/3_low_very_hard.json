Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* radius, `d`, a lantern needs to have to light up an entire street of length `l`.  We have `n` lanterns positioned at coordinates `a_i` along the street. The lanterns light segments of `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nMy first thought is that the order of the lanterns matters.  It makes sense to sort the lantern positions, so let's call the sorted array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.  That'll make it easier to analyze the gaps.\n\nI need to make sure the entire street, from 0 to `l`, is covered. That means there are three potentially critical areas to consider: the very start of the street, the very end, and any gaps *between* lanterns.\n\nTo cover the start, `a_1 - d` has to be less than or equal to 0, so that segment is covered. To cover the end of the street, `a_n + d` must be greater than or equal to `l`. That gives us `d >= a_1` and `d >= l - a_n`.\n\nNow, the tricky part is the gaps. If I have two lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the segment `[a_i, a_{i+1}]` must be lit. The segments covered by these lanterns are `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` and `[a_{i+1} - d, a_{i+1} + d]`.  These two coverage segments have to overlap.  That means the right end of the first has to be *at least* as far as the left end of the second.  Mathematically, that means `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.  Solving that, I get `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  So for the gaps between lanterns, `d` needs to be at least half the distance between them.\n\nSo, in summary, I have a few requirements for my minimum `d`:\n*   `d >= a_1` (to cover the start)\n*   `d >= l - a_n` (to cover the end)\n*   `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` for all adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (to cover gaps)\n\nThe final answer is just the maximum of all those values of `d`.\n\nThinking through the example, if `n = 2`, `l = 5`, and `a = [2, 5]`, I'd sort `a` which is already sorted.\n*   The start gives us `d >= 2`\n*   The end gives us `d >= 5 - 5 = 0`\n*   The gap between `2` and `5` means `d >= (5 - 2)/2 = 1.5`\n\nSo I choose the maximum, which is `2`.  That makes sense; the first lantern's at 2, so it has to shine back to 0.",
