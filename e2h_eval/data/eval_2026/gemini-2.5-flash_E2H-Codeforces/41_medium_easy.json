            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Zoning Restrictions Again\n\nYou are planning to build housing on a street. There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Zoning Profit Problem - A Greedy Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem where I need to maximize the profit from building houses. We have `n` spots, a maximum height `h`, and `m` zoning restrictions. Each spot can have a height between `0` and `h`, and the profit is simply the square of the height. The restrictions are key - they limit the maximum height within certain ranges.\n\nGiven those small constraints, I immediately think of a polynomial solution, probably one that iterates directly. The goal is to maximize the sum of squares, and since the square function is monotonically increasing, it's clear I should try to make each house as tall as possible.\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out the maximum allowable height for each spot considering those restrictions. I start by setting the maximum allowable height of all the houses to h. Then, for each restriction, I reduce the max height of the spots in the constrained range to that range's `x` value. This way, the constraints get applied correctly. It's essentially a local minimum height application problem. After processing all the restrictions, I have an array where `max_allowed_height[j]` represents the height the house at spot `j` can be without violating any restriction. Since `a_j^2` grows as `a_j` grows, setting `a_j` to `max_allowed_height[j]` maximizes the profit. I just square those values and sum them up.\n\nThe time complexity is `O(m*n)`, with space `O(n)`. This should be efficient enough, given the small constraints. The key is in the interpretation: each restriction on a range affects *all* the spots in that range, and that's how to efficiently solve it using a greedy approach. It's really just reading the problem, interpreting the constraints, and coming to a local maxima in this very specific configuration.\n",
