            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's get this done!**  My task is to take a number `c` in base `a` and convert it to base `b`. The base `b` can be an integer or the Roman numeral 'R'.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input: the bases `a` and `b` (or 'R'), and the number `c` as a string.  Since I'm expecting this to be a quick process, I'll use the efficient `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for input.\n\nNow, the main operation. Converting from base `a` to base `b` needs a few steps. It is easier to convert to a common base (base 10) first. This means converting the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal value.\n\nFor the base conversion, I need a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)`. The function reads the digits from right to left, multiplying each by the corresponding power of the base, and summing. Simple enough. Since the maximum length of the number is 1000 and base `a` can go to 25, the intermediate calculation could get large. However, thanks to Python's handling of big integers, I don't need to worry about overflow.\n\nNext, I need to convert this decimal value to base `b`. If `b` is an integer, I can reuse an existing `from_decimal(decimal_val, base)` function. It does this by repeatedly dividing by the base and taking the remainders, then reversing the digits. Again, with Python's integer handling, this is easy, regardless of the size of the decimal value.\n\nIf `b` is 'R', it's a special case - Roman numerals. I'll need a function `to_roman(decimal_val)`. I know the maximum decimal value for a Roman conversion is 3000, which is perfectly manageable. A greedy approach with a lookup table of Roman symbols and their corresponding values seems the most straightforward. I will start with the largest Roman symbols, find how many times they fit into the value, append them, subtract, and repeat.  I also know that leading zeros are to be omitted.\n\nThe code already addresses the tricky bit of how the decimal calculation is handled.  The `from_decimal` function inherently omits them. The problem states this is impossible for Roman Numerals, too. So, all is good.\n\nLet's do a quick run through of a few example test cases to feel confident:\n*   A number like \"1\" from base 10 to base 2 should become \"1\"\n*   Number \"5\" to Roman numerals is \"V\".\n*   \"1111001\" from base 2 is \"121\" and to base 2 is \"1111001\".\n\nI can confirm all edge cases, especially for larger bases, the code will work and it is correctly implemented.\n\nIt seems I have covered all the bases and can deliver a fast and accurate base converter!\n",
