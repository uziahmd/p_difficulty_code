Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.**\n\nMy goal is to find the cheapest pair of non-overlapping \"vouchers\" whose durations add up to a specific target value, `x`.  Each voucher has a start day, end day, and cost.  I need to find the pair with the *lowest* combined cost. If I can't find such a pair, I should report -1.\n\nFirst off, the naive approach of checking every possible pair of vouchers is way too slow, especially with up to 200,000 vouchers!  So, I need something smarter.\n\nI realized the critical constraint is the non-intersection part: the two vouchers must *not* overlap.  That means one has to end before the other begins. I decided to fix one voucher and then look for a second.\n\nDuration is just end - start + 1.  So if duration_i + duration_j equals `x`, the solution might exist.  To tackle this efficiently, I can iterate through vouchers *sorted by start day*, thinking about it as a sweep-line algorithm.\n\nThe main idea became to iterate through each possible end day in the sweep-line and keep track of the minimum cost voucher having that duration. Then I check for a complementary voucher that could pair up and give me the target value for duration `x`, but that has to finish earlier. If `d_prev` is `x - d_curr`, the sum of durations will satisfy the equation.\n\nSpecifically, I'll use a `vouchers_by_start_day` list, storing vouchers that start at the same time, and also `vouchers_ending_on_day` for end days, allowing me to update `min_cost_for_duration` efficiently in the sweep line. The key data structure will be an array `min_cost_for_duration`, which tracks the minimum cost of a voucher *that ended by a particular day and had a specific duration*.\n\nThe sweep-line logic processes vouchers that *start* on the current day, checking if they can complete a valid pair using earlier vouchers. Then I update `min_cost_for_duration` with vouchers that *end* on the current day to be considered by future vouchers.\n\nDuring iteration, for all possible end days, I iterate and update my running minimum cost solution. If no valid pair is found, the final answer remains -1. The algorithm works by considering end points and checking all the preceding possible valid vouchers. This looks like a solid O(N) or O(N log N) solution, which should be fast enough.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping vouchers `i` and `j` such that the sum of their durations `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1)` is exactly `x`, and their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1` be the duration of voucher `k`. We need `d_i + d_j = x`.\nTwo vouchers `i` and `j` don't intersect if `ri < lj` or `rj < li`.\n\nThis problem can be efficiently solved using a sweep-line algorithm. The maximum coordinate for `l` and `r` is `2 * 10^5`, so we can sweep through days from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1.  **Data Structures for Vouchers**:\n    *   Create `vouchers_by_start_day`: a list of lists, where `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` stores all vouchers that start on `day`. Each element in the inner list will be a tuple `(r, cost, duration)`.\n    *   Create `vouchers_ending_on_day`: a list of lists, where `vouchers_ending_on_day[day]` stores all vouchers that end on `day`. Each element in the inner list will be a tuple `(cost, duration)` (we don't need `l` here).\n    *   Initialize these lists for days from 1 to `MAX_DAY_COORD` (which is `2 * 10^5`).\n\n2.  **Initialize Minimum Cost Tracking**:\n    *   `min_total_cost = float('inf')`: This will store the minimum total cost found so far.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: an array of size `MAX_DAY_COORD + 1`, initialized with `float('inf')`. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended* by the current sweep-line day.\n\n3.  **Sweep-line Algorithm**:\n    Iterate `current_day` from `1` to `MAX_DAY_COORD`:\n\n    *   **Step 1: Process Vouchers Starting on `current_day`**:\n        For each voucher `(r_curr, c_curr, d_curr)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n        This voucher `v_curr` is a candidate for the *second* voucher in a pair (i.e., `v_curr` starts after another voucher `v_prev` ends).\n        We need to find a `v_prev` with duration `d_prev = x - d_curr`.\n        The non-intersection condition `r_prev < l_curr` is satisfied if `v_prev` ended on or before `current_day - 1`.\n        At this point, `min_cost_for_duration[d_prev]` holds the minimum cost of such a `v_prev`.\n        *   Calculate `d_comp = x - d_curr`.\n        *   If `1 <= d_comp <= MAX_DAY_COORD` (duration must be positive and within bounds) and `min_cost_for_duration[d_comp]` is not `float('inf')`:\n            *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, c_curr + min_cost_for_duration[d_comp])`.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Process Vouchers Ending on `current_day`**:\n        For each voucher `(c_ended, d_ended)` in `vouchers_ending_on_day[current_day]`:\n        These vouchers have just finished. They can now be considered as potential *first* vouchers (`v_prev`) for future `current_day`s (i.e., for `l_curr > current_day`).\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_duration[d_ended] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_ended], c_ended)`. This ensures `min_cost_for_duration` correctly reflects the minimum cost for vouchers of a given duration that have ended *on or before* `current_day`.\n\n4.  **Result**:\n    After the loop finishes, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair was found, so print -1. Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n*   Preprocessing (reading input and populating `vouchers_by_start_day`, `vouchers_ending_on_day`): O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD). Each of the N vouchers is processed once.\n*   Sweep-line loop: The loop runs `MAX_DAY_COORD` times. Inside the loop, processing `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]` and `vouchers_ending_on_day[current_day]` takes time proportional to the number of vouchers on that day. The sum of lengths of all lists in `vouchers_by_start_day` is `N`, and similarly for `vouchers_ending_on_day`.\n*   Total time complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD). Given `N, X, li, ri <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n*   `vouchers_by_start_day`: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD)\n*   `vouchers_ending_on_day`: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD)\n*   `min_cost_for_duration`: O(MAX_DAY_COORD)\n*   Total space complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY_COORD). This is also within limits.\n\nExample walkthrough (from problem description):\n`n=4, x=5`\nVouchers: `(1, 3, 4, d=3)`, `(1, 2, 5, d=2)`, `(5, 6, 1, d=2)`, `(1, 2, 4, d=2)`\n\n`MAX_DAY_COORD = 6` (max `ri` is 6)\n`min_total_cost = inf`\n`min_cost_for_duration = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n\n`vouchers_by_start_day`:\n`1: [(3, 4, 3), (2, 5, 2), (2, 4, 2)]`\n`5: [(6, 1, 2)]`\n\n`vouchers_ending_on_day`:\n`2: [(5, 2), (4, 2)]`\n`3: [(4, 3)]`\n`6: [(1, 2)]`\n\n**Loop `current_day` from `1` to `6`:**\n\n*   **`current_day = 1`**:\n    *   Start: Vouchers `(1,3,4)`, `(1,2,5)`, `(1,2,4)`. `d_comp` calculated, but `min_cost_for_duration` is all `inf`.
