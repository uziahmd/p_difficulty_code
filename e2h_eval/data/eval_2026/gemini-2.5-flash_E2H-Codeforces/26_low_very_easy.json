Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Triangle Counting Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm facing a problem: count the number of non-degenerate integer-sided triangles, where the side lengths are constrained within specific ranges.  Essentially, I need to find triplets (x, y, z) that satisfy the triangle inequality, with the sides ordered and bounded: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nThe core constraint is the triangle inequality.  For a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, given the ordering (x <= y <= z), I recognize that `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` will always hold true.  Therefore, I'm only concerned with `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was to brute-force this. I could just iterate through all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` within their ranges.  But the ranges are potentially quite large (up to 500,000 for each). This would lead to a cubic time complexity, quickly hitting a computational wall.  Clearly, brute force is out of the question.\n\nI need to optimize.  The crucial insight here is to fix `x` and `y` and then consider the valid range for `z`.  Given `x` and `y`, `z` must be less than `x + y`, and also within the interval `[C, D]`.  This translates to `z` being in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  This makes the problem significantly more tractable. I just need to iterate through x and y.\n\nSo the strategy becomes: for each valid pair `(x, y)`, calculate the number of permissible values of `z` within the calculated bounds.  I'll then sum up the results across all valid pairs. This reduces the time complexity and should make the calculation feasible. This is the way to go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, these are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x, y, z` being positive integers (since `A >= 1`):\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `z >= y >= x` and `z > 0`. Specifically, `y + z >= y + y >= x + x > x`.\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x > 0`. Specifically, `x + z >= x + y > y`.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`. A direct triple loop over `x`, `y`, `z` would be too slow (`O(D^3)`). A double loop over `x, y` and then counting `z` values would be `O(D^2)`, which is `(5*10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^11`, also too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's iterate over `x` and `y` and count valid `z` values.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z < x + y` (from triangle inequality)\n\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x, y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The range for `S` is `A + B <= S <= B + C`.\nThe condition `z < S` means `z <= S - 1`.\nSo, for fixed `x` and `y`, the number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nWe can iterate `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `S = x + y` will range from `A + B` to `B + C`.\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nLet's analyze the number of valid `z` values for a given sum `S = x + y`:\nThe number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `count_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nNotice that `count_z(S)` is a non-decreasing function of `S`.\n- If `S - 1 < C`, then `min(D, S - 1) < C`, so `count_z(S) = 0`. This happens when `S <= C`.\n- If `C <= S - 1 <= D`, then `min(D, S - 1) = S - 1`, so `count_z(S) = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`. This happens when `C < S <= D + 1`.\n- If `S - 1 > D`, then `min(D, S - 1) = D`, so `count_z(S) = D - C + 1`. This happens when `S > D + 1`.\n\nSo, `count_z(S)` can be written as:\n- `0` if `S <= C`\n- `S - C` if `C < S <= D + 1`\n- `D - C + 1` if `S > D + 1`\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} count_z(x + y)`.\nLet `f[S]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\nWe can compute `f[S]` efficiently.\nThe range of `S` is `[A+B, B+C]`.\nWe can use an array (or frequency map) for `f[S]`.\nFor each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  For each `y` from `B` to `C`:\n    `f[x + y] += 1`\nThis is still `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be `O(D^2)`.\nThis is too slow.\n\nInstead, let's use a technique similar to prefix sums or difference arrays.\nFor a fixed `x`, as `y` goes from `B` to `C`, `x + y` goes from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nThis means for a fixed `x`, we are adding 1 to `f[S]` for `S` in the range `[x+B, x+C]`.\nWe can use a difference array `diff` to compute `f[S]`.\nInitialize `diff` array of size `B+C+1` to all zeros.\nFor each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `diff[x + B] += 1`\n  `diff[x + C + 1] -= 1`\nAfter iterating through all `x`, compute `f[S]` by taking prefix sums of `diff`:\n`f[S] = f[S-1] + diff[S]` for `S` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nThis takes `O(B-A+1)` for `diff` array updates and `O(B+C)` for prefix sums.\nTotal time complexity for computing `f[S]` is `O(D)`.\n\nAfter computing all `f[S]` values, the total count of triangles is:\n`TotalTriangles = sum_{S=A+B to B+C} f[S] * count_z(S)`\nThis sum also takes `O(D)` time.\n\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `10^6`. So the `f` and `diff` arrays need to be of this size.\nLet `MAX_SUM = B + C`. Since `D <= 5 * 10^5`, `MAX_SUM` can be up to `10^6`.\nLet's use `MAX_VAL = 5 * 10^5`. `MAX_SUM = 2 * MAX_VAL`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `diff = [0] * (D + C + 2)` (or `2*MAX_VAL + 2` to be safe).\n   The maximum sum `x+y` is `B+C`, which can be up to `2*5*10^5 = 10^6`.\n   The maximum value for `z` is `D`, `5*10^5`.\n   The maximum value for `S-1` is `B+C-1`.\n   Let's use `MAX_POSSIBLE_SUM = B + C`.\n   Let `diff = [0] * (MAX_POSSIBLE_SUM + 2)`.\n2. Iterate `x` from `A` to `B`:\n   `diff[x + B] += 1`\n   `diff[x + C + 1] -= 1`\n   This step takes `O(B-A+1)` time.\n3. Initialize `f_s_count = 0` (current count for `f[S]`).\n   Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n4. Iterate `S` from `A + B` to `MAX_POSSIBLE_SUM`:\n   `f_s_count += diff[S]` (This is `f[S]`)\n   Calculate `num_z = 0`.\n   If `S <= C`: `num_z = 0`\n   Else if `S <= D + 1`: `num_z = S - C`\n   Else (`S > D + 1`): `num_z = D - C + 1`\n   `total_triangles += f_s_count * num_z`\n   This step takes `O(MAX_POSSIBLE_SUM)` time.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(B-A+1 + B+C) = O(D)`.\nTotal space complexity: `O(B+C) = O(D)`.\nGiven `D <= 5 * 10^5`, `O(D)` solution is efficient enough. `10^6` operations/memory is fine.\n\nExample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n`MAX_POSSIBLE_SUM = B + C = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n`diff` array of size `5+2 = 7`. `diff = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nx=1:\n  `diff[1+2] += 1` => `diff[3] = 1`\n  `diff[1+3+1] -= 1` => `diff[5] = -1`\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\nx=2:\n  `diff[2+2] += 1` => `diff[4] = 1`\n  `diff[2+3+1] -= 1` => `diff[6] = -1`\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1]`\n\nCalculate `total_triangles`:\n`f_s_count = 0`\n`total_triangles = 0`\n\nS=A+B=3:\n  `f_s_count += diff[3]` => `f_s_count = 0 + 1 = 1`. (`f[3]=1`, (x,y)=(1,2))\n  `S=3`. `C=3`. `S <= C` is true. `num_z = 0`.\n  `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n\nS=4:\n  `f_s_count += diff[4]` => `f_s_count = 1 + 1 = 2`. (`f[4]=2`, (x,y)=(1,3), (2,2))\n  `S=4`. `C=3`. `S <= D+1` (4 <= 4+1) is true. `num_z = S - C = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n  `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n\nS=5:\n  `f_s_count += diff[5]` => `f_s_count = 2 + (-1) = 1`.
