            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Base Conversions**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm going to do. I need to write a Python script for base conversions.  The input will be in two parts: the original base (`a`) and the target base (`b`), and then the number itself (`c`) in base `a`. `a` and `b` are between 2 and 25, or `b` can be 'R' for Roman numerals. I'm going to have to make sure to account for leading zeros in `c`.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the input.  I'll read the first line to get `a` and `b`, and then the second line to get `c`. I'll have to handle `b` being a string 'R'.\n\nNext, I have to convert the input number `c` from base `a` to base 10. I'll define a function, `to_base10(num_str, base)`, for this, taking care to handle the character-to-integer conversion for digits greater than 9 (A=10, B=11, etc.).  I'll need to watch for invalid input digits too.\n\nThen, based on `b`, I need to select the right conversion method.\n\n*   If `b` is an integer, I'll use the function `from_base10(num_int, base)` to convert the base 10 number to the new base.  I'll need to do the digit-to-character conversion for bases greater than 10 within this function as well.\n*   If `b` is 'R', I'll call `to_roman(num_int)` to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nFor `to_base10`, I'll iterate through the input string from right to left, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of the base. I also need to make a helper `digit_to_int` function to map 'A', 'B', etc. to integer values and check for base mismatches.\n\nFor the integer base conversion (`from_base10`), I'll perform repeated division and remainders, collecting the remainders as digits. I'll reverse the digits at the end to get the correct output. I also need an `int_to_digit` function for the reverse mapping of numbers from 10 to 25 to characters A-O.\n\nThat should do it!  I'll need to initialize and test.\n",
    "response": "The problem requires converting a number `c` from an arbitrary base `a` to another base `b`. The input bases `a` and `b` are integers between 2 and 25. A special case is when `b` is 'R', indicating Roman numerals.\n\nThe solution involves three main steps:\n1.  **Parsing Input**: Read `a`, `b_str` (which can be an integer or 'R'), and the number `c_str` in base `a`.\n2.  **Convert `c_str` from base `a` to base 10**: This is a standard conversion. We need a helper function to convert character digits (e.g., 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11) to their integer values.\n3.  **Convert the base 10 number to the target base `b`**:\n    *   If `b_str` is an integer, convert the base 10 number to base `b`. This is another standard conversion, requiring a helper function to convert integer values back to character digits.\n    *   If `b_str` is 'R', convert the base 10 number to its Roman numeral representation. This requires a specific function that handles Roman numeral rules (subtractive principle, specific symbols for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000).\n\n### Step 1: Parsing Input\n\nRead the first line to get `a` and `b_str`. `a` is converted to an integer. `b_str` is kept as a string to check if it's 'R'. Then read `c_str`.\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Base 10\n\nA `digit_to_int` helper function maps character digits ('0'-'9', 'A'-'Z') to their integer values. For example, '0' maps to 0, '9' to 9, 'A' to 10, 'B' to 11, etc.\nThe `to_base10` function takes `num_str` and `base` as input. It iterates through `num_str` from right to left, multiplying each digit's integer value by `base` raised to the appropriate power, and summing these values.\n\n```python\ndef digit_to_int(char_digit):\n    if '0' <= char_digit <= '9':\n        return int(char_digit)\n    else:  # 'A' through 'O' for bases up to 25\n        return ord(char_digit) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef to_base10(num_str, base):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    for char_digit in reversed(num_str):\n        digit_val = digit_to_int(char_digit)\n        decimal_value += digit_val * (base ** power)\n        power += 1\n    return decimal_value\n```\n\n### Step 3: Convert from Base 10\n\n#### Case 3a: `b` is an integer base\n\nAn `int_to_digit` helper function maps integer values (0-24) back to their character representations ('0'-'9', 'A'-'O').\nThe `from_base10_to_base` function takes `num_int` (the base 10 number) and `base` as input. It repeatedly takes the remainder when `num_int` is divided by `base` (which gives the next digit) and updates `num_int` by integer division. The digits are collected in reverse order and then joined to form the final string. Special handling for `num_int == 0` is needed to return \"0\".\n\n```python\ndef int_to_digit(val):\n    if 0 <= val <= 9:\n        return str(val)\n    else:  # 10 through 24\n        return chr(ord('A') + val - 10)\n\ndef from_base10_to_base(num_int, base):\n    if num_int == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    result_digits = []\n    while num_int > 0:\n        remainder = num_int % base\n        result_digits.append(int_to_digit(remainder))\n        num_int //= base\n    \n    return \"\".join(reversed(result_digits))\n```\n\n#### Case 3b: `b` is 'R' (Roman Numerals)\n\nThe `to_roman` function converts a base 10 integer to its Roman numeral representation. It uses a predefined list of (value, symbol) pairs, ordered from largest to smallest. It iterates through this list, appending the symbol as many times as the value fits into the remaining number, then subtracting that amount from the number. This greedy approach works because the list includes both standard (e.g., 1000, M) and subtractive (e.g., 900, CM) forms.\n\n```python\ndef to_roman(num):\n    if num == 0:\n        return \"\" # Problem guarantees non-zero for Roman, but good to handle\n    \n    roman_map = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    \n    result = []\n    for value, symbol in roman_map:\n        while num >= value:\n            result.append(symbol)\n            num -= value\n    return \"\".join(result)\n```\n\n### Main Logic\n\n1.  Read `a` and `b_str`.\n2.  Read `c_str`.\n3.  Convert `c_str` to its base 10 integer value using `to_base10(c_str, a)`.\n4.  If `b_str` is \"R\", call `to_roman()` with the base 10 value.\n5.  Else (if `b_str` is an integer base), convert `b_str` to an integer `b`, then call `from_base10_to_base()` with the base 10 value and `b`.\n6.  Print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper function to convert a character digit to its integer value\ndef digit_to_int(char_digit):\n    if '0' <= char_digit <= '9':\n        return int(char_digit)\n    else:  # 'A' through 'O' for bases up to 25 (max digit value 24)\n        return ord(char_digit) - ord('A') + 10\n\n# Helper function to convert a number string from a given base to base 10\ndef to_base10(num_str, base):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    # Iterate from right to left (least significant digit to most significant)\n    for char_digit in reversed(num_str):\n        digit_val = digit_to_int(char_digit)\n        # Check if digit is valid for the given base (not strictly necessary based on problem guarantees but good practice)\n        if digit_val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Digit '{char_digit}' is too large for base {base}\")\n        decimal_value += digit_val * (base ** power)\n        power += 1\n    return decimal_value\n\n# Helper function to convert an integer value to its character digit representation\ndef int_to_digit(val):\n    if 0 <= val <= 9:\n        return str(val)\n    else:  # 10 through 24\n        return chr(ord('A') + val - 10)\n\n# Helper function to convert a base 10 integer to a string in a given base\ndef from_base10_to_base(num_int, base):\n    if num_int == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    result_digits = []\n    while num_int > 0:\n        remainder = num_int % base\n        result_digits.append(int_to_digit(remainder))\n        num_int //= base\n    \n    # Digits were collected in reverse order, so reverse them for the final string\n    return \"\".join(reversed(result_digits))\n\n# Helper function to convert a base 10 integer to Roman numerals\ndef to_roman(num):\n    # Roman numerals mapping, including subtractive forms\n    roman_map = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    \n    result = []\n    for value, symbol in roman_map:\n        while num >= value:\n            result.append(symbol)\n            num -= value\n    return \"\".join(result)\n\n# Main part of the script\ndef solve():\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(line1[0])\n    b_str = line1[1]\n    \n    c_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Step 1: Convert input number c from base a to base 10\n    decimal_c = to_base10(c_str, a)\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert base 10 number to target base b\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        # Convert to Roman numerals\n        output = to_roman(decimal_c)\n    else:\n        # Convert to integer base b\n        b = int(b_str)\n        output = from_base10_to_base(decimal_c, b)\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(output + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
