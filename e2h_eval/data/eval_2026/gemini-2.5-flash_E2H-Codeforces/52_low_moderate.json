Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**New Year Candles Problem: My Python Solution**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it's calling for a simulation approach. Seems straightforward enough. The core of it boils down to keeping track of how many candles are available, how many have been burned, and how many new ones can be crafted from the burnt-out ones.\n\nEssentially, I'm starting with `a` new candles. Each one gives me an hour of light, but once it's gone, I can potentially get a new one by recycling `b` burnt-out candles. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nMy strategy is to simulate this process directly. I'll need a few key variables: `total_hours` to track the total burn time, `current_new_candles` for the candles I currently have, and `burnt_out_candles` for the ones that have been used up.\n\nThe loop will be pretty simple:\n1.  Burn all the new candles.  That adds to `total_hours` and the count of burnt ones.\n2.  Then, figure out how many new candles I can make from the burnt-out ones: `new_candles = burnt_out // b`.\n3.  Update the `burnt_out_candles`: `burnt_out = burnt_out % b` to keep track of the remainder.\n4.  Set `current_new_candles` to the new ones from the crafting process.\n\nI'll repeat this loop as long as I have new candles. I believe this will get me to the right answer. The simulation is the simplest way to get there. I'll also do a quick walkthrough using an example, like (4, 2), to make sure my logic is working properly. The modulo operator will be key to keeping track of the remainders. I can now start to implement my Python script.\n",
