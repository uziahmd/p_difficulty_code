            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Guard Duty (easy)\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem. Let's break it down. I need a Python script to solve it. It's about matching Rebel spaceships to bases, and the critical thing is that the paths between them can't cross.  The problem gives me the number of Rebels (`R`) and Bases (`B`), and their 2D coordinates.\n\nFirst thought: `R` must equal `B`.  If they don't, it's immediately \"No\". That's a quick check to start with. The coordinates are up to 10000, and no three points are collinear. The number of ships and bases is small: up to 10. That's a huge hint. Brute force!\n\nSince the number of ships/bases is so small, I can iterate through *all* possible pairings. I mean, it's just a matter of permutations. I can create a list of Rebels and Bases, then generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, I get a potential matching.\n\nFor each matching, I need to check if the segments intersect. I'll need a geometric intersection test for line segments. I remember the cross-product trick! I can use that. For two segments `(p1, p2)` and `(p3, p4)`, I'll need to check if they intersect. If *any* pair of segments in a matching intersect, that's an invalid configuration.\n\nSo the algorithm is clear:\n1.  Check if `R == B`. If not, \"No\".\n2.  Read in the Rebel and Base coordinates.\n3.  Generate all permutations of bases.\n4.  For each permutation (matching):\n    *   Create the segments connecting rebels and bases according to the permutation.\n    *   Check for intersections between *all* pairs of segments. If any intersect, the matching is bad, move to the next.\n    *   If no intersections, then output \"Yes\" and I can stop there.\n5. If I try all permutations, and no valid matching, output \"No\".\n\nSounds like a straightforward implementation, really. Just gotta write it out in Python now.  I know I'll have to be careful with the cross-product implementation to avoid division by zero or any numerical stability issues, but it should be manageable.  This problem is screaming \"brute force\", and I love those!\n",
