Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Process: Finding Optimal Angle in a Regular Polygon**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is to pinpoint three vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a given value, 'a'. My first thought is to dig into the geometry of a regular polygon. Since all vertices sit on a circle, any angle formed by three vertices is an inscribed angle, which, importantly, is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nI'm imagining a situation where one vertex, v2, is the angle's vertex. The other two vertices, v1 and v3, define the arc that determines the angle. The total angle around the circle's center is 360 degrees. Because it's a regular n-gon, this 360-degree pie is split into 'n' equal slices. Each slice, or arc segment, has a central angle of 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, let's fix v2. No need to overcomplicate things with offsets. Let's make v2 vertex number 2. Now, I need to figure out how the position of v1 and v3 influences the arc and ultimately the angle at v2. If the arc between them spans 'k' segments, the central angle is k*(360/n), and the inscribed angle at v2 is half of that: k*(180/n).\n\nThe value of 'k' can range from 1 to n-2. For instance, if v1 and v3 are next to each other, k is 1, and the angle is 180/n. When k is n-2, v1 and v3 are as far apart as possible, and the angle is (n-2)*(180/n). The goal is to get as close as possible to the target angle 'a' by finding the right 'k'.\n\nSo, here's the approach: for all possible values of k, generate the angle using k*(180/n). For k, I'll calculate the absolute difference between this generated angle and my target value 'a'. I need to iterate k from 1 to n-2 and find the k which has the smallest difference.\n\nHowever, the problem description mentions that the value of 'n' can go up to 10^5. A brute force linear search would not be optimal. The function mapping 'k' to angle is monotonically increasing. So I can exploit the monotonicity by computing an ideal `k_target_float` as `a * n / 180.0`. I need to handle edge cases to ensure `1 <= k <= n-2`. Thus, the ideal value should fall within this range to ensure optimal values. So I can use `floor` and `ceil` of the target floating-point `k` value to obtain the nearest possible integer values.\n\nI'll check for integer values which could be potentially the closest value for my target angle based on floor and ceil values of `k`. The main task reduces to evaluating the two closest integer values of `k` and choosing the minimum difference. This ensures the best angle. It is a constant time algorithm since it just involves two comparisons after calculation. After calculating the `k` value, I'll output 1, 2, and k+2.\n\nLet me test this with edge cases. For smaller `n` values, does this hold true? For example, when n=3, and a=15, the output is 1, 2, and 3. So this holds. This means I'm good to go!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices, numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon**\n\n1.  **Circumcircle:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of a polygon inscribed in a circle (an inscribed angle) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc between the two non-vertex points.\n3.  **Regular N-gon Arcs:** In a regular `n`-gon, the `n` vertices divide the circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each arc between adjacent vertices subtends a central angle of `360 / n` degrees.\n\nLet's fix `v2` as one of the vertices. For simplicity, let `v2` be vertex `2`.\nLet `v1` be vertex `1`.\nLet `v3` be another vertex, say `X`.\nThe angle `1-2-X` subtends the arc `1-X` that does not contain vertex `2`.\nThe number of segments (arcs between adjacent vertices) along this arc `1-X` can vary.\nIf `X` is vertex `3`, the arc `1-3` (not containing `2`) consists of 1 segment.\nIf `X` is vertex `4`, the arc `1-4` (not containing `2`) consists of 2 segments.\nIn general, if `X` is vertex `k+2` (where `k` is the number of segments), the arc `1-(k+2)` (not containing `2`) consists of `k` segments.\n\nThe central angle subtended by `k` segments is `k * (360 / n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-(k+2)` is half of this central angle: `k * (360 / n) / 2 = k * (180 / n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of segments `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\n*   Minimum `k=1`: This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`. For example, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3`. The angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\n*   Maximum `k=n-2`: This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the farthest possible from `v2` while still being distinct from `v2`. For example, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=n`. The angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. This is the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon.\n\nSo, the possible angles that can be formed are `k * (180/n)` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal Angle**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`. The possible angles are `k * base_angle`.\nWe are looking for `k` such that `k * base_angle` is closest to `a`.\nThis means `k` should be close to `a / base_angle`.\nLet `k_target_float = a / base_angle = a * n / 180.0`.\n\nThe optimal integer `k` will be either `floor(k_target_float)` or `ceil(k_target_float)`, constrained within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nWe can check these candidate `k` values:\n1.  `k_lower = floor(k_target_float)`\n2.  `k_upper = ceil(k_target_float)`\n\nWe need to ensure these candidates are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `k_target_float = a / base_angle`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  Consider two integer candidates for `k`: `k_cand1 = math.floor(k_target_float)` and `k_cand2 = math.ceil(k_target_float)`.\n6.  Create a list `possible_ks` to store valid `k` values to check:\n    *   If `k_cand1` is within `[1, n-2]`, add `int(k_cand1)` to `possible_ks`.\n    *   If `k_cand2` is within `[1, n-2]` and `k_cand2` is different from `k_cand1`, add `int(k_cand2)` to `possible_ks`.\n7.  **Edge Case Handling:** If `possible_ks` is empty (which happens if `k_target_float` is outside the range `[1, n-2]` and its floor/ceil are also outside), it means the closest `k` is either `1` (if `k_target_float < 1`) or `n-2` (if `k_target_float > n-2`).\n    *   If `k_target_float < 1`, add `1` to `possible_ks`.\n    *   Otherwise (if `k_target_float > n-2`), add `n-2` to `possible_ks`.\n8.  Iterate through `k_val` in `possible_ks`:\n    *   Calculate `current_angle = k_val * base_angle`.\n    *   Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `diff < min_diff`:\n        *   Update `min_diff = diff`.\n        *   Update `best_k = k_val`.\n    *   If `diff == min_diff`: (Tie-breaking rule: problem says any optimal solution is fine. The first one encountered or the last one encountered is acceptable).\n9.  Output the vertices: `1 2 (best_k + 2)`.\n    *   `v2` is vertex `2`.\n    *   `v1` is vertex `1`.\n    *   `v3` is vertex `best_k + 2`.\n    *   These vertices are distinct because `best_k` is at least `1`, so `best_k + 2` is at least `3`. All are within `[1, n]` since `best_k <= n-2`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(1) as it only checks a constant number of `k` values.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=68):**\n1.  `n=4, a=68`.\n2.  `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `k_target_float = 68 / 45.0 = 1.511...`.\n4.  `min_diff = inf`, `best_k = -1`.\n5.  `k_cand1 = math.floor(1.511...) = 1`.\n    `k_cand2 = math.ceil(1.511...) = 2`.\n6.  `possible_ks = []`.\n    *   `k_cand1 = 1`. `1` is in `[1, 4-2=2]`. Add `1` to `possible_ks`. `possible_ks = [1]`.\n    *   `k_cand2 = 2`. `2` is in `[1, 2]`. `2` is different from `1`. Add `2` to `possible_ks`. `possible_ks = [1, 2]`.\n7.  `possible_ks` is not empty.\n8.  Iterate:\n    *   For `k_val = 1`:\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`.\n        *   `min_diff = 23.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   For `k_val = 2`:\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`.\n        *   `22.0 < 23.0`. Update `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 2`.\n9.  Output: `1 2 (2 + 2)` which is `1 2 4`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The base angle for one segment of the circumcircle\n    # An angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the vertex\n    # subtends an arc v1v3.
