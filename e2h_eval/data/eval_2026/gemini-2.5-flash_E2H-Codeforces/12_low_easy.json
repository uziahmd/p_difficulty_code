The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia's Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down. We have `n` houses arranged in a circle, and `m` tasks to complete. The sequence of tasks is given by `a_1` to `a_m`. I'm starting at house 1, and I can only move clockwise. The time to move between adjacent houses is 1 unit. The critical part is that tasks *must* be completed in the given order. So, I have to find the shortest total time to finish all the tasks.\n\nI'm thinking, for each task, I need to calculate the time to get from my *current* house to the *target* house. The key here is the circular nature.  If the target house's number is greater than or equal to my current house's number, the time is straightforward: just subtract. But, if the target house is *smaller*, I have to go the long way around the circle.\n\nI worked through that example, and it makes sense now. Let's say my current position is `current_pos` and the target is `target_pos`.\n\n*   **If `target_pos >= current_pos`:** The time is simply `target_pos - current_pos`.\n*   **If `target_pos < current_pos`:** I need to wrap around.  I can express this as the remaining distance to house `n` (which is `n - current_pos`), plus the distance from house `1` to `target_pos`. It's really the same as saying I'm taking the total number of houses (`n`) and adding to it the difference to get to my next location: `n - current_pos + target_pos`.\n\nI should be able to iterate through the tasks, calculate the time for each move using this logic, and accumulate the total time. I'll need to keep track of my `current_pos`, updating it after each move. That sounds like a solid plan. Now, let's turn this into code!\n",
