    "thought": "**Initial Problem Understanding and Approach**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Gluttony.\" The core challenge is finding a specific permutation `b` of a given array `a`, where the sums of all proper subsets of `a` differ from the corresponding sums in `b`. This looks like it could get computationally heavy fast, given the constraint of `n <= 22`.  I immediately think that anything involving factorial time complexity is out.  This `22` bound suggests potentially solutions leveraging `2^n` or `n * 2^n`.\n\n**Decomposing the Core Condition**\n\nThe critical condition boils down to ensuring that `sum_a(S) != sum_b(S)` for every non-empty, proper subset `S`. The sums must differ, and this needs to hold true for any possible subset (excluding the empty and full sets).  I'm thinking, \"Let's work with the difference. Let `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`.\"  The problem becomes: finding a `b` such that all non-zero subset sums of `c` are non-zero.  Since `b` is a permutation, the sum of `a` equals the sum of `b`. That means the sum of all the `c` values will always be zero. This means that a lot of subset sums will have to be zero.\n\n**Simple Cases and Initial Trials**\n\nI start with the easiest cases: `n = 1`. In this trivial case, any permutation works, so `b = a`. I realize that the problem's constraint (0 < k < n) vacuously true for `n = 1`. Any valid permutation, like `a` will do for `n = 1`. For `n = 2`, and an example of `a=[1, 2]`, I find that `b = [2, 1]` is valid because any `S = {1}` or `S = {2}`, the conditions are satisfied. This gives `c=[-1,1]`, any subset sums of `c` does not equal zero.\n\n**The Cyclic Shift Idea**\n\nThis is where the idea of the cyclic shift of the array elements arises. I try to create the simplest permutations, and start to examine if the sort then rotate `b` creates conditions that satisfy the problem.  I sorted the input array `a`, resulting in an ordered array, `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.  Then I try to construct `b` through the permutation such that `b = [a_{n-1}, a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-2}]` .  This `b` is constructed by the simple index relationship `b[i] = a[(i-1+n)%n]`.\n\nI see that `c[i]` would then be `a[i] - b[i]`. So `c` will have terms like `a_0 - a_{n-1}, a_1 - a_0, a_2 - a_1, ...`.  The thing I'm focused on is if the sums of subsets of this `c` are all non-zero. The single-element subset sums are definitely non-zero.  Also, since the elements of `a` are distinct, the differences `a_i - a_{i-1}` are all nonzero.\n\n**Formalizing and Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nMy hypothesis is that cyclic shift based on the sorted order might work. To make sure the output permutations are with the original indices, I try to construct an example with the input, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n\nThe process: Sort `a` and store index information. Then apply the cyclic shift rule.\n\nSo the strategy is, construct pairs of `(a[i], i)` and sort based on element `a[i]`. From there, shift the values but keeping the original index information:\n\n    1.  `(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)`\n\n    2.  `b_final[orig_idx_j] = val_{(j+1)%n}`\n\nThis leads to `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`, where for the original array `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`. But the example output is `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`.  My results from applying the cyclic shift by this rule, does not match the example output.\n\nI'",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements `a[i]` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b[i]` for `i` in `S`.\n\nLet `sum_a(S) = sum_{i in S} a[i]` and `sum_b(S) = sum_{i in S} b[i]`. We need `sum_a(S) != sum_b(S)` for all `S` such that `0 < |S| < n`.\nThis condition can be rewritten. Let `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. Then the condition is `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b`. That is, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b[i]`.\nThis implies `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] - b[i]) = 0`.\nSo, the condition `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for `0 < |S| < n` is equivalent to saying that no non-empty proper subset sum of `c[i]` is zero.\n\nLet's consider a specific construction for `b`.\n1. Create pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n   `pairs = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n2. Sort these pairs based on their values. Let the sorted pairs be `[(val_0, orig_idx_0), (val_1, orig_idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, orig_idx_{n-1})]`.\n   Now we have `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}`.\n3. Construct the array `b` such that `b[orig_idx_j] = val_{(j+1)%n}` for `j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n   This means:\n   - `val_0` (the smallest value) is placed at `b[orig_idx_{n-1}]`.\n   - `val_1` is placed at `b[orig_idx_0]`.\n   - `val_2` is placed at `b[orig_idx_1]`.\n   - ...\n   - `val_{n-1}` (the largest value) is placed at `b[orig_idx_{n-2}]`.\n\nLet's analyze the `c` values for this construction:\n`c[orig_idx_j] = a[orig_idx_j] - b[orig_idx_j] = val_j - val_{(j+1)%n}`.\n\nConsider the sum `sum_{k in S} c[k]` for an arbitrary non-empty proper subset `S`.\nThis sum can be written as `sum_{j : orig_idx_j in S} (val_j - val_{(j+1)%n})`.\n\nLet `S_val = {val_j | orig_idx_j in S}`.\nThe sum is `sum_{v in S_val} v - sum_{v in S_val} (value that replaced v)`.\nMore precisely, `sum_{j : orig_idx_j in S} val_j - sum_{j : orig_idx_j in S} val_{(j+1)%n}`.\n\nLet's re-index for simplicity. Assume `a` is already sorted, so `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nThen `orig_idx_j = j` and `val_j = a_j`.\nThe construction becomes `b[j] = a_{(j+1)%n}`.\nSo `c[j] = a[j] - a_{(j+1)%n}`.\nSpecifically:\n`c[0] = a_0 - a_1`\n`c[1] = a_1 - a_2`\n...\n`c[n-2] = a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}`\n`c[n-1] = a_{n-1} - a_0`\n\nWe need to check if `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nSince `a_j` are distinct and sorted, `a_j - a_{j+1} < 0` for `j < n-1`, and `a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\nSo `c[0], ..., c[n-2]` are negative, and `c[n-1]` is positive.\n\nLet `X_S = sum_{i in S} c[i]`.\nIf `n=1`, there are no proper non-empty subsets. The condition `0 < k < n` is vacuously true. So `b=a` is a valid solution. The problem's constraints `0 < k < n` implies `n >= 2`. For `n=1`, the logic should still hold, and the problem expects `a[0]`.\n\nCase 1: `n-1 not in S`.\nThen all `c[i]` for `i in S` are negative.\n`c[i] = a[i] - a_{i+1} < 0`.\nSo `X_S = sum_{i in S} (a[i] - a_{i+1}) < 0`.\nThus `X_S != 0`.\n\nCase 2: `n-1 in S`.\nThen `c[n-1] = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\nAll other `c[i]` for `i in S, i < n-1` are negative.\n`X_S = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{i in S, i < n-1} (a_i - a_{i+1})`.\nLet `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`.\n`X_S = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{i in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})`.\n\nSuppose `X_S = 0`.\n`a_{n-1} - a_0 = -sum_{i in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1}) = sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\nLet `S' = \\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_k\\}` where `0 <= s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_k <= n-2`.\n`a_{n-1} - a_0 = (a_{s_1+1} - a_{s_1}) + (a_{s_2+1} - a_{s_2}) + ... + (a_{s_k+1} - a_{s_k})`.\nAll terms `a_{j+1} - a_j` are positive.\nThe sum `sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)` is a sum of positive distinct integers.\nWe know `a_{n-1} - a_0 = (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})`.\nThis is the sum of all `n-1` positive differences.\nThe sum `sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)` is a sum of a *subset* of these `n-1` positive differences.\nSince `S` is a proper subset of indices, `|S| < n`.\nIf `S = \\{n-1\\}`, then `S'` is empty, `X_S = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`. So `X_S != 0`.\nIf `S` contains `n-1` and is a proper subset, then `S'` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nSo `S'` is non-empty and `|S'| < n-1`.\nThis means `sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)` is a sum of `|S'|` terms.\nThe full sum `(a_1 - a_0) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})` consists of `n-1` terms.\nSince `|S'| < n-1`, `sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)` is a sum of a *strict* subset of these `n-1` terms.\nSince all `a_{j+1} - a_j > 0`, the sum of a strict subset of these terms must be strictly less than the sum of all terms.\nTherefore, `sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i) < sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (a_{j+1} - a_j) = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nSo `X_S = (a_{n-1} - a_0) - sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i) > 0`.\nThus, `X_S != 0`.\n\nThis proves that for the sorted array `a`, the construction `b[j] = a_{(j+1)%n}` always works.\n\nThe general algorithm:\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. Handle the `n=1` case: print `a[0]` and exit. (Although the problem definition `0 < k < n` implies `n >= 2` for the condition to be non-vacuous, it's safer to handle `n=1` explicitly. For `n=1`, `b=a` is the only permutation and trivially satisfies the condition).\n3. Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)`: `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n4. Sort `indexed_a` based on values: `indexed_a.sort()`.\n5. Create an empty array `b` of size `n`.\n6. Populate `b` using the cyclic shift logic:\n   For `j` from `0` to `n-1`:\n     `val_j = indexed_a[j][0]`\n     `orig_idx_j = indexed_a[j][1]`\n     `val_next = indexed_a[(j+1)%n][0]`\n     `b[orig_idx_j] = val_next`\n7. Print the elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\nExample 1:\n`n = 2`, `a = [1, 2]`\n`indexed_a = [(1, 0), (2, 1)]`\nSorted `indexed_a`: `[(1, 0), (2, 1)]`\n`val_0=1, orig_idx_0=0`\n`val_1=2, orig_idx_1=1`\n`b` array of size 2.\n`j=0`: `b[orig_idx_0] = val_1` => `b[0] = 2`\n`j=1`: `b[orig_idx_1] = val_0` => `b[1] = 1`\nResult: `b = [2, 1]`. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n`n = 4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n`indexed_a = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\nSorted `indexed_a`: `[(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n`val_0=1, orig_idx_0=3`\n`val_1=10, orig_idx_1=2`\n`val_2=100, orig_idx_2=1`\n`val_3=1000, orig_idx_3=0`\n`b` array of size 4.\n`j=0`: `b[orig_idx_0] = val_1` => `b[3] = 10`\n`j=1`: `b[orig_idx_1] = val_2` => `b[2] = 100`\n`j=2`: `b[orig_idx_2] = val_3` => `b[1] = 1000`\n`j=3`: `b[orig_idx_3] = val_0` => `b[0] = 1`\nResult: `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. This is a valid answer, although different from the sample output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`. The problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\"\n\nThe constraints `n <= 22` mean that `O(N log N)` for sorting is perfectly fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Create pairs (value, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort these pairs based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the array b\n    b = [0] * n # Initialize b with zeros or any placeholder\n\n    # Populate b using the cyclic shift logic\n    # b[original_index_of_val_j] = val_of_next_element_in_sorted_list\n    for j in range(n):\n        # indexed_a[j] is (val_j, orig_idx_j)\n        # indexed_a[(j + 1) % n] is (val_next, orig_idx_next)\n        \n        # The element at original position indexed_a[j][1] (which is a[indexed_a[j][1]] = indexed_a[j][0])\n        # should be replaced by indexed_a[(j + 1) % n][0].\n        \n        # So, b[original_index_j] = value_of_next_element\n        original_position_to_fill = indexed_a[j][1]\n        value_to_place = indexed_a[(j + 1) % n][0]\n        b[original_position_to_fill] = value_to_place\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the elements of b\n    print(*(b))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
