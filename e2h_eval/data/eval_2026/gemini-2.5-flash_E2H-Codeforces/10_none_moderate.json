Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

But `v2 != 0` (division by zero).

No errors.\n    #       So `321` is a valid solution.\n    #\n    # But the example output is `false`. Why?\n    # This implies there's a hidden constraint or an interpretation error.\n    #\n    # Could it be that the *intermediate* results of the expression evaluation must also be non-negative?\n    # This is common in some obscure languages.\n    # `v0 - v1 + v1 / v2`\n    # `3 - 2 = 1` (ok)\n    # `1 + (2 / 1) = 1 + 2 = 3` (ok)\n    #\n    # What if the expression itself must evaluate to 0?\n    # `v0 - v1 + v1 / v2 = 0`\n    # `3 - 2 + 2 / 1 = 3 != 0`. So `321` would not be a solution if target is 0.\n    #\n    # This is the most likely interpretation for \"diet is defined by its name\" and \"feed it\".\n    # If the expression must evaluate to 0, then for Ex2:\n    # `v0 - v1 + v1 / v2 = 0`\n    # Let's try to find `v0, v1, v2` such that `1 <= v2 < v1 < v0` and `v0 - v1 + floor(v1 / v2) = 0`.\n    #\n    # `v0 - v1 = -floor(v1 / v2)`\n    # Since `v0 > v1`, `v0 - v1` is positive.\n    # So `-floor(v1 / v2)` must be positive, which means `floor(v1 / v2)` must be negative.\n    # But `v1, v2` are positive, so `floor(v1 / v2)` is always positive.\n    # This means `v0 - v1 + floor(v1 / v2)` can never be 0 if `v0 > v1` and `v1, v2 >= 1`.\n    #\n    # This explains why Ex2 output is `false`!\n    # So the interpretation is:\n    # 1. Identify distinct variables based on their string representation (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`).\n    #    Let `K` be the number of distinct variables.\n    # 2. Assign values `0-9` to these `K` variables.\n    # 3. All explicit constraints must be satisfied.\n    # 4. No division by zero.\n    # 5. The final expression must evaluate to `0`.\n    # 6. Intermediate results must be non-negative (this is a common Befunge-like constraint for stack operations).\n    #    Let's test this for Ex1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> `0010`\n    #    v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0.\n    #    Expression: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`\n    #    `0 - 0 / 1 * 0`\n    #    `0 / 1 = 0`\n    #    `0 * 0 = 0`\n    #    `0 - 0 = 0`\n    #    Final result is 0. This is consistent.\n    #    Intermediate results:\n    #    `0 / 1 = 0` (non-negative)\n    #    `0 * 0 = 0` (non-negative)\n    #    `0 - 0 = 0` (non-negative)\n    #    Constraint `v2 > v3`: `1 > 0` (true).\n    #    So Ex1 works with this interpretation.\n    \n    # Let's re-check Ex4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` -> `0101`\n    # Distinct variables:\n    # __ -> v0\n    # ___ -> v1\n    # var_counter = 2.\n    # Output `01` means v0=0, v1=1.\n    # Expression: `v0 + v1 + v0 - v1`\n    # Constraints: `v1 > v0`.
