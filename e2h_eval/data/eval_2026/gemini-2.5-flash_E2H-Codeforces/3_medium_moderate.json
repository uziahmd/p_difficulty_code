Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and Lanterns - My Thinking Process**\n\nAlright, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. We need to figure out the smallest radius, `d`, for lanterns to illuminate a street of length `l`. The lantern positions are given as `a_i`.\n\n**Understanding the Core Requirements**\n\n1.  **Street Coverage:** The entire street from 0 to `l` must be lit.\n2.  **Lantern Placement:** Each lantern is at position `a_i` and has a radius `d`. A lantern at `a_i` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n3.  **Minimize the Radius:** We want the *smallest* possible value for `d`.\n\n**Deriving the Solution**\n\nTo ensure full street coverage, we have three key requirements:\n\n1.  **Starting Point (0):** There must be a lantern close enough to the start of the street at position 0 to light up that segment.  This means at least one lantern's light radius must extend to 0. The closest lantern to zero's distance becomes our primary concern, represented as `min(a_i)`. The radius, `d` must be at least this value to fully cover the distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n2.  **Ending Point (l):** Similarly, the end of the street (position `l`) needs to be lit. The lantern's radius should reach to the end, hence `d >= l - a_i`. We want the lantern farthest away, meaning `d` must be at least `l - max(a_i)`.\n3.  **Gaps Between Lanterns:** Any points between two lanterns must also be illuminated. If we sort the lantern locations (which makes sense), the gaps are defined between consecutive lanterns. In particular, we need to guarantee that the segment between two lanterns (say, at `a_i` and `a_j`) is lit by a minimal light. Consider a segment of length `a_j - a_i`. The minimum radius needed is half the length of this gap, or `(a_j - a_i) / 2`. To cover all gaps, we must consider the maximum of all gap segments.\n\n**Final Algorithm**\n\nBased on this, the minimum radius, `d`, is the maximum of the following values:\n\n1.  `min(a_i)`: The shortest distance from position 0 to the first lantern.\n2.  `l - max(a_i)`: The distance from the final lantern to `l`.\n3.  `max((a_j - a_i) / 2)`: The maximum gap between any two adjacent lanterns.\n\n**Edge Cases to Consider**\n\n*   `n = 1`: A single lantern at position `a_0`. `d` must be at least `max(a_0, l - a_0)`.\n*   All lanterns are at the same point: We can treat this point as the new starting point and get `max(d_start, d_end)`.\n*   Lanterns at 0 and `l`: The distance will be zero, meaning `d` can be determined only from the largest gaps.\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\n1.  Read the input values `n`, `l`, and the positions `a_i`.\n2.  Sort the lantern positions `a_i` in ascending order.\n3.  Calculate the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns and store as `max_gap_d`.\n4.  Calculate the distance from the beginning (`d_start`) and end (`d_end`) of the street.\n5.  Find the maximum value between `max_gap_d`, `d_start` and `d_end`. This is our answer!\n6.  Print the answer with the required precision.\n\nI'll make sure to double-check my logic when writing the code to ensure correct values, considering both the starts and endings. The Python code, in particular, will need to efficiently handle sorting. Also, the final output will need a precise display with 10 decimal places. I will also be careful about double precision float arithmetic to satisfy the accuracy requirements in the output.\n",
