Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Puzzle of Souvenir Costs**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're looking at a variation of the classic knapsack problem, but with a twist - the weights of the items are very limited (1, 2, or 3). Our goal is to maximize the total cost of souvenirs we select without exceeding a maximum weight capacity, `m`.  \n\nInitially, an `O(n*m)` approach seemed reasonable, but the constraints reveal a potential pitfall: `n` and `m` can be quite large. Iterating over all combinations, with a time complexity of `3 * 10^{10}`, screams inefficiency. It's too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation? The small weight values (1, 2, 3) are the key to a more efficient solution. We can exploit this.\n\nMy thought process leads to separating the souvenirs into three categories: weight 1 (`items_w1`), weight 2 (`items_w2`), and weight 3 (`items_w3`). To maximize cost, we sort each category in descending order of cost (highest cost first). Now the idea is to choose a combination of items of weight 1, 2, and 3 such that we maximize the cost but their total weight doesn't exceed `m`. \n\nWe'll start by precomputing prefix sums for each weight category. Let `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` be the numbers of items we pick from each category, and let their costs be `ps1`, `ps2`, and `ps3`. We want to maximize the combination of items, but we need to deal with the maximum weight constraint as we don't want an impossible solution.\n\nSince iterating through all possible combinations of k1, k2, and k3 will be too slow, let's fix one of the counts and determine the others.\n\nFirst, let's iterate on `k3`. For a fixed k3 items of weight 3, we have `3 * k3` used. The remaining capacity `m_prime = m - 3 * k3`. Let's precompute `f(W)` which will compute the maximum cost using items of weight 1 and 2 for weight `W`. To compute the function we can iterate over the maximum cost when we take a certain number of weight-2 items.\n\nWe want to calculate `f(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items_w2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)])`. Let's calculate for all W from 0 to m. To compute it in a fast manner, we need to apply the knapsack strategy. The brute-force approach will be too slow because we cannot iterate over weight 1 and weight 2. This part has a complexity of N * M.\nAn important observation is that we might be able to implement the sliding window maximum strategy to solve it efficiently. The function is concave.\n\nLet's rethink. If we pick an item of type w_i, we can also pick an additional item with a similar w_i. However, if we take w_3, then w_1 or w_2. We can try for all combinations. If we know that if we can take the maximum of items from weight 3 that are under m/3, and iterate using weight 1 and weight 2. This is equivalent to applying a dynamic programming structure.\n\nThis gives a similar form to bounded knapsack. In order to optimize the space complexity, we must compute for each possible cost, and also solve using recursion, the most efficient method is dynamic programming, although the space complexity can exceed the capacity.\n\nLet's try to consider the DP strategy. Let's use `dp[w]` as the maximum cost for total weight `w`.\nWe can use a DP state `dp[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[w] = -infinity` for `w > 0`.\nThe time complexity is too expensive. We can use bounded knapsack with Deques for better time complexity.\n\nThe total complexity, due to the constraints, should be lower than O(N * M), because the weight values are small. We are trying to find an algorithmic optimization that will find an optimum cost, without visiting all combinations.\n\nThe final strategy will involve a dynamic programming structure with optimizations for limited weight types. The approach leverages precomputed prefix sums and an iterative technique (potentially with the \"sliding window maximum\" or related tricks) to efficiently compute the optimal selection of souvenirs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs with a total weight not exceeding `m` and maximum possible total cost. We are given `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`. The constraints are `1 <= n <= 100000`, `1 <= m <= 300000`, and `1 <= w_i <= 3`. The costs `c_i` can be up to `10^9`.\n\nThe key constraint is that `w_i` is very small (1, 2, or 3). This suggests that a standard `O(n*m)` knapsack solution is too slow (`10^5 * 3*10^5 = 3*10^{10}`). However, an `O(m * poly(max_w_i))` or `O(m * log N)` solution might be feasible.\n\nLet's categorize the souvenirs by their weights:\n1. `items_w1`: List of costs of souvenirs with weight 1.\n2. `items_w2`: List of costs of souvenirs with weight 2.\n3. `items_w3`: List of costs of souvenirs with weight 3.\n\nTo maximize the total cost, for each weight category, we should always pick the most expensive items first. So, we sort these lists in descending order of cost.\nThen, we compute prefix sums for these sorted lists. `ps1[k]` will be the sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1, `ps2[k]` for weight 2, and `ps3[k]` for weight 3.\n\nThe total cost will be `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]` subject to `1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`, where `k1, k2, k3` are the number of items chosen from each category.\n\nWe can iterate over one or two of the `k` values and determine the rest. Iterating over `k1` and `k2` would be `O(len(items_w1) * len(items_w2))`, which can be `O(N^2)` in the worst case, too slow. Iterating over `k2` and `k3` or `k1` and `k3` similarly leads to `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we can iterate over the number of items of *one* weight type (say, `k2` for weight 2 items) and then efficiently solve the remaining problem for items of weight 1 and 3. Or iterate over `k3` and solve for 1 and 2.\n\nLet's iterate over `k3` (number of items of weight 3).\n`k3` can range from `0` to `min(len(items_w3), m/3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n  `current_weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_3`\n  If `remaining_capacity < 0`, we stop.\n  Now, we need to find the maximum cost we can achieve for `remaining_capacity` using only items of weight 1 and 2. Let's call this `solve_12(W)`.\n  The total maximum cost would be `max(current_cost_3 + solve_12(remaining_capacity))`.\n\nThe subproblem `solve_12(W)` is: maximize `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` subject to `1*k1 + 2*k2 <= W`.\nWe need to compute `solve_12(W)` for all `W` from `0` to `m`.\n`solve_12(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items_w2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n\nThe function `g(k2, W) = ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)]` is a sum of two concave functions (prefix sums of decreasing values are concave). Therefore, `g(k2, W)` is concave with respect to `k2` for a fixed `W`. For a concave function, the maximum can be found efficiently.\n\nHowever, we need `solve_12(W)` for *all* `W` from `0` to `m`.\nA standard way to compute `dp[W]` for all `W` for items of specific types (like weight 1 and 2) is:\nInitialize `dp[W] = 0` for all `W`.\nFor `k1` from `0` to `len(items_w1)`:\n  `cost1 = ps1[k1]`\n  `weight1 = k1`\n  If `weight1 > m`, break.\n  `dp_temp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n  For `W` from `0` to `m`:\n    `dp_temp[W] = dp[W]`\n    If `W >= weight1`:\n      `dp_temp[W] = max(dp_temp[W], dp[W - weight1] + cost1)`\n  `dp = dp_temp`\nThis is incorrect for items with varying costs. The `dp` transitions for \"multiple items of the same weight\" are usually `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-weight_i] + cost_i)`. But here we have items of the same weight but different costs, and we always pick the most expensive ones.\n\nThe function `solve_12(W)` computation can be optimized.\nLet `f[W]` be `solve_12(W)`.\n`f[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items_w2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)])`.\nWe can compute `f[W]` for all `W` from `0` to `m` in `O(m)` time.\nThe observation is that when `W` increases to `W+1`, `W - 2*k2` increases by 1.\n`ps1[k]` is non-decreasing.\nLet `k1_limit = len(items_w1)`.\n`f[W]` can be calculated by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items_w2), W/2)`.\nThe key is that as `W` increases, `W-2*k2` increases, so `ps1[min(k1_limit, W-2*k2)]` is non-decreasing.\nThe maximum `k2` is `m/2`.\nThe number of items of weight 1 can be `m`.\nThe total number of items of weight 1 and 2 is `n`.\nThe overall structure of the solution is:\n1. Sort `items_w1`, `items_w2`, `items_w3` by cost descending.\n2. Compute prefix sums `ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3`.\n3. Compute `f[W]` for `W` from `0` to `m`. `f[W]` is the max cost for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n   This can be done by iterating `k2` from `0` to `len(items_w2)`. For each `k2`, we consider its contribution `ps2[k2]` and weight `2*k2`. Then, for all `W` from `2*k2` to `m`, we can take `min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)` items of weight 1.\n   `f[W] = max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n   This still looks like `O(M * N)` if done naively.\n\nHowever, we can compute `f[W]` for all `W` in `O(M)`.\n`f[W]` is the maximum of `ps2[k2] + ps1[k1]` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= W`.\nLet `current_k1 = 0`.\n`f[W]` can be computed by iterating `W` from `0` to `m`.\n`f[W]` is `max(f[W-1] + items_w1[current_k1] if current_k1 < len(items_w1), f[W-2] + items_w2[current_k2] if current_k2 < len(items_w2))` (this is not quite right, it's for when we only have one item of each type, or specific items).\n\nThe key insight for small `w_i` is often to iterate over the number of items of the *largest* weight type.\nLet `k3` be the count of items of weight 3. `k3` goes from `0` to `min(len(items_w3), m/3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n  `current_weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_3`\n  If `remaining_capacity < 0`, break.\n  We need to find `solve_12(remaining_capacity)`.\n\nTo compute `solve_12(W)` for all `W` from `0` to `m`:\nInitialize `dp_12 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n`ptr1 = 0` (index for `items_w1`)\n`ptr2 = 0` (index for `items_w2`)\n`cost_w1_taken = 0`\n`cost_w2_taken = 0`\n\nWe can use a two-pointer-like approach or a sliding window maximum.\nLet `max_cost_12[w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`max_cost_12[w] = max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(items_w1), w - 2*k2)])`.\nThis can be computed in `O(m)` time.\nFor each `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `max_cost_12[w]` is `max(max_cost_12[w-1] + items_w1[k1_used], max_cost_12[w-2] + items_w2[k2_used])`.\nThis is a greedy approach. At each step `w`, we consider adding a weight 1 item or a weight 2 item.\nThis is incorrect because `items_w1[k1_used]` and `items_w2[k2_used]` depend on how many items we have already taken.\n\nThe correct way to compute `f[W]` (max cost for weight `W` using items of weight 1 and 2) in `O(M)`:\nInitialize `f = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n`k1_limit = len(items_w1)`\n`k2_limit = len(items_w2)`\n`current_k1 = 0`\n`current_k2 = 0`\n`current_cost = 0`\n\nFor `W` from `0` to `m`:\n  If `W > 0`: `f[W] = f[W-1]` (at least we can achieve what `W-1` achieved)\n  We are trying to find `max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(k1_limit, W - 2*k2)])`.\n  The `ps1` term `ps1[min(k1_limit, W - 2*k2)]` is hard to iterate over `W`.\n\nA more standard approach for this kind of problem is to iterate over the number of items of weight 2, `k2`.\nFor each `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items_w2), m/2)`:\n  `cost_w2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `weight_w2 = 2 * k2`\n  `remaining_w = m - weight_w2`\n  If `remaining_w < 0`, break.\n  `k1 = min(len(items_w1), remaining_w)`\n  `current_total_cost = cost_w2 + ps1[k1]`\n  `ans = max(ans, current_total_cost)`\n\nThis is `O(len(items_w2))`, which can be `O(N)`. This is for a fixed `k3=0`.\nWe need to combine this with `k3`.\nThe total algorithm:\n1. Read `n, m`.\n2. Create `items_w1`, `items_w2`, `items_w3` lists.\n3. Populate these lists.\n4. Sort `items_w1`, `items_w2`, `items_w3` in descending order.\n5. Compute prefix sums `ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3` for these lists.\n   `ps1[k]` = sum of first `k` elements of `items_w1`. (0-indexed, `ps1[0]=0`)\n   Similarly for `ps2`, `ps3`.\n6. Initialize `max_total_cost = 0`.\n7. Iterate `k3` from `0` to `len(items_w3)`:\n   `cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n   `weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n   `remaining_m = m - weight_3`\n   If `remaining_m < 0`, break.\n   \n   Now, we need to find the maximum cost using items of weight 1 and 2 for `remaining_m`.\n   This subproblem is `max_{k1, k2} (ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` subject to `1*k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_m`.\n   Let `current_max_12_cost = 0`.\n   Iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items_w2)`:\n     `cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n     `weight_2 = 2 * k2`\n     `remaining_m_for_w1 = remaining_m - weight_2`\n     If `remaining_m_for_w1 < 0`, break.\n     `k1 = min(len(items_w1), remaining_m_for_w1)`\n     `cost_1 = ps1[k1]`\n     `current_max_12_cost = max(current_max_12_cost, cost_1 + cost_2)`\n   \n   `max_total_cost = max(max_total_cost, cost_3 + current_max_12_cost)`\n8. Print `max_total_cost`.\n\nThe complexity of this approach:\n- Sorting: `O(N log N)`\n- Prefix sums: `O(N)`\n- Outer loop (k3): `len(items_w3)` iterations, max `N`.\n- Inner loop (k2): `len(items_w2)` iterations, max `N`.\nThis is `O(N^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `N/3` items of each weight). This is still too slow.\n\nThe maximum value of `m` is `300000`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 1 is `m`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `m/2`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `m/3`.\n\nWhat if we iterate over `k2` and `k3`?\n`ans = 0`\nFor `k2` from `0` to `len(items_w2)`:\n  `cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `weight_2 = 2 * k2`\n  `remaining_m_for_23 = m - weight_2`\n  If `remaining_m_for_23 < 0`, break.\n  For `k3` from `0` to `len(items_w3)`:\n    `cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n    `weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n    `remaining_m_for_1 = remaining_m_for_23 - weight_3`\n    If `remaining_m_for_1 < 0`, break.\n    `k1 = min(len(items_w1), remaining_m_for_1)`\n    `cost_1 = ps1[k1]`\n    `ans = max(ans, cost_1 + cost_2 + cost_3)`\nThis is `O(len(items_w2) * len(items_w3))`, which is `O(N^2)` worst case.\n\nThe key must be that the maximum number of items of weight 1, 2, or 3 that we can take is constrained by `m`.\nSpecifically, `k1 <= m`, `k2 <= m/2`, `k3 <= m/3`.\nThe total number of items `N` can be `10^5`, but `m` can be `3*10^5`.\nIf `N` is small, `N^2` might pass. But `N` is large.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M * C)` where `C` is a small constant, or `O(M * log N)`.\nLet's consider the `f[W]` function again: `f[W] = max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(k1_limit, W - 2*k2)])`.\nThis function `f[W]` needs to be computed for all `W` up to `m`.\nThe `ps1` and `ps2` arrays are prefix sums of sorted-descending costs, so they are concave.\n`ps1[k] - ps1[k-1] = c1_k` (cost of k-th item of weight 1).\n`ps2[k] - ps2[k-1] = c2_k` (cost of k-th item of weight 2).\nThe `k1` term `ps1[min(k1_limit, W - 2*k2)]` is also concave with respect to `k2`.\nThe sum of two concave functions is concave.\nSo, for a fixed `W`, `g(k2) = ps2[k2] + ps1[min(k1_limit, W - 2*k2)]` is concave.\nWe are looking for `max_{0 <= k2 <= min(k2_limit, W/2)} g(k2)`.\nThis maximum can be found efficiently.\nSince `g(k2)` is concave, its maximum can be found by a ternary search like approach or by looking for where `g(k2+1) - g(k2)` changes sign from positive to negative.\nThis still needs to be done for each `W`.\n\nA common trick when weights are small is to use \"meet-in-the-middle\" or to iterate over the items with higher weights, and then use a DP for the lower weights.\nHere, weights are 1, 2, 3.\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\n`dp[w]` can be computed by iterating over `k2` from `0` to `len(items_w2)`. For each `k2`, we use `2*k2` weight and `ps2[k2]` cost.

Correct.\nThe `O(N^2)` approach passed the example.\nThis means either `N` is not `10^5` in worst case for `len(items_w2) * len(items_w3)`, or `m` is small.\nThe constraints `N <= 10^5`, `M <= 3*10^5`.\nIf `N` items are split evenly, `len(items_w_i)` can be `N/3`.\nSo `(N/3) * (N/3)` can be `(10^5/3)^2` which is `10^{10}/9`. This is too slow.\n\nThe only way `O(N^2)` passes is if the actual number of iterations is much smaller.\nFor example, if `len(items_w2)` is small, or `len(items_w3)` is small.\nWhat if `len(items_w2)` is `O(M)` and `len(items_w3)` is `O(M)`?\nThe number of items of weight 2 cannot exceed `m/2`.\nThe number of items of weight 3 cannot exceed `m/3`.\nSo `k2` iterates up to `m/2` times. `k3` iterates up to `m/3` times.\nThe total number of iterations is `(m/2) * (m/3) = m^2 / 6`.\nThis is `(3*10^5)^2 / 6 = 9*10^{10} / 6 = 1.5 * 10^{10}`. This is definitely too slow.\n\nThere must be a mistake in my complexity analysis or the problem constraints allow for a weaker solution.\nPerhaps the problem setter expects `min(N, M)` for the loop limits.\n`k2` goes up to `min(len(items_w2), m/2)`.\n`k3` goes up to `min(len(items_w3), m/3)`.\nIn worst case, `len(items_w2)` can be `N`, `len(items_w3)` can be `N`.\nSo `min(N, m/2)` and `min(N, m/3)`.\nIf `N` is small, e.g., `N=1000`, `M=300000`. Then `min(1000, 150000)` is `1000`. `min(1000, 100000)` is `1000`.\nThen `1000 * 1000 = 10^6`, which is fine.\nIf `N=100000`, `M=1000`. Then `min(100000, 500)` is `500`. `min(100000, 333)` is `333`.\nThen `500 * 333 = 1.6 * 10^5`, which is fine.\nThe problematic case is when both `N` and `M` are large.\nE.g., `N=100000`, `M=300000`.\n`len(items_w2)` could be `N`, `len(items_w3)` could be `N`.\n`k2` up to `min(N, M/2)`. `k3` up to `min(N, M/3)`.\nIf `N > M/2`, then `k2` is `M/2`. If `N > M/3`, then `k3` is `M/3`.\nThis is exactly the `O(M^2)` case.\n\nThe only way this passes is if the sum of `len(items_w_i)` is `N`, not that each can be `N`.\n`len(items_w1) + len(items_w2) + len(items_w3) = N`.\nSo `len(items_w2)` and `len(items_w3)` cannot both be `N`.\nThe maximum of `len(items_w2) * len(items_w3)` would be when `len(items_w2) = N/2` and `len(items_w3) = N/2`.\nThis is `(N/2)*(N/2) = N^2/4`. Still `10^{10}/4`.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M)`.\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_{k1, k2} (ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` subject to `k1 + 2k2 <= W` for all `W` is:\n`f = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`p1 = 0` // current index for `items_w1`\n`p2 = 0` // current index for `items_w2`\n`s1 = 0` // cost from `items_w1`\n`s2 = 0` // cost from `items_w2`\n\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `f[w] = f[w-1]` // Option 1: Don't add any item, same as previous capacity\n\n  `cost_w1_val = -1`\n  if `p1 < len(items_w1)`: `cost_w1_val = items_w1[p1]`\n  \n  `cost_w2_val = -1`\n  if `p2 < len(items_w2)`: `cost_w2_val = items_w2[p2]`\n  \n  `best_cost_to_add = -1`\n  `best_weight_to_add = -1`\n\n  if `cost_w1_val != -1` and (`cost_w2_val == -1` or `cost_w1_val >= cost_w2_val`):\n    `best_cost_to_add = cost_w1_val`\n    `best_weight_to_add = 1`\n  elif `cost_w2_val != -1`:\n    `best_cost_to_add = cost_w2_val`\n    `best_weight_to_add = 2`\n\n  if `best_cost_to_add != -1`:\n    if `best_weight_to_add == 1`:\n      if `w >= 1`:\n        `s1 += best_cost_to_add`\n        `p1 += 1`\n        `f[w] = max(f[w], s1 + s2)`\n    else: # best_weight_to_add == 2\n      if `w >= 2`:\n        `s2 += best_cost_to_add`\n        `p2 += 1`\n        `f[w] = max(f[w], s1 + s2)`\nThis is still not right.
