There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into Knockout Tournament Dynamics**\n\nI'm thinking about maximizing the number of games a tournament winner can play under a specific rule: players can only compete if their game counts differ by at most one. The core of this problem seems to be efficiently managing player \"recycling\" to extend the winner's journey.\n\nMy initial approach was to define `dp[k]` as the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play *k* games. I started tracing the game sequences. I realized that the number of players needed for k games depended on how many games potential opponents had played. Specifically, any opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nThis leads to the recurrence relation: `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`. So, the solution resembles the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum players required grows as the Fibonacci number, shifted.\n\nThe goal then becomes finding the largest Fibonacci number that is smaller than *n*, the total number of players. So I need to generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.\n\nI've tested this method extensively, and it works. I first initialize two variables with the starting values of the sequence, then in each iteration, calculate the next Fibonacci number and test if that number exceeds the number of players, n. If so, then the current value is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nMy code looks good and I think the solution is correct!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. All players start with 0 games played.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a tournament winner who has played exactly `k` games, adhering to the given rule.\n\nLet's analyze the first few values of `dp[k]`:\n- **`dp[0]`**: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player. So, `dp[0] = 1`.\n- **`dp[1]`**: A winner who played 1 game. This player (let's call them W) must have played against one opponent (O1). Both W and O1 start with 0 games. After W wins, W has played 1 game. This requires 2 players in total. So, `dp[1] = 2`.\n- **`dp[2]`**: A winner who played 2 games. W must have played 1 game, then needs to play a second game against an opponent (O2). W has 1 game played. According to the rule, O2 must have played `j` games such that `|1 - j| <= 1`. This means `j` can be 0, 1, or 2. Since O2 is not the final winner and is playing against W who has only 1 win, O2 could not have played 2 games. So O2 must have played 0 or 1 game.\n    - To minimize total players, we choose the opponent type that requires fewer players.\n    - If O2 played 0 games: W (1 game) vs O2 (0 games). W wins. To get W to 1 game, we needed 2 players (`dp[1]`). To get O2 to 0 games, we need 1 player (`dp[0]`). Since these are distinct players, total players = `dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    - If O2 played 1 game: W (1 game) vs O2 (1 game). W wins. To get W to 1 game, we need `dp[1]` players. To get O2 to 1 game, we need another `dp[1]` players. Total players = `dp[1] + dp[1] = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n    - To minimize players, we choose the first option: `dp[2] = 3`.\n\n- **`dp[k]` for `k > 1`**: To get a winner with `k` games, the winner (W) must have played `k-1` games and then played one more game against an opponent (O). W has `k-1` games. O must have played `j` games such that `|(k-1) - j| <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`. Since O is not the final winner and is playing against W who has `k-1` wins, O cannot have `k` wins. So O must have played `k-2` or `k-1` games.\n    - To form W (with `k-1` wins), we need `dp[k-1]` players.\n    - To form O (with `j` wins), we need `dp[j]` players.\n    - These two sets of players must be disjoint. So, the total players required is `dp[k-1] + dp[j]`.\n    - To minimize `dp[k]`, we choose `j` to minimize `dp[k-1] + dp[j]`. Since `dp` values are monotonically increasing (more games require more players), we choose the smallest possible `j`, which is `k-2`.\n    - Therefore, for `k >= 2`, `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet's map it to standard Fibonacci sequence `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`\n- `dp[0] = 1 = F_2`\n- `dp[1] = 2 = F_3`\n- `dp[2] = 3 = F_4`\n- `dp[k] = F_{k+2}`\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can play, given `n` players. This means we need to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`, or equivalently, `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. We can do this iteratively. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will not be very large (around 90 for `10^18`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `f_prev = 1` (representing `F_2`, which is `dp[0]`).\n2. Initialize `f_curr = 2` (representing `F_3`, which is `dp[1]`).\n3. Initialize `k_val = 1` (this `k_val` represents the number of games for which `f_curr` is the minimum players, i.e., `f_curr = dp[k_val]`).\n4. Loop while `f_curr <= n`:\n   a. Store `f_curr` in a temporary variable.\n   b. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `f_curr = f_prev + f_curr`.\n   c. Update `f_prev` to the previous `f_curr`: `f_prev = temp`.\n   d. Increment `k_val` because `f_curr` now corresponds to `dp[k_val + 1]`.\n5. After the loop, `f_curr` is the first `dp` value that is greater than `n`. The previous `dp` value (which is `f_prev` after the last update in the loop, or `f_curr` before the last update) was the largest `dp` value less than or equal to `n`. This corresponds to `dp[k_val - 1]`.\n6. Therefore, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `k_val - 1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=10):**\n1. `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `k_val = 1`.\n2. Loop: `f_curr (2) <= n (10)` is true.\n   `temp = 2`, `f_curr = 1 + 2 = 3`, `f_prev = 2`, `k_val = 2`.\n3. Loop: `f_curr (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n   `temp = 3`, `f_curr = 2 + 3 = 5`, `f_prev = 3`, `k_val = 3`.\n4. Loop: `f_curr (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n   `temp = 5`, `f_curr = 3 + 5 = 8`, `f_prev = 5`, `k_val = 4`.\n5. Loop: `f_curr (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n   `temp = 8`, `f_curr = 5 + 8 = 13`, `f_prev = 8`, `k_val = 5`.\n6. Loop: `f_curr (13) <= n (10)` is false.\n7. Return `k_val - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large `n` without overflow. The number of iterations is logarithmic with respect to `n`, making it very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # dp[k] represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to have played exactly k games.\n    # dp[0] = 1 (A single player, 0 games played)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (Two players, one wins 1 game)\n    # For k >= 2, to get a winner with k games, they must have won k-1 games\n    # and then beat an opponent who had won k-2 games (to minimize total players).\n    # So, dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2].\n    # This is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically:\n    # dp[k] = F_{k+2} (where F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...)\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n    # This means finding the maximum k such that F_{k+2} <= n.\n\n    # f_prev will hold F_{i+1} (or dp[i])\n    # f_curr will hold F_{i+2} (or dp[i+1])\n\n    # Initial values:\n    # For k=0, dp[0] = 1 (F_2)\n    # For k=1, dp[1] = 2 (F_3)\n    \n    # Let's start with dp[0] and dp[1]\n    f_prev = 1  # Represents dp[0] (F_2)\n    f_curr = 2  # Represents dp[1] (F_3)\n\n    # k_val tracks the number of games.
