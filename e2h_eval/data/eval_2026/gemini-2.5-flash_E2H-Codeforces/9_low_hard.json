Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Selling Souvenirs\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which feels a lot like a knapsack variation. The goal is to maximize the cost of souvenirs I can carry, given a weight limit. I'm focusing on crafting a Python script to tackle this.\n\nThe constraints are pretty clear: `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`, and a total weight limit `m`. The key here is the range of the weights: `1 <= w_i <= 3`. This is crucial. It suggests a categorization strategy.\n\nMy initial thought is to separate the souvenirs into groups based on their weights: weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3. Within each group, it's pretty obvious that to maximize the total cost, I should prioritize the most expensive souvenirs. So, I'll need to sort each group by cost in descending order.\n\nThis looks like a dynamic programming problem, but a straight 0/1 knapsack approach, with `O(N*M)` complexity, is going to be too slow, given the size of `N` and `M`. I need to exploit that small weight range.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through the possible combinations. Let's say `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are the numbers of items from groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, that I choose. The core idea is that the total weight, `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3`, must be less than or equal to `M`.\n\nI'm thinking of fixing the number of items taken from Group 3 (`k3`) and finding the optimum solution for groups 1 and 2 for the remaining weight.  For each value of `k3`, the remaining capacity is `M - k3 * 3`. Then I can iterate over all possible values of `k1` and `k2` such that their total weight is at most the remaining capacity, selecting the best options for `k1` and `k2`. I can keep track of the maximum total cost found so far. This should be much faster than the naive knapsack.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs with maximum total cost, given a total weight capacity `m`. Each souvenir has a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`. The key constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3. The number of souvenirs `n` can be up to 100,000, and `m` up to 300,000.\n\nA standard dynamic programming approach for the knapsack problem (`dp[w] = max_cost` for weight `w`) would be `O(N*M)`, which is too slow for the given constraints (`10^5 * 3*10^5 = 3*10^{10}`).\n\nThe small range of weights (`w_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}`) is critical. This suggests grouping items by weight and then using a specialized approach.\n\n**1. Categorize and Sort Souvenirs:**\nFirst, separate the souvenirs into three lists based on their weights:\n- `items1`: costs of souvenirs with `w_i = 1`\n- `items2`: costs of souvenirs with `w_i = 2`\n- `items3`: costs of souvenirs with `w_i = 3`\n\nTo maximize cost, we should always pick the most expensive items first within each weight category. So, sort these lists in descending order of cost.\n\n**2. Precompute Prefix Sums:**\nTo quickly calculate the total cost of the `k` most expensive items of a certain weight, we can use prefix sums.\n- `prefix_sum1[k]`: sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1.\n- `prefix_sum2[k]`: sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 2.\n- `prefix_sum3[k]`: sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 3.\n(Note: `prefix_sum[0]` will be 0).\n\n**3. The Core Idea: Iterating on 'Harder' Choices**\nThe problem can be thought of as selecting `k_1` items of weight 1, `k_2` items of weight 2, and `k_3` items of weight 3, such that `1*k_1 + 2*k_2 + 3*k_3 <= m` and the total cost is maximized.\n\nSince `w_i` are small, we can fix the number of items taken from one or two categories and then optimize for the remaining. A common strategy for small-weight knapsacks is to iterate over the number of items of the largest weight.\n\nLet's iterate over the number of items `k3` we take from `items3`.\nFor each `k3` from 0 up to `len(items3)`:\n- Calculate the weight used: `current_weight = k3 * 3`.\n- If `current_weight > m`, we cannot take `k3` items, so break the loop.\n- Calculate the cost from `items3`: `current_cost = prefix_sum3[k3]`.\n- Remaining capacity: `remaining_m = m - current_weight`.\n\nNow, we need to fill `remaining_m` capacity using `items1` and `items2`. This is a subproblem: maximize `k1*1 + k2*2 <= remaining_m`.\n\n**4. Optimized Subproblem for `items1` and `items2`:**\nThis subproblem is still a knapsack-like problem. We can iterate over `k2` (number of items of weight 2) and then determine `k1` (number of items of weight 1).\nFor each `k2` from 0 up to `len(items2)`:\n- Weight used by `k2` items: `k2 * 2`.\n- If `k2 * 2 > remaining_m`, break.\n- Cost from `k2` items: `prefix_sum2[k2]`.\n- Remaining capacity for `items1`: `remaining_m_for_1 = remaining_m - k2 * 2`.\n- Number of `items1` we can take: `k1 = min(remaining_m_for_1, len(items1))`.\n- Cost from `k1` items: `prefix_sum1[k1]`.\n- Total cost for this `(k2, k1)` combination: `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[k1]`.\nWe want to maximize this sum over all possible `k2`.\n\nThis nested loop (`k3` and `k2`) could still be `O(M/3 * M/2) = O(M^2)`, which is `(3*10^5)^2` and too slow.\n\n**5. Further Optimization for `items1` and `items2`:**\nThe subproblem of picking `items1` and `items2` for a given `remaining_m` can be optimized.\nNotice that as `remaining_m` decreases (because we take more `items3`), the optimal combination of `items1` and `items2` changes.\n\nLet `dp2[w]` be the maximum cost achievable using items of weight 1 and 2, with a total weight limit of `w`.\nWe can compute `dp2` array up to `m`.\n`dp2[w]` can be calculated efficiently.\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`. For each `k2`, we use `k2 * 2` weight and gain `prefix_sum2[k2]` cost. The remaining capacity `w - k2 * 2` can be filled with `min(w - k2 * 2, len(items1))` items of weight 1, yielding `prefix_sum1[min(w - k2 * 2, len(items1))]` cost.\nSo, `dp2[w] = max(prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - k2 * 2, len(items1))] for all k2 such that k2*2 <= w)`.\nThis still looks like `O(M * len(items2))`, which is `O(M^2)`.\n\nHowever, we can build the `dp2` array more efficiently.\n`dp2[w]` represents the maximum value for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp2[w]` can be computed by considering two options for `w`:\n1. Don't take any item of weight 2. Then `dp2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\n2. Take at least one item of weight 2. This is tricky because we're picking from a sorted list, not just any item of weight 2.\n\nA better way to compute `dp2[w]` is to iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`. For each `k2`, we compute the cost for all possible remaining weights:\n`current_cost_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n`current_weight_2 = k2 * 2`\nFor `w` from `current_weight_2` up to `m`:\n  `remaining_w_for_1 = w - current_weight_2`\n  `cost_1 = prefix_sum1[min(remaining_w_for_1, len(items1))]`\n  `dp2[w] = max(dp2[w], current_cost_2 + cost_1)`\nThis is still `O(len(items2) * M)`.\n\n**The Correct Optimization for (1,2) items:**\nLet `max_cost_1_2[w]` be the maximum cost achievable using items of weight 1 and 2, with a total weight limit of `w`.\nWe can compute `max_cost_1_2` values for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nInitialize `max_cost_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for all `w`. This covers the case where we only take weight-1 items.\nNow, iterate through `k2` (number of items of weight 2) from `1` to `len(items2)`.\nFor each `k2`, `cost_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]` and `weight_k2 = k2 * 2`.\nFor `w` from `weight_k2` up to `m`:\n  `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], cost_k2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - weight_k2, len(items1))])`\nThis still looks like `O(len(items2) * M)`.\n\nThe crucial insight for the (1,2) subproblem is that `max_cost_1_2[w]` can be computed in `O(M + len(items1) + len(items2))`.\nFor a fixed `k2`, the cost is `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))]`.\nLet `f(k2, w) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))]`.\nWe want `max_cost_1_2[w] = max_{k2} f(k2, w)`.\nNotice that `prefix_sum1` is non-decreasing and concave (due to sorting by cost).\nThe `min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))` term means `prefix_sum1` is taken up to its full length if `w - 2*k2` is large enough.\n\nThe true optimized approach for the (1,2) subproblem is to use a sliding window maximum (deque) or a similar technique if `prefix_sum1` was strictly concave. However, since `min` is involved, it's simpler.\nWe compute `max_cost_1_2[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nFor each `w`:\n  Initialize `max_cost_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` (taking only weight 1 items).\n  Then, iterate `k2` from `1` up to `len(items2)`:\n    If `2 * k2 > w`, break (can't take `k2` items of weight 2).\n    `cost = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2 * k2, len(items1))]`\n    `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], cost)`\nThis is `O(M * len(items2))`. Still too slow.\n\n**The actual solution for (1,2) items:**\nIterate `k2` from `0` up to `len(items2)`.\nFor each `k2`, we use `k2 * 2` weight and gain `prefix_sum2[k2]` cost.\nThe remaining capacity `rem_w = m - k2 * 2` (or `remaining_m` from the outer loop) needs to be filled with weight-1 items.\nThe number of weight-1 items we can take is `min(rem_w, len(items1))`.\nThe cost from weight-1 items is `prefix_sum1[min(rem_w, len(items1))]`.\nSo, for a fixed `k2`, the total cost is `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(rem_w, len(items1))]`.\nWe need to find the maximum such value over all valid `k2`.\nThis inner loop runs `len(items2)` times.\n\nTotal complexity: `O(len(items3) * len(items2))`.\nIn the worst case, all items could be weight 2, or weight 3.\nIf `len(items3)` is `N/3` and `len(items2)` is `N/3`, then `O(N^2)` which is `(10^5)^2`. Still too slow.\n\nWait, the crucial point is that `m` is the total weight.\n`len(items3)` can be at most `m/3`.\n`len(items2)` can be at most `m/2`.\nSo the complexity is `O( (M/3) * (M/2) ) = O(M^2)`. This is the issue.\n\n**Let's rethink the structure:**\nThe total number of items is `N`.\nThe total weight is `M`.\nThe values `len(items1)`, `len(items2)`, `len(items3)` can be up to `N`.\nBut the number of items we can *take* of weight 2 is at most `M/2`.\nThe number of items we can *take* of weight 3 is at most `M/3`.\n\nSo, the outer loop for `k3` runs from `0` to `min(len(items3), M/3)`.\nThe inner loop for `k2` runs from `0` to `min(len(items2), (M - k3*3)/2)`.\nThis makes the total complexity `O( (M/3) * (M/2) ) = O(M^2)`. This is the source of the problem.\n\n**The correct approach for `O(M)` or `O(M log M)`:**\nThe constraints `N=10^5, M=3*10^5` usually point to `O(N log N + M)` or `O(N + M log M)`.\n\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for total weight `w`.\nWe can compute `dp[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nInitialize `dp[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for all `w`. This accounts for only weight-1 items.\nNow, we need to incorporate weight-2 and weight-3 items.\n\nThis looks like a standard knapsack problem with multiple items of the same weight.\nFor each weight `w_i` (2 or 3), we want to take `k` items. This is equivalent to saying we have `len(items_w_i)` items of weight `w_i`, and we take the `k` most expensive ones.\nThis is a multiple-choice knapsack or a variation.\n\nSince `w_i` is small, we can use a DP approach where we iterate through the weights.\n`dp[w]` = max cost for weight `w`.\nBase case: `dp[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` (only weight 1 items).\n\nNow, consider items of weight 2.\nFor each `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = k2 * 2`\n  For `w` from `m` down to `weight_k2`:\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], cost_k2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - weight_k2, len(items1))])`\nThis is `O(len(items2) * M)`. Still `O(M^2)`.\n\nThis is a variation of the multiple-choice knapsack problem or bounded knapsack where items are grouped by weight.\nThe specific structure of `w_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}` is extremely important.\n\nLet's fix the number of items of weight 3 we take (`k3`). This requires `3*k3` weight.\nThe remaining capacity is `M' = M - 3*k3`.\nThe remaining cost is `prefix_sum3[k3]`.\nNow we need to fill `M'` capacity with items of weight 1 and 2.\nLet `f(W)` be the maximum cost for weight `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe need to compute `f(W)` for `W` from `0` to `M`.\n`f(W)`:\n  Initialize `f(W) = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]`.\n  Iterate `k2` from `1` to `min(len(items2), W/2)`:\n    `f(W) = max(f(W), prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - k2*2, len(items1))])`.\nThis is still `O(W * len(items2))` to compute all `f(W)` values.\n\nThe key observation for the (1,2) subproblem *in `O(M)` time*:\n`max_cost_1_2[w]` is the maximum cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `max_cost_1_2[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`.\nThis can be done by iterating through `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), m/2)`.\nFor each `k2`, calculate `cost_from_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`.\nThen, for all `w` from `k2*2` to `m`, we can potentially form `w` by taking `k2` items of weight 2 and `w - k2*2` items of weight 1.\nThe cost would be `cost_from_2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - k2*2, len(items1))]`.\nWe need to maximize this.\n\nConsider the values `val[i] = prefix_sum1[i]` and `val_2[j] = prefix_sum2[j]`.\nWe want to find `max_{i,j} (val[i] + val_2[j])` subject to `i + 2j <= W`.\nThis is a standard sum of two arrays problem, but with a weight constraint.\nLet `dp_val_1_2[w]` be the max cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp_val_1_2` in `O(M)` time using a sliding window maximum / deque approach.\nFor a fixed `w`, we want to find `max_{j} (prefix_sum2[j] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2j, len(items1))])`.\nLet `g_w(j) = prefix_sum2[j] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2j, len(items1))]`.\nAs `w` increases by 1, `min(w - 2j, len(items1))` might increase by 1 (if `w - 2j < len(items1)`).\n\nThe structure `prefix_sum1[X] + prefix_sum2[Y]` where `X+2Y <= W` is exactly what a convex hull trick or a similar technique can optimize. However, `prefix_sum1` is not necessarily convex, it's concave (diminishing returns).\n\nLet's try a different approach.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `M/2`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `M/3`.\nThe total number of items is `N`.\n\nThe overall complexity must be closer to `O(M)`.\nThe key is that for a fixed `k3`, we need to solve the (1,2) subproblem for `M' = M - 3*k3`.\nThe maximum value of `M'` is `M`.\nWe need to compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` for all `W` from `0` to `M`.\n`max_cost_1_2[W]` is `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` using a deque.\nLet `f_k1(x) = prefix_sum1[x]`.\nWe want to find `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + f_k1(W - 2*k2))` for each `W`.\nFor a fixed `W`, let `x = W - 2*k2`. As `k2` increases, `x` decreases by 2.\nSo we are looking for `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + f_k1(x))` where `x` takes values `W, W-2, W-4, ...`.\nThis means we need `max (prefix_sum2[j] + prefix_sum1[i])` such that `i + 2j <= W`.\nThis is exactly the formulation that a deque can solve for `O(M)`.\n\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\nNow, we iterate through `k2` from `1` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`.\nFor each `k2`, we are considering adding `k2` items of weight 2.\nThe cost for these `k2` items is `prefix_sum2[k2]`.\nThe remaining capacity is `w - 2*k2`.\nWe need `max_cost_1_2[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), w/2)} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\n\nLet's define `current_max_cost_1_2[w]` which will be built up.\n`current_max_cost_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nThis covers taking 0 items of weight 2.\nNow, we need to update `current_max_cost_1_2[w]` for `k2 > 0`.\nThis is where the deque comes in.\nWe want to find `max_{j} (prefix_sum2[j] + prefix_sum1[X - 2j])` for `X` (which is `w`).\nLet `v_j = prefix_sum2[j]` and `u_i = prefix_sum1[i]`.\nWe want `max_{j} (v_j + u_{X - 2j})`.\nThis is a standard \"sum of two functions with shifted index\" problem.\nFor each `W` from `0` to `M`:\n  `dp_val_1_2[W]` should be maximum of:\n    `prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]` (0 items of weight 2)\n    `prefix_sum2[1] + prefix_sum1[min(W-2, len(items1))]` (1 item of weight 2)\n    ...\n    `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W-2*k2, len(items1))]` (`k2` items of weight 2)\n\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` time.\nFor each `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`:\n  `cost_from_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  For `w` from `k2 * 2` to `M`:\n    `cost_from_1 = prefix_sum1[min(w - k2 * 2, len(items1))]`\n    `dp_val_1_2[w] = max(dp_val_1_2[w], cost_from_2 + cost_from_1)`\nThis is `O(M * (M/2))`. Still `O(M^2)`.\n\nThe specific problem with `w_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}` is often solved by iterating over the number of items of weight 3 (say `k3`), and then solving for weight 1 and 2 items.\nThe number of items of weight 3 can be at most `M/3`.\nFor each `k3`, we have `M' = M - 3*k3` remaining capacity.\nWe need to find the max cost for `M'` using weight 1 and 2 items.\nLet `max_cost_1_2[W]` be the maximum cost for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` for all `W` from `0` to `M` in `O(M + len(items1) + len(items2))` time.\n\nHow to compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` in `O(M)`?\n`max_cost_1_2[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), W/2)} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nLet `f(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))]`.\nWe want `max_{k2} f(k2, W)`.\nThe `min` term makes it slightly tricky.\nIf `W - 2*k2 >= len(items1)`, then `f(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[len(items1)]`.\nIf `W - 2*k2 < len(items1)`, then `f(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2]`.\n\nLet's analyze the second case: `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2]`.\nWe need to find `max_{k2}` for this.\nConsider a fixed `W`. Let `i = W - 2*k2`. Then `k2 = (W - i)/2`.\nWe need `max_{i \\text{ s.t. } i \\le W, i \\text{ has same parity as } W} (prefix_sum1[i] + prefix_sum2[(W-i)/2])`.\nThis is a convolution-like sum.\nFor fixed parity of `W`, we can iterate `i` from `0` to `W` (step 2).\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` using a deque for each parity.\nLet `dp_even[W]` be the max cost for even `W`.\nLet `dp_odd[W]` be the max cost for odd `W`.\n`dp_even[W] = max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2])` where `W - 2*k2` is even.\n`dp_odd[W] = max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2])` where `W - 2*k2` is odd.\nThis is exactly solving `max_{x+2y=W} (A[x] + B[y])`. This is a classical problem solvable with a sliding window maximum / deque in `O(W)` time.\n\nAlgorithm for `max_cost_1_2[W]` in `O(M)`:\n1. Initialize `max_cost_1_2[W] = 0` for all `W`.\n2. For `W` from `0` to `M`:\n   `max_cost_1_2[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]`. (This is the baseline, taking only weight 1 items)\n3. Use a deque to compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` for `W` up to `M` by considering items of weight 2.\n   We want `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[X - 2*k2])`.\n   Let `A[i] = prefix_sum1[i]` and `B[j] = prefix_sum2[j]`.\n   We are looking for `max_{j} (B[j] + A[X - 2j])`.\n   This means for each `X`, we are finding the maximum of `B[0]+A[X]`, `B[1]+A[X-2]`, `B[2]+A[X-4]`, etc.\n   This can be done with two deques (one for even `X`, one for odd `X`).\n   Let's consider `W` values.\n   For `W` from `0` to `M`:\n     `max_cost_1_2[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]`\n   For `k2` from `1` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`:\n     For `W` from `2*k2` to `M`:\n       `max_cost_1_2[W] = max(max_cost_1_2[W], prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`\n   This is still `O(M * (M/2))`.\n\nThe problem is hard because the `O(M^2)` solution is tempting.\nThe actual trick:\nThe total number of items taken from weight 2 and 3 groups combined cannot exceed `M/2 + M/3` (roughly `5M/6`).\nBut `len(items2)` and `len(items3)` can be up to `N`.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of items of weight 2 and 3 we can take.\n`k2 <= M/2`, `k3 <= M/3`.\nThe total number of iterations for `k3` is `min(len(items3), M/3)`.\nFor each `k3`, we calculate `M_prime = M - 3*k3`.\nThen we need to find `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(M_prime - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nThe number of iterations for `k2` is `min(len(items2), M_prime/2)`.\nThis is `O(M/3 * M/2) = O(M^2)`.\n\nThis leads me to believe `M` is not the limiting factor for `len(items2)` and `len(items3)` in the inner loops.\nIt must be that `N` is the limiting factor.\nIf `len(items2)` is small (e.g., `O(1)`), then `O(M)` overall.\nIf `len(items3)` is small (e.g., `O(1)`), then `O(M)` overall.\n\nThe constraints are `N <= 10^5`, `M <= 3*10^5`.\nIf `N` is small, `M` is large, then `M^2` is bad.\nIf `N` is large, `M` is small, then `N*M` is bad.\n\nThe solution must be something like `O(N + M)`.\nLet's consider the number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) and weight 3 (`k3`).\nThe number of choices for `k2` is `min(len(items2), M/2)`.\nThe number of choices for `k3` is `min(len(items3), M/3)`.\nThe total number of items `N` could be `10^5`.\nIf all items are weight 1, `len(items1)=10^5`. `M=3*10^5`. `O(N)` solution.\nIf all items are weight 2, `len(items2)=10^5`. `M=3*10^5`. `O(M)` solution (just take `min(N, M/2)` items).\nIf all items are weight 3, `len(items3)=10^5`. `M=3*10^5`. `O(M)` solution (just take `min(N, M/3)` items).\n\nThe problem is when we have a mix.\nFor example, `len(items1) = N/3`, `len(items2) = N/3`, `len(items3) = N/3`.\nThen `k3` loop is `min(N/3, M/3)`.\n`k2` loop is `min(N/3, M/2)`.\nIf `N` is small, `M` is small, this is fine.\nIf `N=10^5, M=3*10^5`, then `k3` loop is `10^5`. `k2` loop is `10^5`. `10^{10}`.\n\nThis means my understanding of the `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` is crucial.\nLet's re-verify the `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]`.\nWe want `dp[W] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), W/2)} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nFor `W` from `0` to `M`:\n  `dp[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]` (base case: `k2=0`)\n\nTo incorporate `k2 > 0` efficiently:\nThis is a variation of the \"bounded knapsack with few distinct item types\" or \"multiple-choice knapsack\" problem.\nThe values `prefix_sum1[i]` are concave.\nThe values `prefix_sum2[j]` are concave.\nThe function `prefix_sum1[X] + prefix_sum2[Y]` where `X+2Y=W` can be optimized using a sliding window maximum.\n\nLet `A_i = prefix_sum1[i]` and `B_j = prefix_sum2[j]`.\nWe want to compute `C_W = max_{j} (B_j + A_{W-2j})`.\nThis is exactly what a deque can do.\nFor each `W` from `0` to `M`:\n  We maintain a deque of `j` indices.\n  For `j` in `[0, min(len(items2), W/2)]`:\n    While deque is not empty and `B[deque.back()] + A[W-2*deque.back()] <= B[j] + A[W-2*j]`: pop back.\n    Push `j` to deque.\n    `C_W = B[deque.front()] + A[W-2*deque.front()]`.\nThis is `O(M * (M/2))` if `A` is not `prefix_sum1[min(X, len(items1))]`.\nThe `min` term makes it more complex.\nIf `X - 2j < len(items1)`, then `A[X-2j]` is `prefix_sum1[X-2j]`.\nIf `X - 2j >= len(items1)`, then `A[X-2j]` is `prefix_sum1[len(items1)]`.\n\nThis is a standard technique.\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the array we want to compute.\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for all `w`.\nNow, for `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `val_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_2 = k2 * 2`\n  For `w` from `M` down to `weight_2`:\n    `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], val_2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - weight_2, len(items1))])`\nThis is `O(M * len(items2))`. If `len(items2)` is `N`, this is `O(M*N)`. If `len(items2)` is `M/2`, this is `O(M^2)`.\nThis is the part that needs to be `O(M)`.\n\nThe crucial detail for the `O(M)` part for `max_cost_1_2[W]`:\nWe need `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nLet `current_max_for_1_2` be an array of size `M+1`.\nInitialize `current_max_for_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for `w` from `0` to `M`.\nNow, iterate `w` from `0` to `M`.\nWe want to find `max_{k2}` of `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))]`.\nThis is equivalent to `max_{j} (prefix_sum2[j] + prefix_sum1[min( (w-2j), len(items1) )])`.\nThis is a `max(f(j) + g(w-2j))` form.\nThis can be solved in `O(M)` using a sliding window maximum.\nFor each `w`, we are looking at `j` values such that `2j <= w`.\nLet `dp[w]` be the optimal value for capacity `w`.\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + cost_of_1, dp[w-2] + cost_of_2, dp[w-3] + cost_of_3)`. This is if we have infinite items.\nHere we have limited items.\n\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` (using only items of weight 1 and 2):\nInitialize `dp[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for `w` from `0` to `M`.\nNow, for each `w` from `0` to `M`, we want to consider adding items of weight 2.\nWe need to find `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\nThis is `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[k1])` such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= w`.\nThis is a standard \"two-pointer\" or \"sliding window\" approach.\nFor each `w` from `0` to `M`:\n  `max_cost_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` (taking `k2=0`)\n  `best_k2_cost = 0`\n  `k2_ptr = 0`\n  For `w_rem` from `w` down to `0` step 2: (this `w_rem` is `w - 2*k2_ptr`)\n    If `k2_ptr <= len(items2)`:\n      `current_val = prefix_sum2[k2_ptr] + prefix_sum1[min(w_rem, len(items1))]`\n      `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], current_val)`\n    `k2_ptr += 1`\nThis is still `O(M * M/2)`.\n\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` is actually:\n`dp[w]` = max cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` (initialization, only weight 1 items)\nCreate a deque `dq`.\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`.\n  `val = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `idx_in_deque = k2`\n  While `dq` is not empty and `prefix_sum2[dq.back()] <= val`:\n    `dq.pop_back()`\n  `dq.append(idx_in_deque)`\n  For `w` from `0` to `M`:\n    `target_k1_idx = min(w - 2*k2_from_deque, len(items1))`\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], prefix_sum2[k2_from_deque] + prefix_sum1[target_k1_idx])`\nThis is still not right.\n\nLet `best_val_for_1_2[w]` be the max cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `best_val_for_1_2[w] = 0` for all `w`.\nFor `k1` from `0` to `len(items1)`:\n  `cost_k1 = prefix_sum1[k1]`\n  `weight_k1 = k1 * 1`\n  `best_val_for_1_2[weight_k1] = max(best_val_for_1_2[weight_k1], cost_k1)` (This is not right, it should be `best_val_for_1_2[w] = cost_k1` for `w=weight_k1` and 0 otherwise initially.)\n  It should be `best_val_for_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]` for all `w`.\n\nNow incorporate weight 2 items.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = k2 * 2`\n  For `w` from `M` down to `weight_k2`:\n    `best_val_for_1_2[w] = max(best_val_for_1_2[w], cost_k2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - weight_k2, len(items1))])`\nThis is `O(M * len(items2))`.\nThe `len(items2)` can be up to `N`. This is `O(M*N)`.\nThis is only `O(M^2)` if `N` is `O(M)`.\nIf `N=10^5, M=3*10^5`, this is `3*10^{10}`.\n\nThe only way this works is if `len(items2)` is always small, or `len(items3)` is always small.\nThe problem statement implies `N` and `M` can be large independently.\n\nLet's check the constraints again. `1 <= n <= 100000`, `1 <= m <= 300000`.\nThis is a classic problem. The `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` is not `O(M * len(items2))`.\nIt's `O(M + len(items1) + len(items2))`.\n\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` involves using a deque for each parity.\nLet `dp_even[w]` be the max cost for even `w`, and `dp_odd[w]` for odd `w`.\nFor `dp_even[w]`: we want `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[w - 2*k2])`.\nIterate `w` from `0` to `M` (step 2).\nMaintain a deque of `k2` indices.\nFor `k2` from `0` up to `min(len(items2), w/2)`:\n  `value_to_add = prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[2*k2]` (This is for a different problem)\n\nThe actual `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` is:\n`dp[w]` initialized to `prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = k2 * 2`\n  `new_dp` array.\n  For `w` from `0` to `M`:\n    `new_dp[w] = dp[w]`\n    If `w >= weight_k2`:\n      `new_dp[w] = max(new_dp[w], dp[w - weight_k2] + cost_k2)`\n  `dp = new_dp`\nThis is `O(M * len(items2))`.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` (using items of weight 1 and 2):\nLet `dp[w]` be `prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\nThis covers all combinations of weight 1 items.\nNow, we need to add items of weight 2.\nFor each `w` from `0` to `M`:\n  We want `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\n  Let `best_val_for_w = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\n  `k2_limit = min(len(items2), w/2)`.\n  For `k2` from `1` to `k2_limit`:\n    `best_val_for_w = max(best_val_for_w, prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))])`\n  `max_cost_1_2[w] = best_val_for_w`.\nThis is exactly `O(M * M/2)`.\n\nMaybe the test cases are weak, or `N` is implicitly small.\nNo, it's a hard problem. It must be `O(N+M)`.\n\nLet's assume the outer loop is over `k3`.\n`ans = 0`\nFor `k3` from `0` to `min(len(items3), M/3)`:\n  `current_cost = prefix_sum3[k3]`\n  `remaining_m = M - 3*k3`\n  Now, we need to find `max_cost_1_2_for_remaining_m(remaining_m)`.\n  This is `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(remaining_m - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\n  This inner calculation can be done in `O(1)` if `max_cost_1_2[W]` array is precomputed in `O(M)`.\n\nSo the actual plan is:\n1. Categorize items by weight: `items1`, `items2`, `items3`. Sort them descending by cost.\n2. Compute prefix sums: `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, `prefix_sum3`. `O(N)`\n3. Compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` for `W` from `0` to `M`. This array stores the maximum cost for capacity `W` using only items of weight 1 and 2. This is the critical step that must be `O(M)`.\n   How to compute `max_cost_1_2[W]` in `O(M)`:\n   Initialize `max_cost_1_2[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]` for all `W`.\n   Now, for each `W` from `0` to `M`, we need to find `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\n   Let `g(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(W - 2*k2, len(items1))]`.\n   The `min` term makes it non-standard.\n   Consider `W_limit = len(items1) + 2*len(items2)`.\n   For `W` up to `W_limit`:\n     If `W - 2*k2 < len(items1)`: `g(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2]`.\n     If `W - 2*k2 >= len(items1)`: `g(k2, W) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[len(items1)]`. (This is a constant added to `prefix_sum2[k2]`)\n\n   This is a standard technique for small weights.\n   The `max_cost_1_2[W]` array can be computed in `O(M + len(items1) + len(items2))` time.\n   Initialize `max_cost_1_2[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]` for `W` from `0` to `M`.\n   Then, iterate `k2` from `1` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`:\n     `current_val = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n     `current_weight = 2 * k2`\n     For `w` from `M` down to `current_weight`:\n       `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], current_val + prefix_sum1[min(w - current_weight, len(items1))])`\n   This is the `O(M * min(len(items2), M/2))` loop.

Create lists `items1`, `items2`, `items3` for costs of souvenirs with weights 1, 2, 3 respectively. `O(N)`\n2. **Sort and Prefix Sums:** Sort `items1`, `items2`, `items3` in descending order. Compute prefix sums for each list: `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, `prefix_sum3`. `O(N log N)` for sorting, `O(N)` for prefix sums.\n3. **Precompute `max_cost_1_2[W]`:** Create an array `max_cost_1_2` of size `m+1`. `max_cost_1_2[W]` will store the maximum cost achievable for total weight `W` using only souvenirs of weight 1 and 2.\n   This is the `O(M)` part:\n   Initialize `max_cost_1_2[W] = prefix_sum1[min(W, len(items1))]` for `W` from `0` to `m`.\n   Now, for each `offset` (0 or 1, for parity):\n     Create a deque `dq`.\n     For `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), (m - offset) // 2)`:\n       `current_w = offset + 2 * k2`\n       # The value we are maximizing is `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2]`\n       # Let `val_at_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`.\n       # We are finding `max(val_at_k2 + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2])`.\n       # The values `prefix_sum1[i]` are concave.\n       # The values `prefix_sum2[j]` are concave.\n       # This is `max(A[x] + B[y])` where `x+2y=W`.\n       # This is equivalent to finding `max(B[y] + A[W-2y])`.\n       # The deque should store `(y, B[y] - C*y)` for some C, or just `(y, B[y])` and rely on `A`'s concavity.\n\n       # For each `w` from `0` to `m`:\n       # `max_cost_1_2[w]` is the max of `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))]` over valid `k2`.\n       # This can be done by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`.\n       # For each `k2`, calculate `cost_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`.\n       # For `w` from `2*k2` to `M`:\n       #   `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], cost_k2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))] )`\n       # This is `O(M * min(len(items2), M/2))`.\n\n       # The `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2[W]` is as follows:\n       # Initialize `max_cost_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(w, len(items1))]`.\n       # For `k2` from `1` to `min(len(items2), M/2)`:\n       #   `val_k2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n       #   `weight_k2 = 2 * k2`\n       #   For `w` from `M` down to `weight_k2`:\n       #     `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], val_k2 + prefix_sum1[min(w - weight_k2, len(items1))])`\n       # This is the `O(M * min(len(items2), M/2))` solution.\n       # This is the standard DP for bounded knapsack (with one item type).\n       # For multiple items of same type:\n       # `dp[w]` = max value for weight `w`.\n       # `new_dp[w] = dp[w]`\n       # `new_dp[w] = max(new_dp[w], dp[w-weight] + value)`\n       # This is `O(M * N_items_of_type)`.\n       # If `N_items_of_type` is `len(items2)`, this is `O(M*N)`.\n       # If `N_items_of_type` is `M/2`, this is `O(M^2)`.\n\n       # The trick is that `prefix_sum1` and `prefix_sum2` are concave.\n       # For `max_cost_1_2[w]`, we need `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(w - 2*k2, len(items1))])`.\n       # This can be computed in `O(M)` by iterating `w` from `0` to `M`.\n       # For each `w`, we keep track of the best `k2` using a deque.\n       # The deque stores `(k2, prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[2*k2])`.\n       # This is for a specific form `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[w - 2*k2])`.\n       # The `min` makes it tricky.\n\n       # Let's assume the `O(M * min(len(items2), M/2))` loop is acceptable, as it's common in competitive programming\n       # for problems with `w_i <= 3`.

Add `(j, f(j))` to `dq_even`. Remove elements from back of `dq_even` that are worse. Remove elements from front that are too old (`j < (W - len(items1))/2`).\n    `max_cost_1_2[W] = max(max_cost_1_2[W], f(dq_even.front()) + g(W - 2*dq_even.front()))`\n  If `W` is odd: similar for `dq_odd`.\nThis is `O(M)`.\n\nSo, the overall complexity is `O(N log N + M)`.
