    "thought": "**The Heart of the Matter: Navigating the \"Tree Sum\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"Tree Sum\" challenge. My objective is to figure out `sum(d(1, n))` across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, doing the modulus dance with 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the playing field. We've got `n` vertices in a tree, numbered 1 to `n`, where each edge has a weight of either `1` or `-1`. A \"good\" tree is one where, for every vertex, the product of the edge weights incident to it is `-1`. The `d(u, v)` value is the sum of edge weights along the unique path from `u` to `v`.\n\nThe quest begins by cracking the code for a \"good\" tree. Let's call the edge weight `w(e)`. The condition is that `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` for all vertices `i`. Let's denote the product for each vertex as `P_i`.  The product across all vertices must equal 1 (an even number of `-1` terms). This means that `n` must be even - an important early finding!  If `n` is odd, we're out of luck, and the answer is `0`.\n\nNow, if `n` is even, a solution *could* exist.  The number of tree structures is given by Cayley's formula, which states there are `n^(n-2)` possible configurations.  For any given structure, the \"good\" weight assignment is unique! So, we simply need to count the good trees.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about computing `sum(d(1,n))` across these good trees. I start by breaking this up: for a given edge (u, v) on the path from 1 to n, I sum the weights assigned over all trees. This sum is over trees where u and n reside in distinct components when edge (u, v) is removed.\n\nA key revelation now emerges: We can compute the weight for each edge. Let's suppose that the number of vertices in 1's component when edge (u, v) is removed is k. The weight of edge (u,v) on the path from 1 to n is (-1)^k. Thus, to compute the total sum, I need to count trees where a path from 1 to n has an edge, such that when the path is removed, 1 will be in a component with size k.\nThus, `sum_{T good} d(1,n) = sum_{k=1 to n-1} (-1)^k * (number of trees T such that the edge (u, v) is on path P(1,n) and size(1, (u,v)) = k)`.\n\nFinally, I use a handy formula from the land of labeled trees. Given a spanning tree on the vertices, and picking some vertex for the root, and letting edge (u,v) be on path P(1,n), if 1 has size k when edge (u, v) is removed, that number is `binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`. By computing `(-1)^k` times this value for `k=1` to `n-1`, I get the solution, which can then be reduced modulo 998244353.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree has edges with weights `1` or `-1`. A tree is \"good\" if for each vertex `i`, the product of the weights of all edges incident to `i` is `-1`. `d(u,v)` is the sum of edge weights on the unique simple path between `u` and `v`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the \"good\" tree condition. Let `w(e)` be the weight of an edge `e`. For each vertex `i`, we are given `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1`.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the left side, each edge `e = (u,v)` is incident to exactly two vertices (`u` and `v`), so its weight `w(e)` appears twice in the product. Thus, the left side is `product_{e in E} (w(e))^2`. Since `w(e)` is either `1` or `-1`, `(w(e))^2 = 1` for all edges.\nSo, `product_{e in E} 1 = 1`.\nEquating the two sides, we get `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, there are no good trees, and thus the sum `d(1,n)` over all good trees is `0`. This explains the example for `n=1`.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nFor a fixed tree structure `T` (i.e., the set of edges without weights), let's determine how many ways there are to assign weights `w(e) in {1, -1}` such that `T` is good.\nLet `y_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1` and `y_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1`. The condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` translates to `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)` with `n-1` variables (one `y_e` for each edge).\nThe matrix of this system is the incidence matrix of the tree. The rank of the incidence matrix of a tree over `GF(2)` is `n-1`. Since `n` is even, the sum of the right-hand sides `sum_{i=1 to n} 1 = n` is `0 (mod 2)`. This matches the linear dependency of the rows of the incidence matrix (sum of rows is `0` vector), so the system is consistent.\nSince the rank is `n-1` and there are `n-1` variables, there is a unique solution for `y_e` (and thus a unique assignment of `w(e)` values) for any given tree structure `T`.\nTherefore, for `n` even, the number of good trees is exactly `n^(n-2)` (the number of distinct tree structures on `n` labeled vertices by Cayley's formula).\n\nNext, we need to determine the weight `w(e)` for an edge `e=(u,v)` in a good tree `T`.\nRemove `e=(u,v)`. The tree `T` splits into two connected components, say `T_u` containing `u` and `T_v` containing `v`. Let `|T_u|` be the number of vertices in `T_u`.\nFor any vertex `x` in `T_u` (excluding `u`), the product of weights of edges incident to `x` within `T_u` is `-1`. The same holds for `T_v`.\nConsider the product of `P_x` for all `x` in `T_u`.\n`product_{x in T_u} P_x = product_{x in T_u} (product_{e' incident to x} w(e'))`.\nAs derived earlier, this product equals `w(u,v)` (since `(u,v)` is the only edge connecting `T_u` to `T_v`).\nAlso, `product_{x in T_u} P_x = product_{x in T_u} (-1) = (-1)^{|T_u|}`.\nThus, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u|}`. Similarly, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_v|}`.\nSince `|T_u| + |T_v| = n` and `n` is even, `|T_u|` and `|T_v|` must have the same parity, so `(-1)^{|T_u|} = (-1)^{|T_v|}`.\nSo, for any edge `e=(u,v)` in a good tree `T`, its weight `w(e)` is `(-1)^k`, where `k` is the size of one of the components formed by removing `e`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T good} d(1, n)`.\nBy linearity of summation, this is `sum_{T good} sum_{e on P_T(1,n)} w_T(e)`.\nLet `P_T(1,n)` denote the unique path between `1` and `n` in tree `T`.\nFor an edge `e=(u,v)` on `P_T(1,n)`, let `k_e` be the size of the component containing vertex `1` when `e` is removed from `T`. Then `w_T(e) = (-1)^{k_e}`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{T good} sum_{e on P_T(1,n)} (-1)^{k_e}`.\nWe can swap the summation order: `sum_{k=1 to n-1} (-1)^k * (number of good trees T such that there is an edge e on P_T(1,n) with k_e = k)`.\nThe condition \"there is an edge `e` on `P_T(1,n)` with `k_e = k`\" means that removing `e` separates `1` from `n`, `1` is in the component of size `k`, and `n` is in the component of size `n-k`. For each tree `T`, there is exactly one such edge `e` on `P_T(1,n)` for each `k` in `1, ..., n-1`.\nSo we need to count the number of good trees `T` such that `1` is in a component of size `k` and `n` is in the other component of size `n-k` when some edge `e` on `P_T(1,n)` is removed.\nLet `N(k)` be the number of (unweighted) trees on `n` labeled vertices such that vertices `1` and `n` are in different components when some edge is removed, and the component containing `1` has size `k`.\nA standard result in enumerating trees states that `N(k) = binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\nSince each tree structure corresponds to exactly one good tree (for `n` even), the number of good trees with this property is also `N(k)`.\n\nThus, the total sum is `sum_{k=1 to n-1} (-1)^k * N(k)`.\n`sum_{k=1 to n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\n\nLet's verify with the examples:\n-   **n = 1**: Odd, so answer is `0`. Correct.\n-   **n = 2**: Even. `k` can only be `1`.\n    `N(1) = binom(2-2, 1-1) * 1^(1-1) * (2-1)^(2-1-1) = binom(0,0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n    Sum = `(-1)^1 * N(1) = -1 * 1 = -1`. Modulo 998244353, this is `998244352`. Correct.\n-   **n = 4**: Even. `k` can be `1, 2, 3`.\n    `N(1) = binom(4-2, 1-1) * 1^(1-1) * (4-1)^(4-1-1) = binom(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = 1 * 1 * 9 = 9`.\n    `N(2) = binom(4-2, 2-1) * 2^(2-1) * (4-2)^(4-2-1) = binom(2,1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n    `N(3) = binom(4-2, 3-1) * 3^(3-1) * (4-3)^(4-3-1) = binom(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = 1 * 9 * 1 = 9`.\n    Sum = `(-1)^1 * N(1) + (-1)^2 * N(2) + (-1)^3 * N(3)`\n    `= -9 + 8 - 9 = -10`. Modulo 998244353, this is `998244343`. Correct.\n\nThe formula is correct. We need to compute this sum modulo 998244353.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\nWe need factorials and inverse factorials for `binom(n,k)`.\n`binom(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.\n`x^y` can be computed using modular exponentiation.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `5 * 10^5`.\nWe need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `n-2`.\nThe loop runs `n-1` times. Inside the loop, we do a few multiplications and modular exponentiations.\nModular exponentiation `a^b mod M` takes `O(log b)` time. Here `b` can be up to `n-1`.\nSo, the total time complexity would be `O(n log n)`. This is efficient enough.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  If `n` is odd, print `0`.\n3.  If `n` is even:\n    a.  Initialize `MOD = 998244353`.\n    b.  Precompute factorials `fact[i]` and inverse factorials `invfact[i]` up to `n-2`.\n        `invfact[i] = pow(fact[i], MOD-2, MOD)` using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n    c.  Define a function `nCr(n, r)` using precomputed factorials.\n        `nCr(n, r) = fact[n] * invfact[r] % MOD * invfact[n-r] % MOD`. Handle `r < 0` or `r > n` returning `0`.\n    d.  Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n    e.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n        i.   Calculate `term = nCr(n-2, k-1)`.\n        ii.  Calculate `k_pow = pow(k, k-1, MOD)`. If `k-1 == 0`, `k_pow` is `1`.\n        iii. Calculate `nk_pow = pow(n-k, n-k-1, MOD)`. If `n-k-1 == 0`, `nk_pow` is `1`.\n        iv.  `N_k = term * k_pow % MOD * nk_pow % MOD`.\n        v.   If `k` is odd, `total_sum = (total_sum - N_k + MOD) % MOD`.\n        vi.  If `k` is even, `total_sum = (total_sum + N_k) % MOD`.\n    f.  Print `total_sum`.\n\nSpecial cases for `pow(base, exponent, mod)`:\n-   `0^0` is typically `1` in combinatorics. Python's `pow(0,0)` is `1`.\n-   `k-1` can be `0` when `k=1`. `pow(1,0,MOD)` is `1`.\n-   `n-k-1` can be `0` when `n-k=1`. `pow(1,0,MOD)` is `1`.\nThese are handled correctly by `pow(base, exponent, MOD)` in Python.\n\nExample `n=1`: `n` is odd, output `0`.\nExample `n=2`: `n` is even. Loop `k=1`.\n`nCr(0,0)=1`. `pow(1,0,MOD)=1`. `pow(1,0,MOD)=1`.\n`N_1 = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n`k=1` is odd, `total_sum = (0 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 998244352`.
