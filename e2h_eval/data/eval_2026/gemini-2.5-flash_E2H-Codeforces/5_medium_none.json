Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.** The problem, \"Colored Boots,\" seems like a classic matching problem. We've got `n` left boots and `n` right boots, each with a color represented by a letter or a question mark. Our goal is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs, where compatibility means either the colors are identical or one (or both) is a '?'. We also need to print the indices of these pairs.\n\nSince `n` can go up to 150,000, we can't use a brute-force approach. A greedy strategy is the way to go. We can treat this as a bipartite matching problem, but an efficient implementation is required. The key is prioritizing the most restrictive matches first.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n**1. Categorization & Prioritization:**\n\nWe need a systematic way to manage the boots. We can categorize them based on their color (from 'a' to 'z' and '?'). I can use 27 categories.\n\nNow, let's think about the best way to match these boots.\n*   **The Most Restrictive:** Matching specific color boots (e.g., 'a' with 'a') is the most restrictive and highest priority.\n*   **Moderately Restrictive:** Matching a specific color with a '?' (e.g., 'a' with '?') is next because once a specific color matches a '?', that '?' can no longer be used.\n*   **The Least Restrictive:** Matching '?' with '?' is the last step.\n\n**2. Data Structure:**\n\nWe can use a dictionary or hash map to store the indices of the boots for each color. This will make lookups very fast, O(1).\n*   `left_indices[color]` : a list of 1-indexed indices for left boots of that `color`.\n*   `right_indices[color]` : a list of 1-indexed indices for right boots of that `color`.\n\n**3. Matching Algorithm:**\n\nI'll follow these three phases:\n\n*   **Phase 1: Specific Color Matches:**\n    *   Iterate through each specific color ('a' to 'z').\n    *   If there are boots for this color on *both* left and right, pair them up until one side runs out.\n*   **Phase 2: Specific with '?':**\n    *   After the specific matches, any remaining specific-colored boots on *either* side *must* match with '?'.\n    *   Match these boots with '?'.\n*   **Phase 3: '?' with '?':**\n    *   Finally, match any remaining '?' boots with each other.\n\n**4. Optimality Reasoning:**\n\nWhy does this greedy strategy give us the optimal solution? Let's reason this out.\n\nIf we match a specific color with its counterpart, there is no other outcome to choose other than a guaranteed match with the most restricted. It does not prevent any better match.\nMatching a specific color boot with a '?' boot satisfies the constraints as best as possible for that boot. A '?' has maximum flexibility and if no `specific` can be found, let's match with a '?' and increase the count.\nMatching '?' with '?' boots happens only when there are no other options.\n\nIn short, this algorithm maximizes the number of pairs by prioritizing the most constrained matches, which helps us ensure no matches are wasted.\nThe example walk-through I did, validates this approach.\n\n**In summary, this seems like the best approach to get the optimal solution to the \"Colored Boots\" problem. I am ready to translate this into code!**\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to print these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, represented by strings `l` and `r`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy strategy. The core idea is to prioritize matches that are most restrictive first, leaving more flexible options for later.\n\nLet's categorize the boots by color: specific colors ('a'-'z') and the indefinite color ('?'). We can store the 1-indexed indices of boots for each color in separate lists.\n\n`left_indices[char]` will be a list of indices of left boots with color `char`.\n`right_indices[char]` will be a list of indices of right boots with color `char`.\n\nThe greedy strategy proceeds in three phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Match specific colors with identical specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a').**\nThese are the most restrictive matches. A left boot of color 'a' can only match a right boot of color 'a' or '?'. If it matches a '?', it uses up a flexible boot. If it matches an 'a', it uses up a boot that is equally restrictive. By matching 'a' with 'a' first, we ensure that specific boots that *must* match each other do so, freeing up '?' boots for other purposes.\nFor each color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n  While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n    Form a pair `(left_boot_c_index, right_boot_c_index)`.\n\n**Phase 2: Match specific colors with indefinite colors ('?' with specific color).**\nAfter Phase 1, any remaining specific-colored boot (e.g., a left 'a' boot) can no longer find a matching specific-colored boot (e.g., a right 'a' boot). Its only remaining option for a compatible match is a '?' boot. Prioritizing these matches ensures that specific boots, which have limited compatibility options, get matched.\nIterate through colors `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n  While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right '?' boots:\n    Form a pair `(left_boot_c_index, right_boot_question_mark_index)`.\n  While there are available right boots of color `c` AND available left '?' boots:\n    Form a pair `(left_boot_question_mark_index, right_boot_c_index)`.\n\n**Phase 3: Match indefinite colors with indefinite colors ('?' with '?').**\nFinally, any remaining '?' boots can be matched with each other. These are the least restrictive matches, so they are handled last.\nWhile there are available left '?' boots AND available right '?' boots:\n  Form a pair `(left_boot_question_mark_index, right_boot_question_mark_index)`.\n\n**Why this greedy strategy is optimal:**\nThe strategy works by satisfying the most constrained requirements first.\n- `c`-`c` matches are the most restrictive because both boots have a specific color. If we don't match them, they would either remain unmatched or one would match a `?`. If `L_c` matches `R_?` and `R_c` matches `L_?`, we could instead match `L_c` with `R_c` and `L_?` with `R_?`, resulting in the same number of pairs but potentially freeing up `L_?` or `R_?` for other specific boots that might not have a `c`-`c` match.\n- `c`-`?` matches are next because the specific boot `c` has limited options. If `L_c` doesn't match `R_c` (because all `R_c` are exhausted), its only option is `R_?`. By using `R_?` for `L_c`, we satisfy `L_c` and use a flexible `R_?` for a less flexible `L_c`. This is better than using `R_?` for `L_?` if `L_c` is still available, because `L_?` is more flexible and could potentially match `R_c` (if `R_c` is still available and `L_c` is exhausted).\n- `?`-`?` matches are the least restrictive. Both boots are flexible. They are matched last, using up any remaining flexible boots.\n\nThis ensures that no specific boot that *could* be matched is left unmatched in favor of a less restrictive match that could have been made in another way.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use a dictionary or a list of lists (indexed by character code) to store indices for each color.\n- Python's `list.pop()` method is efficient for removing elements from the end of a list, which is suitable here as the order of indices for a given color doesn't affect correctness.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed indices of boots for each color\n    # Using lists for each char to allow popping\n    left_indices = {chr(ord('a') + i): [] for i in range(26)}\n    left_indices['?'] = []\n    right_indices = {chr(ord('a') + i): [] for i in range(26)}\n    right_indices['?'] = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Phase 1: Match specific colors with identical specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a')\n    for char_code in range(26):\n        char = chr(ord('a') + char_code)\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Match specific colors with indefinite colors ('?' with specific color)\n    for char_code in range(26):\n        char = chr(ord('a') + char_code)\n        # Left specific, Right '?'\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n        \n        # Left '?', Right specific\n        while left_indices['?'] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: Match indefinite colors with indefinite colors ('?' with '?')\n    while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n        l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Print results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
