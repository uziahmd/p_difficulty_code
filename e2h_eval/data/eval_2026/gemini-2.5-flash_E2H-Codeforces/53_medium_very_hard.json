    "thought": "**Algorithm Refinement for Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem where the goal is to find the length of the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string. Overlaps are allowed, which adds a bit of a wrinkle. I'm dealing with a string of lowercase letters, and its length is capped at 100. That constraint is key; it hints that a brute-force approach, even one with a polynomial time complexity like O(N^3) or even O(N^4), is likely acceptable.\n\nI started by breaking down some examples: \"abcd\" has no repeats, so length is 0. \"ababa\" has \"aba\" as the longest repeat, with a length of 3. \"zzz\" has \"zz\" with length 2. Thinking this through, a substring’s length could range from 1 to N-1 (it can't be N, because the *entire* string is, by definition, unique unless it's repeated from the start).\n\nThe initial approach involves checking all possible substrings and counting their occurrences. I initially considered iterating through potential substring lengths from N-1 down to 1, but I'll optimize that later. For now, the core idea is to see for each substring of length 'k', how many occurrences of length 'k' are in the input string. If any appear more than once, note the length and store the largest length 'k' seen. My first algorithm had this structure:\n1. Initialize the longest repeated substring length to 0.\n2. Iterate from the longest possible substring length (N-1) down to 1.\n3. For each possible length, look for two *distinct* start locations for this length.\n\nI then realized that instead of starting from length N-1, I could simply start with a substring of length 1, as the longest repeat would be discovered sooner. The problem statement says the substring must be \"met in the string\". That means there must be an index after the first instance.\n\nThe refined approach has a \"brute-force with two pointers\":\n1. For each character (starting with the first) as a potential starting position of the first occurrence of this substring, I look for a second.\n2. For each second character and location in the string, I compare and increment the matching substring length if there's a match.\n3. Keep track of maximum length.\n\nTo make things more concrete, with two pointers, I iterate over all combinations of starting locations of matching substrings, and find the longest common prefix. The complexity is O(N^3). It seems robust. After testing with some test examples, my thoughts are that this is a straightforward string problem, with its complexity hidden by the phrase \"very hard\". Given the small string length limit, the brute-force nested loop can still result in a valid solution. I also thought about edge cases like string length one, or a string filled with the same characters, and the approach works there too.\nI need to be careful with the details of implementation, like properly indexing the string and the nested loops. The code should properly read from standard input and provide results to standard output, as required by competitive programming platforms.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. The input string consists of lower-case Latin letters and its length `N` is at most 100.\n\nGiven the small constraint on the string length (`N <= 100`), an `O(N^3)` solution will be efficient enough.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `max_len = 0`. This variable will store the maximum length found so far.\n2.  We need to find two occurrences of the same substring. Let these occurrences start at indices `i` and `j` respectively. To ensure we are looking for distinct occurrences (even if they overlap), we require `j > i`.\n3.  Iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for the first occurrence from `0` to `N-1`.\n4.  For each `i`, iterate through all possible starting positions `j` for the second occurrence from `i+1` to `N-1`. This guarantees `j` is always greater than `i`.\n5.  For each pair `(i, j)`, we want to find the length of the longest common prefix between the substring starting at `s[i]` and the substring starting at `s[j]`. Let's call this `current_common_len`.\n    *   Initialize `current_common_len = 0`.\n    *   While both `i + current_common_len` and `j + current_common_len` are within the bounds of the string (`< N`) AND the characters at `s[i + current_common_len]` and `s[j + current_common_len]` are equal:\n        *   Increment `current_common_len`.\n6.  After the inner loop finishes, `current_common_len` holds the length of the longest substring that starts at `i` and also starts at `j`. Update `max_len = max(max_len, current_common_len)`.\n7.  After checking all possible pairs `(i, j)`, `max_len` will contain the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (s = \"ababa\", N = 5):**\n\n*   `max_len = 0`\n*   **i = 0**:\n    *   **j = 1**: `s[0]` ('a') != `s[1]` ('b'). `current_common_len = 0`. `max_len = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n    *   **j = 2**:\n        *   `s[0]` ('a') == `s[2]` ('a'). `current_common_len = 1`.\n        *   `s[1]` ('b') == `s[3]` ('b'). `current_common_len = 2`.\n        *   `s[2]` ('a') == `s[4]` ('a'). `current_common_len = 3`.\n        *   Next character check: `j + current_common_len = 2 + 3 = 5`, which is not `< N`. Loop terminates.\n        *   `max_len = max(0, 3) = 3`. (Substring \"aba\" found)\n    *   **j = 3**: `s[0]` ('a') != `s[3]` ('b'). `current_common_len = 0`. `max_len = max(3, 0) = 3`.\n    *   **j = 4**:\n        *   `s[0]` ('a') == `s[4]` ('a'). `current_common_len = 1`.\n        *   Next character check: `j + current_common_len = 4 + 1 = 5`, which is not `< N`. Loop terminates.\n        *   `max_len = max(3, 1) = 3`.\n*   **i = 1**:\n    *   **j = 2**: `s[1]` ('b') != `s[2]` ('a'). `current_common_len = 0`. `max_len = max(3, 0) = 3`.\n    *   **j = 3**:\n        *   `s[1]` ('b') == `s[3]` ('b'). `current_common_len = 1`.\n        *   `s[2]` ('a') == `s[4]` ('a'). `current_common_len = 2`.\n        *   Next character check: `j + current_common_len = 3 + 2 = 5`, which is not `< N`. Loop terminates.\n        *   `max_len = max(3, 2) = 3`. (Substring \"ba\" found, but \"aba\" is longer)\n    *   ... (other `j` values for `i=1` and subsequent `i` values will not yield a `current_common_len` greater than 3)\n*   Final `max_len = 3`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nThe outer loop runs `N` times. The middle loop runs up to `N` times. The inner `while` loop runs up to `N` times. Thus, the total time complexity is `O(N * N * N) = O(N^3)`. For `N=100`, `N^3 = 1,000,000`, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually 1-2 seconds).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input string from standard input\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    # Iterate through all possible starting positions for the first occurrence (i)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for the second occurrence (j)\n        # The second occurrence must start at an index strictly greater than the first (j > i)\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            # Find the length of the common prefix between s[i:] and s[j:]\n            current_common_len = 0\n            # Continue as long as we are within string bounds and characters match\n            while (i + current_common_len < n and\n                   j + current_common_len < n and\n                   s[i + current_common_len] == s[j + current_common_len]):\n                current_common_len += 1\n            \n            # Update max_len if this common prefix is longer than any found so far\n            max_len = max(max_len, current_common_len)\n            \n    # Print the result to standard output\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_len) + '\\n')\n\n# This block ensures the solve() function is called when the script is executed.\n# In competitive programming, typically one input string is processed per run,\n# or multiple strings are provided, one per line, and the solution reads them\n# until EOF or a specific count.
