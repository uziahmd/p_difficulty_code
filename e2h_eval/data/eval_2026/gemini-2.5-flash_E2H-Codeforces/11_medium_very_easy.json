A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Soft Drinking\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need a script to figure out the maximum number of toasts each friend can have.  I've got the number of friends (`n`), drinks (`k`), limes (`c`), salt (`p`), and the requirements per toast (drink amount `nl`, lime slices (1) and salt `np`).\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total resources available. For the drink, it's `k * l` milliliters.  Limes are `c * d` slices.  And salt is just `p` grams.\n\nThen, I need to figure out how many *individual* toasts I can make with each resource:\n*   Drink: `(k * l) // nl` - total drink divided by drink *per toast*.\n*   Lime: `(c * d) // 1` (which is just `c * d`) - total limes *per toast*.\n*   Salt: `p // np` - total salt divided by salt *per toast*.\n\nThe *limiting factor* will be the smallest of these three values. That's the total number of \"sets\" of resources to make *individual* toasts. Then, I need to divide that by the number of friends (`n`) to find the toasts *per friend*.\n\nI'll use integer division (`//`) to ensure I get whole numbers of toasts.  I need to handle reading input, splitting it, converting to integers, and printing the output. The constraints guarantee no division by zero and all values will fit into integers, so I don't need to worry about edge cases. I'll make sure to use descriptive variable names for clarity.\n\nSo the main steps are, read the input, calculate the individual toasts possible for drink, lime and salt, find the *minimum* of these, then divide that by `n` to get the answer. Finally, print the result.\n",
