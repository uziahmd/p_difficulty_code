Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Voucher Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is pretty clear: find two vouchers that don't overlap, have a combined duration of exactly *x*, and minimize their total cost. If I can't find a pair that meets these criteria, I need to output -1.\n\nFirst, I've got to break down the input and conditions. I'm given the number of vouchers (*n*), the target duration (*x*), and details about each voucher: departure day (*li*), return day (*ri*), and cost (*costi*). The voucher duration is simply *ri - li + 1*.\n\nThe core problem lies in the selection criteria. I need two distinct vouchers (*i* and *j*) that meet the following: they don't overlap (*ri < lj* or *rj < li*), their durations sum to *x*, and their combined cost is minimized.\n\nMy first thought is a brute-force approach, checking every possible pair. However, with *n* up to 2 * 10^5, this O(N^2) solution will be far too slow. I need something more efficient, ideally O(N log N) or O(N).\n\nLet's fix one voucher, say *i*. I need to find a voucher *j* that complements it perfectly. I'm focusing on the non-intersection condition. If voucher *j* comes after *i*, I'm looking for *lj > ri*. I want to determine *lj, rj, costj* where I know the required duration *duration_j = x - duration_i*.\n\nProcessing the data with sorted values, like grouping the vouchers by their duration and checking each combination could be helpful. This sounds like the direction I want to take. So, I will create a `vouchers_by_duration` where, for any `d`, `vouchers_by_duration[d]` holds the list of `(l, r, cost)` for vouchers with duration `d`.\n",
