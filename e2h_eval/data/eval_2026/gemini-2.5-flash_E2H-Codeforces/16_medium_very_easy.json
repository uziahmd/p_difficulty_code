Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Crazy Town\" Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Crazy Town\" to tackle.  The setup is this:  we have a home base and the university, and there's a bunch of roads, which are basically just straight lines.  The goal is to figure out the *minimum* number of road crossings needed to get from home to the university. It's essentially about counting how many \"walls\" separate the two points.\n\nAfter analyzing the problem, I've got a pretty clear picture. A key insight is that the plane is divided into regions by these roads.  If the home and university are on *opposite* sides of a road, we *have* to cross that road to get there.  If they're on the same side, we don't *need* to cross. So, the number of steps is simply the number of roads that separate them.\n\nHere's my logic: a road divides the space into two half-planes. If my home and university are in different half-planes for a given road, that road *must* be crossed. I realized this can be checked with a simple sign comparison:  `ax + by + c` for each point (home and university) and road.  If the signs are different, it's a mandatory crossing.  I've double-checked my work with a few examples and now I'm ready to code the solution.  I'm using Python because its arbitrary-precision integers handle the calculations without worrying about overflow issues.\n\nThe algorithm is straightforward. I read in the coordinates of the home and university, read in the road information (the coefficients for each line), and then for each road, I check if the home and university are on opposite sides.  If they are, I increment my step count.  Finally, I print the total step count. It's a clean O(N) solution where N is the number of roads and the memory complexity is also constant. I think this will do the trick! I'm ready to submit this one now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a block containing your home to a block containing the university. A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a common border of non-zero length. This implies crossing a single road.\n\nThe key insight is to determine for each road whether it separates your home from the university.\nA line defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes:\n1.  `ax + by + c > 0`\n2.  `ax + by + c < 0`\n\nIf two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of the line, then the expression `ax + by + c` will have different signs when evaluated at `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. Conversely, if they are on the same side, the expression will have the same sign.\n\nLet `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c` and `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\nSince it's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road, `val1` and `val2` will never be zero.\n*   If `val1` and `val2` have different signs (i.e., `val1 * val2 < 0`), then your home and the university are on opposite sides of this road. To get from one to the other, you *must* cross this road. This counts as one step.\n*   If `val1` and `val2` have the same sign (i.e., `val1 * val2 > 0`), then your home and the university are on the same side of this road. You can reach the university block without crossing this particular road. This road does not contribute to the minimum number of steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads that separate your home point from the university point. This is because each such road must be crossed, and each crossing corresponds to exactly one step.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the coordinates of your home `(x1, y1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of the university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val1 * val2 < 0` (meaning they have different signs), increment `steps`.\n6.  Print the final value of `steps`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1):**\n\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nRoads:\n1.  `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\n2.  `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\n\n*   **Road 1 (`y = 0`):**\n    *   For home (1,1): `val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   For university (-1,-1): `val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val1 * val2 = 1 * -1 = -1 < 0`. Signs are different. `steps` becomes 1.\n*   **Road 2 (`x = 0`):**\n    *   For home (1,1): `val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   For university (-1,-1): `val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val1 * val2 = 1 * -1 = -1 < 0`. Signs are different. `steps` becomes 2.\n\nThe final answer is 2.\n\n**Constraints and Data Types:**\nCoordinates and coefficients can be up to `10^6`.\n`a*x` can be `10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12`.\n`a*x + b*y + c` can be approximately `2 * 10^12`.\nThe product `val1 * val2` can be up to `(2 * 10^12) * (2 * 10^12) = 4 * 10^24`.\nPython's arbitrary-precision integers handle these large values automatically, so there is no risk of overflow.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) due to iterating through N roads, with constant time operations for each road. Given N <= 300, this is very efficient. The space complexity is O(1).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1_str, y1_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    x1 = int(x1_str)\n    y1 = int(y1_str)\n\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2_str, y2_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    x2 = int(x2_str)\n    y2 = int(y2_str)\n\n    # Read number of roads\n    n_str = sys.stdin.readline()\n    n = int(n_str)\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read road coefficients (a, b, c for ax + by + c = 0)\n        a_str, b_str, c_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = int(b_str)\n        c = int(c_str)\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the home point\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for the university point\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have different signs, the two points are on opposite sides of the line.\n        # This means this road separates the home and university blocks, and must be crossed.\n        # It's guaranteed that home and university are not on any road, so val1 and val2 are never zero.\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    # Output the minimum number of steps\n    sys.stdout.write(str(steps) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
