The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and the goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open. The core constraint is that a chest with a number `a_i` can only be opened by a key with a number `b_j` if their sum is odd – meaning one has to be even and the other odd.\n\nRight, so the first thing that jumps out is the concept of parity. I can immediately break down the chests and keys into two categories: even and odd. I'll need to keep track of these counts: `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`.\n\nNow, how do I actually maximize the openings? Well, if a chest is even, it *needs* an odd key, and vice-versa.  This is essentially a matching problem. Each key can only open one chest, and each chest can only be opened by one key.\n\nLet's think step-by-step.\n1. **Even Chests & Odd Keys:** I can pair even chests with odd keys.  The number of these pairings is limited by the *smaller* of the number of even chests and odd keys. This is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n2. **Odd Chests & Even Keys:** Similarly, I can pair odd chests with even keys. The number of these pairings is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two pairings are independent (even chests can't use even keys and vice versa), the total number of chests I can open is simply the sum of these two scenarios: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThis seems fairly straightforward. Let's run a quick example to confirm. The example looks good, it produces a sensible answer. And then I can try other examples.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `j` can open chest `i` if and only if the sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two scenarios for `a_i` and `b_j` to have different parities:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nLet's count the number of chests and keys for each parity:\n- `chests_even`: Number of chests with an even number `a_i`.\n- `chests_odd`: Number of chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n- `keys_even`: Number of keys with an even number `b_j`.\n- `keys_odd`: Number of keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nTo maximize the total number of opened chests, we can consider the two scenarios independently, as they use different types of chests and keys:\n\n1.  **Opening even chests with odd keys**:\n    The number of even chests available is `chests_even`.\n    The number of odd keys available is `keys_odd`.\n    Each odd key can open at most one even chest, and each even chest requires one odd key. Therefore, the maximum number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is limited by the minimum of these two counts: `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\n2.  **Opening odd chests with even keys**:\n    The number of odd chests available is `chests_odd`.\n    The number of even keys available is `keys_even`.\n    Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince the keys and chests used in scenario 1 are completely distinct from those used in scenario 2 (an even chest cannot be an odd chest, and an odd key cannot be an even key), these two sets of pairings are independent. We can simply sum the maximums from both scenarios to get the overall maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\nThe algorithm would be:\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)` and print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then a constant number of operations for the final calculation. The time complexity will be O(n + m), which is well within limits for n, m up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Maximize pairings of even chests with odd keys\n    # and odd chests with even keys\n    \n    # Number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys\n    matches_even_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys\n    matches_odd_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    # Total maximum chests opened\n    total_matches = matches_even_chests + matches_odd_chests\n    \n    print(total_matches)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
