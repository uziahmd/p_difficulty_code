Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"TV Game\" problem. It's a classic dynamic programming setup, and here's my thought process:**\n\nThe goal is to maximize the combined score of two players, Homer and Marge, who are taking turns to build their own numbers by appending digits from a given number 'A'. I realize that the order in which they take the digits matters because it impacts the place value of each digit in their final numbers. We need to figure out the optimal strategy.\n\nMy initial instinct is to go with dynamic programming. I'm thinking of creating a state that captures the relevant information about the game's progress. That state would need to know:\n1.  The index `k` of the current digit we are considering in the number `A`.\n2.  How many moves Homer `h_rem` has left to take.\n3.  How many moves Marge `m_rem` has left to take.\n\nSo my `dp` table becomes `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]`. The value stored in each state `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]` would represent the maximum total prize (combined score of Homer and Marge) achievable, starting from the `k`-th digit, with `h_rem` remaining moves for Homer, and `m_rem` for Marge.\n\n**Base Case:** If we have exhausted all the digits (k reaches `2n`), the total prize is 0. Both `h_rem` and `m_rem` must be 0 at that point.\n\n**Recursive Step:** For any state `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]`, we have two options:\n1.  Homer takes digit `A[k]`: This is only possible if `h_rem` is greater than 0. The digit `A[k]` will contribute `A[k] * 10^(h_rem - 1)` to Homer's score, because `A[k]` is the first of `h_rem` remaining moves. We then make a recursive call to `dp[k+1][h_rem-1][m_rem]` to find the best prize from the remaining digits. The total for this option is `A[k] * 10^(h_rem-1) + dp[k+1][h_rem-1][m_rem]`.\n2.  Marge takes digit `A[k]`: Similarly, this requires `m_rem` to be greater than 0. The contribution to Marge's score is `A[k] * 10^(m_rem-1)`. We make the recursive call `dp[k+1][h_rem][m_rem-1]`. The total for this option is `A[k] * 10^(m_rem-1) + dp[k+1][h_rem][m_rem-1]`.\n\nWe then compare the results of these two options and choose the one that gives the maximum prize. To make this efficient, I will memoize the results of each state in a dictionary (memoization) and also store the \"best move\" (H or M) that led to the maximum value in another dictionary (`path`).\n\nThe calculation of `10^(h_rem - 1)` and `10^(m_rem - 1)` could be precomputed to optimize the program's runtime. For n = 18, I don't think precomputing is really necessary, as that calculation fits in a standard integer.\n\nOnce the `dp` table is filled, to get the final answer, we start from the initial state `dp[0][n][n]`. We can then reconstruct the sequence of moves (the best path) by backtracking through the `path` dictionary. That gives us the desired output!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer (H) and Marge (M) to maximize their total prize, S1 + S2. They start with a 2n-digit number A. In each turn, a player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). Each player must make exactly n moves.\n\nLet's analyze the contribution of each digit. When a digit `d` is taken from A, it becomes part of either S1 or S2. The position of `d` within S1 or S2 determines its value. If a player has `k` moves remaining, and they take the current digit `d`, this `d` will be the first of these `k` digits they take. It will eventually be followed by `k-1` more digits. This means `d` will be in the `(n - k)`-th position (0-indexed from the left) of their final `n`-digit number. Its contribution to the total value will be `d * 10^(k-1)`.\n\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach. We need to keep track of:\n1.  `k`: The index of the current leftmost digit being considered in A (from 0 to 2n-1).\n2.  `h_rem`: The number of moves Homer still needs to make.\n3.  `m_rem`: The number of moves Marge still needs to make.\n\nLet `dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]` be the maximum total prize achievable considering the digits `A[k:]` (from index `k` to `2n-1`), given that Homer needs to make `h_rem` more moves and Marge needs to make `m_rem` more moves.\n\nThe base case is when `k == 2n`. This means all digits have been processed. If `h_rem` and `m_rem` are both 0, the remaining prize contribution is 0.\n\nFor a state `(k, h_rem, m_rem)`:\nThe current digit is `d = int(A[k])`.\nWe have two choices:\n\n1.  **Homer takes `d`**:\n    *   This is only possible if `h_rem > 0`.\n    *   The value contributed by `d` to Homer's number S1 will be `d * 10^(h_rem - 1)`.\n    *   The remaining problem is to solve for `(k+1, h_rem-1, m_rem)`.\n    *   The total prize for this choice is `d * 10^(h_rem - 1) + dp[k+1][h_rem-1][m_rem]`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `d`**:\n    *   This is only possible if `m_rem > 0`.\n    *   The value contributed by `d` to Marge's number S2 will be `d * 10^(m_rem - 1)`.\n    *   The remaining problem is to solve for `(k+1, h_rem, m_rem-1)`.\n    *   The total prize for this choice is `d * 10^(m_rem - 1) + dp[k+1][h_rem][m_rem-1]`.\n\n`dp[k][h_rem][m_rem]` will be the maximum of these two choices (or just one if the other is not possible). We also need to store which move ('H' or 'M') led to the maximum value to reconstruct the path.\n\n**State Space and Complexity:**\n*   `k` ranges from `0` to `2n` (2n+1 values).\n*   `h_rem` ranges from `0` to `n` (n+1 values).\n*   `m_rem` ranges from `0` to `n` (n+1 values).\nThe total number of states is `(2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1)`.\nGiven `n <= 18`, this is approximately `(37) * (19) * (19) = 13369` states.\nEach state involves a constant number of operations (two recursive calls, comparisons, arithmetic). This is efficient enough for `n=18`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Use memoization (a dictionary or 3D array) to store `dp` values.\n*   Use another dictionary `path` to store the optimal move ('H' or 'M') for each state.\n*   After computing `dp[0][n][n]`, reconstruct the sequence of moves by backtracking through the `path` dictionary starting from `(0, n, n)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a high recursion limit for deep recursion, though for n=18, 2*n=36 recursion depth is small.\n# sys.setrecursionlimit(2 * 18 + 100) # Not strictly necessary but good practice for DP\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    memo = {}\n    path = {}\n\n    def find_max_prize(k, h_rem, m_rem):\n        # Base case: All digits processed\n        if k == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n\n        # Check if this state has already been computed\n        if (k, h_rem, m_rem) in memo:\n            return memo[(k, h_rem, m_rem)]\n\n        digit = int(A[k])\n        max_val = -1  # Initialize with a value guaranteed to be less than any possible prize\n        best_move = ''\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n        if h_rem > 0:\n            # If Homer has h_rem moves left, this digit will be the (n - h_rem + 1)-th digit taken by Homer.\n            # It will be placed at position (n - h_rem) in S1 (0-indexed from left).\n            # Its value contribution is digit * 10^(h_rem - 1).\n            val_h = digit * (10**(h_rem - 1))\n            res_h = val_h + find_max_prize(k + 1, h_rem - 1, m_rem)\n\n            if res_h > max_val:\n                max_val = res_h\n                best_move = 'H'\n\n        # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n        if m_rem > 0:\n            # Similar logic for Marge\n            val_m = digit * (10**(m_rem - 1))\n            res_m = val_m + find_max_prize(k + 1, h_rem, m_rem - 1)\n\n            # If res_m is greater, or if it's equal and Homer couldn't move (to prefer Marge if H wasn't an option)\n            # Or if it's equal and we want to allow any valid path (first one found is fine)\n            if res_m > max_val:\n                max_val = res_m\n                best_move = 'M'\n            # If res_m is equal to max_val, we can keep the current best_move (H or M)\n            # The problem states \"If there are several solutions, output any of them.\"\n            # So, if max_val was already set by 'H' and res_m is equal, we can keep 'H'.\n\n        memo[(k, h_rem, m_rem)] = max_val\n        path[(k, h_rem, m_rem)] = best_move\n        return max_val\n\n    # Start the DP calculation\n    find_max_prize(0, n, n)\n\n    # Reconstruct the sequence of moves\n    result_sequence = []\n    k, h_rem, m_rem = 0, n, n\n    while k < 2 * n:\n        move = path[(k, h_rem, m_rem)]\n        result_sequence.append(move)\n        if move == 'H':\n            h_rem -= 1\n        else: # move == 'M'\n            m_rem -= 1\n        k += 1\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_sequence) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
