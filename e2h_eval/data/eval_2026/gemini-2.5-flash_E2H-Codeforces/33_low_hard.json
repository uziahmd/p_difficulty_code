You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. Let's break this down. The core is maximizing a number 'a' by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' is a one-time use, and the goal is to make 'a' as large as possible.\n\nMy initial thought is to make 'a' bigger by starting from the most significant digit. It's about finding the largest 's' digit to replace any smaller 'a' digit. Since the length of 'a' remains constant, the length of 'a' won't make a number larger.\n\nMy algorithm idea is pretty straightforward. I'll convert both strings to lists to make manipulation easier. The strategy is:\n1.  Sort the 's' digits in descending order.\n2. Iterate through each digit in 'a'.\n3. For each 'a' digit, I'll check if any 's' digits are left.\n4. If there's an 's' digit that's larger than the current 'a' digit, I replace and mark that 's' digit as used.\n5. If no 's' digit is larger, I move on to the next 'a' digit, keeping it as is.\n6. The key is to keep the number's most significant digits as large as possible. If an 's' digit is greater, replace it. Otherwise, continue to the next one.\n\nIt's about the greedy approach. If an 's' digit is greater, use it! Otherwise, it's not a useful digit for this position in the number, so skip it. It seems pretty efficient, just a single pass through 'a' and 's'. This should be an easy problem!\n",
