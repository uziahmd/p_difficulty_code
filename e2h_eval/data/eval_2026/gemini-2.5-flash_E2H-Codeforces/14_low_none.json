Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials for a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this competitive programming problem where I need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends in exactly `m` zeroes. The goal is to output the count of these `n` values and then list them in ascending order.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out how to efficiently calculate the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It's all about prime factorization, and specifically, the factors of 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, I just need to count how many pairs of 2 and 5 there are.  And I know there are always more factors of 2 than 5.  So, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of 5s.\n\nNow, I remember Legendre's formula!  I can use that to calculate the number of factors of 5 in `n!`. It's this sum: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  It continues as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to `n`.\n\nLet's look at how `Z(n)` behaves. It's non-decreasing; as `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or goes up.  Also, it only *increases* when `n` is a multiple of 5.  For example, `Z(5)` is 1, and it stays at 1 up to `Z(9)`.  Then `Z(10)` becomes 2.  So, for `n` from `5k` to `5k+4`, `Z(n)` remains constant. When `n=5k`, the increase in `Z(n)` is related to the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of `n`.\n\nMy goal is to find all `n` where `Z(n)` equals the given value `m`. I need to consider the range of `m`, which is between 1 and 100,000.  That's my upper bound.\n\nI should figure out what the maximum value of `n` might be. If `m` is 100,000, `n` is approximately 5*m = 500,000. So I should check `Z(500,000)`. It turns out to be 124998, which is much greater than m.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`, the number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nThis can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThe sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of `Z(n)`:\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n    *   For `n` values like `5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4`, the value of `Z(n)` is constant. Specifically, `Z(5k) = Z(5k+1) = Z(5k+2) = Z(5k+3) = Z(5k+4)`.\n    *   When `n` becomes `5k`, `Z(n)` increases by `v_5(5k)`, where `v_5(x)` is the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of `x`.\n    *   For example:\n        *   `Z(1)` to `Z(4)` are 0.\n        *   `Z(5)` to `Z(9)` are 1.\n        *   `Z(10)` to `Z(14)` are 2.\n        *   `Z(20)` to `Z(24)` are 4.\n        *   `Z(25)` to `Z(29)` are 6 (because `Z(24)=4`, `v_5(25)=2`, so `Z(25)=4+2=6`).\n\nWe are looking for `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\nDue to the property `Z(5k) = Z(5k+1) = Z(5k+2) = Z(5k+3) = Z(5k+4)`, if `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, then `Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` might also be `m`, provided `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5 that increase the count of zeroes beyond `m`.\nSpecifically, if `Z(n) = m` and `n` is a multiple of 5 (e.g., `n=5k`), then `Z(n-1)` would be `m - v_5(n)`. If `Z(n-1) < m`, then `n` is the smallest number for which `Z(n)=m`. Then `Z(n), Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` will all be equal to `m`. The next value `Z(n+5)` will be `m + v_5(n+5)`.\nSo, if `m` is an achievable number of zeroes, it is always achieved by exactly 5 consecutive integers `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`, where `n` is a multiple of 5.\n\nThe strategy to solve this problem is:\n1.  **Find a starting `n`**: Since `Z(n)` is roughly `n/4` or `n/5`, for `m = 100,000`, `n` could be around `400,000` to `500,000`. We can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n    *   Let's define `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function based on Legendre's formula.\n    *   Binary search for `n` in a range like `[1, 5 * m + 10]` (e.g., `[1, 500010]` for `m=100000`).\n    *   Find the smallest `low` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(low) = m`.\n2.  **Check if `m` is achievable**: After finding `low`, calculate `Z(low)`. If `Z(low) != m`, then `m` is not an achievable number of zeroes for any `n`. In this case, the answer is `k=0`.\n3.  **Output results**: If `Z(low) = m`, then `low` is the smallest integer `n` for which `Z(n) = m`. Due to the properties of `Z(n)`, we know that `Z(low), Z(low+1), Z(low+2), Z(low+3), Z(low+4)` will all be equal to `m`. The next value `Z(low+5)` will be greater than `m`.\n    So, there are exactly 5 such integers: `low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4`.\n    The output will be `k=5`, followed by these 5 integers in increasing order.\n\nLet's implement the `count_trailing_zeroes` function:\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n```\n\nNow, the main logic:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to calculate trailing zeroes in n!\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        # Check for potential overflow if i becomes very large, though for n up to ~5*10^5,\n        # i will not exceed 5^8 = 390625, which is fine.\n        # Python handles large integers automatically, so no explicit overflow check needed.\n        if i > n / 5: # Optimization to prevent i from growing unnecessarily large if n is small\n            break\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n is roughly 5 * m (since n/5 is the dominant term)\n    # Plus some buffer, e.g., 5 * m + 10 or 5 * m + 100.\n    # For m=100_000, max_n is around 500_000.\n    high = 5 * m + 100 \n    ans_n = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    # After binary search, ans_n holds the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n    # We need to check if Z(ans_n) is exactly m.\n    if ans_n == -1 or count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) != m:\n        # If no such n was found, or the smallest n gives more than m zeroes,\n        # then m is not an achievable number of zeroes.\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n    else:\n        # If Z(ans_n) == m, then ans_n is the smallest n.\n        # Due to the properties of Z(n), the next 4 integers (ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4)\n        # will also have exactly m zeroes.\n        # Z(ans_n+5) will be greater than m.\n        \n        # We need to ensure ans_n is a multiple of 5 for the pattern to hold perfectly.\n        # However, the binary search finds the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n        # If Z(ans_n) == m, then any n' from ans_n to ans_n+4 will also have m zeroes,\n        # provided ans_n is such that Z(ans_n-1) < m.\n        # The binary search ensures ans_n is the minimal such value.\n        # E.g., if m=1, binary search finds ans_n=5.
