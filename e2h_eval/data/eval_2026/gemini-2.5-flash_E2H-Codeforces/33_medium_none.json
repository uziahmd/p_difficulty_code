You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The essence of this problem is to maximize a number by strategically replacing its digits with larger digits from a given sequence, using each replacement digit at most once.**  I start by recognizing the need for a greedy approach. To make the number as large as possible, I need to prioritize the most significant digits.  I'll sort the replacement digits in descending order, making it trivial to find the largest available digit.\n\nMy strategy is straightforward: I iterate through the digits of the original number from left to right.  For each digit, I compare it with the current largest unused replacement digit. If the replacement digit is larger, I replace the current digit.  This is because replacing a more significant digit yields a greater increase in the overall value of the number. If the replacement digit is not larger, I move on, knowing that I've maximized that particular position with the best possible replacement from my remaining pool.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is this replacement condition:  `if sorted_s[s_ptr] > list_a[i]:` where `sorted_s` is the sorted list of replacement digits, `s_ptr` is a pointer to the current largest available digit, and `list_a[i]` is the current digit in the number I'm trying to maximize.  Once I use a replacement digit, I increment `s_ptr` to move to the next largest.  I also have to guard against running out of replacement digits using `s_ptr < m`.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by the sorting step (O(M log M)) and the iteration through the original number (O(N)), where N is the length of the original number and M is the length of the replacement digit sequence. This should be efficient enough, even for the constraints given. Finally, I will convert back from the character list into a string.\n",
