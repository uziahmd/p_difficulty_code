Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Card Sum Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The core idea is this: Vanya has a set of cards, and I need to figure out the fewest extra cards he needs to add to make the total sum zero. The catch is that the extra cards can be any integer between `-x` and `x`.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the *current_sum* of the cards Vanya already has. That's my starting point. The goal is to get that *current_sum* down to zero.\n\nTo minimize the number of extra cards, I need to add values that get me to zero as quickly as possible. If the *current_sum* is already zero, awesome! The answer is 0. No extra cards needed.\n\nNow, if the *current_sum* is positive, I need negative numbers to bring it down. I can add `-x` as many times as needed. And if it's negative, I need positive numbers, so I'll add `x` cards to bring it up.\n\nSo, in general, I need to figure out how many multiples of `x` (or `-x`) I need to add to get as close to zero as possible. This feels like a simple division problem with a bit of a twist. I need the *ceiling* function here.  If the *current_sum* is not exactly divisible by `x`, I need to round up to the nearest integer to make sure I *overshoot* to zero.\n\nLet's call `-current_sum` my `target_sum`.  The difference I want to cover is  `-current_sum`.\nIf `current_sum` is greater than 0, then the number of cards `k` I need is `k = ceil(current_sum / x)`.\n\nEssentially, I'm trying to figure out how many times I need to add/subtract `x` (depending on the sign of the current sum) to reach zero. The ceiling function ensures that I always reach or pass zero, using the minimal number of cards.  This seems pretty straightforward, so I'm confident I can code this up efficiently.\n",
