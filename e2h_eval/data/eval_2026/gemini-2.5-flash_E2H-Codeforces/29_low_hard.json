Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Substitutes in Number\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Substitutes in Number.\" The goal is to take an initial string of digits, `s`, and apply a series of digit-to-string replacements (queries), ultimately finding the value of the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The real challenge is avoiding the computationally expensive string manipulation that would explode memory.\n\nI need a Python script for this. The core of the problem seems to be efficiently handling the repeated replacements. Directly building the string after each query is a no-go; the string length can grow exponentially. I need a clever approach.\n\nMy initial thoughts are that I'll have to consider how the value of each digit is affected by these replacements. Each digit contributes a certain value based on its position (like tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.). When a digit is replaced by a string, this contribution changes. So, I need to track *both* the numerical value and the length (which affects the power of 10 multiplier).\n\nFor each digit from 0 to 9, I'll need to maintain two pieces of information: `val[d]` (the current numerical value of digit `d`) and `length[d]` (how many digits `d` expands into). Initially, `val[d]` is just the digit itself, and `length[d]` is 1.\n\nThe interesting part comes with the queries. If I get a query \"di -> ti\", I need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]`. The key is realizing that these replacements are *cascading*. A replacement can influence subsequent replacements. The problem is I have to replace *all* of the digit so the substitutions can be considered in order. So if `s = \"12\"` and I start with a `1 -> 3` substitution, I end up with `32`. If the next query is `3 -> 4`, I get `42`.\n\nSo how will I go about replacing the initial string `s`? I will probably have to convert the string `s` to digits. Then for each digit, I'll use `val[d]` and `length[d]` to calculate the final answer. This should avoid the string building.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become extremely long, so direct string manipulation is not feasible.\n\nThe key insight is to process the queries in *reverse order*. This allows us to determine what each digit `0-9` eventually \"becomes\" without actually constructing the intermediate strings.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each digit `d` from `0` to `9`, we want to track two pieces of information:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value that `d` contributes to the final number.\n2.  `len[d]`: The length of the string representation that `d` expands into.\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` simply represents itself:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `len[d] = 1`\n\nNow, consider processing the queries `q_1, q_2, ..., q_n` in reverse order, from `q_n` down to `q_1`.\nSuppose we are processing the query `di -> ti`. This query means that any `di` that existed in the string *at the time this query was performed* would be replaced by `ti`. Since we are processing in reverse, `val[x]` and `len[x]` for `x != di` already reflect the effects of queries `q_{i+1}, ..., q_n`.\n\nWhen we process `di -> ti`:\nWe need to calculate the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on `ti`. The string `ti` itself consists of digits. Each digit `c` within `ti` will eventually expand according to its current `val[c]` and `len[c]` (which have already been updated by later queries).\n\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, len[int(c)], MOD) + val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[int(c)]) % (MOD - 1)` (Lengths are added, and since they are exponents of 10, we take them modulo `MOD - 1` by Fermat's Little Theorem. `MOD - 1` is 1000000006. If `MOD - 1` is 0, we can use `MOD` instead, but `MOD - 1` is not 0 here). We must be careful if `new_len_di` could become `0` and cause `pow(10, 0, MOD)` to be `1` when it should be `10^X` where `X` is a large length. The problem statement says the sum of lengths of `ti` is `10^5`, so `len[d]` will not exceed `10^5 * 10^5` (if a digit `d` gets replaced by a string of 10^5 `d`s, and each `d` expands to 10^5, this could be large). `(MOD - 1)` is `10^9 + 6`. `new_len_di` can exceed `MOD - 1`. If `new_len_di` becomes 0 after modulo, it means the actual length is a multiple of `MOD - 1`. In `pow(10, X, MOD)`, if `X` is `k * (MOD - 1)`, then `10^X = (10^(MOD-1))^k = 1^k = 1 (mod MOD)`. If `X` is `0`, `10^0 = 1`. So, `X % (MOD - 1)` is correct for the exponent.\n\nAfter iterating through `ti`, we update:\n*   `val[di] = new_val_di`\n*   `len[di] = new_len_di`\n\nOnce all queries are processed in reverse, `val[d]` and `len[d]` will store the final value and length for each digit `d` as if it were to appear in the *initial* string `s`.\n\nFinally, we calculate the result for the initial string `s`.\nLet `final_ans = 0` and `current_len = 0`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n*   `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, len[int(c)], MOD) + val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `current_len = (current_len + len[int(c)]) % (MOD - 1)` (This `current_len` is not strictly needed if we are building `final_ans` by multiplying by `pow(10, len[int(c)], MOD)` for each term. The `pow(10, len[int(c)], MOD)` already handles the positional value correctly.)\n\nExample: `s = \"123\"`, `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nInitial:\n`val = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`len = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nQuery: `2 -> 00`\nReverse processing:\n`di = 2`, `ti = \"00\"`\n`new_val_2 = 0`\n`new_len_2 = 0`\n\nFor `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n`new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, len[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 0`\n`new_len_2 = (0 + len[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n\nFor `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n`new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, len[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 0`\n`new_len_2 = (1 + len[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (1 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 2`\n\nUpdate: `val[2] = 0`, `len[2] = 2`\nAfter query:\n`val = [0,1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`len = [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nFinal calculation for `s = \"123\"`:\n`final_ans = 0`\nFor `c = '1'`:\n`final_ans = (0 * pow(10, len[1], MOD) + val[1]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 1) % MOD = 1`\nFor `c = '2'`:\n`final_ans = (1 * pow(10, len[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 2, MOD) + 0) % MOD = (1 * 100 + 0) % MOD = 100`\nFor `c = '3'`:\n`final_ans = (100 * pow(10, len[3], MOD) + val[3]) % MOD = (100 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 3) % MOD = (100 * 10 + 3) % MOD = 1003`\n\nThis matches the example `123123` with `2->00` giving `10031003`. If `s` was `123`, it would be `1003`.\n\nThe sum of lengths of `ti` is `10^5`. Each `ti` is processed once. For each character in `ti`, we do a `pow` operation and some arithmetic. The `pow` operation takes `O(log(exponent))` time. The exponent is `len[int(c)]`, which can be up to `MOD - 2` (or `10^9 + 5`). So `log(10^9)` is about 30.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N * L_avg * log(MOD))` where `L_avg` is average `len[int(c)]` or `O(sum_of_lengths_of_ti_across_queries * log(MOD))`.\n`10^5 * 30` is about `3 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_MINUS_1 = 1000000006 # For exponents, by Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9\n    # val[d]: numerical value digit d expands to\n    # length[d]: length of the string digit d expands to (for power of 10)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        query_str = queries_raw[i]\n        d_char, t_str = query_str.split('->')\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        new_val_d = 0\n        new_len_d = 0\n\n        # If t_str is empty, d_int maps to an empty string, value 0, length 0\n        if not t_str:\n            val[d_int] = 0\n            length[d_int] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        # Calculate new_val_d and new_len_d based on t_str\n        # Each character 'c' in t_str refers to its already processed (by later queries) val[int(c)] and length[int(c)]\n        for char_t in t_str:\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            \n            # The current accumulated value (new_val_d) is shifted left by 10^(length[digit_t])\n            # Then the value of the current digit (val[digit_t]) is added\n            exp = length[digit_t]\n            # Handle exp = 0 separately for pow, as 10^0 = 1, but if length is 0, it means the digit disappears,\n            # so it shouldn't shift the existing number.\n            # If exp is 0, it means the digit_t expands to an empty string.\n            # In this case, it contributes 0 to the value and 0 to the length.\n            if exp == 0:\n                # If length[digit_t] is 0, it means digit_t effectively disappears.\n                # So it does not shift existing number, and does not add its value.\n                # new_val_d remains as is. new_len_d remains as is.\n                pass \n            else:\n                new_val_d = (new_val_d * pow(10, exp, MOD) + val[digit_t]) % MOD\n                new_len_d = (new_len_d + exp) % MOD_MINUS_1\n        \n        val[d_int] = new_val_d\n        length[d_int] = new_len_d\n\n    # Calculate the final result for the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        exp = length[digit_s]\n        # Same logic as above: if exp is 0, the digit disappears, contributes nothing\n        if exp == 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, exp, MOD) + val[digit_s]) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
