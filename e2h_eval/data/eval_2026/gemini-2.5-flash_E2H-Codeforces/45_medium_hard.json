There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this knockout tournament problem. The core is figuring out how many games the *winner* can play, given this funky rule about opponents needing similar game counts.  I'm thinking about it like this: the winner (me!) needs to keep playing as long as possible.  Initially, everyone has zero games, but the number of games played by the players must be very similar.\n\nThe rule's a constraint: if I've played a certain number of games, my next opponent can have at most one more or one fewer. My instinct is that I want to accumulate games, but this constraint makes that challenging.\n\nLet's call the number of games a player has `k`.  I'm trying to figure out how many games (`G`) I, as the winner `W`, can play. I have to win every game to keep going. I'm focusing on the state of the tournament. I'm imagining it at each stage based on how many games everyone has won.\n\nI realize that at first, I'm playing folks with zero games.  But to keep going, I'll need to face someone with one game, or even two. The number of players needed grows in a pattern. My thought is that the winner's maximum games directly relates to the number of total players.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of *states*: how many people have played a certain number of games. I'm starting to build a function - `f(k)` - representing the minimum number of players needed to get a winner playing `k` games. It seems it has a Fibonacci-like pattern.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if it's best to always play against those with fewer or similar games.\n\nThe sequence `N_k` shows the number of people needed to make a winner with k games. I figured out it relates to Fibonacci sequence and is `F_{k+2}`.\n\nNow, finding `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n` will give the solution! I'll implement this efficiently, using Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. We are given the total number of players `n`.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has won as `k`. Initially, all `n` players have `k=0` games won.\nThe rule states that if player A has won `k_A` games and player B has won `k_B` games, they can play only if `|k_A - k_B| <= 1`. The winner of the game then increments their `k` value by one, and the loser is eliminated.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of games played by the tournament winner. Let `W` be the winner. Suppose `W` plays `G` games in total.\n\nLet `N_k` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. We are looking for the maximum `G` such that `N_G <= n`.\n\nLet's determine the sequence `N_k`:\n- **`N_0`**: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player. So, we can set `N_0 = 1`. (Although a tournament winner playing 0 games doesn't make sense, this helps define the base cases for the recurrence.)\n- **`N_1`**: The winner plays 1 game. `W` (0 games) plays against `O` (0 games). The rule `|0-0| = 0 <= 1` is satisfied. `W` wins, having played 1 game. This requires 2 players initially. So, `N_1 = 2`.\n- **`N_2`**: The winner plays 2 games. Before its 2nd game, `W` has 1 game. `W` (1 game) needs to play against an opponent `O` (x games) such that `|1-x| <= 1`. This means `x` can be 0 or 1.\n    - If `x=0`: `W` (1 game) vs `O` (0 games). This is allowed. To get `W` to 1 game, we need `N_1` players. To get `O` to 0 games, we need `N_0` players. Total players = `N_1 + N_0 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    - If `x=1`: `W` (1 game) vs `O` (1 game). This is allowed. To get `W` to 1 game, we need `N_1` players. To get `O` to 1 game, we need `N_1` players. Total players = `N_1 + N_1 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n    To minimize players for `N_2`, we choose the first option: `N_2 = 3`.\n- **`N_k` for `k > 2`**: To get a winner `W` who has played `k` games, `W` must have played `k-1` games before its final game. `W` (k-1 games) plays against an opponent `O` (x games). The rule `|(k-1)-x| <= 1` means `x` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`. Since `O` is an opponent that `W` defeats, `O` cannot have played `k` games (otherwise `O` would be the winner with `k` games, not `W`). So `x` can be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n    - To minimize the total players, `W` should play against an opponent `O` that requires the minimum number of players to reach `x` games. Thus, we choose `x` such that `N_x` is minimized.\n    - Comparing `N_{k-2}` and `N_{k-1}`, `N_{k-2}` will always be smaller (or equal for small `k`).\n    - So, the optimal strategy for `W` to play its `k`-th game is to play against an opponent `O` who has played `k-2` games.\n    - This requires `N_{k-1}` players for `W` to reach `k-1` games, and `N_{k-2}` players for `O` to reach `k-2` games.\n    - Thus, the recurrence relation is `N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis sequence `N_k` with `N_0=1, N_1=2` is a shifted Fibonacci sequence.\nLet's list the first few terms:\n`N_0 = 1`\n`N_1 = 2`\n`N_2 = N_1 + N_0 = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`N_3 = N_2 + N_1 = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`N_4 = N_3 + N_2 = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`N_5 = N_4 + N_3 = 8 + 5 = 13`\n...\n\nThis matches the Fibonacci sequence where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, ...`\nSpecifically, `N_k = F_{k+2}`.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need an iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `N_0` or `F_2`) and `b = 2` (representing `N_1` or `F_3`).\n2. Initialize `games_played = 1` (since `N_1 = 2` players allow 1 game to be played by the winner).\n3. If `n < 2`, then no games can be played (problem states `n >= 2`). However, `n=2` directly implies 1 game.\n4. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the `N_k` sequence: `next_N = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a` to `b`.\n   c. Update `b` to `next_N`.\n   d. Increment `games_played` by 1.\n5. The final value of `games_played` is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nLet's trace with the example inputs:\n- `n = 2`:\n  - `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n  - Loop: `b (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n    - `next_N = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    - `a = 2`.\n    - `b = 3`.\n    - `games_played = 2`.\n  - Loop: `b (3) <= n (2)` is false. Loop terminates.\n  - Result: `games_played = 1`. (The loop increments `games_played` *after* checking `b <= n`. Since `N_1=2` is `<= n=2`, `games_played` becomes 2, but this corresponds to `N_2=3` which is `> n=2`. So we need to return the `games_played` value *before* the last increment if `b` exceeded `n`. A simpler way is to initialize `games_played = 0` and then check `if n >= 2`, `games_played = 1`. Then the loop takes care of it.)\n\nCorrected Algorithm for `n >= 2`:\n1. Initialize `prev_N = 1` (representing `N_0`).\n2. Initialize `curr_N = 2` (representing `N_1`).\n3. Initialize `games_played = 1`.\n4. Loop while `curr_N <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next `N_k` value: `next_N = prev_N + curr_N`.\n   b. Update `prev_N = curr_N`.\n   c. Update `curr_N = next_N`.\n   d. Increment `games_played` by 1.\n5. The final value of `games_played - 1` is the maximum number of games. (Because `games_played` is incremented one extra time when `curr_N` *exceeds* `n`).\n\nLet's re-trace with `n=2`:\n- `prev_N = 1`, `curr_N = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n- Loop: `curr_N (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n  - `next_N = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n  - `prev_N = 2`.\n  - `curr_N = 3`.\n  - `games_played = 2`.\n- Loop: `curr_N (3) <= n (2)` is false. Loop terminates.\n- Result: `games_played - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Correct for `n=2`.\n\n- `n=3`:\n  - `prev_N = 1`, `curr_N = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n  - Loop 1: `curr_N (2) <= n (3)` is true.\n    - `next_N = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    - `prev_N = 2`.\n    - `curr_N = 3`.\n    - `games_played = 2`.\n  - Loop 2: `curr_N (3) <= n (3)` is true.\n    - `next_N = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n    - `prev_N = 3`.\n    - `curr_N = 5`.\n    - `games_played = 3`.\n  - Loop 3: `curr_N (5) <= n (3)` is false. Loop terminates.\n  - Result: `games_played - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct for `n=3`.\n\n- `n=4`:\n  - `prev_N = 1`, `curr_N = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n  - Loop 1: `curr_N (2) <= n (4)` is true.\n    - `next_N = 3`, `prev_N = 2`, `curr_N = 3`, `games_played = 2`.\n  - Loop 2: `curr_N (3) <= n (4)` is true.\n    - `next_N = 5`, `prev_N = 3`, `curr_N = 5`, `games_played = 3`.\n  - Loop 3: `curr_N (5) <= n (4)` is false. Loop terminates.\n  - Result: `games_played - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct for `n=4`.\n\n- `n=10`:\n  - `prev_N = 1`, `curr_N = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n  - Loop 1: `curr_N (2) <= n (10)` is true. `games_played = 2`, `curr_N = 3`.\n  - Loop 2: `curr_N (3) <= n (10)` is true. `games_played = 3`, `curr_N = 5`.\n  - Loop 3: `curr_N (5) <= n (10)` is true. `games_played = 4`, `curr_N = 8`.\n  - Loop 4: `curr_N (8) <= n (10)` is true. `games_played = 5`, `curr_N = 13`.\n  - Loop 5: `curr_N (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n  - Result: `games_played - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. Correct for `n=10`.\n\nThis algorithm correctly matches all example cases. The number of Fibonacci numbers up to `10^18` is small (around 90), so this iterative approach is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for N_k:\n    # N_0 = 1 (a player who has played 0 games)\n    # N_1 = 2 (minimum players for winner to play 1 game)\n    # The recurrence is N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}\n\n    # Initialize with N_0 and N_1 values\n    prev_N = 1  # Corresponds to N_0\n    curr_N = 2  # Corresponds to N_1\n    \n    # games_played represents the 'k' in N_k.\n    # If curr_N is N_1, then games_played is 1.\n    games_played = 1 \n\n    # We iterate, calculating N_k values, until curr_N exceeds n.\n    # The last 'games_played' value for which curr_N <= n is our answer.\n    while curr_N <= n:\n        # Calculate the next N_k value based on the recurrence\n        next_N = prev_N + curr_N\n        \n        # Update prev_N and curr_N for the next iteration\n        prev_N = curr_N\n        curr_N = next_N\n        \n        # Increment the count of games played by the winner\n        games_played += 1\n    \n    # After the loop, curr_N is the first N_k that is greater than n.\n    # This means the last valid games_played was one step before.\n    # So, we return games_played - 1.\n    print(games_played - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
