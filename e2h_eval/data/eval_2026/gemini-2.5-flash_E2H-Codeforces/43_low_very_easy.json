He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Validating String Formation**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to craft a Python script to determine if a given string, `S`, adheres to a specific set of formation rules. Essentially, I need to act as a parser and logic engine to validate the string.\n\nThe rules are pretty well-defined, and the core of the problem lies in efficiently checking the structure and counts of characters within the string. Let me break down my thought process.\n\nFirstly, I need to visualize the string's structure. It *must* follow a rigid pattern: some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. This implies a clear order, with no intermixing allowed. This means any deviation from \"a*b*c*\" makes the string immediately invalid, so order validation will be critical.\n\nNext, I need to make sure the counts meet the criteria. There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. There also *must* be at least one 'c', as the number of 'c's has to equal either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's (or both).\n\nThe critical constraint is on the number of 'c's. It *has* to equal either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. This is the core logic I'll need to encode.\n\nTherefore, the string validation process simplifies into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Order Validation:** I will iterate through the string to confirm the order of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. I'll need to identify the transitions between these character blocks. My thought is that I should check for the starting indices for 'b' and 'c' which makes this straightforward.\n2.  **Count Validation:** I will count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. Then, I will confirm that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' and also confirm the count relationship between 'c's and either 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThat's the basic plan! A well-structured Python script should implement these checks efficiently. The `find` operation will be my friend for identifying the key transitions within the string. Let's see how this all comes together.\n",
