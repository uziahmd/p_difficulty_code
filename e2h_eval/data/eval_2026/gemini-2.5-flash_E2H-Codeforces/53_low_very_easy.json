    "thought": "**Solving the Competitive Programming Challenge: Finding the Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's asking me to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice. The really important bit is that these occurrences can overlap, so that changes things up a bit. The input string is just lowercase letters, and the length is capped at 100, which is manageable.\n\nLet's break down how I'm thinking I'd tackle this. First, I need to consider the range of possible substring lengths. Obviously, the length can't be greater than the original string's length minus one, otherwise, the substring and the original string would be the same. The minimum length is clearly one.\n\nNow, for each possible length, I'll have to iterate through all possible substrings of that length. For a string of length 'n', a substring of length 'L' starting at position 'i' is simply `s[i:i+L]`. I can get the values of i by going from 0 to n-L.\n\nOnce I have a substring, I need to check if it appears at least twice within the original string, keeping overlaps in mind. I think the simplest approach here is to iterate through the entire string again, looking for occurrences of the current substring. And that count has to be at least 2.\n\nSince the goal is the *longest* substring, I need to decide on an iteration strategy. I'm thinking of iterating through the lengths in descending order. The first length I find with a repeated substring is the answer. Alternatively, I can go in ascending order and just keep track of the largest length I've found so far.\n\nHere's the algorithm I've solidified in my mind:\n\n1.  I start with a `max_len` set to 0.\n2.  I'll iterate through substring lengths 'L', from 1 up to 'n-1'.\n3.  For each 'L':\n    a.  I'll iterate through possible starting positions 'i', from 0 to 'n-L'.\n    b.  I define `current_substring = s[i:i+L]`.\n    c.  Now I check for another occurrence of `current_substring`.\n        d. I'll iterate again, this time with a starting position, 'j', from `i+1` up to 'n-L'. (Starting 'j' from i+1 ensures that it isn't the same location).\n        e. If `s[j:j+L]` equals `current_substring`:\n            i. I found a second occurrence.\n            ii. I update `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and 'L'.\n            iii. I can break out of the `j` loop (and potentially the `i` loop, as well).\n4.  And that's it! In the end, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest repeated substring. I think this logic will give me the correct solution, now I just have to code it.\n",
