The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The input is the plate's dimensions (`w` and `h`), and the number of rings (`k`).  Each ring is a border of an inner rectangle. Let's break this down further.\n\nI'm starting with the understanding that the `i`-th ring sits on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The number of cells in each ring is what I need to calculate.\n\nI initially tried using a perimeter-based formula, `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`, but I quickly realized that this breaks down at the edges and corners when dealing with extremely thin or single-cell rectangles. I was accounting for the corners twice.\n\nThe problem specifically says \"bordering cells,\" which means even a 1x1 rectangle has 1 border cell. I was off-track for a bit when my formula yielded 0 for a 1x1 area, but remembered the clarification in the problem statement that a 1x1 area has 1 bordering cell.\n\nI'm now thinking I can calculate the border by considering the difference between the total area of the rectangle and the area of the inner, non-border region, but I need to make sure this works correctly for all the edge cases. I'll need to write the formula in such a way that it handles rectangles with `w` or `h` equaling one or zero.\n",
