Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Minimizing Array Instability**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to find the smallest instability you can get by removing one number from a given array.  The instability of an array is just the difference between its biggest and smallest values.  I see that the size of the array can be pretty large, up to 100,000, and the values are also bounded.\n\nMy initial thought is that to minimize the instability, I should focus on making the range between the biggest and smallest numbers as small as possible.  After thinking it through, the key realization is that to minimize the maximum number in the new array, the way to do it is by removing the array's largest element. And to maximize the minimum number, the approach should be to remove the array's smallest element.\n\nSo, I think about sorting the input array. That lets me easily see the smallest and largest numbers. If I remove the smallest, the new minimum will be the next smallest and the maximum will stay the same. If I remove the largest, the maximum is the second largest and the minimum is unchanged. Removing any other element won't reduce the instability more than either of these cases. By just calculating those instabilities of removing the minimum or the maximum and picking the minimum, that should work.\n\nTo make it more efficient, I'm going to sort the given array so I can easily identify the smallest and largest values. It's an O(n log n) operation, but since the size of the array is limited, that's fine.\n\nThe solution is going to involve sorting the array and, then, calculate the instability by removing either the smallest element or the largest element. I compute both these values and select the minimum. That should give the answer. I will start by writing this and testing this with a few examples. I will need to make sure to handle some edge cases.\n",
