A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we're diving into the \"Soft Drinking\" problem. The core is resource allocation – we have a limited supply of drink, lime, and salt, and we need to figure out how many toasts each friend can make, ensuring they all get the same amount. The inputs are straightforward: the number of friends, quantities of each resource, and the per-friend requirements for each. The output is a single integer: the maximum number of toasts per friend.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown and Optimization**\n\nMy initial thought is to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible from *each* resource individually. Then, the limiting factor, the resource that runs out first, determines the total number of toasts for everyone. However, it's about toasts *per friend*, and that throws a slight wrench in.\n\nI'm starting to think in terms of \"single-person toasts\" first. Calculate how many toasts are possible based on drink, lime slices, and salt *as if there was only one friend*. It feels more efficient to find the limiting factor first and *then* divide by the number of friends. This aligns with the sample explanation, which is helpful.\n\n**Core Calculation and Edge Cases**\n\nThe math is simple: total resource divided by per-person requirement. Crucially, the problem specifies integer division (floor division), which is vital here. We can't make fractions of toasts! This is key. A reminder to double-check this: `//` is our operator of choice.\n\nLet's address the edge cases: very low resource values, where the maximum number of toasts is zero. The solution must handle these situations gracefully. This means an empty toast will be a valid output.\n\n**Code Structure and Input Handling**\n\nThe program structure will be equally straightforward. Read the input, perform the calculations, and output the result. The input format is a single line with space-separated integers, and I'll use `sys.stdin.readline` and `split()` to handle this efficiently.\n\n**Code Review and Refinement**\n\nLet's do a quick code check: read the inputs, do the necessary calculations, and calculate the `min` to get the answer. Divide it by `n` and give the result. Looks clean. The code should be ready.\n\n**Testing and Validation**\n\nNow, I'll test it against the given examples. The calculations should be spot on based on how I structured it. Double-check for small inputs, larger inputs, and the zero-toast edge case.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Submission**\n\nLooks like a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem. The final step is to submit the code, which should be quick.\n",
