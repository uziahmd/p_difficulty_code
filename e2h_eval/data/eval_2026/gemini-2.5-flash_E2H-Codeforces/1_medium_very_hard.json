    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants to calculate the gilded cells on a rectangular plate with multiple rings. Each ring borders an inner rectangle, and the rings get progressively smaller, with a two-cell gap between each.  The dimensions of the plate are `w` and `h`, and there are `k` rings.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring. The problem statement gives the formula:  `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. I confirmed that the constraint on `k` guarantees these dimensions are always at least 3, making the perimeter calculation straightforward. That means the \"special case\" formulas for rectangles of size `1xH` or `Wx1` aren't necessary. The number of cells in each ring is simply `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`.\n\nThe key here is understanding how the rings are defined and nested. \"Two cells away from the edge\" means that you subtract two cells from *each* side. The formula `w - 4(i-1)` captures this precisely. The first ring uses the original dimensions (`w`, `h`), the second ring subtracts 4 from both dimensions, the third ring subtracts 8, and so on.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells is just the sum of the cells in each ring, from 1 to `k`.  I need to iterate through each ring, calculate its perimeter, and add it to the running total.\n\nI checked the example and confirmed that the formula is producing the right values. I also considered the edge cases where the inner rectangles might become too small, but the constraint on `k` prevents that. The loop is simple, and the arithmetic is basic.\n\nI'm confident in this approach.  Here's the Python code I'm going to implement: read in the inputs `w`, `h`, and `k`, then, for each ring calculate `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` using the ring-specific formula for `W` and `H`, and increment the total.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    for i_loop in range(k):\n        current_width = w - 4 * i_loop\n        current_height = h - 4 * i_loop\n        \n        gilded_cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_width + 2 * current_height - 4\n        \n        total_gilded_cells += gilded_cells_in_current_ring\n        \n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\nThe constraint on `k` means the loop will run a reasonable number of times, and the calculations are simple, so it will be very efficient. I believe this should be a correct and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings, each 1 cell wide.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the dimensions of each ring's rectangle are defined and that the rings do not overlap.\n\n1.  **Ring Definition**: The problem states that the `i`-th ring (1-indexed) consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\n    *   For the first ring (`i = 1`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(1 - 1)) x (h - 4(1 - 1))`, which simplifies to `w x h`. This means the first ring covers the outermost cells of the entire plate.\n    *   For the second ring (`i = 2`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(2 - 1)) x (h - 4(2 - 1))`, which simplifies to `(w - 4) x (h - 4)`. This means the second ring is formed on a rectangle that is 2 cells inward from each side of the plate (total 4 cells reduction in width and height). This matches the description \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\".\n    *   This pattern continues for all `k` rings. Each successive ring is formed on a rectangle whose dimensions are reduced by 4 (2 from each side) compared to the conceptual rectangle for the previous ring.\n\n2.  **Non-overlapping Rings**: Since each ring has a width of 1 cell and there's a 2-cell gap between consecutive rings (e.g., between the first ring on `w x h` and the second ring on `(w-4) x (h-4)`), the rings are distinct and do not overlap. Therefore, to find the total number of gilded cells, we simply sum the number of cells in each individual ring.\n\n3.  **Cells in a Single Ring**: For a rectangle of size `W x H`, the number of cells along its border (a 1-cell wide ring) is given by the perimeter formula: `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corner cells being counted twice if we simply add `2W` and `2H`.\n\n4.  **Constraints on `w`, `h`, `k`**: The problem specifies `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This `k` constraint is crucial. It guarantees that for any ring `i` from 1 to `k`, the dimensions `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)` will always be at least 3. This simplifies the problem because we don't need to handle edge cases where `W_i` or `H_i` might be 1 or 2 (for which the perimeter formula might need adjustment). Since `W_i, H_i >= 3`, the `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` formula is always valid.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n1.  Read `w`, `h`, and `k` from input.\n2.  Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n3.  Loop `k` times, with a loop variable `i` (0-indexed) ranging from `0` to `k - 1`. This `i` corresponds to `(i + 1)` in the problem's 1-indexed ring definition.\n4.  Inside the loop, for each `i`:\n    *   Calculate the current rectangle's width: `current_w = w - 4 * i`.\n    *   Calculate the current rectangle's height: `current_h = h - 4 * i`.\n    *   Calculate the cells in this ring: `gilded_cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n    *   Add this to the total: `total_gilded_cells += gilded_cells_in_current_ring`.\n5.  After the loop finishes, print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (w=7, h=9, k=2)**:\n*   `total_gilded_cells = 0`\n*   **Loop 1 (i=0, for the 1st ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * 0 = 9`\n    *   `gilded_cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n*   **Loop 2 (i=1, for the 2nd ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * 1 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * 1 = 5`\n    *   `gilded_cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n*   Loop finishes. Print `40`.\n\nThis approach correctly matches all example outputs and adheres to the problem statement and constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three integers w, h, and k from a single line of standard input.\n    # map(int, ...) converts the space-separated strings to integers.\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate 'k' times, once for each ring.\n    # The loop variable 'i' (0-indexed) represents the offset multiplier for dimensions.\n    # For the 1st ring (i=0), dimensions are w - 4*0, h - 4*0.\n    # For the 2nd ring (i=1), dimensions are w - 4*1, h - 4*1.\n    # And so on, up to the k-th ring (i=k-1).\n    for i in range(k):\n        # Calculate the current width and height for the rectangle corresponding to this ring.\n        current_width = w - 4 * i\n        current_height = h - 4 * i\n        \n        # As per the problem constraints, current_width and current_height are always >= 3.\n        # Therefore, the standard perimeter formula for a 1-cell wide border applies:\n        # 2 * (width) + 2 * (height) - 4 (to avoid double-counting corners).\n        gilded_cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_width + 2 * current_height - 4\n        \n        # Add the cells of the current ring to the total.\n        total_gilded_cells += gilded_cells_in_current_ring\n        \n    # Print the final calculated total number of gilded cells.\n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\n# Ensure the solve function is called when the script is executed.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
