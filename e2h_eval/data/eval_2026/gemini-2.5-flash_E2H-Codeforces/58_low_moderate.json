You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Odd Cycle Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to figure out the minimum number of edges, which I'll call `t`, I need to add to an undirected graph to create a simple, odd-length cycle, and then find how many ways, `w`, I can do that. It needs to be a *simple* cycle, so no repeating vertices except at the start/end, and it has to have an *odd* number of edges. No self-loops are allowed, thankfully.\n\nFirst, I should break down the conditions for an odd cycle: it's a closed loop, has an odd edge count, and doesn't revisit any vertices (except the start/end).\n\nLet's start by considering the simplest case: **`t = 0`**.  If the existing graph already *has* an odd cycle, then `t` is 0, and `w` is just 1.  How do I detect an odd cycle?  The key insight is: a graph contains an odd cycle *if and only if* it's not bipartite.  Bipartiteness can be checked using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with a coloring scheme. If I find an edge that connects two vertices with the same color, I know I've got my odd cycle.  And I have to be sure to check each connected component separately.  So, if any component is non-bipartite, then `t = 0`, and the \"number of ways\" is simply 1, since I'm adding zero edges.\n\nNow, let's consider **`t = 1`**.  If the graph is bipartite (or if all of its connected components are), adding a *single* edge might create an odd cycle.  If I'm adding an edge between vertices in *different* connected components, that can't work; it just connects them without forming a cycle. So, the edge needs to be added within a single connected, bipartite component. Within a component, the two vertices should be on the same \"side\" of the bipartite split – they must have the same color in the 2-coloring.\n\nSo, I need to figure out how many such pairs of vertices exist within *each* connected, bipartite component. Let's say I've got a component with a 2-coloring – vertices are either color 0 or color 1. I'll call the sets of vertices with colors 0 and 1 `S0` and `S1`, respectively. An added edge would create an odd cycle if it connects two vertices either from `S0` or from `S1`.  The number of ways to pick two vertices from a set of size `n` is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. So, for a component, it is  `|S0| * (|S0| - 1) / 2 + |S1| * (|S1| - 1) / 2`. The sum of this over all connected components will be the value for `w` when `t = 1`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using a 2-coloring algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS). During the traversal, we assign colors (say, 0 and 1) to vertices. If we encounter an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, an odd cycle exists.\n\nWe analyze the problem by considering the minimum number of edges `t` to add:\n\n**Case 0: `t = 0`**\nIf the given graph already contains an odd cycle, then `t=0`.\nTo check this, we can perform a 2-coloring (BFS/DFS) on each connected component. If any component is found to be non-bipartite (i.e., we try to assign a color to a vertex that conflicts with an already assigned color of an adjacent vertex), then `t=0`. In this case, `w=1` (there's only one way to add zero edges).\n\n**Case 1: `t = 1`**\nIf `t \\neq 0`, the graph is bipartite (all connected components are bipartite).\nTo form an odd cycle by adding one edge, we must add an edge `(u, v)` such that `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and have the same color in a 2-coloring. Adding such an edge `(u, v)` creates an odd cycle because it closes a path between `u` and `v` that has even length (since `u` and `v` are in the same color set, their distance in the bipartite graph must be even). Adding `(u, v)` makes the cycle length `even_path_length + 1`, which is odd.\nIf we add an edge between vertices `u` and `v` from different connected components, or between `u` and `v` in the same component but with different colors, the resulting graph will still be bipartite.\n\nSo, if `t=1`, we need to find pairs `(u, v)` within the same connected component, where `u` and `v` have the same color.\nFor each bipartite connected component:\n1. Perform a 2-coloring. Let `S_0` be the set of vertices colored 0, and `S_1` be the set of vertices colored 1.\n2. The number of ways to choose two distinct vertices from `S_0` is `|S_0| * (|S_0| - 1) / 2`.\n3. The number of ways to choose two distinct vertices from `S_1` is `|S_1| * (|S_1| - 1) / 2`.\n4. The total number of ways for this component is `(|S_0| * (|S_0| - 1) / 2) + (|S_1| * (|S_1| - 1) / 2)`.\nSum these counts over all connected components. If this sum is greater than 0, then `t=1` and `w` is this sum.\n\n**Case 2: `t = 2`**\nIf `t \\neq 0` and `t \\neq 1`, it means:\n1. The graph is bipartite.\n2. All connected components are either singletons (size 1) or paths/trees (size > 1) where `|S_0| <= 1` or `|S_1| <= 1` for all components. This implies that no component has two vertices of the same color that are not already connected by an edge. More precisely, for any component, if it has `|S_0| >= 2`, it must mean `|S_0| * (|S_0| - 1) / 2` is non-zero. So if `t != 1`, then for all components, `|S_0| <= 1` and `|S_1| <= 1`. This means all components are either single vertices or single edges.\nEssentially, if `t=2`, it implies that all connected components are trees/paths of length at most 1 (i.e., isolated vertices or isolated edges).\nTo form an odd cycle with two added edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`:\nWe need to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x`.\nThis means we pick `v` and connect it to `u` and `x`.\nThe path `u-v-x` has length 2, which is even. If `u` and `x` are from different components, adding `(u, x)` would create an odd cycle.\nConsider adding two edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)` such that `u, v, x` are distinct. If `u` and `x` are not connected by an edge, adding `(u, x)` would create an odd cycle of length 3 (`u-v-x-u`).\nThe number of ways to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6` (if order doesn't matter for the set of vertices, it's `C(n,3)`).\nThe problem asks for adding edges. We pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x`. We can form a cycle `u-v-x-u` by adding edges `(u,v)`, `(v,x)`, `(x,u)` if they don't exist. This is 3 edges.\nIf we add two edges, say `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`, to form an odd cycle.\nIf `u, v, x` are already in the graph. `u` and `x` must be in different components, and `v` can be any vertex.\nAdding `(u,v)` and `(v,x)` makes a path `u-v-x`. This path has length 2.\nIf `u` and `x` are in different components, and `v` is any vertex:\nWe add `(u,v)` and `(v,x)`. The new component would be bipartite.\nAn odd cycle requires `u` and `x` to be connected by an odd path length.\nIf we add edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` where `u,v,x,y` are distinct, this also connects components.\nIf `t=2`, we must connect two components, say `C_1` and `C_2`, and then add an edge within the resulting structure to form an odd cycle. Or, we connect three components `C_1, C_2, C_3` to form a triangle.\nThe simplest way to form an odd cycle with two added edges is to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` such that none of `(u,v)`, `(v,x)`, `(x,u)` exist in the graph, and add two of these edges, say `(u,v)` and `(v,x)`. This creates a path `u-v-x`. If `u` and `x` are in different components, and `v` is in another component, this creates a path of length 2. We can't form an odd cycle this way.\nThe only way to form an odd cycle with 2 edges is to have `u,v,x` such that `(u,x)` already exists, and `u,v,x` are in different components.\nNo, this is not right.\nIf `t=2`, it means we need to add two edges. This happens when all connected components are singletons or isolated edges.\nLet's consider three distinct vertices `u, v, x`.\nIf we add edges `(u,v)` and `(v,x)`. This forms a path `u-v-x`. If `u` and `x` were already connected by an edge, say `(u,x)`, then we would have a triangle `u-v-x-u` by adding `(u,v)` and `(v,x)`. This is an odd cycle.\nSo, if `t=2`, we need to find three distinct vertices `u, v, x` such that `(u,x)` is an existing edge, and `(u,v)` and `(v,x)` are not existing edges.\nThe number of ways would be: for each existing edge `(u,x)`, count how many vertices `v` (not `u` or `x`) are not adjacent to `u` and not adjacent to `x`.\nThis is `m * (n - 2 - (deg(u)-1) - (deg(x)-1))` if `u,x` are connected.\nThe number of such `v` is `n - 2 - (count of neighbors of u excluding x) - (count of neighbors of x excluding u)`.\nThis simplifies to `n - 2 - (deg(u)-1) - (deg(x)-1)`. Wait, this is `n - deg(u) - deg(x)`.\n`w = sum_{ (u,x) in E } (n - 2 - (neighbors of u excluding x) - (neighbors of x excluding u))`.\nThis is `sum_{ (u,x) in E } (n - 2 - (number of vertices adjacent to u and not x) - (number of vertices adjacent to x and not u) - (number of vertices adjacent to both u and x))`.\nNo, it's simpler. For each existing edge `(u,x)`, we need to pick a vertex `v` such that `v \\neq u`, `v \\neq x`, `(u,v)` is not an edge, and `(v,x)` is not an edge.\nThe number of choices for `v` is `n - 2` (total vertices minus `u` and `x`) minus `deg(u)-1` (neighbors of `u` excluding `x`) minus `deg(x)-1` (neighbors of `x` excluding `u`).\nThis is `n - 2 - (deg(u)-1) - (deg(x)-1)`. This is not correct. `deg(u)-1` counts neighbors of `u` other than `x`. `deg(x)-1` counts neighbors of `x` other than `u`. Some vertices might be common neighbors of `u` and `x`.\nLet `N(u)` be the set of neighbors of `u`.\nWe need `v \\notin N(u) \\cup N(x) \\cup \\{u, x\\}`.\nThe number of choices for `v` is `n - |N(u) \\cup N(x) \\cup \\{u, x\\}|`.\n`|N(u) \\cup N(x) \\cup \\{u, x\\}| = |N(u)| + |N(x)| - |N(u) \\cap N(x)| + 2` (since `u, x` are not in `N(u)` or `N(x)`).\nNo, `u` is not in `N(u)`, `x` is not in `N(x)`.\n`|N(u) \\cup N(x)|` is the set of neighbors of `u` or `x`.\n`|N(u) \\cup N(x) \\cup \\{u, x\\}| = |N(u)| + |N(x)| - |N(u) \\cap N(x)| + 2` is still wrong.\n`|N(u) \\cup N(x) \\cup \\{u, x\\}| = |N(u) \\setminus \\{x\\}| + |N(x) \\setminus \\{u\\}| + |N(u) \\cap N(x)| + 2`\nThis is `(deg(u)-1) + (deg(x)-1) + |N(u) \\cap N(x)| + 2`.\nThe number of vertices `v` to choose from is `n - (deg(u)-1) - (deg(x)-1) - |N(u) \\cap N(x)| - 2`.\nThis is `n - deg(u) - deg(x) - |N(u) \\cap N(x)|`.\nThis is `n - (deg(u) + deg(x) - |N(u) \\cap N(x)|) - 2`.\nThe number of available vertices `v` is `n - 2 - (|N(u) \\setminus \\{x\\}| + |N(x) \\setminus \\{u\\}| + |N(u) \\cap N(x)|)`.\nThis is `n - 2 - (deg(u) - 1 + deg(x) - 1 + |N(u) \\cap N(x)|)`.\nThis is `n - deg(u) - deg(x) - |N(u) \\cap N(x)|`. This is the count of vertices that are not `u` or `x`, and are not adjacent to `u` or `x`.\nSo, `w = sum_{ (u,x) in E } (n - deg(u) - deg(x) + |N(u) \\cap N(x)|)`.\n`|N(u) \\cap N(x)|` is the number of common neighbors of `u` and `x`. This can be found by iterating through `N(u)` and checking if each neighbor is also in `N(x)`. This is efficient if `N(x)` is a hash set.\nThe sum is over *unordered* edges `(u,x)`. Each pair `(u,x)` will be counted once.\n\n**Case 3: `t = 3`**\nIf `t \\neq 0, 1, 2`, then `t=3`. This means the graph must consist only of isolated vertices (no edges).\nIn this case, `m=0`. We need to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)` to form a triangle.\nThe number of ways to pick three distinct vertices is `C(n, 3) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\nThis is the minimum `t` if `n < 3` or `m > 0` and the previous cases don't apply. If `n < 3`, an odd cycle is impossible. The problem states \"cycle of more than one vertex\", which implies at least 3 vertices for a simple cycle.\nIf `n < 3`, `t=3` is impossible. The problem constraints are `n >= 1`.\nIf `n=1` or `n=2`, it's impossible to form a simple cycle of odd length. The problem implies such a cycle is always possible by adding edges.\nThe smallest simple cycle is a triangle (length 3). This requires `n >= 3`.\nIf `n < 3`, then `t` should be infinity or similar. But competitive programming problems usually imply that a solution exists. Let's assume `n >= 3`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Initialize `adj` list for the graph and `visited` array.\n2. Initialize `t_0_found = False`.\n3. Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`:\n    a. If `i` is not visited:\n        i. Perform BFS/DFS starting from `i` to 2-color the connected component.\n        ii. During BFS/DFS:\n            - Maintain `color` array (0 or 1) and `component_nodes` counts for each color.\n            - If an edge `(u,v)` is found where `color[u] == color[v]`, set `t_0_found = True` and break all loops (no need to check other components).\n            - If the component is bipartite, store `(count_color_0, count_color_1)`.\n4. If `t_0_found` is `True`:\n    Print `0 1`.\n5. Else (`t=0` not found, graph is bipartite):\n    a. Initialize `t_1_ways = 0`.\n    b. For each bipartite component `(c0, c1)` found in step 3.a.ii:\n        `t_1_ways += (c0 * (c0 - 1) // 2) + (c1 * (c1 - 1) // 2)`.\n    c. If `t_1_ways > 0`:\n        Print `1 t_1_ways`.\n    d. Else (`t=1` not found, all components are singletons or isolated edges):\n        i. Initialize `t_2_ways = 0`.\n        ii. Iterate through all existing edges `(u, x)` in the graph:\n            - Find `num_common_neighbors = 0`.\n            - For each neighbor `v` of `u` (excluding `x`), check if `v` is also a neighbor of `x`. Use a set for `N(x)` for efficient lookup.\n            - `t_2_ways += (n - deg[u] - deg[x] + num_common_neighbors)`.\n        iii. Print `2 t_2_ways`.\n        iv. (Edge case: if `m=0` and `n < 3`, `t=3` is impossible. The problem implies a solution exists. If `n < 3`, `C(n,3)` is 0. So this would still work.)\n        v. If `t_2_ways == 0`: (This means `m=0` or `m>0` but `n - deg[u] - deg[x] + num_common_neighbors` is always 0. The latter means `n` is small or graph is dense, but `t=1` already handled cases where `n` is small and graph is dense, i.e., `n=3, m=3` is `t=0`. If `m>0` and `t=2` is 0, it means for every edge `(u,x)`, all other `n-2` vertices are adjacent to `u` or `x`. This implies a very dense graph. E.g., `K_n` with `n>=3` has `t=0`. `K_2` is `t=3`. `K_3` with one edge removed (path 1-2-3) is `t=1`.\n        If `t_2_ways == 0`, it means `m=0` (no edges). In this scenario, we must add 3 edges to form a triangle.\n        Print `3 (n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)`.\n\n**Refinement for `t=2` and `t=3`:**\nThe condition for `t=2` is that `m > 0`. If `m=0`, then `t=2` is impossible because we need an existing edge `(u,x)`.\nSo, if `m=0` (no edges in the graph):\n    - `t=0` is false.\n    - `t=1` is false (since `m=0`, all components are singletons, `c0=1, c1=0` or `c0=0, c1=1`, so `t_1_ways=0`).\n    - `t=2` is false (no existing edges).\n    - Therefore, `t=3`. `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6`. This needs `n >= 3`. If `n < 3`, output `3 0`. The formula `n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6` correctly gives 0 for `n < 3`.\n\n**Final Algorithm Structure:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    edges = [] # Store edges for t=2 case\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        edges.append((u, v))\n\n    # Case 0: Check for existing odd cycle\n    colors = {} # 0 or 1\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    t0_found = False\n    \n    # Store component info for t=1 case\n    bipartite_components_info = [] # List of (count_color_0, count_color_1) for each bipartite component\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append((i, 0)) # (node, color)\n            visited[i] = True\n            colors[i] = 0\n            \n            component_nodes_count = [0, 0] # [count_color_0, count_color_1]\n            component_nodes_count[0] = 1 # Current node i gets color 0\n            \n            is_bipartite = True\n            \n            component_q = deque() # Store nodes in current component for processing after BFS\n            component_q.append(i)\n\n            head = 0 # Manual queue for BFS to avoid recursion depth issues or deque overhead for large N\n            q_list = [(i, 0)]\n\n            while head < len(q_list):\n                u, u_color = q_list[head]\n                head += 1\n\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        colors[v] = 1 -
