You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number Through Digit Replacement: A Python Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core of it is pretty straightforward: I've got this number `a`, represented as a string, and a set of digits `s` that I can use to *optimally* replace digits within `a`. My goal is to end up with the *largest possible* number. Given my expertise, it's pretty clear that this screams a greedy strategy.\n\nThe fundamental idea is this: to maximize a number, I need to make the *most significant* digits as large as possible. Essentially, I want to work from the leftmost digit and replace anything that can be made bigger. So I'll go through `a` digit by digit, left to right.\n\nI need to keep track of the digits I can use in `s`.  Sorting `s` in descending order is key here, so I can easily grab the largest available digit at any given step. I'll maintain a pointer to keep track of which digit in `s` I'm using.\n\nFor each digit in `a`, I'll check if any remaining digit in `s` is larger. If I find one, I replace the current digit in `a` with the larger one from `s` and move to the next digit in `s`. If the current digit in `s` isn't larger than the current digit in `a`, I'm stuck, and I move to the next digit in `a`. Since s is sorted descending, I know that if I can't improve it with the current digit, no subsequent digits will improve it. This keeps the approach simple, because I can work digit by digit, only considering available options.\n\nIn essence, I'm building the largest possible number from left to right, using any available digits from s only when there is an opportunity to improve.\n\nLet's get this coded up.\n",
