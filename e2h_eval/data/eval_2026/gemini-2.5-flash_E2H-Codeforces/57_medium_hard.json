His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Finding Vasya's Best and Worst Olympiad Ranks**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad ranking problem. The goal is to figure out the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could get, given the total number of participants, the minimum score Vasya achieved, and the scores from two rounds, without knowing which score belongs to whom.\n\nFirst, I define my variables to make things easier. Then, I realize that it boils down to finding the right pairings of scores. Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from the two rounds. The ranking rule is straightforward: higher total score means a better rank. Ties are broken by the jury.\n\nThe core of the challenge is that I don't know the exact pairings. So, I need to consider all possible scenarios. To get Vasya's *best* rank, I want to maximize his score and minimize everyone else's.  I reason that if Vasya gets the maximum possible total score (the sum of the highest score from the first round and the highest score from the second round), he can be guaranteed the best rank, because nobody else can have a higher score. I know the problem *guarantees* that someone got at least the minimum score. By default, it's very likely Vasya can achieve rank 1.\n\nFor the *worst* rank, I need to minimize Vasya's score while maximizing the number of other participants who score at least as high. It seems intuitive that Vasya should be paired with the smallest possible total score that still meets the minimum score requirement.  However, this doesn't tell me the *exact* worst case. I need to consider all the ways to arrange everyone's scores and find the number of people who could, at worst, be tied with or ahead of Vasya.\n\nI start by thinking about how to create pairs to ensure a minimum score. I try and figure out how to count the number of people above some threshold `T`. I realize the tricky bit is that since the jury breaks ties, if `k` people score `S`, Vasya's worst possible rank is at least `k`.\n\nI come to realize that I need to find the smallest possible score Vasya can achieve and maximize the number of people who can score higher than that score. It's becoming evident that a greedy strategy will be key here. Sorting the scores and using two pointers feels like the way to count how many pairs can reach a certain total. So it's about finding a value for Vasya and checking with this function.\n\nUltimately, I realize that I need to consider `count_ge(T)` where `count_ge(T)` is the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= T`. And the worst rank is `count_ge(T)` for `T>=x`, where `T` must be a valid total score `a_i + b_j`. The problem is reduced to finding the maximum `count_ge(T)`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given the number of participants `n`, the minimum total points Vasya earned `x`, and two lists of scores `a` and `b` for the first and second tours, respectively. The crucial information is that we don't know which `a_i` and `b_j` belong to which participant; we only have the sets of scores. Each participant's total score is the sum of one score from `a` and one from `b`, and all `n` scores from `a` must be paired with all `n` scores from `b` to form `n` participant totals.\n\nThe ranking rules are:\n1. Participants are sorted by total points in decreasing order.\n2. If two or more participants have the same total points, the jury can assign places arbitrarily among them.\n\n**Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to maximize his score and ensure no one else scores higher.\nLet `max_A = max(a)` and `max_B = max(b)`.\nIf Vasya is assigned the score `max_A` from the first tour and `max_B` from the second tour, his total score would be `S_V = max_A + max_B`.\nBy definition of maximum, no other `a_i` or `b_j` can be greater than `max_A` or `max_B` respectively. Therefore, no other participant can achieve a score strictly greater than `S_V`.\nThe problem guarantees that Vasya was present and got at least `x` points, meaning there exist `a_i, b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This implies that `max_A + max_B` must also be at least `x` (since `max_A + max_B >= a_i + b_j`).\nSo, Vasya can achieve the score `max_A + max_B`, which is guaranteed to be `>= x`. Since no one can score higher, Vasya can be ranked 1st.\nThus, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo find Vasya's worst possible rank, we need to find a valid pairing of scores such that:\n1. Vasya's assigned score `S_V = a_i + b_j` is at least `x`.\n2. The number of participants (including Vasya) who score `S_k >= S_V` is maximized. Because of the jury's discretion for ties, if `k` participants score `S_k >= S_V`, Vasya could be ranked `k`-th.\n\nLet's denote `A` and `B` as the sorted lists of scores in ascending order.\n`A = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`B = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]`\n\nConsider a specific total score `T`. We want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` that can be formed from `A` and `B` such that `a_i + b_j >= T`. Let this function be `count_ge(T)`.\n`count_ge(T)` can be calculated efficiently using a two-pointer approach:\nInitialize `count = 0`, `ptr_A = 0`, `ptr_B = n-1`.\nWhile `ptr_A < n` and `ptr_B >= 0`:\n  If `A[ptr_A] + B[ptr_B] >= T`:\n    // This pair satisfies the condition. Increment count and use both scores.\n    `count += 1`\n    `ptr_A += 1`\n    `ptr_B -= 1`\n  Else (`A[ptr_A] + B[ptr_B] < T`):\n    // The smallest `a` value `A[ptr_A]` cannot form `T` with the largest available `b` value `B[ptr_B]`.\n    // It also cannot form `T` with any smaller `b` values. So, `A[ptr_A]` cannot be part of a pair summing to `>= T`.\n    // Discard `A[ptr_A]` and try with the next smallest `a` value.\n    `ptr_A += 1`\nReturn `count`.\n\nThe `count_ge(T)` function is monotonically non-increasing as `T` increases.\nVasya's worst rank is `k` if there exists a valid pairing `P` and a score `S_V` in `P` (Vasya's score) such that `S_V >= x`, and `k` participants in `P` score at least `S_V`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum `count_ge(T)` for any `T` that Vasya could possibly score (i.e., `T = a_i + b_j` for some `i, j`) such that `T >= x`.\n\nSince `count_ge(T)` is non-increasing, to maximize `count_ge(T)` for `T >= x`, we should choose the smallest possible `T` which is a valid score for Vasya and is at least `x`.\nHowever, this logic is flawed. We are looking for `max_{T >= x, T \\text{ is a valid score}} count_ge(T)`.\nThe actual maximum `count_ge(T)` for `T >= x` is `count_ge(x)`. This `count_ge(x)` value represents the maximum number of people who *could* score at least `x`. If Vasya is one of these people and scores exactly `x`, his rank could be `count_ge(x)`.\nThe key is that Vasya *can* always be one of the `count_ge(x)` participants. The problem guarantees that `a_i + b_j >= x` for some `i, j`. We can assign this specific `a_i, b_j` to Vasya, making his score at least `x`.\nThen, we can form `count_ge(x)` pairs that sum to at least `x`. If Vasya's chosen `(a_i, b_j)` is one of these pairs, then his rank can be `count_ge(x)`. If it's not, we can always swap one of the `a` or `b` values with Vasya's to ensure he is part of a high-scoring pair, without reducing the number of high-scoring pairs. The two-pointer greedy approach for `count_ge(T)` doesn't care about specific indices, just that `a_i` and `b_j` are available.\n\nTherefore, Vasya's worst possible rank is simply `count_ge(x)`.\n\n**Algorithm for Worst Rank:**\n1. Sort `a` (let's call it `A`) and `b` (let's call it `B`) in ascending order.\n2. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n3. Use two pointers: `ptr_A = 0` (for `A`), `ptr_B = n-1` (for `B`).\n4. While `ptr_A < n` and `ptr_B >= 0`:\n   a. If `A[ptr_A] + B[ptr_B] >= x`:\n      `worst_rank += 1`\n      `ptr_A += 1`\n      `ptr_B -= 1`\n   b. Else (`A[ptr_A] + B[ptr_B] < x`):\n      `ptr_A += 1`\n5. Print `worst_rank`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `B = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`x = 2`\n`ptr_A=0, ptr_B=4`. `A[0]+B[4] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank=1`. `ptr_A=1, ptr_B=3`.\n`ptr_A=1, ptr_B=3`. `A[1]+B[3] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank=2`. `ptr_A=2, ptr_B=2`.\n`ptr_A=2, ptr_B=2`. `A[2]+B[2] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank=3`. `ptr_A=3, ptr_B=1`.\n`ptr_A=3, ptr_B=1`. `A[3]+B[1] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank=4`. `ptr_A=4, ptr_B=0`.\n`ptr_A=4, ptr_B=0`. `A[4]+B[0] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank=5`. `ptr_A=5, ptr_B=-1`.\nLoop ends.
