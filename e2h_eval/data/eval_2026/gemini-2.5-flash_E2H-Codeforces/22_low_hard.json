After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Marks\" problem. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, the input. I have `n` students and `m` subjects, and each student's marks are provided as digits.  The output needs to be the total number of successful students. A student is \"successful\" if they are the best at *at least one* subject.  \"Best\" means their mark for a subject is the highest among all students for that subject.\n\nMy initial approach is to tackle it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Input Handling**\n\nI'll read in `n` and `m` first. Then, I'll read the student marks. Since the marks are characters ('1' to '9'), the most efficient thing to do is store them as a 2D list. Converting the characters to integers immediately will be helpful for the calculations. It seems like the most natural data structure to use here is `gradebook = [[2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [1, 1, 2]]`.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Maximum Marks per Subject**\n\nNext, I need to figure out the highest mark for *each* subject.  I can iterate through the gradebook subject by subject, find the maximum mark for each subject, and store them in a list.  `max_marks_per_subject[j]` will hold the maximum mark in subject `j`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding Successful Students**\n\nNow, the core logic: figuring out which students are successful. I'll initialize a counter and a boolean list `is_successful[student_idx]`. I will set `is_successful` for each student initially to `False`.  For each student, I'll compare their mark in each subject with the maximum mark for that subject that I calculated in Step 2. If a student's mark matches the maximum, that student is best in that subject, which means they are successful, so I can set their entry in `is_successful` to `True`.  As soon as I find *one* subject where a student is the best, I can mark them as successful and move on to the next student.\n\n**Step 4: Counting Successful Students**\n\nFinally, I iterate through the `is_successful` list and count the number of `True` values. This count represents the total number of successful students, which is the answer I'm looking for.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**\n\nLooking at that sample input, I can see how this would work. I read the marks and create the `gradebook`. Then I find the maximum marks in each subject and store them. Then I determine if each student is successful by looking at each entry in the `gradebook` compared to the maximum mark for that corresponding subject. Finally, I count the True entries in the `is_successful` array, which gives me the final answer. Seems pretty straightforward! I'm ready to start coding this up.\n",
