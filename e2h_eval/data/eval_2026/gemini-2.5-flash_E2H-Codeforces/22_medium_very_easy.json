After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, so here's what I'm thinking about this \"Marks\" problem.** First, I need to understand the goal: find the number of \"successful\" students. A successful student is one who's the best at *at least one* subject. Being the best at a subject means having the highest mark for that specific subject.\n\nThe input is straightforward: `n` students, `m` subjects, and their marks. I'll read this in and store it efficiently. A 2D list of integers, `gradebook[student_idx][subject_idx]`, seems like the cleanest approach.\n\nNow, to determine who's successful, I need a good strategy. I'll go step by step. First, for *each* subject, I'll find the *maximum* mark. This gives me the benchmark for being the best. I'll store these maximums in `max_marks_per_subject`.\n\nThen, I'll iterate through each student. For *each* student, I'll compare their mark in each subject to the maximum mark for that subject. If a student's mark matches the maximum, they are successful. Crucially, as soon as a student is identified as successful (they are best in at least one subject), I can immediately move to the next student. There's no need to check all the other subjects for that student. This `break` statement within the inner subject loop should save some time.\n\nI'll use a boolean array `is_successful[n]` to keep track of who's successful.\n\nFinally, I'll just count how many `True` values are in `is_successful`. That will be my answer.\n\nI'm thinking about the implementation details. I can read the input line by line and convert the characters to integers efficiently using list comprehensions. Finding the maximum mark in each subject can be done in a couple of ways – either by iterating and keeping track of the current maximum, or by using Python's `max()` function along with list comprehensions for a more concise and Pythonic approach. Both have the same time complexity (O(N*M)) but the second version may be clearer. For the successful student identification step, the logic is very clear, checking the current grade against the max mark for that subject and using break as mentioned.\n\nAs for the constraints, both `n` and `m` are limited to 100. So, my algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(N*M), is perfectly acceptable. Worst case time complexity is O(100*100) = O(10,000) which will finish within time limits. Space complexity is also fine.\n\nI'm also considering some edge cases: what happens if there's only one student (`n=1`)? or one subject (`m=1`)? It looks like my proposed algorithm will correctly handle these cases.\n\nFinally, I'll double-check that the code handles all the problem's requirements, including correctly processing the input, defining success correctly, and generating the correct output based on the input.\n\nI'll also keep in mind that I can use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` instead of `input()` and `print()` respectively for potentially faster execution.\n\nI believe this is a robust solution. Let's start coding!\n",
