The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Xenia and the Ringroad: Crafting an Optimal Path**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script to tackle this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's think this through. The core of it seems to be about minimizing travel time on a circular path.\n\nI've got `n` houses in a ring, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks to complete in a specific order, defined by the array `a`. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete each task in sequence, moving clockwise. Each move to the next house takes one unit of time.\n\nEssentially, I'm tracing her journey. She begins at house 1 and must move to each target house (`a_i`) in the `a` array. The tricky part is calculating the time for each move. It's clockwise only, so it's a bit like modular arithmetic, but not quite.\n\nFor each task, let's say she's at `current_house` and needs to get to `target_house` (which is `a_i`). The time taken depends on the relative positions of these houses.\n\n*   If the target house is ahead or the same (`target_house >= current_house`), she moves directly, and the time is just the difference: `target_house - current_house`.\n*   If the target house is *behind* (`target_house < current_house`), she has to go all the way around the ring, time is `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n\nThis logic has to be applied iteratively for each task in the `a` array. I'll need a `total_time` variable to keep track of the accumulated time. So, after each move, the `current_house` updates to the target house, and the new movement time is added to `total_time`.\n\nTo ensure this works, let's run a quick dry run using the given example (`n = 4`, `m = 3`, `a = [3, 2, 3]`). Xenia starts at 1, goes to 3 (2 time units). Then from 3 to 2 (requires a full wrap-around), then 2 to 3 (directly). I think that example looks correct, but it's important to be sure! Now, I'm confident in the logic, so it's time to translate this into Python.\n",
