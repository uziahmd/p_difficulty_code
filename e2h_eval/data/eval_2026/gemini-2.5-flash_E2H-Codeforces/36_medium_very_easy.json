The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Thinking**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm grappling with. I'm trying to figure out the probability of a valid setup for a competitive programming problem. Basically, we've got this scenario where we randomly build towers in towns and then need to pick signal powers for them. A valid setup means each town gets a signal from exactly one tower, and no signals leak outside of the town boundaries.\n\nMy initial thoughts are focused on dissecting the problem's conditions. I'm trying to translate those conditions into math, specifically by defining sets and constraints. The core of this seems to be the constraint that each town gets covered by precisely one tower. The tower must be in the set of towers.\n\nI'm thinking that for each tower, there's a certain \"power\" we can choose. That power determines which towns a tower reaches. The problem also specifies that the powers must not \"leak\". This limits the maximum power for each tower, based on its location. The math involves interval covering.\n\nInitially, I'm trying to identify the maximum possible power for each tower such that the signal doesn't escape the town boundaries. This leads me to derive the condition that $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$, meaning the signal range doesn't cover towns outside the acceptable range.\n\nNext, I'm focusing on the condition that exactly one tower covers each town.  This means the intervals covered by each tower in the final answer must form a partition of the towns. The sets and their union must be the given towns. I'm trying to figure out what a \"partition\" means in the context of intervals, and what are the implications. This also connects to the fact that $S$ is built with probability.\n\nThe crucial constraint boils down to the fact that towers cannot overlap or leave holes in the covered towns. If one interval ends, the next one has to start right where it ends.  This implies an order to how the signals \"tile\" the towns.  A set S is valid if it meets these constraints and each $i \\in S$. The towns outside $S$ should have no signal.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach and Set Constraints**\n\nThe intervals that come from assigning powers must somehow create a perfect \"tiling\" of the towns. This is a bit complex, so I'm thinking of trying to build a dynamic programming solution. I'm thinking I'll define a `dp[k]` that represents the number of valid ways to partition the first `k` towns. My current intuition suggests that I can try to build this incrementally.\n\nThe dp approach looks promising.  I'm trying to establish a connection between `dp[k]` and the power of a specific tower that could cover town `k`. From the condition where $p_i=k-i+1$ I know that is a sufficient range to cover the location k. This can work only if $2i-k-1$ is a valid previous dp state. This builds on the idea of creating a partition and solving the problem from the beginning.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing that the problem isn't asking for the *number* of ways, but the *probability*.  This dynamic programming approach seems to be counting and it may get complex because it counts the towers. Moreover, the probability is affected by how the towers are set, and the powers are set.\n\nThe main difficulty here is to deal with the fact that it is a *probability*.  We need to calculate over all possible sets.\nThe solution must count the number of valid *sets* S that *allow* a configuration.\n\nLet's rethink this as a probability problem. This requires counting \"good\" sets *S* over all possible sets. For this, I am going to call A the set of valid assignments and $P$ the probability. Then $P = |A| / (2^n)$. So counting A is going to be the major part of the problem.\n\nThe nature of these intervals suggests a very particular structure for the set of towers. They form a contiguous, non-overlapping sequence.  Towers can't just be scattered randomly.\n\nThis is where things are becoming subtle. Let me reconsider the fact the n must be odd. The reasoning suggests that a perfect tiling with a valid power selection implies that all the 'boundaries' must be even. I am working with the constraint $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$, meaning that the intervals must cover perfectly the range. This leads me to the conclusion that if n is even, there is no way for the towns to have valid powers.\n\n**The Crucial Parity Condition and Probability Analysis**\n\nThe parity condition has to be key: `n` must be odd, otherwise, no valid power assignment exists. This could greatly simplify the solution. It means that, if `n` is even, the probability",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random configuration of towers, we can assign signal powers to meet certain constraints. There are $n+2$ towns at coordinates $0, 1, \\dots, n+1$. Towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, independently.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we must choose an integer signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ reaches towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the integer interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n   - For town $0$: $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n   - For town $n+1$: $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n   - So, for each $i \\in S$, $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n   - This means the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   - Let $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\n   - The intervals must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   - This implies that if we sort the towers in $S$ as $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then:\n     a. $L_{i_1} = 1 \\implies i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n     b. $R_{i_k} = n \\implies i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\n     c. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $R_{i_j} = L_{i_{j+1}}-1$. This means $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1)-1 \\implies i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\n\nLet's analyze the condition $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nLet $B_0 = 0$ and $B_k = n+1$.\nFor each interval covered by tower $i_j$, its left \"boundary\" is $i_j-p_{i_j}$ and its right \"boundary\" is $i_j+p_{i_j}$.\nThe conditions become:\n- $i_1-p_{i_1} = B_0 = 0$.\n- $i_j+p_{i_j} = B_j$ for some $B_j$.\n- $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}} = B_j$.\n- $i_k+p_{i_k} = B_k = n+1$.\n\nFrom $i_j-p_{i_j}=B_{j-1}$ and $i_j+p_{i_j}=B_j$, we can solve for $i_j$ and $p_{i_j}$:\n$2i_j = B_{j-1}+B_j \\implies i_j = (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2$.\n$2p_{i_j} = B_j-B_{j-1} \\implies p_{i_j} = (B_j-B_{j-1})/2$.\n\nFor $i_j$ and $p_{i_j}$ to be integers, $B_{j-1}+B_j$ and $B_j-B_{j-1}$ must both be even. This implies $B_{j-1}$ and $B_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $B_0=0$ (even), all $B_j$ must be even.\nIn particular, $B_k=n+1$ must be even. This means $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions. The probability is $0$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, so all $B_j$ can be even.\nThe condition $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must also hold for all $i \\in S$.\n$p_{i_j} = (B_j-B_{j-1})/2 \\ge 1 \\implies B_j-B_{j-1} \\ge 2$.\n$i_j = (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2$.\nThe condition $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ becomes $(B_j-B_{j-1})/2 \\le (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2 \\implies B_j-B_{j-1} \\le B_{j-1}+B_j \\implies -B_{j-1} \\le B_{j-1} \\implies 2B_{j-1} \\ge 0 \\implies B_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is true since $B_0=0$ and $B_j$ are increasing.\nThe condition $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ becomes $(B_j-B_{j-1})/2 \\le n+1-(B_{j-1}+B_j)/2 \\implies B_j-B_{j-1} \\le 2(n+1)-(B_{j-1}+B_j) \\implies B_j-B_{j-1} \\le B_k - (B_{j-1}+B_j) \\implies B_j-B_{j-1} \\le B_k-B_{j-1}-B_j \\implies 2B_j \\le B_k$. This implies $B_j \\le (n+1)/2$.\nSo, for any tower $i_j \\in S$, its right boundary $B_j$ must be $\\le (n+1)/2$.\nThis means all towers must be in the first half of the towns. This is not right.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ implies $i+p_i \\le n+1$. This is $B_j \\le n+1$. This is always true for $B_j \\le B_k$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ implies $i-p_i \\ge 0$. This is $B_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is always true for $B_{j-1} \\ge B_0$.\nSo the only conditions on $B_j$ are that they must be even integers, $0=B_0 < B_1 < \\dots < B_k=n+1$, and $B_j-B_{j-1} \\ge 2$. Also $i_j = (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2$ must be an integer from $1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe set $S$ of towns where towers are built must be exactly the set $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$. If there is any $j \\in S$ not in $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$, or any $j \\notin S$ but in $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$, the conditions cannot be met.\nSo, a set $S$ is \"good\" if and only if:\n1. $n$ is odd.\n2. $S$ consists of a sequence of towns $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\n3. There exist even integers $0=B_0 < B_1 < \\dots < B_k=n+1$ such that $B_j-B_{j-1} \\ge 2$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n4. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, $i_j = (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2$.\n5. No tower is built in any town $m \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$.\n\nThis implies that $S$ is uniquely determined by the sequence of $B_j$'s.\nThe towns $i_j$ are the midpoints of the intervals $(B_{j-1}, B_j)$.\nThe set of $B_j$ values partitions the interval $[0, n+1]$ into segments of even length.\nThe towns $i_j$ are centers of these segments.\nFor $S$ to be \"good\", it must be exactly the set of these centers. All other towns $m \\notin S$ must not have towers.\n\nLet $N=(n+1)/2$. Since $n$ is odd, $N$ is an integer.\nLet $b_j = B_j/2$. Then $0=b_0 < b_1 < \\dots < b_k = N$.\nAnd $b_j-b_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\nThe town $i_j = (2b_{j-1}+2b_j)/2 = b_{j-1}+b_j$.\nThe set of towns $S$ is $\\{b_0+b_1, b_1+b_2, \\dots, b_{k-1}+b_k\\}$.\nAll $b_j$ are distinct integers from $0$ to $N$.\nThe condition $b_j-b_{j-1} \\ge 1$ is naturally satisfied if $b_j$ are distinct and sorted.\nThe values $b_j$ can be chosen by picking $k-1$ distinct integers from $\\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ and sorting them.\nLet $S_b = \\{b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_k\\}$ be the set of selected boundaries.\nThe set of towers $S_i = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j = b_{j-1}+b_j$.\nThe total number of towns is $n$. The total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nWe need to count the number of \"good\" sets $S$.\n\nA \"good\" set $S$ is defined by a sequence $0=b_0 < b_1 < \\dots < b_k=N$.\nFor each such sequence, the towns in $S_i = \\{b_0+b_1, b_1+b_2, \\dots, b_{k-1}+b_k\\}$ must have towers.\nAll towns $m \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S_i$ must *not* have towers.\nThis means that for a choice of $S_b$, there is only one configuration of towers (all $i \\in S_i$ built, all $i \\notin S_i$ not built).\nThe probability of this specific configuration is $(1/2)^n$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of valid sequences $0=b_0 < b_1 < \\dots < b_k=N$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing $k-1$ distinct integers from $\\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\nThe number of ways to choose $k-1$ integers from $N-1$ is $\\binom{N-1}{k-1}$.\nThe total number of such sequences is $\\sum_{k=1}^N \\binom{N-1}{k-1}$.\nThis is $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\binom{N-1}{j} = 2^{N-1}$.\nSo there are $2^{N-1}$ such \"good\" sets $S$.\n\nThe probability is $2^{N-1} \\cdot (1/2)^n = 2^{N-1-n}$.\nSince $N=(n+1)/2$, this is $2^{(n+1)/2 - 1 - n} = 2^{(-n+1)/2 - 1} = 2^{-(n+1)/2}$.\nSo the probability is $1/2^{(n+1)/2}$.\n\nThis formula holds if $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is even, the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n$n=2$: $n$ is even. Probability should be $0$. Example output: $748683265$. This is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My logic is wrong for even $n$.\n\nWhat is wrong with $n$ being even?\nThe error is in assuming $B_j$ must be even.\n$i_j = (B_{j-1}+B_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j} = (B_j-B_{j-1})/2$.\nFor $i_j, p_{i_j}$ to be integers, $B_{j-1}$ and $B_j$ must have the same parity.\n$B_0 = 0$ (even). So $B_1$ must be even, $B_2$ must be even, ..., $B_k$ must be even.\nSo $n+1$ must be even, which means $n$ must be odd.\nThis logic seems sound. Why does $n=2$ have $1/4$?\nIf $n=2$, towns are $0,1,2,3$. Towers in $1,2$.\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$C(1,1) = [1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1]$.\n$C(2,1) = [2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2]$.\nThese partition $\\{1,2\\}$.\n$p_1=1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1) = \\min(1,2)=1$. OK.\n$p_2=1 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1)=1$. OK.\nTowns $0,3$ not covered. OK.\nThis works for $S=\\{1,2\\}$. This configuration has probability $1/4$.\nMy logic for $B_j$ being even is indeed wrong for this case.\nLet's trace $B_j$ for $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $n=2$.\n$i_1=1, i_2=2$.\n$p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$i_1-p_1=0$. This is $B_0$.\n$i_1+p_1=1+1=2$. This is $B_1$.\n$i_2-p_2=2-1=1$. This is $B_1$.\n$i_2+p_2=2+1=3$. This is $B_2$.\nSo we have $B_0=0, B_1=2, B_2=3$.\nHere $B_0$ is even, $B_1$ is even, but $B_2=n+1=3$ is odd.\nMy conclusion that $B_j$ must all have the same parity as $B_0$ is correct. $B_j$ must all be even.\nBut $B_k=n+1$. If $n+1$ is odd, then $B_k$ cannot be even.\nThis means my definition of $B_j$ is slightly off, or the problem is not about these $B_j$.\n\nThe definition of $C(i,p)$ is towns $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$, i.e. $i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\nThe interval of real numbers covered is $(i-p, i+p)$.\nThe problem is about integer towns.\nThe set of towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be partitioned.\nThe intervals are $[L_j, R_j]$.\n$L_1=1, R_k=n$. $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means the intervals are $[1, R_1], [R_1+1, R_2], \\dots, [R_{k-1}+1, n]$.\nThe center of $[L_j, R_j]$ is $i_j$. So $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThe length of $[L_j, R_j]$ is $2p_{i_j}-1$.\n$R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_{i_j}-1$.\n$L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$. $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\n$R_j = L_{j+1}-1 \\implies i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThis means $i_j+p_{i_j}$ and $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ are the same integer. Let's call this $M_j$.\n$M_0 = i_1-p_{i_1}$.\n$M_1 = i_1+p_{i_1}$. $M_1 = i_2-p_{i_2}$.\n$M_k = i_k+p_{i_k}$.\nThe sequence $M_0, M_1, \\dots, M_k$ are the \"real\" boundaries.\n$M_0 = 0$. $M_k = n+1$.\n$i_j = (M_{j-1}+M_j)/2$. $p_{i_j} = (M_j-M_{j-1})/2$.\nFor $i_j, p_{i_j}$ to be integers, $M_{j-1}$ and $M_j$ must have the same parity.\n$M_0=0$ (even). So all $M_j$ must be even.\nThis implies $M_k=n+1$ must be even. So $n$ must be odd.\n\nThe example $n=2$ (even) has $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$i_1=1, p_1=1 \\implies M_0=i_1-p_1=0$. $M_1=i_1+p_1=2$.\n$i_2=2, p_2=1 \\implies M_1=i_2-p_2=1$. This is wrong! $M_1$ must be unique.\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ is for towns.\n$i_j+p_{i_j}-1$ is the rightmost town covered by tower $i_j$.\n$i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ is the leftmost town covered by tower $i_{j+1}$.\nIf these are $R_j$ and $L_{j+1}$, then $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nFor $n=2$, $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n$p_1=1 \\implies C(1,1)=[1,1]$. $L_1=1, R_1=1$.\n$p_2=1 \\implies C(2,1)=[2,2]$. $L_2=2, R_2=2$.\n$R_1=1, L_2=2$. So $R_1=L_2-1$. This works.\nThe values $i_j+p_{i_j}$ and $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ are not necessarily equal.\n$i_j+p_{i_j}$ is the right real boundary, $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ is the left real boundary.\nThe towns covered are $(i_j-p_{i_j}, i_j+p_{i_j})$.\nThe condition is that these intervals $(i_j-p_{i_j}, i_j+p_{i_j})$ tile $(0, n+1)$.\nThis means $i_1-p_{i_1}=0$.\n$i_k+p_{i_k}=n+1$.\nAnd $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis is exactly what I had. So $n$ must be odd.\n\nThe example $n=2$ with $S=\\{1,2\\}$:\n$i_1=1, p_1=1$. $i_1-p_1=0$. $i_1+p_1=2$.\n$i_2=2, p_2=1$. $i_2-p_2=1$. $i_2+p_2=3$.\nThe intervals are $(0,2)$ and $(1,3)$. These are NOT disjoint. They overlap on $(1,2)$.\nTown 1 is covered by tower 1. Town 2 is covered by tower 2.\nTown 1 is covered by $C(1,1)=[1,1]$.\nTown 2 is covered by $C(2,1)=[2,2]$.\nThis is a partition of $\\{1,2\\}$.\nMy interpretation of \"intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$\" was wrong.\nIt should be \"the sets of towns $C(i,p_i)$ must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$\".\nThe set of towns covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$ is $C_i = \\{i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1\\}$.\nWe need $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} C_i = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset$ for $i \\ne j$.\nAlso $C_i \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is guaranteed by $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to choose a set of towers $S \\cap [1, k]$ and assign powers such that towns $1, \\dots, k$ are partitioned.\nFor $k=0$, $dp[0]=1$ (empty set of towns, empty set of towers).\nFor $k > 0$, to partition towns $1, \\dots, k$:\nThe town $k$ must be covered by some tower $i \\in S$.\nThis tower $i$ must cover an interval ending at $k$. So $i+p_i-1=k$.\nThis implies $p_i = k-i+1$.\nThe conditions on $p_i$:\n1. $p_i \\ge 1 \\implies k-i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies i \\le k$.\n2. $p_i \\le i \\implies k-i+1 \\le i \\implies k+1 \\le 2i \\implies i \\ge (k+1)/2$.\n3. $p_i \\le n+1-i \\implies k-i+1 \\le n+1-i \\implies k \\le n$. (This is always true for $k \\le n$).\nSo, town $k$ must be covered by a tower $i \\in S$ where $(k+1)/2 \\le i \\le k$.\nThis tower $i$ covers towns $[i-p_i+1, k] = [i-(k-i+1)+1, k] = [2i-k, k]$.\nThe remaining towns $[1, 2i-k-1]$ must be partitioned by other towers in $S$.\nSo, $dp[k]$ is the sum of $dp[2i-k-1]$ for all $i \\in S$ such that $(k+1)/2 \\le i \\le k$.\nThis is a DP for a fixed $S$. We need to sum over all $S$.\n\nLet $f[k]$ be the number of ways to choose towers in $S \\cap [1, k]$ such that towns $1, \\dots, k$ are partitioned, AND all towns $j \\in [1, k] \\setminus S$ do NOT have towers built.\n$f[0] = 1$.\nFor $k=1, \\dots, n$:\n  $f[k] = 0$.\n  For each $i$ such that $(k+1)/2 \\le i \\le k$:\n    If we choose tower $i$ to cover $[2i-k, k]$:\n      This means $i$ must have a tower.\n      All towns $j \\in [2i-k, k]$, $j \\ne i$, must NOT have towers.\n      The number of towns $j \\in [2i-k, k]$ excluding $i$ is $(k-(2i-k)+1)-1 = 2k-2i$.\n      The number of towns $j \\in [1, 2i-k-1]$ is $2i-k-1$.\n      For this to be a valid choice, town $i$ must have a tower, and all $j \\in [2i-k, k] \\setminus \\{i\\}$ must NOT have towers.\n      The towns $1, \\dots, 2i-k-1$ must be partitioned using towers in $S \\cap [1, 2i-k-1]$.\n      This means $f[k] += f[2i-k-1]$ IF tower $i$ is built AND no other towers in $[2i-k, k]$ are built.\n\nThis is still not right. The problem is about total probability.\nLet $A$ be the event that a valid power assignment exists. We want $P(A)$.\n$P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of } S \\text{ for which a valid assignment exists}}{2^n}$.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to choose towers in $S \\cap [1, k]$ and assign powers such that towns $1, \\dots, k$ are partitioned, and *no tower is built in towns $k+1, \\dots, n$*. This is too complex.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to partition the prefix $[1, k]$ using towers $i \\in S \\cap [1, k]$ such that $i$ is the center of its interval, and all other towns $m \\in [1, k] \\setminus S$ are not centers.\nThis is a \"Fibonacci-like\" recurrence.\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to partition $[1, k]$ into intervals $C(i,p_i)$ where $i$ is in $S$ and $p_i$ is chosen appropriately.\nSuppose $k$ is covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i=k-i+1$.\nThis tower covers $[2i-k, k]$.\nThe condition $(k+1)/2 \\le i \\le k$ must hold.\nAlso, $i$ must be in $S$. And no other $j \\in S$ can be in $[2i-k, k]$.\nThis means $S \\cap [2i-k, k] = \\{i\\}$.\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ for this segment is $1 \\cdot (1/2)^{k-(2i-k)-1} = (1/2)^{2k-2i}$.\nThe remaining problem is to partition $[1, 2i-k-1]$.\nThis suggests $dp[k]$ is the total number of ways to choose $S \\cap [1, k]$ such that $1, \\dots, k$ is covered.\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of valid configurations of towers for the prefix $1, \\dots, k$.\n$dp[0] = 1$.\nFor $k=1, \\dots, n$:\n  $dp[k] = 0$.\n  For $i$ from $\\lceil (k+1)/2 \\rceil$ to $k$:\n    A tower at $i$ covers $[2i-k, k]$.\n    This tower must be present. The $2k-2i$ towns in $[2i-k, k] \\setminus \\{i\\}$ must not have towers.\n    The remaining $n-k$ towns $k+1, \\dots, n$ can have towers or not. This is $2^{n-k}$ options.\n    The remaining $2i-k-1$ towns $1, \\dots, 2i-k-1$ must be partitioned.\n    So, $dp[k] = \\sum_{i=\\lceil (k+1)/2 \\rceil}^k dp[2i-k-1]$.\nThis $dp[k]$ counts the number of ways to choose $S \\cap [1, k]$ that partition $1, \\dots, k$.\nThe final answer is $dp[n]$.\nThis is essentially counting the number of ways to partition the integer $n$ into parts of the form $2p-1$ where $p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThe values $i$ are the centers.\nThe sequence $dp[k]$ is:\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]$: $i=1$. $p_1=1-1+1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(1)-1-1=0$. $dp[1]=dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[2]$:\n  $i=1$: $(2+1)/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1.5 \\le 1$ False.\n  $i=2$: $(2+1)/2 \\le 2 \\implies 1.5 \\le 2$ True. $p_2=2-2+1=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(2)-2-1=1$. $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[3]$:\n  $i=2$: $(3+1)/2 \\le 2 \\implies 2 \\le 2$ True. $p_2=3-2+1=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(2)-3-1=0$. $dp[3]+=dp[0]=1$.\n  $i=3$: $(3+1)/2 \\le 3 \\implies 2 \\le 3$ True. $p_3=3-3+1=1$. Covers $[3,3]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(3)-3-1=2$. $dp[3]+=dp[2]=1$.\n  So $dp[3]=1+1=2$.\n$dp[4]$:\n  $i=2$: $(4+1)/2 \\le 2 \\implies 2.5 \\le 2$ False.\n  $i=3$: $(4+1)/2 \\le 3 \\implies 2.5 \\le 3$ True. $p_3=4-3+1=2$. Covers $[2,4]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(3)-4-1=1$. $dp[4]+=dp[1]=1$.\n  $i=4$: $(4+1)/2 \\le 4 \\implies 2.5 \\le 4$ True. $p_4=4-4+1=1$. Covers $[4,4]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(4)-4-1=3$. $dp[4]+=dp[3]=2$.\n  So $dp[4]=1+2=3$.\n$dp[5]$:\n  $i=3$: $(5+1)/2 \\le 3 \\implies 3 \\le 3$ True. $p_3=5-3+1=3$. Covers $[1,5]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(3)-5-1=0$. $dp[5]+=dp[0]=1$.\n  $i=4$: $(5+1)/2 \\le 4 \\implies 3 \\le 4$ True. $p_4=5-4+1=2$. Covers $[3,5]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(4)-5-1=2$. $dp[5]+=dp[2]=1$.\n  $i=5$: $(5+1)/2 \\le 5 \\implies 3 \\le 5$ True. $p_5=5-5+1=1$. Covers $[5,5]$. $2i-k-1 = 2(5)-5-1=4$. $dp[5]+=dp[4]=3$.\n  So $dp[5]=1+1+3=5$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[k]$ is $1,1,1,2,3,5, \\dots$. This is Fibonacci sequence $F_{k}$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nSo $dp[k] = F_k$ for $k \\ge 1$, $dp[0]=1$. (If we define $F_0=1, F_1=1$ then $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$).\nLet's use $F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$. Then $dp[k]=F_{k+1}$.\n$dp[0]=1$. $dp[1]=F_2=1$. $dp[2]=F_3=2$. No, $dp[2]=1$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\n$dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5$.\nThis sequence is $dp[k] = F_{k+1}$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\n$F_1=1 \\implies dp[0]=F_1$.\n$F_2=1 \\implies dp[1]=F_2$.\n$F_3=2 \\implies dp[2]=F_3$. No, $dp[2]=1$.\nThis is $F_k$ if $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\n$dp[k] = F_k$ for $k \\ge 0$ where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_k = F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$.\n$F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8$.\nNo, $dp[k]$ values are $1,1,1,2,3,5$.\n$dp[k] = F_{k-1}$ for $k \\ge 2$, with $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\n$dp[0]=1$. $dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[k]$ for $k \\ge 2$:\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor - 1} dp[k-1-2j]$ (This is for a different problem, where $i$ is fixed to be $k-j$).\n\nLet's carefully write the DP state and transitions:\n$dp[k]$ is the number of ways to choose a set of towers $S_k \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $1, \\dots, k$ is perfectly partitioned by towers in $S_k$, and for any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\} \\setminus S_k$, no tower is built at $j$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty prefix, empty set of towers).\nFor $k=1, \\dots, n$:\n  $dp[k] = 0$.\n  For each $i$ from $\\lceil (k+1)/2 \\rceil$ to $k$:\n    Let $p_i = k-i+1$. This is the power for tower $i$.\n    This tower covers $[2i-k, k]$.\n    For this to be a valid construction for $1, \\dots, k$:\n      1. Tower $i$ must be built.\n      2. No other towers in $[2i-k, k]$ (i.e. $j \\in [2i-k, k]$ and $j \\ne i$) must be built.\n      3. The prefix $[1, 2i-k-1]$ must be partitioned by towers chosen from $S_{2i-k-1}$.\n    So, $dp[k] = \\sum_{i=\\lceil (k+1)/2 \\rceil}^k dp[2i-k-1]$.\nThe values $dp[k]$ are indeed $1,1,1,2,3,5, \\dots$.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]$: $i=1$. $(1+1)/2 \\le 1 \\le 1$. $dp[1]=dp[2(1)-1-1]=dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[2]$: $i=2$. $(2+1)/2 \\le 2 \\le 2$. $dp[2]=dp[2(2)-2-1]=dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[3]$: $i=2$. $(3+1)/2 \\le 2 \\le 3$. $dp[3]+=dp[2(2)-3-1]=dp[0]=1$.\n         $i=3$. $(3+1)/2 \\le 3 \\le 3$. $dp[3]+=dp[2(3)-3-1]=dp[2]=1$. Total $dp[3]=1+1=2$.\n$dp[4]$: $i=3$. $(4+1)/2 \\le 3 \\le 4$. $dp[4]+=dp[2(3)-4-1]=dp[1]=1$.\n         $i=4$. $(4+1)/2 \\le 4 \\le 4$. $dp[4]+=dp[2(4)-4-1]=dp[3]=2$. Total $dp[4]=1+2=3$.\n$dp[5]$: $i=3$. $(5+1)/2 \\le 3 \\le 5$. $dp[5]+=dp[2(3)-5-1]=dp[0]=1$.\n         $i=4$. $(5+1)/2 \\le 4 \\le 5$. $dp[5]+=dp[2(4)-5-1]=dp[2]=1$.\n         $i=5$. $(5+1)/2 \\le 5 \\le 5$. $dp[5]+=dp[2(5)-5-1]=dp[4]=3$. Total $dp[5]=1+1+3=5$.\n\nThis sequence is $dp[k] = F_{k-1}$ for $k \\ge 2$, if $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$.\nOr $dp[k] = F_{k}$ for $k \\ge 1$ if $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_3=2$.\n$dp[4]=F_4=3$.\n$dp[5]=F_5=5$.\nSo $dp[k] = F_k$ for $k \\ge 1$ and $dp[0]=1$. (Using standard Fibonacci $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThis means $dp[n]$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number (with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$).\nThe maximum $n$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. We need to compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThis can be done using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time or by simple iteration in $O(n)$ time. $O(n)$ is fine for $n=2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nThe total number of configurations of towers is $2^n$.\nThe number of \"good\" configurations $S$ is $dp[n]$.\nFor each such \"good\" $S$, the probability is $1/2^n$.\nSo the total probability is $dp[n] / 2^n$.\nWe need to calculate $dp[n] \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$dp[n]$ is $F_n$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\n\nExample $n=2$: $F_2=1$. Probability $1/2^2 = 1/4$. Matches example output.\nExample $n=3$: $F_3=2$. Probability $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches example output.\nExample $n=5$: $F_5=5$. Probability $5/2^5 = 5/32$. Matches example output.\n\nThis looks correct. The interpretation of \"exactly one radio tower each\" means that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is a unique $i \\in S$ such that $j \\in C(i,p_i)$. This implies that the sets $C(i,p_i)$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. And crucially, any town $m \\notin S$ cannot be chosen as a tower center. And any town $m \\in S$ must be chosen as a tower center. The DP counts exactly these configurations where $S$ is precisely the set of centers.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Initialize $MOD = 998244353$.\n2. Compute $F_n \\pmod{MOD}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$.\n   This can be done iteratively:\n   $f_0 = 0$\n   $f_1 = 1$\n   For $k=2, \\dots, n$:\n     $f_k = (f_{k-1} + f_{k-2}) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   If $n=0$, $F_0=0$.\n3. Compute $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{MOD}$. This is $pow(2, n, MOD)^{-1} \\pmod{MOD}$ or $pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD-2, MOD)$.\n4. The result is $(F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1}) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nEdge case $n=1$:\n$F_1=1$.\n$2^1=2$.\nResult: $1 \\cdot 2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$.\nCheck $n=1$:\nTowers in town 1. $S=\\{1\\}$.\n$p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1) = \\min(1,1)=1$. So $p_1=1$.\n$C(1,1)=[1,1]$. This partitions $\\{1\\}$. $0,2$ not covered. Valid.\nThis happens if tower 1 is built (prob $1/2$).\nIf tower 1 is not built (prob $1/2$), $S=\\emptyset$. No towers, cannot partition $\\{1\\}$. Invalid.\nSo probability is $1/2$. Matches.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    MOD = 998244353\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        # If n=0, there are no towns 1..n.
