    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The core of the problem is about dissecting a directed graph into its strongly connected components (SCCs) and figuring out how to arrange those components to minimize the total number of nodes while meeting a \"p-reachable\" condition. The p-reachable condition specifies that there must be exactly `p` pairs of nodes (u, v), where `u < v`, that are mutually reachable.\n\nI started by breaking down the definitions, making sure I understood what a \"p-reachable\" graph and a \"unidirectional pair\" were.  The `u < v` condition is tricky, but it's important to realize it's about counting pairs to ensure no double-counting. Each SCC is a \"clique\" in our graph, meaning all nodes within it are mutually reachable. The number of such (u, v) pairs is determined by the size of the SCC.\n\nTo minimize the node count, I realized I needed to maximize the size of each SCC. With this in mind, I need to look for largest 'k' that can satisfy the  `k * (k-1) / 2 <= p`. So, `p` can be made up of multiples of these `k`s. I needed to repeatedly find the largest k value that satisfied this condition.\n\nNext I focused on the \"unidirectional\" pairs. These exist when there is a path from `u` to `v`, but there is no path from `v` to `u`. Thinking about the DAG (directed acyclic graph) that is formed by contracting each SCC into a single node, I realized that I'd maximize these unidirectional pairs by creating a chain of SCCs, like `SCC1 -> SCC2 -> SCC3`. In a chain, every pair `(u, v)` where u is in an earlier SCC and `v` is in a later SCC is unidirectional. I had to focus on the structure of the DAG to determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. The tricky part here was ensuring that the unidirectional pair calculations align with the example given, and I found the error in my reasoning and calculation. The max number of unidirectional pairs equals `sum(k_i * k_j)` for any ordered pairs of SCC nodes (i, j) where i < j.\n\nTo summarize, my approach combines a greedy strategy to calculate the minimum number of nodes `n` and a structural understanding of SCCs to maximize unidirectional pairs. I needed to correctly interpret the meaning of p-reachable graphs, and unidirectionality to solve this problem correctly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- A directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, then any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` from this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nLet the graph consist of `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i`.\nThe `p`-reachable condition means `\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2 = p`.\nWe want to minimize `n = \\sum k_i` subject to this sum.\nThe function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` is convex for `k \\ge 1`. To minimize `\\sum k_i` for a fixed `\\sum f(k_i) = p`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and make their sizes `k_i` as large as possible. This is a greedy approach:\n1. Initialize `n = 0`, `current_p = p`.\n2. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k \\ge 2` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 \\le current_p`.\n   b. Add `k` to `n`.\n   c. Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `current_p`.\n3. If `current_p` becomes 0, `n` is the minimum number of nodes.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`. `k * (k-1) / 2 \\approx k^2 / 2`. So `k \\approx \\sqrt{2p} \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 10^5} \\approx 632`. We can precompute `f(k)` values or use binary search to find `k` in step 2a. A simple loop for `k` from `632` down to `2` for each `current_p` will be efficient enough since the number of SCCs `m` is small (at most `p` if `k_i=2` for all `i`).\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, `u` can reach `v`, and `v` cannot reach `u`.\nThis occurs when `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, say `SCC_u` and `SCC_v`, and there's a path from `SCC_u` to `SCC_v` in the DAG of SCCs, but no path from `SCC_v` to `SCC_u`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we need to minimize pairs `(u, v)` where `u` cannot reach `v` and `v` cannot reach `u`. This happens when the DAG of SCCs has no incomparable components. The optimal structure for this is a linear chain of SCCs: `SCC_1 \\to SCC_2 \\to \\dots \\to SCC_m`.\nIn such a chain, for any `u \\in SCC_i` and `v \\in SCC_j`:\n- If `i = j`: `u` and `v` are mutually reachable.\n- If `i < j`: `u` can reach `v`, `v` cannot reach `u`. So `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair. There are `k_i \\cdot k_j` such pairs.\n- If `i > j`: `u` cannot reach `v`, `v` can reach `u`. So `(u, v)` is NOT a unidirectional pair.\n\nThus, the total number of unidirectional pairs in a linear chain of SCCs is `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i \\cdot k_j`.\nThis sum can be computed efficiently. Let `S = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i = n`.\nThe sum `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i \\cdot k_j` is part of the expansion of `(\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i)^2`.\nSpecifically, `S^2 = (\\sum k_i)^2 = \\sum k_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i \\cdot k_j`.\nSo, `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i \\cdot k_j = (S^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2) / 2`.\nThis is the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n\n1. **Calculate `n` and `k_i` values:**\n   Initialize `nodes_count = 0`, `current_p = p`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n   While `current_p > 0`:\n     Find `k` (integer `\\ge 2`) such that `k * (k - 1) // 2 \\le current_p` and `(k + 1) * k // 2 > current_p`.\n     A simple way to find `k` is to iterate `k_val` downwards from `632` (or `k_val = int((2 * current_p)**0.5) + 2` down to `2`) until `k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2 \\le current_p`.\n     Add `k` to `nodes_count`.\n     Append `k` to `scc_sizes`.\n     Subtract `k * (k - 1) // 2` from `current_p`.\n   The minimum number of nodes is `nodes_count`.\n\n2. **Calculate maximum unidirectional pairs:**\n   `total_unidirectional_pairs = 0`.\n   `current_sum_k = 0`.\n   `current_sum_k_sq = 0`.\n   For `k` in `scc_sizes`:\n     `current_sum_k += k`.\n     `current_sum_k_sq += k * k`.\n   `total_unidirectional_pairs = (current_sum_k * current_sum_k - current_sum_k_sq) // 2`.\n   This is the sum `\\sum_{i < j} k_i k_j`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- `p = 0`:\n  - Minimum nodes: `n=0`. The loop for `n` won't run. `nodes_count` remains `0`. `scc_sizes` is empty.\n  - Max unidirectional pairs: `current_sum_k = 0`, `current_sum_k_sq = 0`. So `(0*0 - 0) // 2 = 0`.\n  - Output: `0 0`. This is correct.\n\n**Example 1: p = 3**\n1. `current_p = 3`, `nodes_count = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n   - `k=3`: `3 * 2 // 2 = 3 \\le 3`. `k=4` would be `6 > 3`. So `k=3`.\n   - `nodes_count = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   - `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n   - `current_p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n   Loop terminates. Minimum nodes `n = 3`.\n2. `current_sum_k = 3`, `current_sum_k_sq = 3*3 = 9`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `(3*3 - 9) // 2 = (9 - 9) // 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**Example 2: p = 4**\n1. `current_p = 4`, `nodes_count = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n   - `k=3`: `3 * 2 // 2 = 3 \\le 4`. `k=4` would be `6 > 4`. So `k=3`.\n   - `nodes_count = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   - `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n   - `current_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n   - `current_p = 1`.\n     `k=2`: `2 * 1 // 2 = 1 \\le 1`. `k=3` would be `3 > 1`. So `k=2`.\n   - `nodes_count = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   - `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\n   - `current_p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n   Loop terminates. Minimum nodes `n = 5`.\n2. `current_sum_k = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   `current_sum_k_sq = 3*3 + 2*2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `(5*5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`.
