After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Marks\" problem.  The goal is to find the number of \"successful\" students based on their marks in different subjects. First, let's break down the input: we've got the number of students (`n`) and subjects (`m`), and then the actual marks for each student in each subject.  The \"best\" student in a subject is the one with the highest mark, and a \"successful\" student is one who is the best in *at least one* subject.\n\n**Data Structures and Approach**\n\nTo represent the data, a 2D structure makes sense - either a list of lists or an array of strings. We'll store the grades in a data structure where `gradebook[i][j]` represents the mark of the `i`th student in the `j`th subject. Because the marks are single digits, integer conversion is the most efficient. To identify the maximum mark for each subject, we will initialize a list to hold these maximums (`max_marks_per_subject`). To identify the successful students, a set will efficiently store the indexes of the successful students, handling any duplicates. The `successful_students_indices` set will keep track of unique successful students. We'll iterate through each subject, find the maximum mark and add the students achieving that mark to the set.\n\n**Implementation Details and Complexity**\n\nWe'll start by reading the input and converting the marks to integers. Now we can proceed with a modular process: first, calculating the maximum mark for each subject. Then, identify successful students by checking for these maximum marks in each subject. Finally, the size of the set will give us the count of successful students. We're looking at a time complexity of O(n*m) for reading the data, finding max marks, and identifying successful students.  The size limitation `n, m <= 100` makes this manageable, and the O(n*m) is extremely efficient, so no optimizations will be required.\n\n**Code Structure and Edge Case Check**\n\nThe final Python implementation will include input reading using `sys.stdin.readline` for speed, nested loops for identifying maximum marks and finding successful students, and using a set to efficiently count unique students. Reading the input properly with `.strip()` will be critical to remove the newline characters.  I've checked the examples and the logic seems sound.  The problem description is clear, and the chosen data structure and approach will be sufficient to handle all edge cases and produce the correct output.",
