Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "**Solving the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The \"Crazy Town\" problem is all about finding the fewest steps to get from home to the university. We're on a plane divided into blocks by lines, and a step means crossing a line. I've got to find the most efficient route.\n\nThe key is realizing that each line acts like a divider. For a point's journey, the crucial factor isn't the *specific* value of where it lands relative to the line (ax + by + c), but whether the points are on the same side or opposite sides of the line. Home and university can't lie directly on any line. This allows us to work with just the sign of ax + by + c.\n\nNow, if home and the university are on the *same* side of a line for every line in the town, then we're golden, zero steps. However, if they're on opposite sides of a line, we've got a line to cross. In essence, my route has to cross the dividing lines in some way.\n\nI've got a system, and here's my plan: For each line I calculate the value of ax+by+c for home and university. If the product of those values is negative, meaning the signs are different, those points are on opposite sides of the line. So each road where the signs are different adds one to my total steps.  If they have the same sign, I don't need to cross the road (because the home and university are on the same block, as far as that road is concerned). My final answer is just the count of lines where their signs differ. This number represents the absolute minimum steps it would take.\n\nIt's essentially a counting game; a simple algorithm.  I iterate through the lines, perform a couple of multiplications and additions, and a single comparison. Then, I print the number of \"separating\" lines I've found. Boom, that's my answer.\n\nThis also seems robust to edge cases, with large coordinates and potentially parallel or concurrent roads. Since I'm simply looking at sign comparisons, the magnitudes don't matter. Since I'm using Python, I don't have to worry about integer overflow. Seems like a simple and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (your home) to a target block (the university). The plane is divided into blocks by `n` infinite line roads. A step is defined as moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length, which means crossing exactly one road. It's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road.\n\nLet's represent a road by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`. This line divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x, y)` not on the line, the expression `ax + by + c` will be either positive or negative. Points on one side of the line will yield a positive value, and points on the other side will yield a negative value.\n\nYour home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` are located in specific blocks.\n1. If your home and the university are in the *same* block, it means they are on the same side of *every* road. In this case, no steps are needed, and the answer is 0.\n2. If your home and the university are in *different* blocks, it means there is at least one road `i` such that `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of road `i`.\n\nConsider a single road `i` defined by `a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0`.\n- Calculate `val_home = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i`.\n- Calculate `val_univ = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i`.\n\nSince neither point lies on any road, `val_home` and `val_univ` will never be zero.\n- If `val_home` and `val_univ` have the *same sign* (both positive or both negative), it means your home and the university are on the same side of road `i`. You do not need to cross this road to get from home to university.\n- If `val_home` and `val_univ` have *opposite signs* (one positive and one negative), it means your home and the university are on opposite sides of road `i`. To move from the block containing home to the block containing the university, you *must* cross this road. This constitutes one step.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required is simply the total count of roads for which your home and the university are on opposite sides. Each such road must be crossed at least once. A straight line path from your home to the university will cross exactly these roads, and each crossing represents one step. Therefore, the number of such roads directly gives the minimum number of steps.\n\nTo check if two non-zero numbers have opposite signs, we can check if their product is negative (`val_home * val_univ < 0`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read the coordinates of your home `(x1, y1)`.\n2. Read the coordinates of the university `(x2, y2)`.\n3. Read the number of roads `n`.\n4. Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5. For each of the `n` roads:\n    a. Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the current road `ax + by + c = 0`.\n    b. Calculate `val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`.\n    c. Calculate `val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`.\n    d. If `val_home * val_univ < 0`, increment `steps`.\n6. Print the final value of `steps`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nRoads:\n1. `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y=0`)\n2. `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x=0`)\n\nFor Home (1, 1):\n- Road 1 (`y=0`): `0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1` (positive)\n- Road 2 (`x=0`): `1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1` (positive)\n\nFor University (-1, -1):\n- Road 1 (`y=0`): `0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1` (negative)\n- Road 2 (`x=0`): `1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1` (negative)\n\nComparing signs:\n- Road 1: Home (positive), University (negative). Opposite signs. `steps` becomes 1.\n- Road 2: Home (positive), University (negative). Opposite signs. `steps` becomes 2.\n\nFinal answer: 2.\n\n**Constraints and Data Types:**\nCoordinates and coefficients are up to `10^6`.\nThe expression `a*x + b*y + c` can be up to `10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6` which is approximately `2 * 10^12`. This fits within a 64-bit integer type (like `long long` in C++).\nThe product `val_home * val_univ` can be up to `(2 * 10^12)^2 = 4 * 10^24`. Python's integers handle arbitrary precision, so this is not an issue. In languages like C++ or Java, one would need to compare signs explicitly: `(val_home > 0 and val_univ < 0) or (val_home < 0 and val_univ > 0)`.\n\nThe solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(N) where N is the number of roads. Given N <= 300, this is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read coordinates of home (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read coordinates of university (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the minimum number of steps\n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients (a, b, c) for the current line equation: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Calculate the value of the expression ax + by + c for the home point.\n        # The sign of this value indicates which side of the line the home point is on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        \n        # Calculate the value of the expression ax + by + c for the university point.\n        # The sign of this value indicates which side of the line the university point is on.\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        # If val_home and val_univ have opposite signs, it means home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this line.
