There are $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$ distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ edge-weighted trees with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each edge is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. Your task is to find the sum of $$$d(1,n)^\\ddagger$$$ of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$). That is why total number of distinct edge-weighted tree is $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$.$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$d(u,v)$$$ denotes the sum of the weight of all edges on the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nThe only line of output should contain a single integer, the required answer, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n### Output\n['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, there is only $$$1$$$ distinct good tree. The value of $$$d(1,2)$$$ for that tree is $$$-1$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,352$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.In the second test case, the value of $$$d(1,1)$$$ for any tree is $$$0$$$, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the third test case, there are $$$16$$$ distinct good trees. The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees. The sum of $$$d(1,4)$$$ over all trees is $$$2 \\cdot (-2) + 8 \\cdot (-1) + 4 \\cdot (0) + 2 \\cdot (1) = -10$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,343$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

Then all x_i are determined.\n# d(1,n) = sum_{e=(u,v) on P_T(1,n)} x_u * x_v.\n# The sum of d(1,n) over all trees.\n\n# Let's check a source for the sum of distances for such trees.\n# A common result for this type of problem is related to the number of edges on the path.\n# The sum of path lengths (unweighted) from u to v over all trees is n^(n-3) * (n-1) * (n-1).\n# This is for u!=v.\n# For n=2, this is 2^(-1) * 1 * 1 = 1/2.\n# For n=3, this is 3^0 * 2 * 2 = 4.\n# For n=4, this is 4^1 * 3 * 3 = 36.\n\n# For n=2, there is 1 tree, d(1,2) = -1.\n# For n=4, there are 16 trees. The sum of d(1,4) is -10.\n\n# The sum of distances d(u,v) in a tree T is sum_{e=(x,y)} w_e * count(e,u,v),\n# where count(e,u,v) is 1 if e is on path from u to v, 0 otherwise.\n# So we need sum_{T} sum_{e=(x,y) on P_T(1,n)} w_e(T).\n# This is sum_{e=(x,y)} sum_{T: e on P_T(1,n)} w_e(T).\n\n# Let's reconsider the problem from a fundamental perspective.\n# The number of good trees is n^(n-2) for n even.\n# For each tree, the weights are uniquely determined.\n# Let's consider the value of w(u,v) for an edge (u,v).\n# It is known that for a fixed edge (u,v), the number of trees where w(u,v)=1 is equal to the number of trees where w(u,v)=-1.\n# No, this is not true for good trees.\n\n# Let's assume the formula is correct and my modulo arithmetic is off.\n# -10 mod 998244353 = 998244343.\n# My code gets 998244349.\n# This means my formula result is -10 + 6 = -4.\n# So for n=4, the formula is giving -4.\n# -(n-1) * n^(n-3) + (n-2) * n^(n-4)\n# = -(4-1) * 4^(4-3) + (4-2) * 4^(4-4)\n# = -3 * 4^1 + 2 * 4^0\n# = -12 + 2 = -10.\n# The value -10 is correct.\n# Why is my modulo arithmetic giving 998244349 instead of 998244343?\n# The value -10 modulo M is M - 10.\n# 998244353 - 10 = 998244343.\n# My code calculates:\n# term1 = (MOD - (n-1)) * power(n, n-3)\n# term2 = (n-2) * power(n, n-4)\n# ans = (term1 + term2) % MOD\n# This is equivalent to `(- (n-1) * power(n, n-3) + (n-2) * power(n, n-4)) % MOD`\n# In Python, `(-10) % 998244353` correctly gives `998244343`.\n# So the calculation `(-(n-1) * power(n, n-3) + (n-2) * power(n, n-4)) % MOD` should be correct.\n# Let's use negative numbers directly and then take modulo.\n# This might be the issue. Python's % operator handles negative numbers differently than C++.\n# `(-10) % 3` is `2` in Python. `(-10) % 3` is `-1` in C++.\n# So Python's `%` operator gives `a % n` in range `[0, n-1]` if `n` is positive.\n# So `(-10) % MOD` should give `998244343`.\n\n# Let's trace with n=4:\n# n_minus_1 = n - 1 = 3\n# n_minus_2 = n - 2 = 2\n# n_minus_3_pow = power(n, n - 3) = power(4, 1) = 4\n# n_minus_4_pow = power(n, n - 4) = power(4, 0) = 1\n# result = (-(n_minus_1 * n_minus_3_pow) + (n_minus_2 * n_minus_4_pow))\n# result = (-(3 * 4) + (2 * 1))\n# result = (-12 + 2)\n# result = -10\n# final_ans = result % MOD\n# final_ans = (-10) % 998244353 = 998244343.\n# This should be correct.\n# My manual calculation `(998244350 * 4 + 2)` was wrong.\n# It should be `( (MOD - 3) * 4 % MOD + 2 ) % MOD`.\n# `(998244350 * 4)` is `3992977400`.\n# `3992977400 % MOD` is `998244347`.\n# So `(998244347 + 2) % MOD` is `998244349`.\n# The issue is with `term1_coeff = (MOD - (n - 1)) % MOD`.\n# This calculates `(- (n-1)) % MOD`.\n# So the code is actually calculating `(- (n-1) % MOD * power(n, n-3) % MOD + (n-2) % MOD * power(n, n-4) % MOD) % MOD`.\n# This is `(-3 % MOD * 4 % MOD + 2 % MOD * 1 % MOD) % MOD`.\n# `(-3 % MOD)` is `998244350`.\n# `(998244350 * 4) % MOD` is `998244347`.\n# `(2 * 1) % MOD` is `2`.\n# `(998244347 + 2) % MOD` is `998244349`.\n# This means the formula `-(n-1) * n^(n-3) + (n-2) * n^(n-4)` is not actually giving -10.\n# It's giving -4.\n# The example output -10 is correct.

The sum is -10.\n# So my formula `-(n-1) * n^(n-3) + (n-2) * n^(n-4)` must be correct for n=4.\n# And it evaluates to -10.\n# The problem is that my manual modulo arithmetic evaluation of the formula to 998244349 was wrong.\n# `-(n-1) * power(n, n-3)` should be `(MOD - (n-1) * power(n, n-3) % MOD) % MOD` if `(n-1) * power(n, n-3)` is positive.\n# Let `val1 = (n-1) * power(n, n-3) % MOD`.\n# Let `val2 = (n-2) * power(n, n-4) % MOD`.\n# The expression is `-val1 + val2`.\n# This should be `(MOD - val1 + val2) % MOD`.\n# For n=4:\n# val1 = (3 * 4) % MOD = 12.\n# val2 = (2 * 1) % MOD = 2.\n# ans = (MOD - 12 + 2) % MOD = (MOD - 10) % MOD = 998244343.\n# This matches the example output!\n\n# So the final formula is:\n# If n is odd, answer is 0.\n# If n=2, answer is -1.
