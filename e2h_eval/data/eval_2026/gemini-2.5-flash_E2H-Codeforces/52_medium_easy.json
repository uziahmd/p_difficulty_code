Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"New Year Candles\" problem. I've got a solid grasp on what's needed.**  I'm dealing with candles here, starting with a certain number of new ones (`a`) and a crafting ratio (`b`). The goal is to figure out the total hours the room can be lit.  Since a candle only burns for one hour, the strategy is obvious: burn every candle as soon as possible.  That's how we'll get the maximum lit time.\n\n**The Strategy:  It's all about maximizing.**  I'm treating this as a simulation. I'll track the `total_hours`, the `current_new_candles`, and the `burnt_out_candles`.  We start with the initial values, then enter a loop that runs as long as there are candles to burn.\n\n**The Simulation Loop: Burn, Collect, Craft, Repeat.**  Inside the loop, it's pretty straightforward.  First, burn all the `current_new_candles`, adding their hours to the `total_hours` and moving them to the `burnt_out_candles` pile. Then, if there are enough burnt-out candles (`burnt_out_candles`), I'll calculate how many new candles can be crafted (`new_candles_from_crafting`).  Update the remaining `burnt_out_candles`, and add the new candles to the `current_new_candles` pool.  Repeat this process until there are no more new candles to burn or craft.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: Making sure it's correct.** I went through the example scenarios provided, like `a=4, b=2` and `a=6, b=3`, step by step to verify that the logic is sound. It makes perfect sense that in the end we'll get 7 and 8 hours respectively.\n\n**Code and Constraints:  Keeping it Clean.** I'm aiming for a Python solution.  The constraints on `a` and `b` (both up to 1000) seem reasonable – meaning the simulation won't take too long.  The code itself is simple: read the inputs, simulate the burning and crafting, and print the `total_hours`. It has one single input line with two integer arguments.\n\n**Edge Cases:  Testing for all possibilities.** I did some quick checks for edge cases, like `a=1, b=2` and `a=1000, b=1000`, to be absolutely sure the code handles these situations correctly. The test revealed the correct total time in each case.\n\nSo, I am confident I've got a correct and efficient solution for the \"New Year Candles\" problem. Let's get the code running.\n",
