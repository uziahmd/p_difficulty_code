    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Frog Jumping\" problem in front of me. The user wants me to essentially figure out how many distinct positions a frog can land on within a given range, considering the constraints of the problem.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the core mechanics. This frog starts at 0 and can jump either forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units. The tricky part is the restriction: the frog *can never land on a position outside the range [0, x]*. This means every intermediate jump also needs to be within that boundary. I need to calculate `f(x)`, which represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, for each `x` from 0 to `m`, and then sum those values up.\n\nThis feels like a reachability problem, almost like traversing a graph. Integers are the nodes, and the jumps (+a and -b) are the edges. The constraint introduces a layer of complexity; it's not simply about reaching a point, but about the entire path being valid. If I'm at some position 'k' and want to jump, the new position *and all intermediate positions* must stay within the [0, x] interval.\n\nTo make things more concrete, if I'm at 'k' and jump forward, `k + a` must be less than or equal to `x`, and if I jump backward, `k - b` must be greater than or equal to 0. This makes the reachability dependent on the *entire sequence* of jumps and the intermediate positions that they define.\n\nThe problem defines reachability recursively. A number 'p' within [0,x] is reachable if there's a valid path of jumps that begin at 0. So, it comes down to being able to define p as a difference of positive multiples of a and b: `p = c1 * a - c2 * b`. Then, all intermediate steps in the jumps must also remain within `[0, x]`.\n\nAnd I remember something about the greatest common divisor. Since the frog can only jump in steps of `a` or `-b`, any reachable position must be a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`. That's a key observation. This can likely significantly reduce the search space. I'll need to use this information somehow.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0`, given that all intermediate positions must stay within `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `R_x` be the set of points reachable within `[0, x]`.\nA point `p` is in `R_x` if `0 <= p <= x` and `p` can be expressed as `k*a - l*b` for some non-negative integers `k, l`, such that all intermediate positions on the path from `0` to `p` also lie within `[0, x]`.\nThis is equivalent to saying that `p` is reachable if `0 <= p <= x` and `p` is a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`, AND there exists a path from `0` to `p` where all points are in `[0, x]`.\nThe condition \"all intermediate positions must stay within `[0, x]`\" is the crucial part. This means that if the frog is at `k` and wants to jump `k+a`, then `k+a` must be `_le_ x`. If it wants to jump `k-b`, then `k-b` must be `_ge_ 0`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum possible value `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`. If `k` is unreachable from `0` (e.g., `k < 0`), we can set `dp[k] = infinity`.\nThe initial state is `dp[0] = 0`. All other `dp[k]` are initialized to infinity.\nWe can use a Dijkstra-like algorithm to find `dp[k]` for `k` in `[0, a+b-1]`.\nThe states in the priority queue would be `(cost, position)`.\nWhen we extract `(cost_k, k)` from the priority queue:\n1. Try to jump `k+a`: The new position is `k+a`. The cost to reach `k+a` is `max(cost_k, k+a)`. If `max(cost_k, k+a) < dp[k+a]`, update `dp[k+a]` and push to PQ. Note that `k+a` must be `_le_ a+b-1` for this to be relevant for the `dp` array.\n2. Try to jump `k-b`: The new position is `k-b`. The cost to reach `k-b` is `max(cost_k, k)`. If `max(cost_k, k) < dp[k-b]`, update `dp[k-b]` and push to PQ. Note that `k-b` must be `_ge_ 0`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` we need to compute `dp[k]` for is `a+b-1`. Why?\nConsider any `k >= a+b`. If `k` is reachable, it must have been reached by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps.\nIf `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`, then `k+a` is reachable within `[0, max(X, k+a)]` and `k-b` is reachable within `[0, max(X, k)]`.\nThe critical observation is that once we reach a point `k` such that `k >= b`, we can always jump `k-b` as long as `k-b >= 0`.\nSimilarly, if we are at `k` and `k+a <= X`, we can jump `k+a`.\nThe values `dp[k]` for `k >= b` will behave somewhat periodically.\nMore precisely, for `k >= b`, `dp[k]` is at least `k`. If `k` is reachable, then `dp[k] >= k`.\nThe crucial insight for `dp[k]` values is that `dp[k]` will be `k` for all `k` that are multiples of `g = gcd(a, b)` and `k >= a`.\nFor `k` in range `[0, a+b-1]`, we can compute `dp[k]` using Dijkstra. The maximum value for `a+b-1` is `2 * 10^5 - 1`.\nThe number of states is `a+b`. Each state has two outgoing edges. Dijkstra's complexity is `O((a+b) log (a+b))`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Only multiples of `g` can be reached.\n`dp[k]` stores the minimum `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\nIf `dp[k] <= k`, it means `k` is reachable without ever exceeding `k` itself. This is only possible if `k` is reachable by only `+a` jumps (i.e., `k` is a multiple of `a` and `k >= 0`) or by some combination of `+a` and `-b` jumps that never take it above `k`.\nHowever, the problem states \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\". This `x` is the same `x` for `f(x)`. So `dp[k]` is the smallest `X` such that `k` is in `R_X`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `dp` state. `dp[rem]` is the minimum `current_pos` such that `current_pos % g == rem` and `current_pos` is reachable, and `current_pos` is the largest value reached so far on the path to `current_pos`.\nNo, the definition of `dp[k]` as the minimum `X` required to reach `k` is correct.\n`dp[k]` is the smallest `X` such that `k` is a reachable point in `R_X`.\nIf `dp[k] <= x`, then `k` is in `R_x`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `dp` array of size `a+b` with `infinity`.\n2. `dp[0] = 0`.\n3. Use a priority queue `pq`. Push `(0, 0)` into `pq`.\n4. While `pq` is not empty:\n   a. Extract `(cost, u)` with the minimum `cost` from `pq`.\n   b. If `cost > dp[u]`, continue (already found a better path).\n   c. Consider jumping `+a`:\n      Let `v_plus = u + a`.\n      Let `new_cost_plus = max(cost, v_plus)`.\n      If `v_plus < a+b` and `new_cost_plus < dp[v_plus]`:\n         `dp[v_plus] = new_cost_plus`.\n         Push `(new_cost_plus, v_plus)` to `pq`.\n   d. Consider jumping `-b`:\n      Let `v_minus = u - b`.\n      Let `new_cost_minus = max(cost, u)`.\n      If `v_minus >= 0` and `new_cost_minus < dp[v_minus]`:\n         `dp[v_minus] = new_cost_minus`.\n         Push `(new_cost_minus, v_minus)` to `pq`.\n\nAfter computing `dp` values for `0` to `a+b-1`:\nFor `k >= a`, any `k` that is a multiple of `g = gcd(a, b)` can be reached within `[0, k]`. This is because we can always express `k = i*a - j*b` and then if `k` is large enough, we can find a path that stays within `[0, k]`. Specifically, for `k >= a`, `k` is reachable within `[0, k]` if `k` is a multiple of `g`. So `dp[k] = k` for `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`.\nThe `dp` array computed by Dijkstra will correctly capture this for `k < a+b`.\nFor `k >= a+b`, `dp[k]` will be `k` if `k % g == 0`.\nSo, `dp[k] = k` for `k >= max(a, b)` and `k % g == 0`.\nMore accurately, `dp[k] = k` for `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`. This is because if `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`, we can reach `k` by `k/a` jumps of `+a` if `k` is a multiple of `a`. If `k` is not a multiple of `a`, but `k % g == 0`, we can reach `k` by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps. Since `k >= a`, we can always make a `+a` jump, and then adjust with `-b` jumps. The minimum `X` will be `k`.\nThis implies that for `k >= a`, if `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k] = k`.\n\nLet's refine `dp[k]` for `k >= a`.\nIf `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k] = k`. This is because `k` can be reached by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps. Since `k >= a`, we can always ensure the path stays within `[0, k]`. For example, reach `k` by `k/g * (a/g) - (k/g - (a/g)) * (b/g)` jumps. The maximum point reached on such a path is `k`.\nSo, for `k >= a`, if `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k] = k`. Otherwise `dp[k] = infinity`.\n\nNow, we need to calculate `f(x) = count(k <= x and dp[k] <= x)`.\nThe sum is `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i=0}^m sum_{k=0}^i [dp[k] <= i]`.\nChanging the order of summation: `sum_{k=0}^m sum_{i=k}^m [dp[k] <= i]`.\nFor a fixed `k`, `[dp[k] <= i]` is true if `i >= dp[k]`.\nSo the inner sum is `sum_{i=max(k, dp[k])}^m 1 = m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1`.\nThus, the total sum is `sum_{k=0}^m (m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1)`.\n\nWe compute `dp[k]` for `k` from `0` to `a-1` using Dijkstra.\nFor `k >= a`, if `k % g == 0`, `dp[k] = k`. Otherwise `dp[k] = infinity`.\nThe Dijkstra will compute `dp[k]` for `k` up to `a+b-1`.\nThe `dp` values for `k >= a` that are multiples of `g` should be `k`.\nThe Dijkstra computation for `k` up to `a+b-1` will find `dp[k]` values.\nLet `max_k_dijkstra = max(a, b) + a + b` to be safe. A bound like `2*(a+b)` or `a+b` is common for Dijkstra's states when values repeat.\nLet's use `max_k_dijkstra = a+b`.\nThe `dp` array will store `dp[k]` for `k` from `0` to `a+b-1`.\nFor `k` in this range, `dp[k]` is correctly computed.\nFor `k >= a+b`: if `k % g == 0`, `dp[k] = k`. Else `dp[k] = infinity`.\nSo we compute `dp[k]` for `k` up to `a+b-1`.\nThen iterate `k` from `0` to `min(m, a+b-1)`. Add `m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1` to the total sum if `dp[k] <= m`.\nFor `k` from `a+b` to `m`:\n   If `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k] = k`. So we add `m - max(k, k) + 1 = m - k + 1`.\n   If `k % g != 0`, then `dp[k] = infinity`. So we add `0`.\nThis means we sum `m - k + 1` for `k` from `a+b` to `m` where `k % g == 0`.\n\nLet's refine `dp` values for `k >= a`.\n`dp[k]` for `k` in `[0, a-1]` are computed by Dijkstra.\nFor `k` in `[a, m]`:\n  If `k % g != 0`, `dp[k] = infinity`.\n  If `k % g == 0`:\n    If `k < a+b`, `dp[k]` is from Dijkstra.\n    If `k >= a+b`, `dp[k] = k`. (This is because if `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k]=k`.)\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n`TotalSum = 0`\n`limit = min(m, a+b-1)`\nFor `k` from `0` to `limit`:\n  If `dp[k] <= m`:\n    `TotalSum += (m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1)`\n\nNow, for `k` from `limit + 1` to `m`:\n  If `k % g == 0`:\n    `TotalSum += (m - k + 1)`\n\nThe second part `sum_{k=limit+1 to m, k % g == 0} (m - k + 1)` can be computed efficiently.\nLet `start_k = limit + 1`. Find the smallest `k_0 >= start_k` such that `k_0 % g == 0`.\n`k_0 = ((start_k + g - 1) // g) * g`.\nThen we need to sum `(m - k + 1)` for `k = k_0, k_0+g, k_0+2g, ..., k_max`, where `k_max <= m`.\nThis is an arithmetic progression.\nLet `j = (k - k_0) / g`. Then `k = k_0 + jg`.\nThe sum is `sum_{j=0}^{(m-k_0)/g} (m - (k_0 + jg) + 1)`.\nLet `C = m - k_0 + 1`. We sum `C - jg`.\n`sum C - g * sum j`.\nNumber of terms `N = (m - k_0) // g + 1`.\nSum `C` for `N` terms is `N * C`.\nSum `g * j` for `j=0 to N-1` is `g * (N-1) * N / 2`.\nSo, `N * (m - k_0 + 1) - g * (N-1) * N // 2`.\n\nExample 1: m=7, a=5, b=3. g=gcd(5,3)=1.\nDijkstra for `k` up to `a+b-1 = 7`.\n`dp` array (size 8):\n`dp[0]=0`\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\nExtract `(0,0)`:\n  `+a`: `v=5`, `cost=max(0,5)=5`. `dp[5]=5`. `pq.push((5,5))`\n  `-b`: `v=-3`, skip.\n`pq = [(5,5)]`\nExtract `(5,5)`:\n  `+a`: `v=10`, skip (`v >= a+b`).\n  `-b`: `v=2`, `cost=max(5,5)=5`. `dp[2]=5`. `pq.push((5,2))`\n`pq = [(5,2)]`\nExtract `(5,2)`:\n  `+a`: `v=7`, `cost=max(5,7)=7`. `dp[7]=7`. `pq.push((7,7))`\n  `-b`: `v=-1`, skip.\n`pq = [(7,7)]`\nExtract `(7,7)`:\n  `+a`: `v=12`, skip.\n  `-b`: `v=4`, `cost=max(7,7)=7`. `dp[4]=7`. `pq.push((7,4))`\n`pq = [(7,4)]`\nExtract `(7,4)`:\n  `+a`: `v=9`, skip.\n  `-b`: `v=1`, `cost=max(7,7)=7`. `dp[1]=7`. `pq.push((7,1))`\n`pq = [(7,1)]`\nExtract `(7,1)`:\n  `+a`: `v=6`, `cost=max(7,6)=7`. `dp[6]=7`. `pq.push((7,6))`\n  `-b`: `v=-2`, skip.\n`pq = [(7,6)]`\nExtract `(7,6)`:\n  `+a`: `v=11`, skip.\n  `-b`: `v=3`, `cost=max(7,6)=7`. `dp[3]=7`. `pq.push((7,3))`\n`pq = [(7,3)]`\nExtract `(7,3)`:\n  `+a`: `v=8`, skip.\n  `-b`: `v=0`, `cost=max(7,3)=7`. `dp[0]` is already `0`, `7 > 0`, so no update.\n`pq` empty.\n\nFinal `dp` values for `k` in `[0, 7]`:\n`dp[0]=0`\n`dp[1]=7`\n`dp[2]=5`\n`dp[3]=7`\n`dp[4]=7`\n`dp[5]=5`\n`dp[6]=7`\n`dp[7]=7`\n\nSum `m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1` for `k` from `0` to `m=7`.\n`k=0: dp[0]=0. m-max(0,0)+1 = 7-0+1 = 8`\n`k=1: dp[1]=7. m-max(1,7)+1 = 7-7+1 = 1`\n`k=2: dp[2]=5. m-max(2,5)+1 = 7-5+1 = 3`\n`k=3: dp[3]=7. m-max(3,7)+1 = 7-7+1 = 1`\n`k=4: dp[4]=7. m-max(4,7)+1 = 7-7+1 = 1`\n`k=5: dp[5]=5. m-max(5,5)+1 = 7-5+1 = 3`\n`k=6: dp[6]=7. m-max(6,7)+1 = 7-7+1 = 1`\n`k=7: dp[7]=7. m-max(7,7)+1 = 7-7+1 = 1`\n\nTotal sum = `8+1+3+1+1+3+1+1 = 19`.

For example, if `a=5, b=3`, `g=1`.\n`dp[5]=5`. This is `k`.\n`dp[6]=7`. This is not `k`. `dp[6]` is `7` because to reach `6`, we must go `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6`. The max on this path is `7`.\nSo `dp[k]` is not necessarily `k` for `k >= a` if `k % g == 0`.\nThe `dp[k]` values computed by Dijkstra are correct for `k` in `[0, a+b-1]`.\nFor `k >= a+b`: if `k % g == 0`, then `dp[k] = k`.\nThis is because for `k >= a+b`, we are \"far enough\" from `0` and `m` that we can consider `k` to be reachable without exceeding `k` itself.\nThe states in the Dijkstra should be `k % g`.\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum `k` such that `k % g == r` and `k` is reachable.\nThis is a standard shortest path problem on a graph with `g` nodes.\nNodes are `0, 1, ..., g-1`. Edge `r -> (r+a)%g` with weight `a`. Edge `r -> (r-b)%g` with weight `-b`.\nBut this is not what we need for `dp[k]`.\nThe `dp[k]` as minimum `X` for `k` in `[0, a+b-1]` is correct.\nThe `dp[k] = k` for `k >= a+b` and `k % g == 0` is also correct.\n\nLet's verify the `k >= a+b` part.\nAny reachable point `p` is of the form `x*a - y*b`.\nIf `p >= a+b`, then `p` is large enough.\nSuppose `p = q*g`.\nWe want to reach `p` such that all intermediate points are `_ge_ 0` and `_le_ p`.\nThis is possible if `p >= a`. (For example, `0 -> a -> 2a -> ... -> (k/a)*a` if `a` divides `k`).\nIf `k % g == 0` and `k >= a`, then `k` is reachable by jumps that stay within `[0, k]`.\nA path from `0` to `k` can be constructed by `k/g` steps of `g`. Each step of `g` can be achieved by `(a/g)` jumps of `+g` and `(b/g)` jumps of `-g`.\nIt's a known result that if `k` is a multiple of `gcd(a,b)` and `k >= a`, then `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0` and without going above `k`.\nThis implies `dp[k] = k` for `k >= a` and `k % g == 0`.\nSo the range for Dijkstra should be `0` to `a-1`.\nFor `k` from `0` to `min(m, a-1)`:\n  If `dp[k] <= m`:\n    `TotalSum += (m - max(k, dp[k]) + 1)`\nFor `k` from `a` to `m`:\n  If `k % g == 0`:\n    `TotalSum += (m - k + 1)`\nThis is simpler. The Dijkstra range is `0` to `a-1`.\nThe `dp` array size is `a`.\nLet's re-run Dijkstra for `a=5, b=3, m=7`. `g=1`. `a-1 = 4`.\n`dp` array (size 5): `[0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\nExtract `(0,0)`:\n  `+a`: `v=5`, `v >= a`, skip for Dijkstra.\n  `-b`: `v=-3`, skip.\n`pq` empty.\nThis Dijkstra only computes `dp[0]=0`.\n\nThis means `dp[k]` for `k in [1, a-1]` are all infinity.\nThis is wrong. `dp[2]=5` was computed.\nThe Dijkstra should run on states `k` where `k` is the actual position, not `k % g`.\nThe `dp[k]` values are minimum `X` such that `k` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\nThe `a+b` bound is for the states, not the `dp[k]` values.\nThe maximum `k` for which `dp[k]` could be greater than `k` is `a+b-1`.\nFor example, if `a=1, b=100000`, `g=1`.\n`dp[0]=0`.\n`dp[1]=1`.\n...\n`dp[99999]=99999`.\n`dp[100000]=100000`.\n`dp[100001]=100001`.\nThese are all `k`.\nWhat if `a=100000, b=1`? `g=1`.\n`dp[0]=0`.\n`dp[1]`? Need to jump `+a` to `100000`, then `-b` repeatedly.\n`0 -> 100000 -> 99999 -> ... -> 1`.\n`dp[1]` would be `max(0, 100000, 99999, ..., 1) = 100000`.\n`dp[k] = 100000` for `k` in `[1, 99999]`.\n`dp[100000] = 100000`.\nThis is exactly what the Dijkstra computes up to `a+b-1`.\nSo the Dijkstra should run for `k` up to `a+b-1`.\nThe `dp` array size should be `a+b`.\nThe `limit = min(m, a+b-1)` and the two summation parts are correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # dp[k] stores the minimum X such that k is reachable within [0, X]\n    # We only need to compute dp for k up to a+b-1, because for k >= a+b\n    # if k is a multiple of g, then dp[k] = k.\n    # Otherwise, dp[k] = infinity.\n    \n    # Max value of k for Dijkstra is a+b-1.\n    # Max array size is 2*10^5.\n    max_k_dijkstra = a + b \n    \n    # Initialize dp array with infinity\n    dp = [float('inf')] * max_k_dijkstra\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # Priority queue for Dijkstra: (cost, position)\n    pq = [(0, 0)] \n\n    while pq:\n        cost, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        if cost > dp[u]:\n            continue\n\n        # Jump +a\n        v_plus = u + a\n        new_cost_plus = max(cost, v_plus)\n        if v_plus < max_k_dijkstra:\n            if new_cost_plus < dp[v_plus]:\n                dp[v_plus] = new_cost_plus\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost_plus, v_plus))\n        # If v_plus >= max_k_dijkstra, it falls into the \"k >= a+b\" case\n        # where dp[k]=k if k%g==0.
