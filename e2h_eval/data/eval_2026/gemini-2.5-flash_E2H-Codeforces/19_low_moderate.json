The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The goal is to write a Python script that takes some input (`n`, `k`, and edges representing a graph) and outputs `k` district numbers to remove.  Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I see the graph structure is a tree, which simplifies things. Every district has exactly one path to every other district, and the input guarantees a single path between any two. This means we're dealing with a connected, acyclic graph.\n\nThe objective is to remove `k` districts and maximize the *total fans* of the remaining districts. Crucially, the remaining districts *must* form a connected subgraph. The fan count for each district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nNow, the core insight:  To maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining districts, I need to keep the districts with the largest indices.  Because `2^i` grows so fast, keeping a district with a larger index will *always* contribute more than keeping a district with a smaller one, if I'm forced to choose. This means I want to minimize the sum of the `2^i` values of the removed districts, which effectively means removing districts with smaller indices.\n\nSo, the strategy crystallizes: I have to select `n-k` districts that are connected and have the largest possible indices. This translates to minimizing the indices of the *removed* districts, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nI can rephrase this as: find the connected subtree of size `n-k` with the largest possible indices. I'm thinking a greedy approach from the largest indices might work here.  I could start by tentatively keeping district `n`, then `n-1`, and so on, building a connected component. If I need more districts, I add the largest-indexed, adjacent district that isn't already included.  This looks like a subtree optimization problem with the `2^i` values as the \"weight\" and a greedy approach might be viable.\n\nThe constraint on `n` is up to `10^6`, so brute-force approaches are out. I need an efficient algorithm. I'm focusing on the *removed* districts. I need to remove exactly `k`. I'll explore this line of thinking. Perhaps there's an optimal removal strategy related to removing subtrees with low indices? Time to dig deeper and see if this greedy subtree idea can be refined.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected subgraph (a subtree) such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts is maximized. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of `2^i` for the `k` removed districts. Since `2^i` is always positive and grows exponentially, minimizing the sum means we should prioritize removing districts with smaller indices.\n\nThe core idea is to find a connected component of size `n-k` that includes districts with the largest possible indices. We can achieve this by starting with the district `n` (which has the largest index and thus the largest `2^n` fans) and greedily adding adjacent districts with the largest available indices, until we have `n-k` districts. However, this greedy approach doesn't directly guarantee finding the optimal connected component.\n\nA more robust approach is to consider the districts we *must* remove. We want to remove `k` districts, and these should be the `k` districts with the smallest indices, *if possible*. The constraint is that the remaining `n-k` districts must form a connected component.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem: We want to keep `n-k` districts. To maximize the sum of `2^i`, we should try to keep the districts with the largest indices. This means we should try to keep districts `n, n-1, n-2, \\ldots` as much as possible.\n\nConsider the strategy:\n1.  Start with the district `n`. We definitely want to keep district `n` if possible, as it contributes the most fans.\n2.  We need to select `n-k` districts. Let's say we have a target count `count_to_keep = n-k`.\n3.  We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from district `n`. During the traversal, we prioritize visiting nodes with larger indices.\n4.  If we perform a traversal (e.g., BFS) starting from district `n`, and always add the highest-indexed unvisited neighbor to our queue/stack first, we will explore paths that try to include higher-indexed nodes.\n\nA simpler, more direct greedy approach:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. We want to keep the nodes with the largest indices.\nLet's initialize a set of `removed` nodes as empty.\nWe iterate through the nodes from `n` down to `1`. For each node `i`:\nIf `i` is currently connected to our \"kept\" component (initially empty, then grows), we consider keeping it.\nThis is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nThe problem effectively asks us to find a connected component of size `n-k` with the largest possible sum of `2^i`. This is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that contains the largest possible set of high-indexed nodes.\n\nConsider the districts in increasing order of their index: `1, 2, \\ldots, n`.\nWe want to remove `k` districts. To minimize the sum of `2^i` of removed districts, we should remove the smallest `k` districts, *if* the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component.\n\nWhat if we try to remove districts `1, 2, \\ldots, k`? If the remaining `n-k` districts are connected, then this is the optimal solution because we removed the `k` smallest values.\nWhat if they are not connected? Then we must keep some of `1, \\ldots, k` to ensure connectivity. Which ones? We should keep the ones that help connect components, and remove other larger-indexed nodes instead.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved by iterating through possible roots of the desired subtree. However, `n` is too large.\nThe key insight comes from realizing that we want to keep the `n-k` largest-indexed nodes possible.\nLet's try to keep `n-k` nodes. Start with node `n`.\nWe can do a \"reverse\" BFS/DFS. We want to identify `k` nodes to remove.\nWe can think of this as: we have `n-k` \"slots\" for nodes. We want to fill these slots with the largest possible node indices.\nThe node `n` is definitely in our optimal set, unless `n` itself is one of the `k` nodes we must remove to make the remaining `n-k` nodes connected (which is not possible if we want to maximize sum, `n` will always be kept).\n\nLet's identify the `k` nodes to remove.\nWe can use a BFS-like approach starting from all nodes that we *cannot* reach if we were to only keep the `n-k` largest nodes.\nThis is equivalent to finding the `n-k` nodes with largest indices that form a connected component.\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, n-2, \\ldots, 1`.\nWe must keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet's try to keep the `n-k` nodes with the largest indices.\nStart a BFS from node `n`. We will add nodes to a `kept` set.\nThe `removed` set will be initialized with `k` nodes.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nWe can iterate through nodes `1, 2, \\ldots, n`.\nFor each node `i`, we calculate its `depth` from node `n` (or any fixed high-indexed node) in the original tree.\nThe nodes that are \"far\" from `n` are more likely to be removed.\n\nA more concrete approach:\n1.  We definitely want to keep node `n` if possible.\n2.  We perform a BFS starting from node `n`. When exploring neighbors, we always prioritize adding neighbors with larger indices to the queue.\n    This is not a standard BFS. A standard BFS explores layer by layer.\n    A priority queue based BFS (Dijkstra-like) could work, where priority is `-node_index`.\n    However, this is not quite right because we need a connected component of *exactly* `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's maintain a set of `kept` nodes and a set of `removed` nodes.\nWe want `|kept| = n-k` and `|removed| = k`.\nInitialize `kept` with node `n`.\nInitialize `removed` with `n-k` placeholders.\nWe need to remove `k` nodes.\nWe can try to remove nodes `1, 2, \\ldots, k` sequentially.\nFor each node `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  If `i` is not yet marked for removal:\n    Check if `i` can be removed without disconnecting the current `kept` set AND if we still have `k` removals left.\n    This is complex.\n\nA more direct strategy:\nWe want to find `k` nodes to remove. We should remove the ones that are \"least valuable\" AND whose removal doesn't disconnect the remaining graph.\nThe \"least valuable\" nodes are those with small indices.\nSo, we iterate through nodes `i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n`.\nFor each node `i`, we consider removing it. We can only remove it if:\n1.  We still need to remove more nodes (i.e., `removed_count < k`).\n2.  Removing `i` does not disconnect the graph formed by nodes `i+1, \\ldots, n` and any nodes `< i` that we decided to keep. This is very hard to check efficiently.\n\nThe problem can be solved by a specialized BFS/DFS.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. We can think of this as \"coloring\" `n-k` nodes as `kept` and `k` nodes as `removed`.\nWe want to keep nodes with higher indices.\nLet's start a traversal from node `n`. We will add nodes to a `kept` list.\nWhen we visit a node `u`, we add it to `kept`. Then we look at its neighbors `v`.\nWe want to explore neighbors in decreasing order of their index.\nThis is like a greedy DFS.\n\n```python\n# Adjacency list for the tree\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\nfor _ in range(n - 1):\n    u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj[u].append(v)\n    adj[v].append(u)\n\n# We want to keep n-k nodes.\n# We will use a modified BFS/DFS.\n# We prioritize keeping nodes with larger indices.\n# Start from node n.\n# We use a deque for BFS, but we'll add neighbors in a specific order.\n# A standard BFS explores layer by layer.\n# We want to explore by prioritizing larger indices.
