    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences count, and the string only has lowercase Latin letters, with a length up to 100.  My immediate instinct is to brute-force it, given that small input size.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking of approaching it.  First, I'll go through all possible substring lengths, from 1 up to N-1 (where N is the string length). Then, for each length, I need to check all substrings of that length to see if any of them repeat. If I find a repeating substring, that length is a candidate. I'll just keep track of the largest length I've found so far.\n\nSince N is at most 100, checking every possible substring won't be too slow. I'll need to create a Python script to solve this.\n\nI'll start by iterating `L` from `N-1` down to 1 (because I want the longest repeating substring). For each length `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions `i` (from 0 to `N - L`). For each substring `s[i:i+L]`, I need a way to check if it appears somewhere else in the string.\n\nAt first, I thought `str.count()` in Python might work, but it doesn't give me the right result when substrings can overlap. I need to be careful with counting. Instead of `str.count`, I'll use `str.find()`. For a given substring, I'll find its first occurrence, then search for a *second* occurrence starting *after* the first one. If a second occurrence exists, that means the substring repeats, and I've got a valid candidate for the maximum length.\n\nTo make it more clear and efficient, the method is this: For a given substring, I'll use Python's string `find()` function. First, `first_idx = s.find(substring)`. If this finds a starting index, then I will make a second call to find the string again, after the starting position of the first. This approach is what's needed for the problem definition.\n\nHowever, I've also come up with a more elegant solution that might be a bit faster in practice: using a set to store substrings of a given length. For each length L, create a `seen_substrings` set. Iterate through the string, create all substrings of length L. If a substring is already in the set, I know it repeats. Then the answer is that length `L`. This method should be faster because checking if an element exists in a set is an O(1) operation.\n\nUltimately, I'll implement the approach that I feel will run the quickest and also can be understood easily. The `str.find()` method should be sufficient, but the set approach could be faster in some instances.\n",
