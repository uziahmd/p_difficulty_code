There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing the Winner's Games in a Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this knockout tournament problem.  The constraint is the *crucial* part: players can only compete if their game counts differ by at most one.  I want to figure out the absolute maximum number of games the eventual winner can play, given 'n' initial players.\n\nLet's use 'k' to represent the number of games played by a winner.  My initial instinct is that a perfectly balanced tournament with a power-of-2 number of players results in log2(n) games for the winner. But, the problem doesn't *force* perfect balance, which opens up the possibility of a different maximum.  I need to exploit the rule to maximize that 'k'.\n\nSo, if the winner, 'W', plays 'x' games... what does that imply about the opponents? The first game is easy, W faces someone with zero games.  Then, in game two, W has one game, and the opponent can have zero or one.  The rule clearly isn't restrictive in the early rounds.\n\nThis leads me to think about a recursive pattern, something along the lines of a function `f(k)` which describes the number of players needed for a winner to play 'k' games. That's a good approach to investigate.  Let's call that minimum required number of players `P(k)`.\n\nBase cases are obvious:\n*   `P(0) = 1`: The potential winner, before the tournament.\n*   `P(1) = 2`: Winner plays one game, against an opponent.\n\nNow, let's explore `P(2)`. The winner, with one game, must play someone who has 0 or 1. If it's zero, then the total number of players are the winner (1 game), original opponent (0 game), and the new opponent (0 game) - so 3 players. If it's 1 game, then the opponent played against someone else to get to 1 game, so 4 players.\n\nLet's consider `P(k)` further, building up the minimum number of players needed to accommodate this game difference rule. It feels like this minimum will not be a power of two, necessarily. The constraint will lead to an imbalanced bracket, and that's the key.  I need to rigorously analyze how this imbalanced bracket affects how many players are needed per extra game the winner plays.  I suspect there's a relationship between the game count and the number of players that will look something other than the classic `n = 2^k`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `W_k` be a player who has won `k` games.\nWhen `W_k` plays their `(k+1)`-th game, their opponent `O` must have played `k'` games such that `|k - k'| <= 1`. This means `k'` can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`. Since `O` must also have won all their games to reach this point, `k'` must be non-negative.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required for the winner of a tournament to play exactly `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze `f(k)`:\n- To play 0 games: A player exists. `f(0) = 1`. (This player will be the winner of a 0-game tournament, i.e., they are the only player).\n- To play 1 game: The winner `W` (0 games) plays against an opponent `O` (0 games). `W` wins. `W` now has 1 game. Total players: 2. `f(1) = 2`.\n- To play `k` games: Suppose the winner `W` has already played `k-1` games. To play their `k`-th game, `W` needs an opponent `O`. `W` has `k-1` games. The opponent `O` must have played `k'` games such that `| (k-1) - k' | <= 1`. This means `k'` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n  To minimize the total number of players `f(k)`, we should choose the opponent `O` who has played the *maximum possible* number of games, as this opponent would have already eliminated other players. The maximum `k'` allowed is `k`.\n  So, `W` (with `k-1` games) plays against `O` (with `k` games). `W` wins.\n  This means `W` needs `f(k-1)` players to reach `k-1` wins.\n  And `O` needs `f(k)` players to reach `k` wins.\n  This structure is `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k)`. This is incorrect because `O` is not the winner of the sub-tournament, but a player *within* a sub-tournament.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\nTo play `k` games, the winner `W` must defeat an opponent `O` in their `k`-th game.\nBefore this `k`-th game, `W` has played `k-1` games.\nThe opponent `O` must have played `k_O` games, where `| (k-1) - k_O | <= 1`.\nTo maximize `k` for a given `n`, we want to be as efficient as possible with players. This means we want the opponent `O` to have played as many games as possible. The maximum `k_O` can be is `k`.\nSo, `W` (who has played `k-1` games) plays against `O` (who has played `k` games).\nThis implies that `W` is the winner of a sub-tournament requiring `f(k-1)` players, and `O` is the winner of a sub-tournament requiring `f(k)` players.\nBut `O` is not the winner of the overall tournament. This implies that the sub-tournament structure is:\nThe winner `W` plays `k` games.\nThe `k`-th game is `W` (with `k-1` wins) vs `O` (with `k_O` wins).\nTo minimize players for `W` to win `k` games, `W` should play against an opponent `O` who has also played many games.\nThe most efficient way for `W` to reach `k` wins is to play against an opponent `O` who has played `k-1` games.\nIn this case, `W` (with `k-1` wins) plays `O` (with `k-1` wins). `W` wins. `W` now has `k` wins.\nThe number of players needed for `W` to win `k-1` games is `f(k-1)`.\nThe number of players needed for `O` to win `k-1` games is `f(k-1)`.\nSince `W` and `O` come from separate sub-tournaments, the total players required for `W` to win `k` games in this scenario is `f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2 * f(k-1)`.\n\nHowever, the rule `|k_A - k_B| <= 1` allows more flexibility.\nConsider the maximum number of players that can participate in a tournament whose winner plays `k` games. Let's denote this as `N_k`.\n`N_0 = 1` (A single player, no games played).\n`N_1 = 2` (Player A (0 games) vs Player B (0 games). Winner plays 1 game).\nFor the winner to play `k` games:\nThe winner `W` (who has `k-1` games) plays their `k`-th game against an opponent `O`.\n`O` must have played `k_O` games, where `k_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nTo maximize `N_k`, we want to maximize the number of players involved.\nThe opponent `O` could be the winner of a sub-tournament where `O` played `k-1` games. In this case, `N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-1}`.\nThe opponent `O` could be the winner of a sub-tournament where `O` played `k-2` games. In this case, `N_k = N_{k-1} + N_{k-2}`. This is more efficient in terms of total players for `W` to play `k` games.\nLet's consider the Fibonacci sequence.\n`F_0 = 1` (number of players for winner to play 0 games)\n`F_1 = 2` (number of players for winner to play 1 game)\n`F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}` for `k >= 2`.\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` (shifted Fibonacci `F_{i+2}` for `i >= 0` where `F_0=0, F_1=1`) represents the maximum number of players that can be in a tournament where the winner plays `k` games.\nLet `P(k)` be the maximum number of players in a tournament where the winner plays `k` games.\n`P(0) = 1` (The player is the winner, 0 games played)\n`P(1) = 2` (Player A (0 games) vs Player B (0 games). A wins, plays 1 game. `|0-0|<=1` is valid)\n`P(k)`: To play `k` games, the winner `W` (who has `k-1` games) needs to play one more game.\nThe opponent `O` for `W` must have played `j` games where `| (k-1) - j | <= 1`.\nSo `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nTo maximize `P(k)`, we should choose the opponent `O` such that the sub-tournament they came from is as large as possible.\nIf `O` has played `k-1` games, then `W` (from `P(k-1)` players) plays `O` (from `P(k-1)` players). Total players `P(k-1) + P(k-1)`.\nIf `O` has played `k-2` games, then `W` (from `P(k-1)` players) plays `O` (from `P(k-2)` players). Total players `P(k-1) + P(k-2)`.\nThe second option `P(k-1) + P(k-2)` generates a larger number of players for the *same* number of games played by the winner, `k`. This is because `P(k-1)` is always greater than `P(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\nSo, the recurrence relation for the maximum number of players `P(k)` for a winner to play `k` games is:\n`P(0) = 1`\n`P(1) = 2`\n`P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically, `P(k) = F_{k+2}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...`.\n`P(0) = F_2 = 1`\n`P(1) = F_3 = 2`\n`P(2) = F_4 = 3`\n`P(3) = F_5 = 5`\n...\n\nWe are given `n` players and need to find the maximum `k` such that `P(k) <= n`.\nWe can generate Fibonacci numbers `F_i` until `F_i > n`. The corresponding `k` will be `i-2`.\n\nExample:\n`n = 2`:\n`P(0) = 1 <= 2`\n`P(1) = 2 <= 2`\n`P(2) = 3 > 2`\nMax `k = 1`.\n\n`n = 3`:\n`P(0) = 1 <= 3`\n`P(1) = 2 <= 3`\n`P(2) = 3 <= 3`\n`P(3) = 5 > 3`\nMax `k = 2`.\n\n`n = 4`:\n`P(0) = 1 <= 4`\n`P(1) = 2 <= 4`\n`P(2) = 3 <= 4`\n`P(3) = 5 > 4`\nMax `k = 2`.\n\n`n = 10`:\n`P(0) = 1 <= 10`\n`P(1) = 2 <= 10`\n`P(2) = 3 <= 10`\n`P(3) = 5 <= 10`\n`P(4) = 8 <= 10`\n`P(5) = 13 > 10`\nMax `k = 4`.\n\nThe strategy is to generate Fibonacci numbers starting with `a=1, b=2` (representing `P(0)` and `P(1)`) and count how many steps we take.\nLet `a` be `P(k_current)` and `b` be `P(k_current+1)`.\nInitialize `k_max = 0`.\nIf `n=1`, `k_max=0`. (Problem states `n >= 2`, so this case is not strictly needed, but good for completeness).\nIf `n=2`, `k_max=1`.\nOtherwise:\n`a = 1` (P(0))\n`b = 2` (P(1))\n`k = 1` (Current max games for `b` players)\nWhile `b <= n`:\n  `temp = b`\n  `b = a + b`\n  `a = temp`\n  `k = k + 1`\nThe loop stops when `b > n`. At this point, `a` holds the largest `P(k_prev)` that was `<= n`, and `k` holds the corresponding number of games for `a`.\n\nLet's trace with `n=10`:\nInitial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `k=1`. (This means for `P(1)=2` players, winner plays 1 game).\n1. `b=2 <= 10`.\n   `temp = 2`\n   `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n   `a = 2`\n   `k = 1 + 1 = 2`. (For `P(2)=3` players, winner plays 2 games).\n2. `b=3 <= 10`.\n   `temp = 3`\n   `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n   `a = 3`\n   `k = 2 + 1 = 3`. (For `P(3)=5` players, winner plays 3 games).\n3. `b=5 <= 10`.\n   `temp = 5`\n   `b = 3 + 5 = 8`\n   `a = 5`\n   `k = 3 + 1 = 4`. (For `P(4)=8` players, winner plays 4 games).\n4. `b=8 <= 10`.\n   `temp = 8`\n   `b = 5 + 8 = 13`\n   `a = 8`\n   `k = 4 + 1 = 5`. (For `P(5)=13` players, winner plays 5 games).\n5. `b=13 > 10`. Loop terminates.\nThe last `k` value before termination was `4`. So the answer is `4`.\n\nThis approach correctly finds the maximum `k`.\nThe input `n` can be up to `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so we will not need many iterations. `F_90` is approximately `2.8 * 10^18`. So, the loop will run at most around 90 times, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # P(k) is the maximum number of players for the winner to play k games.\n    # P(0) = 1\n    # P(1) = 2\n    # P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2) for k >= 2\n    # This is a shifted Fibonacci sequence.\n    # We want to find the largest k such that P(k) <= n.\n\n    # Initial values:\n    # a represents P(k_current-1)\n    # b represents P(k_current)\n    # games_played represents k_current\n    \n    # Let's start with P(0)=1, P(1)=2\n    a = 1  # P(0)\n    b = 2  # P(1)\n    games_played = 1 # Number of games for b players (P(1))\n\n    # We iterate, calculating P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2)\n    # The loop continues as long as the current number of players (b) is within n.\n    # Each iteration, we calculate the next Fibonacci number and increment games_played.\n    while b <= n:\n        next_b = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = next_b\n        games_played += 1\n    \n    # When the loop terminates, 'b' is the first P(k) that exceeds 'n'.\n    # 'a' is the last P(k') that was less than or equal to 'n'.\n    # 'games_played' would have been incremented one too many times for 'b'.\n    # So, the maximum number of games is 'games_played - 1'.\n    \n    # Example trace: n=10\n    # Initial: a=1, b=2, games_played=1\n    # 1. b=2 <= 10. next_b=1+2=3. a=2, b=3. games_played=2.\n    # 2. b=3 <= 10. next_b=2+3=5. a=3, b=5. games_played=3.\n    # 3. b=5 <= 10. next_b=3+5=8. a=5, b=8. games_played=4.\n    # 4. b=8 <= 10. next_b=5+8=13. a=8, b=13. games_played=5.\n    # 5. b=13 > 10.
