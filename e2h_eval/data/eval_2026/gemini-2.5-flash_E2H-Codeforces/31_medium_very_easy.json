Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution Breakdown: Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of new cards Vanya has to find to get a total sum of zero, given the cards he *already* has.\n\nFirst, I analyze the constraints.  I'm given *n* cards and a maximum absolute value *x* for the numbers on the cards.  The numbers on the cards can be between -*x* and *x*, inclusive.  The inputs are *n*, *x*, and the *n* card values. The output should be the *minimum* number of additional cards needed.\n\nThe core idea is this:\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:** Sum up all the numbers on the cards Vanya already has. Let's call this sum *S*.\n2.  **Figure out the target sum:**  Vanya wants the total sum to be zero. So, the new cards need to add up to -*S*.\n3.  **Minimize the number of cards:** To use the fewest cards, each new card should have the largest possible *absolute value*. If *S* is positive, Vanya needs negative cards (specifically, -*x*). If *S* is negative, he needs positive cards (*x*). If *S* is zero, he needs zero cards (trivial case).\n\nThe algorithm itself is quite straightforward:\n1.  Read *n* and *x*.\n2.  Read the initial card values and compute their sum (*current_sum*).\n3.  If *current_sum* is zero, the answer is 0.\n4.  If *current_sum* isn't zero, calculate `abs_current_sum = abs(current_sum)`.\n5.  The minimum number of cards is `ceil(abs_current_sum / x)`.  To do the `ceil` properly, without importing, I can use integer division trick with `(abs_current_sum + x - 1) // x`.\n\nI tested with examples, like `n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2]`, `n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2]` and the results matched the expected output, confirming the logic.\n\nI also checked for edge cases, like, what happens if the current sum is zero?  What is the smallest or largest current sums that could arise. I believe everything is correctly accounted for.\n\nThe Python code will read the input, calculate the sum, and then use that `(a + b - 1) // b` trick to get the `ceil` without the `math` library. The algorithm guarantees the correct minimum number of cards.\n",
