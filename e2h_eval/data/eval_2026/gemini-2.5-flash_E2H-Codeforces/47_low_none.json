    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Neko Does Maths Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Neko Does Maths\" problem. The core of it is finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. My expert intuition tells me there's probably a neat number theory trick involved.\n\nFirst, I'm setting up `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`. My goal is to minimize `lcm(x, y)`. I know `lcm(x, y)` can be expressed as `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  This is key, since minimizing a fraction can often be achieved by maximizing the denominator (in this case, the greatest common divisor) while keeping the numerator (the product) bounded.\n\nLet's call the greatest common divisor `g`. So, `g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`.  If `g` divides `a+k` and `b+k`, then it *must* also divide their difference, which is `(b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`. I'll call this difference `d`. Without loss of generality, I can assume `a <= b`, simplifying things. If `a` is greater than `b`, swapping them won't change the absolute value of the difference. So, `g` has to be a divisor of `d = |b - a|`. That's a huge hint!\n\nNow, the edge case: If `a = b`, then `d` becomes zero. In this case, `g = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.  The `lcm` becomes `a+k` and to minimize this, I just make `k = 0`. Easy peasy!\n\nFor the main case where `a < b`, let `d = b - a > 0`.  So, for each divisor `g` of `d`, I need to find the `k` that minimizes the `lcm`.  I'm focusing on how `g` dictates the value of `k`.  Since `g` must divide `a+k`, `a+k` has to be a multiple of `g`.  This means `a+k = m*g` for some integer `m`, and solving for `k` gives me `k = m*g - a`. To keep `k` non-negative, I need `m*g >= a`. The smallest suitable `m` can be determined by taking the ceiling of `a/g` and multiplying by `g`.\n\nNow, I'm considering `k`, specifically the smallest non-negative integer `k`, that makes the `lcm` as low as possible. I realize that I have to consider all the divisors of `d`. The smallest non-negative `k` can be computed as `k = (-a % g + g) % g`. With this `k`, `a+k` becomes a multiple of `g`, as does `b+k`.\n\nEssentially, for each divisor `g` of `d`, I compute this minimal `k`, and then I can use that to test different `g` values to find the minimal LCM overall, selecting the smallest `k` that provides that minimal value. I've got a solid plan now!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\nSince `g` divides both `a+k` and `b+k`, it must also divide their difference: `(b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nLet `d = |b - a|`. So `g` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nIf `a = b`, then `d = 0`. In this case, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\n`lcm(a+k, a+k) = (a+k)*(a+k) / (a+k) = a+k`.\nTo minimize `a+k` while `k >= 0`, we choose `k=0`. The minimum LCM is `a`.\n\nIf `a != b`, then `d > 0`. We need to iterate through all divisors `g` of `d`.\nFor each divisor `g` of `d`:\nWe need `gcd(a+k, b+k)` to be `g`. This implies `a+k` must be a multiple of `g`.\nSo, `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, which means `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`.\nThe smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this congruence is `k_g = (-a % g + g) % g`.\nWith this `k_g`, `a+k_g` is a multiple of `g`. Let `X_g = a+k_g`.\nThen `b+k_g = (a+d)+k_g = X_g+d`. Since `d` is a multiple of `g` (by definition of `g` being a divisor of `d`), `X_g+d` is also a multiple of `g`.\nSo, for this `k_g`, `gcd(a+k_g, b+k_g)` is guaranteed to be a multiple of `g`.\nLet `X_g = a+k_g` and `Y_g = b+k_g`.\nThe `lcm(X_g, Y_g) = (X_g * Y_g) / gcd(X_g, Y_g)`.\nSince `g` divides `d`, `X_g` is `a+k_g`, and `Y_g` is `a+k_g+d`.\n`X_g/g = (a+k_g)/g` and `Y_g/g = (a+k_g+d)/g`.\n`gcd(X_g, Y_g) = gcd(X_g, Y_g - X_g) = gcd(X_g, d)`.\nSince `X_g` is a multiple of `g` and `d` is a multiple of `g`, `gcd(X_g, d)` is also a multiple of `g`.\nLet `gcd(X_g, Y_g) = G`. Then `lcm(X_g, Y_g) = (X_g/G) * Y_g`.\n\nWe want to minimize `(a+k)(b+k) / gcd(a+k, b+k)`.\nFor each divisor `g` of `d`:\n1. Calculate `k_g = (-a % g + g) % g`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\n2. Calculate `val_a = a+k_g` and `val_b = b+k_g`.\n3. Calculate `current_lcm = (val_a // math.gcd(val_a, val_b)) * val_b`. (Using `//` to avoid potential float issues and `*` before `//` to prevent overflow if `val_a*val_b` is too large, although `val_a` and `val_b` are up to `2*10^9`, so `val_a*val_b` could be `4*10^18`, which fits in 64-bit integer types, but Python handles large integers automatically. The order `(val_a // gcd) * val_b` is safer).\n4. Keep track of the minimum `current_lcm` found so far and the corresponding smallest `k_g`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `a` and `b`.\n2. If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b` to ensure `a <= b`. This doesn't change `lcm(a+k, b+k)` or `|b-a|`.\n3. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n4. Calculate `d = b - a`.\n5. Initialize `min_lcm = infinity` and `min_k = -1`.\n6. Find all divisors of `d`. A simple way is to iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(d)`. If `i` divides `d`, then both `i` and `d/i` are divisors.\n7. For each divisor `g` (both `i` and `d/i`):\n   a. Calculate `k = (-a % g + g) % g`.\n   b. Calculate `val_a = a + k`.\n   c. Calculate `val_b = b + k`.\n   d. Calculate `current_lcm = (val_a // math.gcd(val_a, val_b)) * val_b`.\n   e. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n      `min_lcm = current_lcm`\n      `min_k = k`\n   f. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n      `min_k = min(min_k, k)` (to ensure we pick the smallest `k`)\n8. Print `min_k`.\n\nExample walk-through for `a=6, b=10`:\n1. `a=6, b=10`. `a < b` is true.\n2. `d = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3. `min_lcm = infinity`, `min_k = -1`.\n4. Divisors of `d=4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n   - For `g = 1`:\n     `k = (-6 % 1 + 1) % 1 = 0`.\n     `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n     `gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n     `current_lcm = (6 // 2) * 10 = 3 * 10 = 30`.\n     `min_lcm = 30`, `min_k = 0`.\n\n   - For `g = 2`:\n     `k = (-6 % 2 + 2) % 2 = 0`.\n     `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n     `gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n     `current_lcm = (6 // 2) * 10 = 3 * 10 = 30`.\n     `current_lcm == min_lcm`, so `min_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n   - For `g = 4`:\n     `k = (-6 % 4 + 4) % 4 = (-2 + 4) % 4 = 2 % 4 = 2`.\n     `val_a = 6+2 = 8`, `val_b = 10+2 = 12`.\n     `gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n     `current_lcm = (8 // 4) * 12 = 2 * 12 = 24`.\n     `current_lcm < min_lcm` (24 < 30).\n     `min_lcm = 24`, `min_k = 2`.\n\n5. All divisors processed. Print `min_k = 2`.\n\nThis approach covers all necessary `k` values because `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `|b-a|`. By checking `k` values derived from each such `g`, we ensure we consider `k` values that can lead to an optimal `lcm`. Specifically, for a fixed `g`, `k = (-a % g + g) % g` is the smallest `k` that makes `a+k` a multiple of `g`. If there were another `k'` such that `gcd(a+k', b+k') = g` and `lcm(a+k', b+k')` is smaller, then `k'` would also have to satisfy `a+k' \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, implying `k'` is of the form `k_g + m*g` for some `m > 0`. This would make `a+k'` and `b+k'` larger, thus `lcm(a+k', b+k')` would be larger than `lcm(a+k_g, b+k_g)` (unless `gcd` increased proportionally more, which is not generally true), so `k_g` is the best choice for a given `g`.\n\nThe maximum value of `d` is `10^9 - 1`. The number of divisors for `d` can be large but is manageable. For `d <= 10^9`, the maximum number of divisors is for `735134400` (which is `2^5 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17`), having 1344 divisors. Iterating `sqrt(d)` is `sqrt(10^9) approx 31622`.
