String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Counting Beautiful Strings: A Journey into NOR Logic and Combinatorics**\n\nMy primary goal here is to determine how many \"beautiful strings\" exist, based on specific criteria. A beautiful string consists solely of '0's and '1's, has a defined number of each digit (n zeros and m ones), and reduces to a single character (g) after repeated modifications. The modification rule is the heart of the problem: it replaces the last two characters with '1' if they were \"00\", and '0' otherwise.\n\nAnalyzing this modification, I quickly realized it's related to a logic operation.  I explored the parity of '1's after each modification but found no immediate simplification.  Instead, I focused on the resulting character 'g'.  Since each modification reduces the string length, the problem essentially boils down to calculating `f(s_1, f(s_2, f(...f(s_{L-1}, s_L)...)))`.  Representing the operation in terms of logical operations, I figured out that this is, in fact, the NOR operation.\n\nBy expressing the modifications as NOR operations, I could analyze how the '1's and '0's interact. If any '1' exists after the first position (if m > 0), the result is always 0. However, if the first character is 0, the result depends on how the leading zeros cancel out.\nIf `m = 0` (string consists of only zeros), I concluded that `g = 1` if the number of zeros `n` is even and `g = 0` if n is odd.\n\nWhen `m > 0`, the key insight is to locate the position `k_0` of the first '1' from the left. The result `g = 1` if `k_0 - 1` (number of leading zeros) is odd, and `g = 0` if  `k_0 - 1` is even. This is the main concept to solve.\n\nTo count the possible strings, I started by exploring a position for each '1', and from there, I need to count the remaining positions and use combinatorics. The calculation has to be made using binomial coefficients.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count \"beautiful strings\" modulo 1000000007. A string `s` is beautiful if it has exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and after a series of modifications, it reduces to a single character `g`.\n\nThe modification operation replaces the two last characters `c_1 c_2` with a single character `f(c_1, c_2)`.\n`f('0', '0') = '1'`\n`f('0', '1') = '0'`\n`f('1', '0') = '0'`\n`f('1', '1') = '0'`\n\nThis operation is equivalent to the logical NOR operation: `f(A, B) = NOR(A, B)`.\nThe string `s_1 s_2 \\dots s_L` (where `L = n+m`) reduces to `g = s_1 \\circ s_2 \\circ \\dots \\circ s_L`, where `A \\circ B = NOR(A, B)`. This is a right-associative reduction: `g = NOR(s_1, NOR(s_2, \\dots NOR(s_{L-1}, s_L)\\dots))`.\n\nLet's analyze the final character `g`:\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (The string consists only of '0's)**\nThe string is `00\\dots0` (`n` times).\nLet `val_k` be the result of `s_k \\circ s_{k+1} \\circ \\dots \\circ s_L`.\n`val_L = s_L = 0`.\n`val_{L-1} = NOR(s_{L-1}, val_L) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\n`val_{L-2} = NOR(s_{L-2}, val_{L-1}) = NOR(0, 1) = 0`.\n`val_{L-3} = NOR(s_{L-3}, val_{L-2}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\nThe result alternates between `0` and `1`.\nIf `n` is odd, `g = val_1 = 0`.\nIf `n` is even, `g = val_1 = 1`.\nSo, if `m=0`, the string is beautiful if and only if `g == (n % 2 == 0)`. There is only 1 such string (\"0...0\"), so the count is 1 if the condition holds, 0 otherwise.\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (The string contains at least one '1')**\nLet `k_0` be the index of the first '1' from the left. This means `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{k_0-1}` are all '0's, and `s_{k_0} = '1'`.\nLet `val_j = NOR(s_j, NOR(s_{j+1}, \\dots NOR(s_{L-1}, s_L)\\dots))`.\nIf `s_j = 1`, then `val_j = NOR(1, \\text{anything}) = 0`.\nSince `s_{k_0} = 1`, we have `val_{k_0} = 0`.\nNow we compute `val_j` for `j < k_0`. For these `j`, `s_j = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-1} = NOR(s_{k_0-1}, val_{k_0}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\n`val_{k_0-2} = NOR(s_{k_0-2}, val_{k_0-1}) = NOR(0, 1) = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-3} = NOR(s_{k_0-3}, val_{k_0-2}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\nThe value `val_j` (for `j < k_0`) is `1` if `k_0-j` is odd, and `0` if `k_0-j` is even.\nThe final character `g` is `val_1`.\nTherefore, `g = 1` if `k_0-1` is odd (an odd number of leading zeros), and `g = 0` if `k_0-1` is even (an even number of leading zeros).\nSo, if `m > 0`, the string is beautiful if and only if `g == ((k_0-1) % 2 == 1)`.\n\n**Counting Beautiful Strings:**\n\nLet `N_0 = k_0-1` be the number of leading zeros.\n`N_0` can range from `0` to `n`.\nIf `N_0 = n`, it means all `n` zeros are at the beginning. Then `s_1 \\dots s_n` are '0's, and `s_{n+1}` must be '1' (since `m>0`). This uniquely determines the first `n+1` characters. The remaining `m-1` characters must be '1's. The string is `0\\dots01\\dots1` (n zeros, m ones). There is 1 such string.\nThe condition for this string to be beautiful is `g == (n % 2 == 1)` (if `m>0`).\n\nFor `N_0 < n`:\nWe fix `N_0` leading zeros (`s_1 \\dots s_{N_0}` are '0's).\nWe fix `s_{N_0+1}` to be '1'.\nWe have `n - N_0` zeros and `m - 1` ones remaining to be placed in the remaining `(n+m) - (N_0+1)` positions.\nThe number of ways to do this is `C( (n+m) - (N_0+1), n - N_0 )`.\nThis simplifies to `C(n+m-N_0-1, n-N_0)`.\nWe need to sum these counts for `N_0` values that satisfy the condition `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Modulo is `1000000007`.\n- We need combinations `C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials.\n- Maximum `N` is `10^5 + 10^5 = 2 \\cdot 10^5`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n, m, g`.\n2. Handle `m=0` case:\n   If `g == (n % 2 == 0)` (i.e., `g=1` if `n` even, `g=0` if `n` odd), print `1`.\n   Else, print `0`.\n   Return.\n3. Handle `m > 0` case:\n   Initialize `ans = 0`.\n   Loop `N_0` from `0` to `n`:\n     `N_0` is the number of leading zeros.\n     The condition for a beautiful string is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\n     If this condition is met:\n       If `N_0 == n`: (string is `0...01...1`)\n         Add `1` to `ans`.\n       Else (`N_0 < n`):\n         Remaining zeros: `n - N_0`.\n         Remaining ones: `m - 1`.\n         Total remaining characters: `(n - N_0) + (m - 1)`.\n         Add `C((n - N_0) + (m - 1), n - N_0)` to `ans`.\n   Print `ans`.\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- `n+m >= 1`.\n- If `n=0`, then `N_0` can only be `0`. The first character is '1'. `k_0=1`, so `N_0=0`. `N_0` is even.\n  Condition `g == (0 % 2 == 1)` means `g == False`, so `g=0`.\n  If `n=0, m>0, g=0`: `N_0=0` (even) satisfies `g=0`. `C(m-1, 0)` ways (which is 1). String `1...1`.\n  If `n=0, m>0, g=1`: `N_0=0` (even) does not satisfy `g=1`. `0` ways.\n  This is correctly handled by `N_0=0` in the loop.\n- `n=0, m=1, g=0`: `N_0=0`. `0 % 2 == 0`. `g=0` means `(N_0 % 2 == 1)` is false. So it fails.\n  Let's recheck the logic for `m>0`.\n  `g == ((k_0-1) % 2 == 1)`. This means `g=1` iff `N_0` is odd.\n  If `g=1`, we sum `C(...)` for odd `N_0`.\n  If `g=0`, we sum `C(...)` for even `N_0`.\n\nCorrected `m > 0` logic:\nInitialize `ans = 0`.\nLoop `N_0` from `0` to `n`:\n  If `N_0 == n`: (all zeros are leading zeros)\n    If `g == (n % 2 == 1)`: (since `m>0`, `n` leading zeros, `s_{n+1}` is `1`, so `k_0 = n+1`. `N_0 = n`. Condition is `g == (n % 2 == 1)`)\n      Add `1` to `ans`.\n  Else (`N_0 < n`):\n    If `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`:\n      Add `C(n+m-N_0-1, n-N_0)` to `ans`.\nPrint `ans`.\n\nWait, the `N_0=n` case for `m>0` is still slightly off.\nIf `N_0 = n`, then `s_1 \\dots s_n` are '0's. `s_{n+1}` must be '1'. So `k_0 = n+1`. The number of leading zeros is `n`.\nThe condition for `m>0` is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\nSo if `N_0=n`, the condition is `g == (n % 2 == 1)`.\nIf this holds, we add 1 to `ans`.\nThis looks correct.\n\nLet's test `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`m > 0` case.\n`ans = 0`.\n`N_0 = 0`: `0 < n`. Condition `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` means `0 == (0 % 2 == 1)` which is `0 == False`. This is true.\n  Add `C(1+1-0-1, 1-0) = C(1, 1) = 1` to `ans`. `ans = 1`.\n`N_0 = 1`: `N_0 == n`. Condition `g == (n % 2 == 1)` means `0 == (1 % 2 == 1)` which is `0 == True`. This is false.\nFinal `ans = 1`.\nBut expected output for `1 1 0` is `2`. My logic gives `1`.\n\nWhat went wrong? The example `n=1, m=1, g=0` strings are \"01\", \"10\".\n\"01\": `k_0=1`. `N_0=0` (even). `g=0`. This string is counted.\n\"10\": `k_0=1`. `N_0=0` (even). `g=0`. This string is *also* counted.\nMy current logic only counts strings where the first '1' is at position `N_0+1`.\nIt effectively counts strings of the form `0...01...`.\nBut `10` starts with `1`. For `10`, `k_0=1`, so `N_0=0`.\nThe `C(n+m-N_0-1, n-N_0)` formula assumes `s_{N_0+1}` is '1'.\nWhen `N_0=0`, this means `s_1` is '1'.\nSo, if `N_0=0`, the condition `g == (0 % 2 == 1)` is `g == False`, meaning `g=0`.\nIf `g=0`, we add `C(n+m-1, n)` to `ans`. This counts strings starting with '1'.\nFor `n=1, m=1, g=0`: `N_0=0` is even. `g=0`. Condition `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` is `0 == False`, which is true.\n`C(1+1-0-1, 1-0) = C(1,1) = 1`. This counts `10`.\n\nThis means my logic for `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` is wrong.\nLet's re-evaluate `g` for `m>0`.\n`g = 1` if `N_0` is odd. `g = 0` if `N_0` is even.\nThis is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\nFor `n=1, m=1, g=0`:\n`N_0=0`: `N_0` is even. `g=0`. Condition `0 == (0 % 2 == 1)` is `0 == False`, which is `True`. So count strings with `N_0=0`.\n  `C(1+1-0-1, 1-0) = C(1,1) = 1`. This corresponds to string \"10\".\n`N_0=1`: `N_0` is odd. `g=0`. Condition `0 == (1 % 2 == 1)` is `0 == True`, which is `False`. So don't count strings with `N_0=1`.\nTotal `ans = 1`. Still `1`.\n\nThe string `01` for `n=1, m=1, g=0` has `k_0=1`, so `N_0=0`.\n`s_1=0`. `k_0` is the index of the first '1'.\nIf `s_1=0`, then `k_0 > 1`.\nIf `s_1=1`, then `k_0=1`.\nMy loop over `N_0` is correct. `N_0` is `k_0-1`.\nSo `N_0=0` corresponds to `k_0=1` (string starts with '1').\n`N_0=1` corresponds to `k_0=2` (string starts with `01`).\n`N_0=n` corresponds to `k_0=n+1` (string starts with `0...01`).\n\nLet's re-trace `g` for `01`: `n=1, m=1`.\n`s_1=0, s_2=1`.\n`val_2 = s_2 = 1`.\n`val_1 = NOR(s_1, val_2) = NOR(0, 1) = 0`. So `g=0`.\nHere `k_0=2`. `N_0 = k_0-1 = 1`. `N_0` is odd.\nAccording to my rule `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`, this means `0 == (1 % 2 == 1)` which is `0 == True`, which is `False`.\nSo \"01\" is beautiful, but my rule says it's not. This is where the error is.\n\nThe derivation for `m>0` was:\n`val_{k_0} = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-1} = NOR(s_{k_0-1}, 0) = NOT s_{k_0-1}`.\nSince `s_j=0` for `j < k_0`, `val_{k_0-1} = NOT 0 = 1`.\n`val_{k_0-2} = NOR(s_{k_0-2}, val_{k_0-1}) = NOR(0, 1) = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-3} = NOR(s_{k_0-3}, val_{k_0-2}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\nSo `val_j` is `1` if `k_0-j` is odd, `0` if `k_0-j` is even.\n`g = val_1`. This means `g=1` if `k_0-1` is odd, `g=0` if `k_0-1` is even.\nThis is `g == ((k_0-1) % 2 == 1)`. This is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\nThis derivation seems robust.\n\nLet's re-verify `01` with `n=1, m=1`.\n`s_1=0, s_2=1`.\n`val_2 = 1`.\n`val_1 = NOR(0, 1) = 0`. So `g=0`.\n`k_0` is the index of the first '1'. Here `s_2=1`, so `k_0=2`.\n`N_0 = k_0-1 = 1`.\nMy rule says `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` implies `0 == (1 % 2 == 1)` implies `0 == True`, which is `False`.\nSo the rule predicts `01` is *not* beautiful for `g=0`. But it is.\n\nThe error is in the interpretation of `g`.\nThe problem states: \"The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\nThis is `f(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\nThen `f(s_{L-2}, f(s_{L-1}, s_L))`.\nThis is `s_1 \\circ s_2 \\circ \\dots \\circ s_L` where `A \\circ B = f(A,B)`.\n`A \\circ B = NOR(A,B)`.\nThis means the reduction is `NOR(s_1, NOR(s_2, \\dots NOR(s_{L-1}, s_L)\\dots))`.\nThis is indeed right-associative.\n\nLet's re-check the definition of `NOR(A,B)`: it's `1` if `A=0` and `B=0`, else `0`.\n`01`: `NOR(0,1) = 0`. `g=0`.\n`10`: `NOR(1,0) = 0`. `g=0`.\n`0011`: `NOR(0, NOR(0, NOR(1,1))) = NOR(0, NOR(0,0)) = NOR(0,1) = 0`. `g=0`.\n`1001`: `NOR(1, NOR(0, NOR(0,1))) = NOR(1, NOR(0,0)) = NOR(1,1) = 0`. `g=0`.\n`1010`: `NOR(1, NOR(0, NOR(1,0))) = NOR(1, NOR(0,0)) = NOR(1,1) = 0`. `g=0`.\n`1100`: `NOR(1, NOR(1, NOR(0,0))) = NOR(1, NOR(1,1)) = NOR(1,0) = 0`. `g=0`.\nAll example strings reduce to `g=0`.\n\nThis means `g` is *always* `0` if `m > 0`.\nLet's test this hypothesis.\nIf `m > 0`, there is at least one '1'. Let `s_j` be any '1'.\nIf `s_1 = 1`, then `g = NOR(1, \\text{anything}) = 0`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`:\n  `g = NOR(0, val_2) = NOT val_2`.\n  If `s_2 = 1`, then `val_2 = NOR(1, \\text{anything}) = 0`. So `g = NOT 0 = 1`.\n  This disproves my hypothesis that `g` is always `0`.\n  Example `01` has `s_1=0, s_2=1`. `g=0`. Here `s_2=1`, `val_2=1`. `g = NOR(0,1) = 0`.\n  Example `0011`: `s_1=0, s_2=0, s_3=1, s_4=1`.\n  `val_4=1`.\n  `val_3=NOR(s_3, val_4) = NOR(1,1) = 0`.\n  `val_2=NOR(s_2, val_3) = NOR(0,0) = 1`.\n  `val_1=NOR(s_1, val_2) = NOR(0,1) = 0`. So `g=0`.\n  Here `k_0=3`. `N_0=2` (even). `g=0`. This is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 0)`.\n\nMy initial derivation for `m>0`: `g=1` if `N_0` is odd, `g=0` if `N_0` is even.\nThis is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)`.\nLet's re-check `0011`. `N_0=2` (even). `g=0`. `0 == (2 % 2 == 1)` is `0 == False`, which is `True`.\nThis matches. So `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` means `g=1` if `N_0` is odd, `g=0` if `N_0` is even.\n\nLet's re-check `01`: `N_0=1` (odd). `g=0`. My rule `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` means `0 == (1 % 2 == 1)` is `0 == True`, which is `False`.\nThis string `01` is beautiful for `g=0`, but my rule says it's not.\nThis means the condition `g == (N_0 % 2 == 1)` for `m>0` is incorrect.\n\nThe problem is that `val_{k_0}` is not always `0`.\n`val_{k_0} = NOR(s_{k_0}, val_{k_0+1})`.\n`s_{k_0}=1`. So `val_{k_0} = NOR(1, val_{k_0+1}) = 0`. This is correct. `val_{k_0}` is always `0`.\n\nThe chain of logic:\n`val_{k_0} = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-1} = NOR(s_{k_0-1}, val_{k_0}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\n`val_{k_0-2} = NOR(s_{k_0-2}, val_{k_0-1}) = NOR(0, 1) = 0`.\n`val_{k_0-3} = NOR(s_{k_0-3}, val_{k_0-2}) = NOR(0, 0) = 1`.\nThe pattern for `val_j` (where `j < k_0`) is:\n`val_j = 1` if `k_0-j` is odd.\n`val_j = 0` if `k_0-j` is even.\nThe final result `g = val_1`.\nSo `g=1` if `k_0-1` is odd.\n`g=0` if `k_0-1` is even.\nThis means `g == ((k_0-1) % 2 == 0)`.\nThis is `g == (N_0 % 2 == 0)`.\n\nLet's re-verify with this new rule for `m > 0`: `g == (N_0 % 2 == 0)`.\nExample 1: `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n  \"01\": `k_0=2`, `N_0=1` (odd). Rule `0 == (1 % 2 == 0)` is `0 == False`, which is `True`. So \"01\" is beautiful.\n  \"10\": `k_0=1`, `N_0=0` (even). Rule `0 == (0 % 2 == 0)` is `0 == True`, which is `True`. So \"10\" is beautiful.\n  Total 2 strings. Matches example.\n\nExample 2: `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n  `g=0`. We need `N_0` to be even.\n  `N_0=0`: (string starts with '1'). `C(2+2-0-1, 2-0) = C(3,2) = 3`. These strings are \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n  `N_0=2`: (string starts with `001`). `C(2+2-2-1, 2-2) = C(1,0) = 1`. This string is \"0011\".\n  Total `3+1 = 4` strings. Matches example.\n\nExample 3: `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n  `g=1`. We need `N_0` to be even.\n  `N_0=0`: (string starts with '1'). `C(1+1-0-1, 1-0) = C(1,1) = 1`. This would be \"10\". But `g=1` needed, `N_0=0` is even. This string results in `g=0` by rule. So it is not counted.\n  `N_0=1`: (string starts with `01`). `N_0` is odd. Not counted.\n  Total 0 strings.
