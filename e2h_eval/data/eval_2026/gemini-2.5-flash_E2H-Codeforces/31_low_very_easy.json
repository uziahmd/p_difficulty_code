            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Card Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. Vanya has a bunch of cards, and he needs to get the total sum to zero by adding more cards. The catch is the cards have a value limit, and I need to find the *minimum* number of new cards to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking, \"Let's keep it simple.\" I start by calculating the current sum of the cards Vanya already has. That's my starting point, let's call it `S`. Now, I want to get to zero, so I need to add enough cards so that the new cards' sum is exactly `-S`.  Easy enough, right?\n\nThe crucial part is the constraint: each new card has a value between `-x` and `x`. To minimize the card count, I should aim to use values as far from zero as possible. So if `S` is positive, I should add negative cards.  If `S` is negative, I'd want to add positive cards.  Let's focus on the case of needing negative cards since it's the more natural example (positive is symetrical).\n\nIf my starting sum `S` is 0, then no extra cards are needed.  The answer is 0. Done!\n\nIf my sum `S` is not zero, I know I need to add cards to get to zero. The goal is to figure out the *fewest* cards I can add.\n\nThe most extreme negative value I can add is `-x`. So, my strategy is to keep adding cards with a value of `-x` until my sum is 0 (or goes past it, and I correct by just making sure all values are valid). So, how many `-x` cards do I need?\n\nWell, if `S` is perfectly divisible by `x`, then it's just `S / x`.  But what if `S` isn't a multiple of `x`? Then, I still add `-x` cards as many times as I can (integer division, the *floor* of `S / x` tells you that count). But that won't get you to exactly zero. You'll have some \"remainder\" that must be cancelled out. The remaining sum will be a value between `1-x` and `x`.  To achieve this, I will add *one* additional card to cancel the remaining value.\n\nSo, in essence, I need the ceiling of `S / x`.  Mathematically, this translates to using the `ceil` function. Or, thinking in integer division land, I can compute the result as `(S + x - 1) // x`. This formula covers all scenarios in one tidy expression.  That's my final answer!\n",
