They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Playoff\" problem and how to determine the winning integers.**\n\nI've got a competitive programming problem on my hands, and I need to figure out which skill levels, represented by integers, can actually win this tournament.  Here's the setup: we have a single-elimination tournament with $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level. The tournament structure is fixed, with initial matches, winners moving on, and so forth, until a single champion emerges.  The string *s* of length *n* holds the secret: each character in *s* ('0' or '1') dictates the outcome of each phase of the tournament â€“ '0' means the lower skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher skilled team wins.\n\nMy goal is to find all the \"winning integers,\" that is, all the skill levels that can *possibly* lead to a win, given the right permutation of skills.  The key is realizing that to win, a team must be *both* stronger than some opponents and weaker than others. If a team has to win in a phase where a lower skilled team wins (s_i = 0), this implies its skill value has to be smaller than the opponent's skill value. Conversely, in a phase when a higher skill wins (s_i = 1), its skill value must be greater than the opponent's.\n\nSo, for a skill to be a winner, there must exist a permutation of skills such that this skill *consistently* wins its matches, respecting the '0' and '1' rules defined by *s*. In the initial tournament layout, we have the $2^n$ skills. Now, my plan is to determine the range of possible winning skills *within* this pool of values, using the total count of the '0' and '1' characters in the string *s*.\n\nI've deduced that if a skill can potentially win the tournament, it will need to be bigger than *c_1* opponents (wins on s_i = 1) and less than *c_0* opponents (wins on s_i = 0). Thus, if a team has $x$ skill and it wins, the following two conditions should be met:\n\n1.  $x$ must be greater than *c_1* other skills.\n2.  $x$ must be less than *c_0* other skills.\n\nThis implies $c_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nNow, the winning integers will be all integer values that satisfy the condition. The overall strategy is, given the string *s*, determine *c_0* and *c_1*, then produce the range.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill values $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) such that a team with skill $x$ can win the tournament, given that we can choose any permutation $p$ of $1, \\dots, 2^n$. The tournament rules are determined by a string $s$ of length $n$: $s_i = '0'$ means the lower-skilled team wins in phase $i$, and $s_i = '1'$ means the higher-skilled team wins in phase $i$.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of a winning skill $x$. A team with skill $x$ must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$, and $c_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThis means the winning team with skill $x$ must:\n1. Win $c_0$ games by having a lower skill than its opponent.\n2. Win $c_1$ games by having a higher skill than its opponent.\n\nConsider the $n$ distinct opponents that the winning team $x$ faces throughout the tournament. Let their skills be $O_1, O_2, \\dots, O_n$.\nFor $x$ to win, for each of the $c_0$ games where $s_i = '0'$, $x$ must be strictly less than its opponent $O_j$.\nFor each of the $c_1$ games where $s_i = '1'$, $x$ must be strictly greater than its opponent $O_k$.\n\nThis implies that there must be at least $c_0$ skills available that are strictly greater than $x$, and at least $c_1$ skills available that are strictly less than $x$.\nThe skills strictly less than $x$ are $1, 2, \\dots, x-1$. There are $x-1$ such skills. So, $x-1 \\ge c_1 \\implies x \\ge c_1+1$.\nThe skills strictly greater than $x$ are $x+1, x+2, \\dots, 2^n$. There are $2^n-x$ such skills. So, $2^n-x \\ge c_0 \\implies x \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nCombining these, the range of possible winning skills $x$ is $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\nLet's check if this simple range is sufficient.\n\nConsider the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_2='0'$), $c_1 = 2$ (for $s_1='1', s_3='1'$).\nThe number of teams is $2^3 = 8$.\nAccording to the formula, $x$ must be in the range $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0] = [2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$. The value $3$ is missing from the output. This suggests the simple formula is incorrect.\n\nThe problem with the simple formula is that the opponents are not arbitrary skills. They are themselves winners of sub-tournaments.\nFor example, if $s_i = '0'$, the winner is the lower skill. This means the winner's \"rank\" among the skills in its sub-bracket must be lower.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner is the higher skill. This means the winner's \"rank\" among the skills in its sub-bracket must be higher.\n\nLet's re-examine the number of '0's and '1's.\nThe string $s$ specifies the rule for phases $1, 2, \\dots, n$.\n$s_1$ applies to the first round of games.\n$s_2$ applies to the second round of games.\n...\n$s_n$ applies to the final game.\n\nA team that wins the tournament plays $n$ games.\nLet's define $L_0$ as the number of phases $i$ where $s_i = '0'$ and $R_0$ as the number of phases $i$ where $s_i = '1'$.\nSo $L_0 = c_0$ and $R_0 = c_1$.\n\nA winning team with skill $x$ must be strictly smaller than its opponent in $L_0$ games and strictly larger than its opponent in $R_0$ games.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $R_0$ distinct skills and smaller than $L_0$ distinct skills.\nThe values $1, \\dots, R_0$ must be available to be smaller than $x$.\nThe values $2^n-L_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ must be available to be larger than $x$.\n\nThis implies that $x$ must be at least $R_0+1$.\nAnd $x$ must be at most $2^n-L_0$.\nSo the range of winning skills is $[R_0+1, 2^n-L_0]$.\nThis is the same as $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\n\nThe key insight is that the \"ranks\" of the skills matter.\nLet's count the number of '0's in $s$. This is $c_0$.\nLet's count the number of '1's in $s$. This is $c_1$.\nA team that wins must win $c_0$ games by being the lower skill and $c_1$ games by being the higher skill.\n\nConsider the minimum possible skill value $X_{min}$ that can win.\nTo minimize $X$, we want $X$ to win as many games as possible by being the lower skill.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins if $X < \\text{opponent}$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins if $X > \\text{opponent}$.\nFor $X$ to win a game where $s_i = '1'$, its opponent must be $ < X$.\nThere are $c_1$ such games. So $X$ needs $c_1$ distinct skills smaller than itself.\nThe smallest $c_1$ skills are $1, 2, \\dots, c_1$.\nSo, $X$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This is the minimum possible winning skill.\n\nConsider the maximum possible skill value $X_{max}$ that can win.\nTo maximize $X$, we want $X$ to win as many games as possible by being the higher skill.\nFor $X$ to win a game where $s_i = '0'$, its opponent must be $ > X$.\nThere are $c_0$ such games. So $X$ needs $c_0$ distinct skills larger than itself.\nThe largest $c_0$ skills are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1$.\nSo, $X$ must be at most $2^n-c_0$. This is the maximum possible winning skill.\n\nTherefore, the set of all winning integers $x$ is precisely the range $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\nLet's re-evaluate the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$c_0 = 1, c_1 = 2$.\n$2^n = 8$.\nThe range is $[2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe discrepancy implies that the simple logic is indeed flawed. The problem is that the $c_0$ skills greater than $x$ and $c_1$ skills smaller than $x$ cannot be arbitrary. They must themselves be \"winnable\" skills in their respective sub-brackets.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that a winner $x$ \"eliminates\" from consideration for being smaller than $x$ or larger than $x$.\nWhen $x$ plays a game where $s_i = '0'$, $x$ must be smaller than its opponent. This means the opponent's skill $O > x$. This $O$ is one of the $2^n$ skills.\nWhen $x$ plays a game where $s_i = '1'$, $x$ must be larger than its opponent. This means the opponent's skill $O < x$. This $O$ is one of the $2^n$ skills.\n\nThe crucial observation is that the maximum number of teams whose skills can be *smaller* than the winner is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nSimilarly, the maximum number of teams whose skills can be *larger* than the winner is $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThis is because a team winning $k$ games by being the higher skill implies it is higher than $k$ opponents. But those opponents also won games.\nA team that wins $c_1$ games by being the higher skill implies it is higher than $c_1$ opponents. The total number of teams in the sub-brackets that these opponents come from is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThis means that for the winner to be $x$, we need to be able to fill $2^{c_1}-1$ slots with skills smaller than $x$.\nAnd for the winner to be $x$, we need to be able to fill $2^{c_0}-1$ slots with skills larger than $x$.\n\nThe number of teams that must be strictly smaller than the winner $x$ is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that must be strictly larger than the winner $x$ is $2^{c_0}-1$.\n(This is based on the idea that if you win $k$ games by being higher, you are higher than $k$ opponents. Each opponent is a winner of a sub-bracket. The total number of initial teams in the tree that are \"below\" you in skill is $2^k-1$. Similarly for being lower skill.)\n\nSo, for $x$ to be a winning skill:\n1. There must be at least $2^{c_1}-1$ skills available that are less than $x$.\n   This means $x-1 \\ge 2^{c_1}-1 \\implies x \\ge 2^{c_1}$.\n2. There must be at least $2^{c_0}-1$ skills available that are greater than $x$.\n   This means $2^n-x \\ge 2^{c_0}-1 \\implies x \\le 2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)$.\n\nThus, the range of winning skills is $[2^{c_1}, 2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)]$.\n\nLet's check this revised hypothesis with the examples:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n   $c_0=1$ (one '0'), $c_1=2$ (two '1's).\n   $2^{c_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n   $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^3 - (2^1-1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8 - 1 = 7$.\n   The range is $[4, 7]$.\n   This matches the example output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n   $c_0=0$ (zero '0's), $c_1=1$ (one '1').\n   $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^1 - (2^0-1) = 2 - (1-1) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n   The range is $[2, 2]$.\n   This matches the example output: $2$.\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n   $c_0=1$ (one '0'), $c_1=1$ (one '1').\n   $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^2 - (2^1-1) = 4 - (2-1) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n   The range is $[2, 3]$.\n   This matches the example output: $2, 3$.\n\nThis refined hypothesis seems correct for all examples.\n\nThe logic behind $2^{c_1}-1$ and $2^{c_0}-1$:\n- If a team wins $k$ games by being the higher skill, it means it beat $k$ opponents. Each of these opponents is a winner of a sub-bracket. The total number of initial teams in these $k$ sub-brackets (excluding the winner's own initial position) is $2^k-1$. All these $2^k-1$ teams must have skills less than the winner.\n- If a team wins $k$ games by being the lower skill, it means it beat $k$ opponents. Each of these opponents is a winner of a sub-bracket. The total number of initial teams in these $k$ sub-brackets (excluding the winner's own initial position) is $2^k-1$. All these $2^k-1$ teams must have skills greater than the winner.\n\nThe minimal winning skill $X_{min}$ is achieved when $X_{min}$ is set to $2^{c_1}$ and the skills $1, \\dots, 2^{c_1}-1$ are assigned to the $2^{c_1}-1$ teams that must be smaller than $X_{min}$. The remaining $2^n - X_{min}$ skills are assigned to $X_{min}$'s $c_0$ opponents and their sub-brackets. This is always possible.\nThe maximal winning skill $X_{max}$ is achieved when $X_{max}$ is set to $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)$ and the skills $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)+1, \\dots, 2^n$ are assigned to the $2^{c_0}-1$ teams that must be larger than $X_{max}$. The remaining $X_{max}-1$ skills are assigned to $X_{max}$'s $c_1$ opponents and their sub-brackets. This is also always possible.\n\nThe solution is to calculate $c_0$ and $c_1$ from $s$, then compute the lower bound $L = 2^{c_1}$ and upper bound $R = 2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)$. Print all integers from $L$ to $R$ inclusive.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    c0 = s.count('0')\n    c1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # Lower bound for winning skill x:\n    # x must be greater than 2^c1 - 1 other skills (for games where higher skill wins).\n    # So, x must be at least 2^c1.\n    lower_bound = 2**c1\n\n    # Upper bound for winning skill x:\n    # x must be smaller than 2^c0 - 1 other skills (for games where lower skill wins).\n    # The total number of skills is 2^n.\n    # So, there must be at least 2^c0 - 1 skills greater than x.\n    # This means x must be at most 2^n - (2^c0 - 1).\n    upper_bound = (2**n) - (2**c0 - 1)\n\n    # Generate all winning integers in the calculated range.\n    winning_integers = []\n    for x in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):\n        winning_integers.append(str(x))\n\n    print(\" \".join(winning_integers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
