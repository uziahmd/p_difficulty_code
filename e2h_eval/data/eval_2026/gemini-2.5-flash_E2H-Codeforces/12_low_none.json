The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm thinking about how to approach this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem.  It's pretty straightforward, but I need to be careful with the circular nature of the ring road.  So, I have `n` houses, `m` tasks, and an array `a` where `a[i]` is the house for task `i`. Xenia starts at house 1, and everything is clockwise. The goal is to minimize total time to complete all the tasks in order.\n\nI'm imagining a basic loop through the tasks.  I'll need to keep track of the `current_house` where Xenia is and the `total_time` elapsed. For each task, I need to figure out the distance from `current_house` to the `target_house`.\n\nIf the `target_house` is greater than or equal to the `current_house`, it's a simple subtraction: `target_house - current_house`.  Easy.\n\nThe tricky part is when the `target_house` is *less* than the `current_house`. That's where the circular road comes into play. I'm thinking I have to move *past* house `n` and loop back around. I initially thought it would be `(n - current_house) + (target_house - 1) + 1`, but that's overly complex. It's really just the distance from `current_house` to `n` plus the distance from `1` to `target_house`, which simplifies to `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI'm still a bit concerned about the logic, so I'm going to run a quick test with `n=4` and tasks `[3, 2, 3]` to make sure this works correctly.  With the `n - current_house + target_house` formula. I believe this will simplify the code, and ensure it accounts for those cases where `target_house` is less than `current_house`.\n",
