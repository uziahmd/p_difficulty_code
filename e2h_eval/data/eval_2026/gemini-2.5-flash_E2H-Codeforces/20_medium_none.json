    "thought": "**Solving a Competitive Programming Problem: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my main focus is figuring out how many ways I can choose these `c_s` values such that the biggest possible \"beautiful multiset\" ends up with a specific size, `f`.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on what the problem is asking.  We've got these binary strings (`s`) of a certain length, and associated with each is an integer `c_s`. A \"beautiful multiset\" is a group of binary strings where, for any prefix `s`, the number of strings *in the multiset* that start with `s` is no more than `c_s`. I need to count the *number* of ways to choose my `c_s` values such that the biggest possible multiset is size `f`.\n\nThe heart of the challenge is determining this *maximum* multiset size. Given a set of `c_s` values, what's the biggest multiset I can create? This looked like a max-flow or min-cost-max-flow type problem at first, but with `n` being small (up to 15), the straightforward approach with flow algorithms would be too slow.  Then I started thinking about it as a binary tree, where each string `s` of length 1 to `n` is a node. This suggests a dynamic programming solution.\n\nHere's my thought process: I could use dynamic programming on a prefix tree (trie).  Let `dp[s]` be the maximum number of strings of length `n` in the subtree rooted at `s`, subject to the `c_s` constraints. If `s` has length `n`, then `dp[s] = c_s` (I can include at most `c_s` copies of that string).  If `s` has length less than `n`, then `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])` where `s0` and `s1` are the children of `s` (appending `0` and `1` to `s` respectively). The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is then calculated as `dp[\"\"]`. It's essentially a greedy strategy, where I maximize the count at each node, limited by the `c_s` constraint.\n\nSo, here's how to calculate the max size, let's call it `M_val`:  For each string `s` of length `n`, set `val[s] = c_s`.  Iterate backwards from length `n-1` down to 1. For each string `s` of length `L`, set `val[s] = min(c_s, val[s0] + val[s1])`. Then, `M_val` is `val[\"0\"] + val[\"1\"]`.  \n\nNow, the trick is counting *how many* sets of `c_s` values give you this particular `M_val`.  That's still a DP problem!  I started thinking, \"Let `dp[L][current_val]` be the number of ways to pick the `c_s` values for strings of length `L` and their descendants such that `N(s)` is equal to `current_val`\". Where `N(s)` represents the maximum number of strings, that can be made in the subtree of `s`.\n\nIt quickly became clear that `N(s)` is always bounded by `k` (because `c_s` is at most `k`). I defined `dp[L][v]` as the number of ways to choose the `c_s` for strings in the subtree rooted at a generic node `s` of length `L` such that `N(s) = v`. I used the relationship `N(s) = min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))` to build the DP.  The tricky part is efficiently calculating how many ways you can get a particular `N(s)` from the possibilities for `N(s0)` and `N(s1)`.  The values of `v` range from `0` to `k`.\n\nIn this DP formulation, `dp[n][v] = 1` if `0 <= v <= k`, otherwise `0`. Then, when `L<n`, for a string `s` of length `L`, I'm looking for how I can get `N(s)=v`, by choosing `c_s` and `N(s0), N(s1)`. If `v0` and `v1` are the possible values for `N(s0)` and `N(s1)`,",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n` (where `0 \\le c_s \\le k`), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output the result modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined given all `c_s` values. Let `N(s)` be the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nIf `s` is a string of length `n`, then `N(s)` is simply the number of times `s` itself appears in the multiset. The constraint for `s` is `N(s) \\le c_s`. To maximize the total size, we should pick `N(s) = c_s`.\nIf `s` is a string of length `L < n`, then any string in the multiset that has `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`. However, `N(s)` is also limited by `c_s`. So, `N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`.\n\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach on the levels of the binary prefix tree, from strings of length `n` up to strings of length `1`.\nLet `dp[L][v]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` for all strings `t` in the subtree rooted at a generic node `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself) such that the maximum number of strings in `s`'s subtree that can be part of a beautiful multiset is `v`.\nCrucially, `N(s)` cannot exceed `k` because `c_s \\le k`. So `v` will always be in the range `[0, k]`.\n\n**Base Case: `L = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `N(s) = c_s`. Since `c_s` can be any value from `0` to `k`, `N(s)` can also be any value from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `dp[n][v] = 1` for `0 \\le v \\le k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L < n`**\nTo calculate `dp[L][v]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`. Its children are `s0` and `s1`, both of length `L+1`.\n`N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`.\nLet `v_0 = N(s0)` and `v_1 = N(s1)`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `N(s0) = v_0` is `dp[L+1][v_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `N(s1) = v_1` is `dp[L+1][v_1]`.\nLet `S = v_0 + v_1`.\nWe need to count ways to choose `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) such that `\\min(c_s, S) = v`.\n\n1.  **If `v < S`**: For `N(s)` to be `v`, we must have `c_s = v`. This is possible if `v \\le k`. There is `1` way to choose `c_s`.\n2.  **If `v = S`**: For `N(s)` to be `S`, we must have `c_s \\ge S`. This is possible if `S \\le k`. There are `k - S + 1` ways to choose `c_s` (i.e., `S, S+1, \\ldots, k`).\n3.  **If `v > S`**: This case is impossible, as `\\min(c_s, S)` cannot exceed `S`.\n\nLet `P[x] = dp[L+1][x]`. We need to compute `dp[L][v]` for `0 \\le v \\le k`.\n`dp[L][v] = \\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1] \\cdot \\text{ways_c_s}(v, v_0, v_1) \\pmod{998244353}`\n\nLet `P_{conv}[S] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} P[v_0] \\cdot P[v_1]`. This is the convolution of `P` with itself. `S` can range from `0` to `2k`.\n\nNow we can write `dp[L][v]` based on `P_{conv}[S]`:\n`dp[L][v] = \\left( \\sum_{S=v+1}^{2k} P_{conv}[S] \\right) + P_{conv}[v] \\cdot (k - v + 1) \\pmod{MOD}`\nThis formula needs adjustment for `S > k`.\nIf `S > k`: `N(s) = \\min(c_s, S) = c_s` (since `c_s \\le k < S`). So `N(s)` is `v` if `c_s = v`.\nIf `S \\le k`:\n    If `v < S`: `N(s) = v` if `c_s = v`.\n    If `v = S`: `N(s) = S` if `c_s \\ge S`.\n\nLet `dp_next[v]` be the values for `dp[L][v]`.\n1.  Initialize `dp_next[v] = 0` for all `v \\in [0, k]`.\n2.  Calculate `sum_P_conv_gt_k = \\sum_{S=k+1}^{2k} P_{conv}[S] \\pmod{MOD}`.\n    For each `v \\in [0, k]`, `dp_next[v] = (dp_next[v] + sum_P_conv_gt_k) \\pmod{MOD}`.\n    This covers the case where `S > k`, and `c_s` must be `v` for `N(s)=v`.\n3.  For `S` from `0` to `k`:\n    a.  `dp_next[S] = (dp_next[S] + P_{conv}[S] \\cdot (k - S + 1)) \\pmod{MOD}`.\n        This covers the case where `N(s)=S` and `c_s \\ge S`.\n    b.  For `v` from `0` to `S-1`: `dp_next[v] = (dp_next[v] + P_{conv}[S]) \\pmod{MOD}`.\n        This covers the case where `N(s)=v` and `c_s = v` (when `v < S`).\nThe `for v` loop in step 3b can be optimized. Notice that `dp_next[v]` gets `P_{conv}[S]` added for all `S` such that `v < S \\le k`. This is a suffix sum.\nLet `suffix_P_conv[v] = \\sum_{S=v}^{k} P_{conv}[S] \\pmod{MOD}`.\nThen, for `v \\in [0, k]`:\n`dp_next[v] = (sum_P_conv_gt_k + P_{conv}[v] \\cdot (k - v + 1) + suffix_P_conv[v+1]) \\pmod{MOD}`.\n(Where `P_{conv}[v]` is `0` if `v > 2k`, and `suffix_P_conv[k+1]` is `0`).\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Initialize `dp_curr` array of size `k+1`. `dp_curr[v] = 1` for `0 \\le v \\le k`, else `0`.\n2.  For `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n    a.  Compute `P_{conv}`: the convolution of `dp_curr` with itself. This can be done efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) since the modulus `998244353` is a friendly prime. The size of `dp_curr` is `k+1`. The result `P_{conv}` will have length `2k+1`.\n    b.  Compute `sum_P_conv_gt_k = \\sum_{S=k+1}^{2k} P_{conv}[S] \\pmod{MOD}`.\n    c.  Compute `suffix_P_conv` array of size `k+2`. `suffix_P_conv[v] = \\sum_{S=v}^{k} P_{conv}[S] \\pmod{MOD}` for `v` from `k` down to `0`. `suffix_P_conv[k+1] = 0`.\n    d.  Create `dp_next` array of size `k+1`.\n    e.  For `v` from `0` to `k`:\n        `term1 = sum_P_conv_gt_k`\n        `term2 = (P_{conv}[v] * (k - v + 1)) % MOD` (if `v \\le 2k`, else 0)\n        `term3 = suffix_P_conv[v+1]`\n        `dp_next[v] = (term1 + term2 + term3) % MOD`.\n    f.  Set `dp_curr = dp_next`.\n3.  After the loop, `dp_curr` contains `dp[1][v]`.\n4.  The final answer requires `N(0) + N(1) = f`. This is another convolution of `dp_curr` with itself, specifically `final_P_conv[f]`.\n    a.  Compute `final_P_conv`: convolution of `dp_curr` with itself.\n    b.  The answer is `final_P_conv[f]`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5`, `n \\le 15`.\n*   NTT: Requires a polynomial size `M` which is a power of 2, `M \\ge 2k+1`. For `k=2 \\cdot 10^5`, `2k+1 = 4 \\cdot 10^5 + 1`. The smallest power of 2 is `2^{19} = 524288`.\n*   Each NTT operation takes `O(M \\log M)`.\n*   There are `n-1` DP steps. So total NTT time: `(n-1) \\cdot O(M \\log M)`.\n    For `n=15`, `14 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.4 \\cdot 10^8`. This might be acceptable.\n*   The sum and suffix sum calculations take `O(k)` time per DP step. Total `(n-1) \\cdot O(k)`. This is much smaller.\n*   Final convolution: `O(M \\log M)`.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n*   Modulus `MOD = 998244353`.\n*   Primitive root `G = 3`.\n*   Inverse primitive root `INV_G = pow(G, MOD - 2, MOD)`.\n*   `bit_reverse_permutation` for `NTT` and `inverse NTT`.\n*   Padding arrays to `M` size with zeros.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Fast I/O\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nMOD = 998244353\nG = 3  # Primitive root modulo 998244353\nINV_G = pow(G, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half <<= 1\n        w_n = pow(INV_G if inverse else G, (MOD - 1) // len_half, MOD)\n        for i in range(0, n, len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n\n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n    return a\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    n_ntt = 1\n    while n_ntt < result_len:\n        n_ntt <<= 1\n\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_b)\n\n    fa = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    fb = ntt(b_padded, False)\n\n    for i in range(n_ntt):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n\n    res = ntt(fa, True)\n    return res[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # dp_curr[v] = number of ways to pick c_t's in subtree such that N(s) = v\n    # For L=n, dp[n][v] = 1 for 0 <= v <= k\n    dp_curr = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for v in range(k + 1):\n        dp_curr[v] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from L = n-1 down to 1\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # 1.
