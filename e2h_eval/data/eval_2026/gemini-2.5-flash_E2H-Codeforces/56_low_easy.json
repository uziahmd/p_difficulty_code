Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Approach for \"Guard Duty (easy)\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Guard Duty (easy)\". Sounds straightforward enough, but let's break it down. We have rebel spaceships and bases, represented as 2D coordinates. The core is finding a perfect matching – each spaceship to exactly one base and vice-versa – such that no connection lines intersect.  \n\nThe constraints are pretty tight: R and B are at most 10. That's a good sign; I can probably get away with something exponential in R and B. No coordinate collision, and no three points on the same line are critical too.\n\nThe key is that non-intersection condition.  Let's think geometrically. If I have just two pairs, intersections are pretty easy to check. Basically, if the four endpoints form a convex quadrilateral, and the connections are the diagonals, then you have an intersection.\n\nMy initial instinct is to leverage geometric properties, maybe something with convex hulls or point ordering.  If I can sort or order the points somehow, I might be able to find a good solution.\n\nIt's clear that R must equal B for a perfect matching to even exist. Let's assume `R = B = N`. Now, I have `N` rebel points and `N` base points. My goal is to find a set of `N` non-intersecting line segments.\n\nI know there's a connection between matching and the convex hull. If you look at the convex hull of all the points, segments connecting points on the hull could potentially intersect. It would be helpful to relate the matching problem to this convex hull structure.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1.  Check that `R == B`. If not, we're done; it's impossible.\n2.  Then, I'll need to figure out how to iterate through all possible matchings and check each for intersections.  Given the small problem size, this sounds feasible.\n3.  I suspect there's a clever way to avoid checking all matchings, perhaps based on the geometric structure and sorting the points somehow. Maybe an ordering based on the angle to a central point will help reduce the solution space. I'll need to think about how to exploit that \"outermost points\" insight, too.\n4. I want to look into geometric algorithm approaches, and how I can use them to efficiently find non-intersecting segments.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a perfect matching between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two connecting segments intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching is only possible if the number of Rebel spaceships `R` is equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, we can immediately say \"No\". Let's assume `N = R = B`.\n\nThe core of the problem is checking for non-intersecting segments. Given two segments `P1-Q1` and `P2-Q2`, they intersect if and only if:\n1. `P1` and `Q1` are on opposite sides of the line `P2-Q2`.\n2. `P2` and `Q2` are on opposite sides of the line `P1-Q1`.\n\nThis can be efficiently checked using the cross product (or `ccw` function, which determines the orientation of three points). For points `A=(x_A, y_A)`, `B=(x_B, y_B)`, `C=(x_C, y_C)`, the cross product `(B-A) x (C-A)` (which is `(x_B-x_A)(y_C-y_A) - (y_B-y_A)(x_C-x_A)`) tells us:\n* `> 0`: `C` is to the left of directed line `A->B` (counter-clockwise turn).\n* `< 0`: `C` is to the right of directed line `A->B` (clockwise turn).\n* `= 0`: `A`, `B`, `C` are collinear.\n\nSince the problem guarantees no three points are collinear, we don't need to worry about the `= 0` case for `ccw`.\n\nTwo segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect if and only if:\n`ccw(P1, P2, Q1) * ccw(P1, Q1, Q2) < 0` AND `ccw(P2, P1, Q2) * ccw(P2, Q2, Q1) < 0`.\nThis is a standard condition for proper intersection (endpoints are not on the other segment).\n\nThe constraints `R, B <= 10` are very small. This suggests that an exponential time complexity algorithm, such as one involving permutations or backtracking, might be acceptable.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `R` and `B`.\n2. Read the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships into a list `rebels`.\n3. Read the coordinates of `B` bases into a list `bases`.\n4. If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5. If `R == B == 0` (though `1 <= R, B` so this won't happen), it's trivially \"Yes\".\n6. We need to find a permutation `p` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` such that if we match `rebels[i]` with `bases[p[i]]` for all `i`, no two segments intersect.\n7. We can use a recursive backtracking approach to try all possible matchings:\n   - `solve(k, current_matching)`:\n     - `k` is the index of the Rebel spaceship we are currently trying to match (`rebels[k]`).\n     - `current_matching` is a list of pairs `(rebel_index, base_index)` representing the matches made so far.\n     - Base case: If `k == N`, it means all `N` Rebel spaceships have been successfully matched without any intersections. Return `True`.\n     - Recursive step:\n       - Iterate through all available bases `j` (i.e., `bases[j]` has not been used yet).\n       - For each `j`, consider matching `rebels[k]` with `bases[j]`.\n       - Check if this new segment `rebels[k]-bases[j]` intersects any of the segments in `current_matching`.\n       - If it intersects any, this choice is invalid; continue to the next base `j`.\n       - If it does not intersect any, then:\n         - Add `(k, j)` to `current_matching`.\n         - Mark `bases[j]` as used.\n         - Recursively call `solve(k+1, current_matching)`.\n         - If the recursive call returns `True`, then we found a valid matching. Return `True` immediately.\n         - Backtrack: Remove `(k, j)` from `current_matching` and unmark `bases[j]` as used to try other options.\n     - If we tried all bases `j` for `rebels[k]` and none led to a solution, return `False`.\n8. Start the recursion with `solve(0, [])`.\n9. Print \"Yes\" if `solve` returns `True`, otherwise print \"No\".\n\n**Helper Functions:**\n* `ccw(p1, p2, p3)`: Calculates `(x2-x1)(y3-y1) - (y2-y1)(x3-x1)`.\n* `segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)`: Uses `ccw` to check if segments `p1q1` and `p2q2` intersect.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\nR=3, B=3\nRebels: `R0=(0,0), R1=(2,0), R2=(3,1)`\nBases: `B0=(-2,1), B1=(0,3), B2=(2,2)`\n\n`solve(0, [])`\n  Try `R0` with `B0`: `match = [(R0,B0)]`. No intersections (empty `current_matching`).\n    `solve(1, [(R0,B0)])`\n      Try `R1` with `B1`: `match = [(R0,B0), (R1,B1)]`. Check `R1B1` vs `R0B0`. They don't intersect.\n        `solve(2, [(R0,B0), (R1,B1)])`\n          Try `R2` with `B2`: `match = [(R0,B0), (R1,B1), (R2,B2)]`.\n            Check `R2B2` vs `R0B0`: No intersection.\n            Check `R2B2` vs `R1B1`: No intersection.\n          All matched. Return `True`.\n        Return `True`.\n      Return `True`.\n    Return `True`.\nOutput: \"Yes\"\n\nThis approach explores `N!` permutations in the worst case, and for each permutation, it checks `O(N^2)` pairs of segments for intersection. An intersection check takes `O(1)`. Total complexity: `O(N! * N^2)`. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`. `10! * 10^2 = 3.6 * 10^8`, which might be too slow. However, the `N^2` check is inside the recursion, so it's `N` calls to `solve`, each doing `N` loops, each doing `k` intersection checks. So it's more like `N! * N^2`.\n\nLet's refine the complexity:\n`solve(k, ...)`:\n  - Loop `N-k` available bases.\n  - For each base, check `k` segments.\n  - Total checks for a path of length `N`: `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (N-k) * k` which is roughly `N^3`.\n  - The number of paths is `N!`. So, total `N! * N^3`. This is definitely too slow.\n\nWait, the check for `current_matching` is done for the *new* segment against *all existing* segments.\n`solve(k, current_matching)`:\n  - For each `j` (unused base):\n    - `new_segment = (rebels[k], bases[j])`\n    - `is_valid = True`\n    - For `(r_idx, b_idx)` in `current_matching`:\n      - If `segments_intersect(new_segment, (rebels[r_idx], bases[b_idx]))`:\n        - `is_valid = False`; break\n    - If `is_valid`:\n      - Add `(k, j)` to `current_matching`\n      - Mark `bases[j]` used\n      - If `solve(k+1, current_matching)` returns `True`, return `True`\n      - Backtrack\n\nThe number of segments in `current_matching` is `k`. So, for `rebels[k]`, we iterate `N-k` bases. For each base, we do `k` intersection checks.\nTotal operations: `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (N-k) * k * (N-k-1)!` (roughly). This is `O(N! * N^2)`.\nFor `N=10`, this is `3.6 * 10^6 * 100 = 3.6 * 10^8`, which might be acceptable for a 1-2 second time limit in competitive programming if the constant factor is small. Given it's an \"easy\" problem, this brute force approach is likely intended.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to calculate cross product / orientation\n# Returns positive if p3 is left of p1p2, negative if right, zero if collinear.\ndef ccw(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Function to check if two line segments intersect\n# Assumes no three points are collinear (guaranteed by problem)\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = ccw(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = ccw(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = ccw(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = ccw(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations are different for both segments\n    # and no points are collinear.\n    # Since no three points are collinear, o1, o2, o3, o4 will never be 0.\n    return (o1 > 0 and o2 < 0 or o1 < 0 and o2 > 0) and \\\n           (o3 > 0 and o4 < 0 or o3 < 0 and o4 > 0)\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R\n    if N == 0: # This case is not possible due to 1 <= R, B\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n\n    # used_bases[j] is True if bases[j] is already matched\n    used_bases = [False] * N\n    \n    # current_matching stores pairs of (rebel_index, base_index)\n    # The actual coordinates are rebels[rebel_index] and bases[base_index]\n\n    def find_matching(rebel_idx, current_matching):\n        if rebel_idx == N:\n            # All rebels matched successfully\n            return True\n\n        for base_candidate_idx in range(N):\n            if not used_bases[base_candidate_idx]:\n                # Try to match rebels[rebel_idx] with bases[base_candidate_idx]\n                \n                new_rebel_point = rebels[rebel_idx]\n                new_base_point = bases[base_candidate_idx]\n                \n                # Check for intersections with existing matches\n                is_valid_match = True\n                for matched_r_idx, matched_b_idx in current_matching:\n                    existing_rebel_point = rebels[matched_r_idx]\n                    existing_base_point = bases[matched_b_idx]\n                    \n                    if segments_intersect(new_rebel_point, new_base_point, \n                                          existing_rebel_point, existing_base_point):\n                        is_valid_match = False\n                        break\n                \n                if is_valid_match:\n                    used_bases[base_candidate_idx] = True\n                    current_matching.append((rebel_idx, base_candidate_idx))\n                    \n                    if find_matching(rebel_idx + 1, current_matching):\n                        return True # Found a complete valid matching\n                    \n                    # Backtrack: remove this match and unmark the base\n                    current_matching.pop()\n                    used_bases[base_candidate_idx] = False\n        \n        return False # No valid match found for rebels[rebel_idx]\n\n    if find_matching(0, []):\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
