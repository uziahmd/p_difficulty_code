The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and I need to figure out the probability of a specific radio tower configuration being valid. Let's break this down systematically. We've got towns, towers, and signal power to consider, plus some constraints.\n\nFirst off, there are towns numbered from 0 to n+1. We'll be building towers in towns 1 through n, each with a 50% chance. Then we need to assign a power level (an integer between 1 and n) to each of those towers. The reach of a tower is determined by its power: if a tower is at town *i* with power *p<sub>i</sub>*, it will reach all towns within *p<sub>i</sub>* units of *i*.\n\nNow, the crucial part: towns 0 and n+1 *cannot* receive any signal. That means if there's a tower at *i*, its power *p<sub>i</sub>* has to be carefully chosen. It can't be too high or it will reach outside the central section. Specifically, the power has to be less than or equal to the minimum of *i* and *n+1-i*. This makes sense: the tower has to be weak enough that it doesn't leak to those edge towns.\n\nThen there's the core constraint: each of the towns 1 through n must be covered by *exactly one* tower.  This is the tricky part.  A tower at *i* with power *p<sub>i</sub>* covers a range. So we need to ensure that these ranges don't overlap too much or not enough.  This is a combinatorial problem with overlapping intervals. I need to make sure I don't \"double-cover\" any town with more than one tower and that all towns within the range are covered by at least one tower. This suggests I need to think about building a function to check this for a specific tower configuration, and, more importantly, figure out how to iterate through possible configurations. This will probably require thinking about the structure of valid coverings.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given $n$ potential tower locations ($1, \\dots, n$), we can choose signal powers for built towers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means towns $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n**Constraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.**\n*   For town $0$: If a tower at $i$ with power $p$ reaches $0$, then $|0-i| < p \\implies i < p$. To prevent this, for any tower at $i$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $p_i \\le i$.\n*   For town $n+1$: If a tower at $i$ with power $p$ reaches $n+1$, then $|(n+1)-i| < p \\implies n+1-i < p$. To prevent this, for any tower at $i$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nCombining these, for any tower at $i$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThis ensures that the range covered by a tower at $i$ (i.e., $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$) is strictly within $[1, n]$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.**\nThis means the intervals covered by the chosen powers must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose $p_i$. The covered interval is $I_i = [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe conditions become:\n*   $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} I_i = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$\n*   For any $i, j \\in S$ with $i \\ne j$, $I_i \\cap I_j = \\emptyset$.\n\nConsider the center $i$ of an interval $I_i$. The interval is symmetric around $i$. The length of $I_i$ is $2p_i-1$.\nIf we have two towers at $i$ and $j$ ($i < j$), and their intervals $I_i$ and $I_j$ are disjoint, then $i+p_i-1 < j-p_j+1$.\nThis implies $i+p_i \\le j-p_j$.\nThe towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be covered. This means there must be towers $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ in $S$ such that $I_{i_1}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis implies that $I_{i_1} = [1, i_1+p_{i_1}-1]$, $I_{i_k} = [i_k-p_{i_k}+1, n]$, and for $1 < m \\le k$, $I_{i_m}$ starts exactly where $I_{i_{m-1}}$ ends, i.e., $i_m-p_{i_m}+1 = i_{m-1}+p_{i_{m-1}}$.\n\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ means $L_i \\ge 1$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ means $R_i \\le n$.\nThe condition $L_i \\ge 1$ implies $p_i \\le i$.\nThe condition $R_i \\le n$ implies $p_i \\le n-i+1$.\nSo $p_i \\le \\min(i, n-i+1)$. This is slightly stricter than $\\min(i, n+1-i)$ (it's $n-i+1$ instead of $n+1-i$).\nLet's recheck: $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies p_i \\le i$. $i+p_i-1 \\le n \\implies p_i \\le n-i+1$. So $p_i \\le \\min(i, n-i+1)$.\n\nConsider the center $i$ of an interval $I_i = [L_i, R_i]$. The length of the interval is $R_i - L_i + 1 = 2p_i - 1$.\nThe center of the interval is $(L_i+R_i)/2 = i$.\nThis means that any covered interval must have an integer center.\nIf a town $j$ is covered by a tower at $i$, then $j \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nIf $j$ is covered by exactly one tower, then $j$ must be the center of its interval, or it must be covered by an interval whose center is not $j$.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the covered intervals. If $I_1, \\dots, I_k$ partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, then $I_1 = [1, R_1]$, $I_2 = [R_1+1, R_2]$, ..., $I_k = [R_{k-1}+1, n]$.\nLet $i_m$ be the center of $I_m$. Then $I_m = [i_m-p_{i_m}+1, i_m+p_{i_m}-1]$.\nThe length of $I_m$ is $2p_{i_m}-1$. This length must be an odd number.\nThis means that the *number of towns covered by any tower must be odd*.\nSo, if $I_m = [L_m, R_m]$, then $R_m - L_m + 1$ must be odd.\nThis implies $L_m$ and $R_m$ must have the same parity.\nSince $I_1=[1, R_1]$, $R_1$ must be odd.\nSince $I_2=[R_1+1, R_2]$, and $R_1$ is odd, $R_1+1$ is even. Thus $R_2$ must be even.\nIn general, $R_m$ must have the same parity as $m$.\nThis implies that $n$ must have the same parity as $k$.\n\nCrucially, the center $i$ of an interval $[L, R]$ is $(L+R)/2$. If $L$ and $R$ have the same parity, then $L+R$ is even, so $(L+R)/2$ is an integer.\nThis means that for any interval $[L, R]$ that is part of the partition, its center $(L+R)/2$ must be a town where a tower is built.\nSo, the set of towns where towers are built must be precisely the set of centers of the partition intervals.\n\nLet's denote $x_j=1$ if a tower is built at town $j$, and $x_j=0$ otherwise.\nWe need to find a sequence of towers $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ such that $x_{i_j}=1$ for all $j$, and for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we can choose $p_{i_j}$ such that the intervals $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$ partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe partition conditions are:\n1. $L_1 = 1$\n2. $R_k = n$\n3. $L_{j+1} = R_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nFrom $L_j$ and $R_j$ we can find $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\nFor this to be valid, $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity (so $p_j$ is an integer) and $L_j+R_j$ must be even (so $i_j$ is an integer).\nThe parity condition implies $R_j$ has the same parity as $L_j$.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $R_1$ must be odd.\n$L_2=R_1+1$ (even). So $R_2$ must be even.\n$L_3=R_2+1$ (odd). So $R_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have parities alternating between odd and even.\n$R_j$ must have the same parity as $j$.\nThis means $n=R_k$ must have the same parity as $k$.\n\nConsider the sequence of centers $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$.\n$i_1 = (1+R_1)/2$.\n$i_2 = (R_1+1+R_2)/2$.\n...\n$i_k = (R_{k-1}+1+n)/2$.\nNotice that $i_j$ is the midpoint of its interval. The distance from $i_j$ to $L_j$ is $i_j-L_j = p_j-1$. The distance from $i_j$ to $R_j$ is $R_j-i_j = p_j-1$.\nSo $i_j - (p_j-1) = L_j$ and $i_j + (p_j-1) = R_j$.\nThe condition $L_{j+1} = R_j+1$ becomes $i_{j+1}-(p_{j+1}-1) = i_j+(p_j-1)+1$.\n$i_{j+1} - p_{j+1} + 1 = i_j + p_j - 1 + 1 \\implies i_{j+1} - p_{j+1} = i_j + p_j - 1$.\nSince $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$, $2p_j-1 = R_j-L_j+1$. This is the length of the interval.\n$p_j = i_j - L_j + 1$.\n$p_j = R_j - i_j + 1$.\nSo $i_j - L_j = R_j - i_j$.\nThe condition $L_{j+1} = R_j+1$ means that there are no gaps or overlaps.\nThe condition $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n-i_j+1)$ is automatically satisfied if $L_1=1$ and $R_k=n$ and $L_{j+1}=R_j+1$.\n$p_1 = i_1 - L_1 + 1 = i_1$. So $p_1 \\le i_1$ is satisfied.\n$p_k = R_k - i_k + 1 = n - i_k + 1$. So $p_k \\le n-i_k+1$ is satisfied.\nFor intermediate $j$, $p_j = i_j - L_j + 1$ and $p_j = R_j - i_j + 1$.\n$L_j \\ge 1$ and $R_j \\le n$ are true by construction. So $p_j \\le i_j$ and $p_j \\le n-i_j+1$ are also satisfied.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding a set of towns $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where towers are built, such that if we define $L_1=1, R_k=n$, and $L_{j+1}=R_j+1$, then $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ are integers, and $R_j-L_j+1$ are odd (so $p_j$ are integers). As shown above, these conditions are equivalent to $R_j$ having the same parity as $j$.\n\nLet's define $f(m)$ as the number of ways to partition the towns $1, \\dots, m$ into odd-length intervals whose centers are built towers.\nThe last interval must be $[L_k, m]$. Its center is $i_k=(L_k+m)/2$. Its length is $m-L_k+1$.\nThis length must be odd, so $L_k$ and $m$ must have the same parity.\nIf $m$ is odd: $L_k$ must be odd.\nIf $m$ is even: $L_k$ must be even.\nAlso, the center $i_k$ must have a tower built.\nThe previous interval ends at $L_k-1$. If $L_k-1=0$, then $L_k=1$. In this case, the first tower $i_1=(1+m)/2$ must be built. This is one way.\nIf $L_k-1 > 0$, then we need to partition $1, \\dots, L_k-1$.\nThis is a recursive structure.\nLet $dp[m]$ be the number of valid ways to select towers in towns $1, \\dots, m$ to partition $1, \\dots, m$.\nTo partition $1, \\dots, m$:\nThe last interval $[L, m]$ must have length $m-L+1$ odd. So $L$ must have the same parity as $m$.\nThe center of this interval is $(L+m)/2$. A tower must be built there.\nThe remaining towns $1, \\dots, L-1$ must be partitioned.\n$dp[m] = \\sum_{L \\text{ s.t. } L \\text{ and } m \\text{ have same parity}} dp[L-1]$ (where $dp[0]=1$).\nThe sum is over $L=1, 2, \\dots, m$.\nIf $m$ is odd, $L$ must be odd: $L=1, 3, \\dots, m$.\n$dp[m] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\nIf $m$ is even, $L$ must be even: $L=2, 4, \\dots, m$.\n$dp[m] = dp[1] + dp[3] + dp[5] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\n\nLet's compute the first few values:\n$dp[0] = 1$\n$dp[1]$ (m=1, odd): $L=1$. $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$. (Tower at 1, power 1).\n$dp[2]$ (m=2, even): $L=2$. $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. (Tower at 2, power 1).\n$dp[3]$ (m=3, odd): $L=1, 3$. $dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    (1) Tower at 2, power 2 (covers [1,3]).\n    (2) Towers at 1,3, power 1 (covers [1,1] and [3,3]).\n$dp[4]$ (m=4, even): $L=2, 4$. $dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$dp[5]$ (m=5, odd): $L=1, 3, 5$. $dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5$.\n$dp[6]$ (m=6, even): $L=2, 4, 6$. $dp[6] = dp[1] + dp[3] + dp[5] = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], \\dots$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$. This is the Fibonacci sequence!\nSpecifically, $dp[m] = F_{m}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, \\dots$.\nLet's adjust. If we define $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$ (shifted Fibonacci), then $dp[m] = F_m'$.\nLet's use the standard definition $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5, \\dots$.\nThis means $dp[m] = F_{m+1}$ for $m \\ge 0$.\nLet's verify the recurrence:\nIf $m$ is odd: $dp[m] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\n$F_{m+1} = F_1 + F_3 + \\dots + F_m$. This is a known identity: $\\sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^N F_k = F_{N+1}$ if $N$ is odd.\nHere, $N=m$. So $\\sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^m F_k = F_{m+1}$.\nBut our sum is $dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[m-1] = F_1 + F_3 + \\dots + F_m$. This is correct.\nIf $m$ is even: $dp[m] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\n$F_{m+1} = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_m$. This is another identity: $\\sum_{k=2, k \\text{ even}}^N F_k = F_{N+1}-1$ if $N$ is even.\nThis doesn't quite match.\nLet's re-evaluate the recurrence:\n$dp[m] = \\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ has same parity as } m-1}^{m-1} dp[k]$.\nIf $m$ is even, $m-1$ is odd. $dp[m] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\n$F_{m+1} = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_m$. This is incorrect.\nThe sum $F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_m = F_{m+1} - F_1 = F_{m+1} - 1$.\nThis means $dp[m] = F_{m+1}-1$ for even $m$. This is not $F_{m+1}$.\nLet's check $dp[2]$: $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. $F_3=2$. So $dp[2] \\ne F_3$.\nLet's check $dp[4]$: $dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1+2=3$. $F_5=5$. So $dp[4] \\ne F_5$.\n\nThe recurrence is $dp[m] = \\sum_{k=0 \\dots m-1, k \\text{ has same parity as } m-1} dp[k]$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$dp[m] = dp[m-2] + dp[m-1]$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nLet's check this:\n$dp[m] = dp[m-1 \\text{ (same parity as } m-1)] + dp[m-3 \\text{ (same parity as } m-1)] + \\dots$\n$dp[m-1] = dp[m-2 \\text{ (same parity as } m-2)] + dp[m-4 \\text{ (same parity as } m-2)] + \\dots$\nThis means the sums are not directly related as $dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]$.\nThe sum is over $L-1$.\nIf $m$ is odd: $dp[m] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\nIf $m$ is even: $dp[m] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[m-1]$.\n\nLet $S_{odd}(k) = dp[0]+dp[2]+\\dots+dp[k]$ for even $k$.\nLet $S_{even}(k) = dp[1]+dp[3]+\\dots+dp[k]$ for odd $k$.\nIf $m$ is odd: $dp[m] = S_{odd}(m-1)$.\nIf $m$ is even: $dp[m] = S_{even}(m-1)$.\n\nFor $m \\ge 2$:\nIf $m$ is odd: $dp[m] = S_{odd}(m-1) = (dp[0] + \\dots + dp[m-3]) + dp[m-1] = dp[m-2] + dp[m-1]$.\nIf $m$ is even: $dp[m] = S_{even}(m-1) = (dp[1] + \\dots + dp[m-3]) + dp[m-1] = dp[m-2] + dp[m-1]$.\nSo, $dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nWith $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=dp[1]+dp[0]=1+1=2$\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[1]=2+1=3$\n$dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[2]=3+2=5$\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[3]=5+3=8$\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$.\nThis corresponds to $F_{m+1}$ if we use the standard $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nSo, $dp[m] = F_{m+1}$.\n\nThe number of ways to pick towers and assign powers is $dp[n] = F_{n+1}$.\nEach configuration of towers is chosen with probability $(1/2)^k$ where $k$ is the number of towers built.\nIn our construction, $k$ is the number of intervals, which is the number of towers built.\nThe problem states: \"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nThis means we sum the probabilities of all successful tower configurations.\nEach configuration has exactly $k$ towers. The probability of a specific configuration with $k$ towers is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis is because for *any* choice of $k$ towers, the remaining $n-k$ towns must *not* have towers.\nSo, each successful configuration (which has $k$ towers, where $k$ is determined by the partition) has probability $(1/2)^n$.\nThe total probability is $dp[n] \\times (1/2)^n = F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nWe need to compute $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$n=1$: $F_{1+1}/2^1 = F_2/2 = 1/2$.\n$n=2$: $F_{2+1}/2^2 = F_3/4 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\n$n=3$: $F_{3+1}/2^3 = F_4/8 = 3/8$.\n$n=5$: $F_{5+1}/2^5 = F_6/32 = 8/32 = 1/4$.\n\nExample outputs:\n$n=2$: Output $748683265$. $1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$. My answer $1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\nThis is the same as $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$4 \\times 748683265 = 2994733060$. $2994733060 \\pmod{998244353} = 1$.\nSo for $n=2$, the example output is $1/4$.\nMy calculation gives $F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nWhat is wrong?\n\nThe example for $n=2$ says: \"with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is one way. Towers at $1,2$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. $I_1=[1,1], I_2=[2,2]$. This is a valid partition. $k=2$.\nWhat about only tower at $2$? $p_2=1$ covers $[2,2]$. $1$ is not covered. Invalid.\nWhat about only tower at $1$? $p_1=1$ covers $[1,1]$. $2$ is not covered. Invalid.\nWhat about no towers? Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, only the configuration $\\{1,2\\}$ is valid. This has probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nMy $dp[2]$ is $2$. This means there are 2 ways to partition $1, \\dots, 2$.\n1. Tower at 2, power 1. This would cover [2,2]. Town 1 is not covered. This is NOT a valid partition of *all* towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nThe DP definition: $dp[m]$ is the number of valid ways to select towers in towns $1, \\dots, m$ to partition $1, \\dots, m$.\nFor $n=2$:\n$dp[2]$ (m=2, even): $L=2$. $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. This implies only one way: last interval is $[2,2]$. Center is $2$. Tower at $2$.\nThis implies the partition is $[1,1], [2,2]$ (if $L=1$ was allowed for $dp[2]$) or just $[2,2]$ (if $L=2$ is the only option).\nLet's re-read the recurrence carefully.\n$dp[m] = \\sum_{L \\text{ s.t. } L \\text{ and } m \\text{ have same parity}} dp[L-1]$\nFor $m=2$: $L$ must be even. So $L=2$.\n$dp[2] = dp[2-1] = dp[1] = 1$.\nThis means the only way is to have the last interval be $[2,2]$. This requires a tower at $2$.\nThen the remaining part is $1, \\dots, L-1 = 1, \\dots, 1$.\n$dp[1]$ means partitioning $\\{1\\}$. $L$ must be odd, so $L=1$. $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$.\nThis means the interval for $1$ is $[1,1]$. This requires a tower at $1$.\nSo the only way to partition $1, \\dots, 2$ is with intervals $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$, requiring towers at $1$ and $2$. This is $k=2$ towers. This has probability $1/4$. This matches the example.\n\nNow for $n=3$:\n$dp[3]$ (m=3, odd): $L$ must be odd. $L=1, 3$.\n$dp[3] = dp[1-1] + dp[3-1] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1+1=2$.\nThese two ways are:\n1. Last interval is $[3,3]$ (so $L=3$). Tower at $3$.\n   Remaining part is $1, \\dots, 2$. This is $dp[2]=1$ way.\n   This means partition of $1, \\dots, 2$ is $[1,1], [2,2]$ (towers at $1,2$).\n   So this way is intervals $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]$ with towers at $1,2,3$. $k=3$. Probability $1/8$.\n2. Last interval is $[1,3]$ (so $L=1$). Tower at $2$.\n   Remaining part is $1, \\dots, 0$. This is $dp[0]=1$ way.\n   So this way is interval $[1,3]$ with tower at $2$. $k=1$. Probability $1/8$.\nTotal probability for $n=3$ is $(1/8) + (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $748683265$, which is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. This matches!\n\nSo my DP recurrence and the interpretation of $dp[n]$ as the number of valid tower configurations is correct.\n$dp[m] = F_{m+1}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nFinal check on $n=5$:\n$dp[5] = F_{5+1} = F_6 = 8$.\nProbability is $8/2^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$.\nExample output for $n=5$ is $842268673$.\n$4 \\times 842268673 = 3369074692$. $3369074692 \\pmod{998244353} = 1$.\nSo for $n=5$, the example output is $1/4$. My calculation matches.\n\nThe problem asks for $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1}$. Since $n$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, we need an efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers. Matrix exponentiation is $O(\\log n)$.\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number.\nWe also need to compute $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. This is $2^{MOD-1-n} \\pmod{MOD}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Define the modulus `MOD = 998244353`.\n2.  Function for matrix multiplication: `multiply(A, B)`\n    `C = [[0,0],[0,0]]`\n    `C[0][0] = (A[0][0]*B[0][0] + A[0][1]*B[1][0]) % MOD`\n    `C[0][1] = (A[0][0]*B[0][1] + A[0][1]*B[1][1]) % MOD`\n    `C[1][0] = (A[1][0]*B[0][0] + A[1][1]*B[1][0]) % MOD`\n    `C[1][1] = (A[1][0]*B[0][1] + A[1][1]*B[1][1]) % MOD`\n    `return C`\n3.

Function to calculate $F_k$: `fib(k)`\n    If $k=0$, return $0$.\n    If $k=1$, return $1$.\n    The Fibonacci recurrence is $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    So $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    `M_pow_k = matrix_pow(M, k)`\n    `return M_pow_k[0][1]` (this gives $F_k$) or `M_pow_k[1][0]` (also gives $F_k$).\n    We need $F_{n+1}$.

This is $1/4$.\nThis means my Fibonacci index is off for $n=1$.\nMy $dp[1]=1$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$.\nThe example output $1/4$ means $dp[1]$ should be $1/2$ (total probability $1/4$) or $n$ is effectively $2$ for some reason.\nIs the problem asking for $F_n/2^n$?\nIf $F_n/2^n$:\n$n=1: F_1/2^1 = 1/2$. Still $1/2$.\n$n=2: F_2/2^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example for $n=2$.\n$n=3: F_3/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. This matches the example for $n=3$.\n$n=5: F_5/2^5 = 5/32$. This matches the example for $n=5$.\n\nSo it seems the answer is $F_n / 2^n$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$.\nLet's re-evaluate $dp[m]$ values and their correspondence to Fibonacci.\n$dp[0]=1$ (no towns, 1 way, empty partition)\n$dp[1]=1$ (partition $1$ into $[1,1]$, tower at $1$)\n$dp[2]=2$ (partition $1,2$ into $[1,1],[2,2]$ (towers at $1,2$) OR $[1,2]$ (tower at $1.5$ not allowed)).\nWait, $dp[2]$ should be $1$ from my recurrence: $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$.\nThe recurrence $dp[m] = dp[m-1] + dp[m-2]$ with $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1$ gives $1,1,2,3,5,8,\\dots$.\nThis is $F_{m+1}$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$.\nIf $dp[m] = F_m$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$:\n$dp[0]=F_0=0$. This is problematic as $dp[0]$ must be $1$.\nIf $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1$, then $dp[2]=2, dp[3]=3, dp[4]=5$. This sequence is $F_{m+1}$ for $m \\ge 0$.\nSo $dp[n]$ is $F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's re-verify $n=2$:\nExample says $1/4$. My $dp[2]=F_3=2$. Probability $2/4=1/2$.\nThe example note for $n=2$ says: \"with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is ONE valid configuration. It has $k=2$ towers. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nIs this the ONLY valid configuration?\nIf we have a tower at $1$ only: $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town $2$ is not covered. Invalid.\nIf we have a tower at $2$ only: $p_2=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ is not covered. Invalid.\nIf we have no towers: Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, there is only $1$ valid configuration. This configuration involves $2$ towers.\nIts probability is $1 \\times (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nSo $dp[2]$ should be $1$.\nMy $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2, dp[3]=3, \\dots$ is wrong.\n\nLet's restart the DP state and recurrence carefully.\n$dp[m]$ = number of ways to choose towers from $1, \\dots, m$ such that $1, \\dots, m$ are covered by exactly one tower each, and $0, m+1$ are not covered.\n$dp[0]=1$ (empty set of towns, 1 way to cover them: no towers).\nFor $m > 0$:\nConsider the tower that covers town $m$. Let this tower be at $i$ with power $p$.\nIt covers $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\nSince it covers $m$, $i+p-1 = m$.\nSo $p = m-i+1$.\nThe interval covered is $[i-(m-i+1)+1, m] = [2i-m, m]$.\nThe town $0$ must not be covered: $2i-m \\ge 1$.\nSo $2i \\ge m+1 \\implies i \\ge (m+1)/2$.\nThe town $m+1$ must not be covered: $i+p-1=m \\le m$. This is already satisfied.\nThe town $i$ must have a tower.\nThe length of the interval $[2i-m, m]$ is $m-(2i-m)+1 = 2m-2i+1$. This must be odd. This is always true.\nThe towns $1, \\dots, 2i-m-1$ must be covered by other towers.\nSo $dp[m] = \\sum_{i = \\lceil(m+1)/2\\rceil}^{m} dp[2i-m-1]$.\nThe sum is over possible locations $i$ for the tower covering $m$.\nFor each such $i$, $2i-m-1$ is the new $m'$ for the recursive call.\nLet's check $dp[1]$:\n$m=1$. $i \\ge (1+1)/2 = 1$. So $i=1$.\n$dp[1] = dp[2(1)-1-1] = dp[0] = 1$.\nThis means one way: tower at $1$, power $p=1-1+1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$.\nThis is correct.\n\nLet's check $dp[2]$:\n$m=2$. $i \\ge (2+1)/2 = 1.5$. So $i=2$.\n$dp[2] = dp[2(2)-2-1] = dp[1] = 1$.\nThis means one way: tower at $2$, power $p=2-2+1=1$. Covers $[2,2]$.\nRemaining part is $1, \\dots, 2(2)-2-1 = 1, \\dots, 1$. This is $dp[1]=1$ way, tower at $1$, power $1$.\nSo the only way to partition $1, \\dots, 2$ is with intervals $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$, requiring towers at $1$ and $2$.\nThis requires $2$ towers. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example for $n=2$.\n\nLet's check $dp[3]$:\n$m=3$. $i \\ge (3+1)/2 = 2$. So $i=2, 3$.\n$dp[3] = dp[2(2)-3-1] + dp[2(3)-3-1] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThese two ways are:\n1. Tower at $i=2$. Power $p=3-2+1=2$. Covers $[2(2)-3, 3] = [1,3]$.\n   Remaining part is $1, \\dots, 2(2)-3-1 = 1, \\dots, 0$. This is $dp[0]=1$ way.\n   This configuration has 1 tower (at $2$). Probability $(1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\n2. Tower at $i=3$. Power $p=3-3+1=1$. Covers $[2(3)-3, 3] = [3,3]$.\n   Remaining part is $1, \\dots, 2(3)-3-1 = 1, \\dots, 2$. This is $dp[2]=1$ way.\n   This means the partition of $1, \\dots, 2$ is $[1,1], [2,2]$ (towers at $1,2$).\n   So this configuration has 3 towers (at $1,2,3$). Probability $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$.\nTotal probability for $n=3$ is $(1/2) + (1/8) = 5/8$.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $1/4$. My calculation $5/8$ is wrong.\n\nWhat is going on? The example outputs are $1/4, 1/4, 5/32$.\n$n=1$: $1/4$.\n$n=2$: $1/4$.\n$n=3$: $1/4$.\n$n=5$: $5/32$.\n\nMy $dp[n]$ values:\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=1$\n$dp[3]=2$ (from above, this should be $1$ way for $k=1$ and $1$ way for $k=3$)\n$dp[4]$: $m=4$. $i \\ge (4+1)/2 = 2.5$. So $i=3, 4$.\n$dp[4] = dp[2(3)-4-1] + dp[2(4)-4-1] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$dp[5]$: $m=5$. $i \\ge (5+1)/2 = 3$. So $i=3, 4, 5$.\n$dp[5] = dp[2(3)-5-1] + dp[2(4)-5-1] + dp[2(5)-5-1] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[m]$ is $1,1,1,2,3,5,\\dots$.\nThis is $F_m$ for $m \\ge 1$, with $dp[0]=1$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\nSo $dp[m] = F_m$ for $m \\ge 1$, and $dp[0]=1$.\nThis means the number of ways is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe total probability is $\\sum (\\text{prob of configuration } C)$.\nProb of configuration $C$ is $(1/2)^n$.\nSo total probability is $dp[n] \\times (1/2)^n = F_n / 2^n$ (for $n \\ge 1$).\n\nLet's test this with example values:\n$n=1: F_1/2^1 = 1/2$. Example is $1/4$. Still mismatch.\n$n=2: F_2/2^2 = 1/4$. Example is $1/4$. Match!\n$n=3: F_3/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Example is $1/4$. Match!\n$n=5: F_5/2^5 = 5/32$. Example is $5/32$. Match!\n\nIt seems the formula is $F_n/2^n$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nWhat about $n=1$?\nFor $n=1$, towns are $0,1,2$. Only town $1$ can have a tower.\nIf tower at $1$ is built (prob $1/2$):\n  Power $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town $0$ not covered, town $2$ not covered. Town $1$ covered by exactly one tower. Valid.\nIf tower at $1$ is not built (prob $1/2$):\n  Town $1$ is not covered. Invalid.\nSo for $n=1$, the probability is $1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=1$ is $748683265$, which is $1/4$.\nThis suggests that the problem statement for $n=1$ implies some additional constraint or interpretation not covered by my DP.\nCould it be that $n=1$ is a special case or the problem description is slightly ambiguous for $n=1$?\nThe problem note for $n=2$ says \"the real answer for the first example is $1/4$\".\nThe first example is $n=2$. So for $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$. My formula $F_2/2^2 = 1/4$ matches.\nThe second example is $n=3$. \"the real answer for the second example is $1/4$\". My formula $F_3/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$ matches.\nThe third example is $n=5$. \"the real answer for the third example is $5/32$\". My formula $F_5/2^5 = 5/32$ matches.\nThe input values are '2', '3', '5', '200000'.\nThe output for $n=1$ is not given in the example.\nThe provided example output is for $n=2, 3, 5, 200000$.\nThe list `['2', '3', '5', '200000']` are inputs.\nThe list `['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']` are outputs.\nSo for $n=2$, output is $748683265 = 1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, output is $748683265 = 1/4$.\nFor $n=5$, output is $842268673 = 5/32$.\nFor $n=200000$, output is $202370013$.\n\nMy formula $F_n/2^n$ works for $n=2,3,5$.\nSo for $n=1$, it should be $F_1/2^1 = 1/2$.\nBut $n=1$ is not in the example inputs.\nIt's possible that the problem statement means $F_n/2^n$ is the general formula, and $n=1$ gives $1/2$.\nThe constraints are $1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nI will use the formula $F_n/2^n$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=0$, $F_0/2^0 = 0/1 = 0$. But $dp[0]=1$. So $F_n$ is for $n \\ge 1$.\nIf $n=1$, the answer is $F_1/2^1 = 1/2$.\nIf $n=0$ was allowed, it would be $1$.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nSo we need to compute $F_n$.\nMatrix exponentiation for $F_n$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{k-1} \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{k-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nSo to get $F_n$, we need to compute $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$.\nIf $n=1$, we need $M^0 = I$. Then $F_1$ is $I[0][0]=1$. This works.\nThe matrix exponentiation needs $n-1$. If $n=1$, $n-1=0$.\n`matrix_pow(M, 0)` should return `[[1,0],[0,1]]`.\nThen $F_1$ is `res[0][0]*F_1 + res[0][1]*F_0 = 1*1 + 0*0 = 1`.
