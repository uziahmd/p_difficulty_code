            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's \"Guard Duty (easy)\", but I want to make sure I understand the core: we have Rebel spaceships and bases, and we need to assign each to the other while ensuring the connecting lines don't cross.  The key is that the number of spaceships (R) has to equal the number of bases (B) for a solution to even exist. If R and B are unequal, it's an immediate \"No\".\n\nMy immediate thought is that since R and B are small, up to 10, a brute-force approach, like generating and checking all permutations, is likely acceptable.  The critical part is figuring out how to efficiently check if a given set of segments *do* intersect.\n\nThe geometric constraint is what jumps out as the heart of the problem. Two line segments intersect if the endpoints of each segment are on opposite sides of the other segment. The cross product, or the orientation test, seems perfect for this.  Given three points, A, B, and C, the orientation gives us a signed area - positive for counter-clockwise, negative for clockwise, and zero if they're collinear (which, thankfully, isn't a concern here).\n\nSo, two segments, (P1, Q1) and (P2, Q2), intersect if: P1 and Q1 are on opposite sides of the line P2Q2 AND P2 and Q2 are on opposite sides of the line P1Q1. Mathematically, that's  `o(P1, Q1, P2) * o(P1, Q1, Q2) < 0` AND `o(P2, Q2, P1) * o(P2, Q2, Q1) < 0`.\n\nThe plan is to:\n\n1.  Verify that R equals B.\n2.  Generate all possible permutations of bases for a fixed ordering of spaceships.\n3.  For each permutation:\n    *   Create the segments connecting spaceship i to the base assigned by the permutation.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of segments. If any pair intersects (using the cross product test), this permutation is invalid.\n    *   If no segments intersect, we have a valid assignment and we can output \"Yes\".\n\nSince we're dealing with factorials (R!), even with R = 10, the computational cost should be within acceptable limits. I'm confident I can make this work with a Python script!\n",
