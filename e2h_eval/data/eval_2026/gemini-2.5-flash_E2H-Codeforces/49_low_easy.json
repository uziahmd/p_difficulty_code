They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Diving into Mushroom Strife**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem.  The gist of it is this: I've got a graph of lawns, connected by roads.  Each road gives me the GCD and LCM of the number of mushrooms on the two lawns it connects. My mission? Figure out how many mushrooms are on each lawn, or declare it impossible.  The mushroom count is bound between 1 and 10^6.\n\nFirst things first, let's nail down the core idea:  `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.  This is gold! If I know the GCD and LCM for two connected lawns, I can directly relate their mushroom counts.  If I have an edge with a given GCD (`g`) and LCM (`l`),  I know that  `m_u * m_v = g * l`, where `m_u` and `m_v` are the mushroom counts for the connected lawns `u` and `v`.\n\nIt also seems clear that `g` must divide both `m_u` and `m_v`.  Similarly, both `m_u` and `m_v` have to divide `l`.  This helps me get a handle on what valid values could be.  I can think of it this way:  `m_u = g * x` and `m_v = g * y`, where `x` and `y` are coprime.  Then, the LCM is  `g * x * y`, which gives me  `l = g * x * y`.  This reinforces my earlier equation. Now the key is realizing that if I can get one value, the other can be worked out using the edge properties.\n\nNow, the plan unfolds.  This screams graph traversal! I can arbitrarily fix a mushroom count for one lawn and use the roads to propagate this information. For example, if I decide  `m_u` has a certain value, I can immediately look at its neighbor `v`. To determine if this value makes sense, two checks are needed: `m_u` must be divisible by `g`, and `l` must be divisible by `m_u`. If both pass, I can calculate `m_v = (g * l) / m_u`. Then, I need to verify that `GCD(m_u, m_v)` is indeed the given `g`. If this is consistent, I can move along to all the other lawns to try to figure out what values work.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: `n` and `m` are up to 1000, and the GCD/LCM values are capped at 10^6. This approach looks promising – a BFS or DFS-like graph traversal, with checks at each step to see if my values are consistent. This should allow me to solve the problem and determine whether a valid solution exists!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to assign a positive integer number of mushrooms to each of `n` lawns, given `m` roads. For each road connecting two lawns `u` and `v`, we are given the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on `u` and `v`. We need to find any valid assignment or report that none exists. The mushroom counts must be between 1 and 10^6.\n\n**Key Property:**\nFor any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.\nThis property is fundamental. If `m_u` and `m_v` are the mushroom counts on lawns `u` and `v`, and we are given `g = GCD(m_u, m_v)` and `l = LCM(m_u, m_v)`, then `m_u * m_v = g * l`.\n\n**Additional Constraints for a valid pair (m_u, m_v):**\n1. `g` must divide both `m_u` and `m_v`.\n2. Both `m_u` and `m_v` must divide `l`.\n3. `GCD(m_u, m_v)` must be exactly `g`. (If `m_u * m_v = g * l` and `GCD(m_u, m_v) = g`, then `LCM(m_u, m_v)` will automatically be `l`.)\n\n**Initial Check:**\nFor each given road `(u, v, g, l)`:\n- If `l % g != 0`, then `LCM(a, b)` cannot be `l` if `GCD(a, b)` is `g`. This is because `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`. If `g` does not divide `l`, no such `a, b` exist. In this case, no solution is possible, and we can immediately output \"NO\".\n\n**Graph Representation and BFS/DFS:**\nThe problem can be modeled as finding values for nodes in a graph. If we fix the value for one node, we can potentially determine values for its neighbors. This suggests a graph traversal approach (BFS or DFS).\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Create an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[u]` stores `(v, g, l)` for roads connected to `u`.\n   - Initialize an array `ans` of size `n+1` with 0s (or a special value like -1) to store the mushroom counts.\n   - Initialize a `visited` array or set to keep track of visited nodes during traversal.\n\n2. **Iterate through nodes:**\n   - For each node `i` from 1 to `n`:\n     - If `ans[i]` is still 0 (meaning its value hasn't been determined yet):\n       - Start a BFS/DFS from `i`.\n       - **What value to start with?** We don't know `ans[i]`. The problem states that `ans[i]` must be a divisor of `l` and a multiple of `g` for any adjacent edge `(i, v, g, l)`.\n       - Instead of guessing `ans[i]`, let's maintain a set of *possible* values for each node. For each node `u`, `possible_values[u]` will initially contain all numbers from 1 to 10^6 (or a smaller range based on `g` and `l` of its neighbors).\n       - A better approach: The problem asks for *any* valid assignment. This implies we can make choices. If a connected component is independent of others, we can try to find a solution for it.\n\n**Revised Approach - Constraint Propagation with BFS/DFS:**\n\nThe key observation is that for any edge `(u, v, g, l)`, if we know `m_u`, then `m_v` is uniquely determined as `(g * l) / m_u`. We then must verify `GCD(m_u, m_v) == g`.\n\n1. **Data Structures:**\n   - `adj`: Adjacency list, `adj[u]` stores `(v, g, l)` for neighbors `v`.\n   - `ans`: Array of size `n+1` to store determined mushroom counts, initialized to 0.\n   - `q`: A queue for BFS.\n\n2. **Preprocessing (Initial Checks):**\n   - For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n     - If `l % g != 0`, print \"NO\" and exit. This is a crucial early check.\n     - Store the edge in `adj`: `adj[u].append((v, g, l))` and `adj[v].append((u, g, l))`.\n\n3. **BFS Traversal:**\n   - Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`:\n     - If `ans[i] == 0` (node `i` not yet assigned a value):\n       - **Find a starting value for `i`:**\n         - `start_val = 1`. This is a valid choice because `1` is a divisor of any `l` and a multiple of `1` (the smallest possible `g`). If `g` for some adjacent edge is greater than 1, `1` might not be valid, but we will check this during propagation. The simplest choice that allows propagation is `1`.\n         - If `i` has neighbors, we can try to be smarter. For an edge `(i, v, g, l)`, `ans[i]` must be a multiple of `g`. So `g` itself is a potential candidate. A safer bet is to use `1` for an isolated node, or `g` for the first edge we encounter.\n         - Let's just try `ans[i] = 1`. If `ans[i]` needs to be a multiple of `g` for an edge `(i, v, g, l)`, and `g > 1`, then `1` is an invalid choice. This will be caught by the `GCD` check later.\n         - A robust starting point for a connected component: Initialize `ans[i] = 1`. Add `i` to the queue.\n       - **Run BFS:**\n         - While `q` is not empty:\n           - `u = q.popleft()`\n           - For each `(v, g, l)` in `adj[u]`:\n             - **Check validity of `ans[u]` for this edge:**\n               - `m_u = ans[u]`\n               - If `m_u % g != 0` or `l % m_u != 0`:\n                 - This means the chosen `m_u` is inconsistent with the edge `(u, v, g, l)`. This should not happen if `m_u` was propagated correctly, but if we chose `ans[i]=1` arbitrarily, it might. If `m_u` is invalid, then no solution is possible for this component with this starting choice. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n             - **Calculate `m_v`:**\n               - `m_v_candidate = (g * l) // m_u`\n             - **Verify `m_v_candidate`:**\n               - If `GCD(m_u, m_v_candidate) != g`:\n                 - This indicates an inconsistency. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n             - **Propagate `m_v_candidate`:**\n               - If `ans[v] == 0` (value for `v` not yet determined):\n                 - `ans[v] = m_v_candidate`\n                 - `q.append(v)`\n               - Else (value for `v` already determined):\n                 - If `ans[v] != m_v_candidate`:\n                   - This means we found two different required values for `v`. Inconsistency! Print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - If the BFS completes for all components without printing \"NO\", then a valid assignment has been found. Print \"YES\" followed by the `n` values in `ans[1...n]`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- **Disconnected Graph:** The outer loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` handles disconnected components by starting a new BFS for each unvisited node.\n- **Node with no edges (m=0):** If `m=0`, all nodes are isolated. We can assign `1` to all of them. The `ans[i] = 1` initialization and BFS logic handles this correctly as `ans[i]` will remain `1` and no checks will fail.\n- **Maximum values:** `g, l` up to 10^6. `g*l` can be up to 10^12. Python handles large integers automatically. `m_u` and `m_v` must be within 1 to 10^6. This check should be added: `if not (1 <= m_v_candidate <= 10**6): print \"NO\"; exit()`.\n\nLet's refine the starting value and checks. When we start a BFS from `i` and `ans[i]` is 0:\nWe need to pick a value for `ans[i]`. The simplest is `1`. If this choice leads to an inconsistency, we report \"NO\".\nThe condition `m_u % g != 0` or `l % m_u != 0` is implicitly checked by `GCD(m_u, m_v_candidate) != g` and `m_u * m_v_candidate = g * l`.\nSpecifically, if `m_u % g != 0`, then `GCD(m_u, m_v_candidate)` cannot be `g` (since `g` must divide `m_u`).\nIf `l % m_u != 0`, then `m_u * m_v_candidate` would not be `g * l` if `m_v_candidate` was `l / m_u`. But `m_v_candidate` is defined as `(g*l)/m_u`. So `m_u * m_v_candidate = g*l` is always true by definition. The `GCD` check is sufficient.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\nimport math\n\n# Function to compute GCD (Python's math.gcd is efficient)\n# def gcd(a, b):\n#     while b:\n#         a, b = b, a % b\n#     return a\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    edges = [] # Store edges to perform initial validity checks\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v, g, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n        adj[u].append((v, g, l))\n        adj[v].append((u, g, l))\n\n    # Initial check for l % g != 0\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        if l % g != 0:\n            sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n            return\n\n    ans = [0] * (n + 1) # 0 means unassigned\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if ans[i] == 0: # If node i has not been assigned a value yet\n            q = deque()\n            \n            # Decide initial value for the component\n            # If the node has neighbors, its value must be a multiple of g for any edge (i, neighbor, g, l)\n            # A simple starting point is 1.
