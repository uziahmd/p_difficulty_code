He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so the user wants me to tackle a competitive programming problem. I need to take the input, process it, and spit out the answer in the correct format.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem:**\n\nRight, so the input's a bit quirky. We're given an integer *n* which defines the length of a hidden string *s*. Then we get a bunch of strings, specifically 2*n*-2 of them. These strings are all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes of *s*.  Improper means they can't be the entire string, so their lengths are between 1 and *n*-1.  Crucially, there are exactly two strings of *each* length from 1 to *n*-1.  And, there *must* exist at least one string of length n, from which the given input strings can be created.  The task is to determine whether each given input string is a prefix or a suffix of the original string *s*, and generate a string of 'P's and 'S's to represent that.\n\n**The Aha Moment (Hopefully):**\n\nThe key here is that we have an equal number of prefixes and suffixes (*n*-1 each). For any length *k* (1 to *n*-1), there's a prefix *and* a suffix of that length in the input.  This implies a strong overlap when it comes to the string of length *n*. The prefix of length *n*-1 will be the first n-1 characters, and the suffix of length *n*-1 will be the last n-1 characters.\n\nLet's call the *n*-1 length prefix  `s_prefix_n_minus_1` and the *n*-1 length suffix `s_suffix_n_minus_1`. If we know these two, we can reconstruct *s*!\n\nSpecifically, the overlap means that `s_prefix_n_minus_1` plus the last character of `s_suffix_n_minus_1` forms *s*, or, the first character of `s_prefix_n_minus_1` followed by `s_suffix_n_minus_1` also forms *s*.  The bit that ties this all together is that the overlapping portion ( `s[1:n-1]` ) must be identical in both.  Therefore, `s_prefix_n_minus_1[1:]` must equal `s_suffix_n_minus_1[:-1]`. If that's true, we have a candidate for the final string *s*.\n\n**Putting it into Action:**\n\nOkay, so the plan is:\n\n1.  Store the input strings along with their original indices.\n2.  Find the two strings that are length *n*-1.  Let's call these strings `str1` and `str2`.\n3.  Check if `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`.\n    *   If it is, then `s_candidate1 = str1 + str2[-1]` is a valid possible string s.\n4. Then we can go back and make our P/S string for the output by checking each of the initial strings if it is a prefix or suffix.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given list of `2n-2` strings as prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from `1` to `n-1`, and that these strings correspond to the prefixes and suffixes of some valid string `s`. We need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's, where the `i`-th character indicates the type of the `i`-th input string.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1.  There are `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes in total.\n2.  For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings provided. One must be the prefix of length `k`, and the other must be the suffix of length `k`.\n3.  The prefix of length `n-1` is `s[0:n-1]`.\n4.  The suffix of length `n-1` is `s[1:n]`.\n5.  These two strings (the prefix of length `n-1` and the suffix of length `n-1`) are crucial because they determine the original string `s`.\n    *   If `P_n_minus_1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `S_n_minus_1` is `s[1:n]`, then `s` can be reconstructed as `P_n_minus_1 + S_n_minus_1[-1]`.\n    *   For this reconstruction to be valid, the overlapping part must match: `P_n_minus_1[1:]` must be equal to `S_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Store Input:** Read all `2n-2` strings and store them along with their original indices. This is important for printing the result in the correct order.\n2.  **Identify Length `n-1` Strings:** Find the two strings that have length `n-1`. Let's call them `str_A` and `str_B`.\n3.  **Form Potential Original Strings `s`:** There are two possibilities for how `str_A` and `str_B` map to the prefix and suffix of length `n-1`:\n    *   **Possibility 1:** `str_A` is the prefix of length `n-1`, and `str_B` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check consistency: `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n        *   If consistent, a candidate string `s1 = str_A + str_B[-1]` is formed.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** `str_B` is the prefix of length `n-1`, and `str_A` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check consistency: `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n        *   If consistent, a candidate string `s2 = str_B + str_A[-1]` is formed.\n4.  **Validate and Choose `s`:**\n    *   Since the problem guarantees that a valid `s` exists, at least one of these possibilities must lead to a consistent `s`. We can pick either `s1` or `s2` (if both are valid) and proceed. Let's say we pick `s_chosen`.\n5.  **Classify All Strings:**\n    *   For each input string `input_str` (at its original index `i`):\n        *   Check if `input_str` is a prefix of `s_chosen`: `s_chosen.startswith(input_str)`.\n        *   Check if `input_str` is a suffix of `s_chosen`: `s_chosen.endswith(input_str)`.\n    *   We need to ensure that we assign `n-1` 'P's and `n-1` 'S's. A simple greedy approach might fail if a string is both a prefix and a suffix (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\").\n    *   A more robust approach: For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are two strings. One is `s_chosen[0:k]` and the other is `s_chosen[n-k:n]`.\n        *   We can iterate through all `2n-2` input strings.\n        *   Maintain a count of how many 'P's and 'S's we have assigned for each length.\n        *   For each input string `current_str` at index `idx`:\n            *   If `current_str` matches `s_chosen[0:len(current_str)]` (the unique prefix of that length) AND we haven't yet assigned 'P' to a string of this length, then assign 'P' to `current_str`.\n            *   Otherwise, `current_str` must be the suffix of that length, so assign 'S'. (This implicitly means `current_str` matches `s_chosen[n-len(current_str):n]` and we haven't assigned 'S' to a string of this length yet).\n            *   A simpler way: Since there are exactly two strings of each length, we can identify `s_chosen[0:k]` and `s_chosen[n-k:n]` for each `k`. Then, for each input string, we check if it's the `k`-length prefix or the `k`-length suffix.\n\n**Refined Classification Strategy:**\n\n1.  After determining `s_chosen`, create an array `result` of size `2n-2` initialized with empty strings.\n2.  Create a dictionary `used_prefixes_by_len` and `used_suffixes_by_len` to keep track of which specific string (by its content) has been assigned as a prefix/suffix for a given length. This is necessary because two distinct input strings might have the same content if `s` is palindromic.\n3.  Iterate through the `stored_inputs` (list of `(original_string, original_index)` tuples):\n    *   For `original_string` at `original_index`:\n        *   The true prefix of its length `k` is `s_chosen[0:k]`.\n        *   The true suffix of its length `k` is `s_chosen[n-k:n]`.\n        *   If `original_string == s_chosen[0:k]` and `original_string` has not yet been assigned as a prefix for this length `k`:\n            *   Assign `result[original_index] = 'P'`.\n            *   Mark `original_string` as used for prefix of length `k`.\n        *   Else (it must be the suffix of length `k`):\n            *   Assign `result[original_index] = 'S'`.\n            *   Mark `original_string` as used for suffix of length `k`.\n\n    This refined strategy is still tricky if `s_chosen[0:k]` happens to be identical to `s_chosen[n-k:n]`. In such a case, both input strings of length `k` would match both prefix and suffix.\n    A more robust way for the refined strategy:\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(string, index)` for all input strings.\n    *   Create a boolean array `is_prefix` of size `2n-2`, initialized to `False`.\n    *   For `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n        *   The prefix of length `k` is `p_k = s_chosen[0:k]`.\n        *   The suffix of length `k` is `s_k = s_chosen[n-k:n]`.\n        *   Find the two input strings of length `k`. Let them be `(str1, idx1)` and `(str2, idx2)`.\n        *   If `p_k == s_k`: (e.g., \"a\" for \"aaa\", or \"aba\" for \"ababa\")\n            *   We need to assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'. The specific assignment doesn't matter as long as there's one 'P' and one 'S'.\n            *   Set `is_prefix[idx1] = True`.\n            *   Set `is_prefix[idx2] = False`. (Or vice-versa, it's arbitrary)\n        *   Else (`p_k != s_k`):\n            *   If `str1 == p_k`: `is_prefix[idx1] = True`, `is_prefix[idx2] = False`.\n            *   Else (`str1 == s_k`): `is_prefix[idx1] = False`, `is_prefix[idx2] = True`.\n6.  **Print Result:** Join the characters in `result` (or based on `is_prefix` array) to form the final output string.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=5`\nInputs: `ba`, `a`, `abab`, `a`, `aba`, `baba`, `ab`, `aba`\nStored with indices: `[(ba,0), (a,1), (abab,2), (a,3), (aba,4), (baba,5), (ab,6), (aba,7)]`\n\n1.  **Length `n-1=4` strings:** `abab` (idx 2), `baba` (idx 5).\n    *   Let `str_A = \"abab\"`, `idx_A = 2`.\n    *   Let `str_B = \"baba\"`, `idx_B = 5`.\n\n2.  **Possibility 1:** `str_A` is prefix, `str_B` is suffix.\n    *   `P_4 = \"abab\"`, `S_4 = \"baba\"`.\n    *   Consistency check: `P_4[1:] == \"bab\"`, `S_4[:-1] == \"bab\"`.

Input strings: `(a,1), (a,3)`.\n        *   `p_1 == s_1`, so assign arbitrarily. `is_prefix[1]=True`, `is_prefix[3]=False`.\n    *   **Length 2:** `p_2=\"ab\"`, `s_2=\"ba\"`. Input strings: `(ba,0), (ab,6)`.\n        *   `p_2 != s_2`.\n        *   `ab` (idx 6) matches `p_2`. So `is_prefix[6]=True`.\n        *   `ba` (idx 0) matches `s_2`. So `is_prefix[0]=False`.\n    *   **Length 3:** `p_3=\"aba\"`, `s_3=\"aba\"`. Input strings: `(aba,4), (aba,7)`.\n        *   `p_3 == s_3`. Assign arbitrarily. `is_prefix[4]=True`, `is_prefix[7]=False`.\n    *   **Length 4:** `p_4=\"abab\"`, `s_4=\"baba\"`. Input strings: `(abab,2), (baba,5)`.\n        *   `p_4 != s_4`.\n        *   `abab` (idx 2) matches `p_4`. So `is_prefix[2]=True`.\n        *   `baba` (idx 5) matches `s_4`.
