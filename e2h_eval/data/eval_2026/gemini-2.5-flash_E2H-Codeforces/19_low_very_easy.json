The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The core of it seems to be about maximizing a sum, specifically, a weighted sum where the weights grow exponentially. It's asking me to select a subset of districts, `n - k` of them, from a larger set of `n` districts, such that they are connected. Each district has a \"fan\" value which is `2^i` where `i` is the district number. My goal is to maximize the total fan count of the selected, connected districts.\n\nSince the fan value increases exponentially with the district index, it's clear I need to prioritize keeping districts with higher indices. This hints strongly at a greedy approach. I should start by trying to keep the districts with the largest indices, `n`, `n-1`, and so on, until I have selected the required `n-k` districts that still form a connected component.\n\nMy initial thought was to iteratively build this connected component by adding districts in descending order. For each district, I'd need a way to check if adding it, while also ensuring the districts I've already selected remain connected. This feels a bit complex, especially figuring out that connectivity check.\n\nThen I shifted my thinking. I realized that the best-case scenario would be keeping the `n-k` districts with the highest indices, from `n-k+1` to `n`. That set would lead to the maximum sum of fans. Of course, this might not be possible because they might not form a connected component. The challenge is figuring out how to achieve the best possible result, or a result close to this maximum sum by swapping nodes as required.\n\nSo, I think I'll formalize a greedy strategy, starting from keeping the largest values, and swaping to a new value only if necessary to keep connectivity.\nI think I can get this to work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of their fan counts is maximized. The fan count for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nSince `2^i` grows exponentially, `2^i` is always greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < i` (specifically, `2^i > sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j = 2^i - 2`). This means that to maximize the total sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices.\n\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1. We want to keep `n - k` districts.\n2. We iterate through districts from `n` down to `1`.\n3. For each district `i`, we try to keep it if it's possible to form a connected component of `n - k` districts including `i` and all previously chosen (larger index) districts.\n\nLet's refine this greedy strategy. We will maintain a set of districts we have decided to keep, `kept_nodes`, and a set of districts we have decided to remove, `removed_nodes`. Initially, `kept_nodes` is empty, and `removed_nodes` is empty.\n\nWe iterate district `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n1. If we have already decided to remove `k` districts, we must keep all remaining districts. So, if `len(removed_nodes) == k`, we add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n2. Otherwise (we still have \"removal budget\" `k - len(removed_nodes)`):\n   a. We tentatively add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n   b. We check if the set `kept_nodes` (with `i` added) can form a connected component of size `n - k` by only removing `k - len(removed_nodes)` *more* districts from the remaining unvisited districts (`1` to `i-1`).\n   c. This check is equivalent to: if we keep `i`, can we still \"afford\" to remove `k` districts in total such that the final `n-k` kept districts are connected?\n   d. A simpler way to think about this is: if we *don't* keep `i`, we would have to keep some district `j < i` instead. This would result in a smaller total sum of fans. So, we should keep `i` unless keeping `i` forces us to remove too many other districts (more than `k` in total) to maintain connectivity.\n\nThe core idea is that we want to keep the largest possible indices. So, we try to keep `n`, then `n-1`, and so on. We only remove a district `i` if keeping it would make it impossible to form a connected component of `n-k` districts without exceeding the `k` removal limit.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their labels, from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain a `count` of how many districts we have decided to keep so far.\nWe also maintain a `removed_count` of how many districts we have decided to remove.\n\nFor each district `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\n1. If `removed_count` is already `k`, it means we have removed all `k` allowed districts. We must keep `i`. Add `i` to `kept_nodes`.\n2. If `removed_count < k`:\n   a. We want to keep `i` if possible, as it has a high fan count.\n   b. If we keep `i`, we add it to `kept_nodes`.\n   c. What if keeping `i` disconnects some other already kept nodes? Or what if keeping `i` makes it impossible to form a connected component of `n-k` nodes?\n   d. This is tricky. A more robust greedy strategy for trees is to consider the \"cost\" of removing a node. If we remove a node `u`, its neighbors become disconnected from `u`. If `u` is an articulation point, removing it can split the graph.\n\nLet's use a different perspective. We need to find a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with maximum sum of `2^i`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` nodes to remove such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component, and the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes is minimized. Since `2^i` is minimized for smaller `i`, we want to remove nodes with small indices.\n\nThe strategy:\n1. Initialize `kept_nodes` with all districts `1` to `n`.\n2. Initialize `removed_nodes` as an empty list.\n3. We need to remove `k` districts. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\n4. For each `i`, we want to remove it if possible, because it has the smallest fan count.\n5. To check if we can remove `i`:\n   a. Temporarily remove `i` from the graph.\n   b. Check if the remaining `n-1` nodes still form a connected component. This is not quite right, because we are removing `k` nodes in total.\n   c. A better check: if we remove `i`, will the number of connected components formed by `kept_nodes - {i}` be `1`? And will `kept_nodes - {i}` still have size `n-k` after `k` removals?\n\nThis problem can be solved by a greedy approach based on removing nodes.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest possible indices, provided that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\nLet `S` be the set of `n` districts. We want to select `S_kept` of size `n-k`.\nThe districts we remove are `S_removed = S \\setminus S_kept`. We want `sum_{i \\in S_kept} 2^i` to be maximum, which is equivalent to `sum_{i \\in S_removed} 2^i` to be minimum.\nThis means we want to remove districts with small indices.\n\nIterate through districts `i` from `1` to `n-1` (or up to `n` if `k` is large enough).\nFor each `i`, try to remove it. If removing `i` (and adding it to `removed_nodes`) keeps the remaining `n - len(removed_nodes)` nodes connected, and `len(removed_nodes)` is still less than or equal to `k`, then we can remove `i`.\n\nThis is still not precise enough. The problem is that removing a node `i` might disconnect a larger node `j` from the component, forcing us to remove `j` as well or keep some other small node instead of `j`.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy is to remove nodes from smallest index to largest index, as long as the remaining graph stays connected *and* has enough nodes to eventually form the `n-k` component.\n\nLet's try to remove nodes `1, 2, ..., k_0` for some `k_0`.\nThis implies that the nodes `k_0+1, ..., n` must form a connected component.\nThis is not necessarily true. We might remove `1` and `3` but keep `2`.\n\nA more effective greedy approach for trees:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. To maximize `sum 2^i`, we want to keep nodes with large indices.\nLet's try to keep node `n`. Then `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., until we have `n-k` nodes.\nWhat if `n` and `n-1` are not connected? We cannot just pick them. They must form a connected component.\n\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `n-k` nodes.\nLet `kept` be the list of nodes we keep.\nLet `removed` be the list of nodes we remove.\nInitially, `kept` is empty. `removed` is empty.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each `i`:\nIf we have already kept `n-k` nodes, we are done with keeping, so all subsequent nodes `j < i` must be removed. Add `j` to `removed`.\nIf we have removed `k` nodes, we must keep `i`. Add `i` to `kept`.\n\nOtherwise (we haven't kept `n-k` nodes yet, and haven't removed `k` nodes yet):\nWe try to keep `i`. Add `i` to `kept`.\nNow, check if the current `kept` nodes form a connected component. This is not enough.\nWe need to check if the current `kept` nodes, PLUS some `(n-k) - len(kept)` more nodes from `1` to `i-1`, can form a connected component, while only removing `k - len(removed)` more nodes from `1` to `i-1`.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a \"centroid-like\" approach or by considering nodes in decreasing order of importance (here, index `i`).\n\nThe key observation is that if we keep a set of nodes `S_kept`, they must form a connected component. This means that if we \"contract\" all nodes in `S_kept` into a single supernode, the original edges between them become internal to the supernode. The edges connecting a node in `S_kept` to a node not in `S_kept` become edges from the supernode to the outside node.\n\nConsider the strategy:\n1. Start with `removed_nodes = []`.\n2. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\n3. For each `i`, we check if we can remove it. We can remove `i` if `len(removed_nodes) < k` AND removing `i` does not disconnect any *already decided to be kept* nodes.\n4. This still doesn't quite work. The \"already decided to be kept\" nodes are not known yet.\n\nThe correct greedy approach is based on the idea of keeping the largest nodes possible.\nLet `S_kept` be the set of nodes we keep.\nInitially, `S_kept = {n}`. We have `k` removals allowed.\nThen, iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nFor each `i`:\n  If `len(S_kept) == n-k`, we have kept enough nodes. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n  Else (we need to keep more nodes):\n    If `i` is adjacent to any node in `S_kept`:\n      Add `i` to `S_kept`.\n    Else (if `i` is not adjacent to any node in `S_kept`):\n      We cannot add `i` to `S_kept` directly without breaking connectivity (unless we add a path between `i` and `S_kept`, which would involve adding smaller nodes, thus reducing the total sum).\n      So, if `i` is not adjacent to `S_kept`, we must remove it. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`. If `len(removed_nodes)` exceeds `k`, then our initial choice of `S_kept = {n}` was bad. This implies that this greedy strategy is flawed.\n\nThe problem is that the condition \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" means the final set of `n-k` nodes must form a single connected component.\n\nLet's use a standard technique for this kind of tree problem:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. This means we keep `N = n-k` nodes.\nTo maximize the sum `sum 2^i`, we want to keep the highest `N` indices possible.\nLet these `N` indices be `i_1 > i_2 > ... > i_N`.\nWe try to keep `n, n-1, ..., n-N+1`. If these `N` nodes form a connected component, this is the optimal solution.\nIf not, we must remove one of these `N` nodes (say `j`) and replace it with a smaller indexed node `l` to ensure connectivity. This would decrease the sum.\n\nThis implies we should try to keep the largest possible indices.\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe maintain a set `kept_candidate` of nodes we are considering keeping.\nWe maintain `removed_final` of nodes we have decided to remove.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen considering `i`:\n1. If `len(removed_final) == k`: We must keep `i`. Add `i` to `kept_candidate`.\n2. Else (`len(removed_final) < k`):\n   a. If `kept_candidate` is empty: Add `i` to `kept_candidate`. This `i` will be the \"root\" or starting point of our component.\n   b. If `kept_candidate` is not empty:\n      We need to check if adding `i` to `kept_candidate` is \"safe\".\n      If `i` is connected to any node in `kept_candidate`, we can add `i` to `kept_candidate`.\n      If `i` is NOT connected to any node in `kept_candidate`:\n         Then `i` forms a separate component. To connect `i` to `kept_candidate`, we would need to include all nodes on the unique path between `i` and `kept_candidate`. These nodes are smaller than `i`. This means we would have to keep more nodes than `n-k` or remove other large nodes. This is bad.\n         So, if `i` is not connected to `kept_candidate`, we should remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_final`.\n\nThis greedy strategy still has a flaw: \"connected to any node in `kept_candidate`\" implies we need to know the entire structure of `kept_candidate` and its induced subgraph.\n\nA simpler, correct greedy approach for trees:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet `R` be the set of nodes to be removed. Initially `R` is empty.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nFor each `i`:\n  If `len(R) == k`, we cannot remove any more nodes. Break the loop.\n  If `i` is already in `R` (which shouldn't happen with this iteration order), skip.\n  \n  Consider removing `i`.\n  If we remove `i`, the graph `G - R - {i}` must still be connected and have `n-k` nodes at the end.\n  This is equivalent to saying: if we remove `i`, the total number of nodes that become \"isolated\" or part of small components that cannot be merged into the main `n-k` component, must not exceed `k - len(R) - 1`.\n\nThis is a typical \"remove $k$ nodes to maximize sum of remaining nodes\" problem on a tree.\nThe optimal solution involves finding a connected component of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `n-k` that includes the largest possible node labels.\n\nLet's maintain the set of nodes we *must* keep, `must_keep`.\nInitially, `must_keep` is empty.\nWe also maintain `current_removed_count = 0`.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `i` is currently \"isolated\" from `must_keep` (i.e., `i` is not in `must_keep` and no neighbor of `i` is in `must_keep`):\n  If `current_removed_count < k`:\n    Add `i` to `removed_nodes`. `current_removed_count++`.\n  Else:\n    Add `i` to `must_keep`.\nElse (`i` is connected to `must_keep` or already in `must_keep`):\n  Add `i` to `must_keep`.\n\nThis doesn't work because `must_keep` will grow, and `i` might be connected to a node `j` in `must_keep` only through a path of nodes smaller than `i`.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is often related to the \"leaves\" of the component we want to keep.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe total number of nodes is `n`.\nWe can remove `k` nodes.\nThe strategy for removing nodes:\nWe want to remove nodes with small indices.\nLet `kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we keep. Initially, `kept_nodes` is empty.\nLet `removed_nodes` be the set of nodes we remove. Initially, `removed_nodes` is empty.\n\nWe iterate from `i = 1` to `n`.\nFor each `i`:\n  If `i` is a leaf node in the *current graph* (the graph of nodes not yet removed).\n  And if `len(removed_nodes) < k`.\n  And if removing `i` would not disconnect the graph of *remaining* nodes (this is always true for a leaf in a tree if the tree has > 1 node).\n  Then, remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n\nThis strategy is known as \"peeling off leaves\".\nRepeatedly remove leaves until `k` nodes are removed or no more leaves can be removed (because we only have 1 or 2 nodes left, or removing a leaf would disconnect the remaining component).\n\nLet's try this:\n1. Initialize `adj` list for the tree.\n2. Calculate initial degrees of all nodes.\n3. Initialize a queue `q` with all nodes `i` such that `deg[i] == 1`. These are the initial leaves.\n4. Initialize `removed_count = 0` and `removed_list = []`.\n5. Create a `is_removed` boolean array, initialized to `False`.\n6. While `q` is not empty and `removed_count < k`:\n   a. Dequeue a node `u`.\n   b. If `is_removed[u]` is already `True` (e.g., if it was dequeued multiple times because its degree changed), continue.\n   c. If `n - removed_count == 1`: If only one node is left, we can't remove it (unless `n-k=0`, which is not possible as `k < n`). If `n-k=1`, we must stop removing.\n      The condition `n - removed_count == n-k` means we have exactly `n-k` nodes left. We cannot remove any more. So we stop.\n      This simplifies to: if `n - removed_count == n-k`, we break.\n   d. Remove `u`: Add `u` to `removed_list`. Set `is_removed[u] = True`. Increment `removed_count`.\n   e. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `v` is not removed (`is_removed[v] == False`):\n         Decrement `deg[v]`.\n         If `deg[v] == 1`: Add `v` to `q`.\n\n7. After the loop, `removed_list` contains the districts to be removed. Sort it and print.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the first example:\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nDegrees:\ndeg[1]=1\ndeg[2]=4\ndeg[3]=1\ndeg[4]=1\ndeg[5]=1\ndeg[6]=2\n\nInitial leaves (degree 1): `q = [1, 3, 4, 5]`\n`removed_count = 0`, `removed_list = []`\n`is_removed = [F,F,F,F,F,F]` (for 1 to 6)\n\nTarget `n-k = 6-3 = 3` nodes to keep.\nWe can remove up to `k=3` nodes.\n\nIteration 1:\n  Dequeue `u = 1`.\n  `n - removed_count = 6 - 0 = 6`. We need to keep 3. `6 != 3`. So we can remove.\n  `removed_list = [1]`. `is_removed[1] = True`. `removed_count = 1`.\n  Neighbor of 1 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n  `deg[2]` becomes `4-1=3`.\n\nIteration 2:\n  Dequeue `u = 3`.\n  `n - removed_count = 6 - 1 = 5`. `5 != 3`. So we can remove.\n  `removed_list = [1, 3]`. `is_removed[3] = True`. `removed_count = 2`.\n  Neighbor of 3 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n  `deg[2]` becomes `3-1=2`.\n\nIteration 3:\n  Dequeue `u = 4`.\n  `n - removed_count = 6 - 2 = 4`. `4 != 3`. So we can remove.\n  `removed_list = [1, 3, 4]`. `is_removed[4] = True`. `removed_count = 3`.\n  Neighbor of 4 is 2. `is_removed[2]` is False.\n  `deg[2]` becomes `2-1=1`.\n  Since `deg[2]` is now 1, add 2 to `q`. `q = [5, 2]`.\n\nIteration 4:\n  Dequeue `u = 5`.\n  `n - removed_count = 6 - 3 = 3`. This is `n-k`. We cannot remove any more nodes.\n  Break the loop.\n\nFinal `removed_list = [1, 3, 4]`.\nSorted: `[1, 3, 4]`.\nThis matches the example output!\n\nLet's confirm why this works.\nThis strategy removes nodes with the smallest indices first, as long as they are leaves.\nBy removing leaves, we ensure that the remaining graph stays connected.\nIf we remove a leaf `u`, its only neighbor `v` remains connected to the rest of the graph. The component `G - {u}` is still connected.\nWe prioritize removing leaves with smaller indices. This is crucial for maximizing the sum of `2^i` for kept nodes.\nWhen `n - removed_count == n-k`, it means we have exactly `n-k` nodes left. These nodes must form a connected component because we only removed leaves. If we tried to remove one more node, we would violate the `n-k` constraint.\n\nThis \"peeling off leaves\" approach is standard for finding a connected subgraph of a certain size that maximizes/minimizes a property, especially when the property is monotonic with node labels (like `2^i`).\n\nEdge case: What if `n-k = 1`?\nExample: `n=3, k=2`. Keep 1 node.\nEdges: `(1,2), (2,3)`.\nDegrees: `deg[1]=1, deg[2]=2, deg[3]=1`.\n`q = [1, 3]`. `removed_count = 0`, `removed_list = []`. `n-k = 1`.\n\nIter 1: Dequeue `u=1`. `n-removed_count = 3`. Not 1. Remove 1.\n  `removed_list = [1]`. `removed_count = 1`.\n  `deg[2]` becomes `2-1=1`. Add 2 to `q`. `q = [3, 2]`.\n\nIter 2: Dequeue `u=3`. `n-removed_count = 2`. Not 1. Remove 3.\n  `removed_list = [1, 3]`. `removed_count = 2`.\n  `deg[2]` becomes `1-1=0`.\n\nIter 3: Dequeue `u=2`. `n-removed_count = 1`. This is `n-k`. Break.\n\nFinal `removed_list = [1, 3]`. Sorted: `[1, 3]`.\nThe kept node is 2. This is correct.\n\nThe constraint `1 <= k < n` means `n-k >= 1`, so we always keep at least one node.\nThe graph is always a tree.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Adjacency list for graph: `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`\n- Degrees: `deg = [0] * (n + 1)`\n- Queue: `collections.deque`\n- `is_removed` array: `[False] * (n + 1)`\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    deg = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        deg[u] += 1\n        deg[v] += 1\n\n    # Initialize queue with all leaf nodes\n    q = collections.deque()\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if deg[i] == 1: # A leaf node\n            q.append(i)\n        # Handle case n=1 (not possible due to k < n, so n >= 2)\n        # If n=2, k=1, then both nodes have deg=1.\n        # If n=2, k=1, n-k=1.
