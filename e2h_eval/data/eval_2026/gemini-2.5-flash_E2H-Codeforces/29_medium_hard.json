Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design for Substitutes in Number Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and my first instinct is to break down the core logic.  We're given an initial digit string `s` and a series of queries, each replacing a digit `di` with a string `ti`.  The final task is to calculate the value of the modified string modulo 1000000007. The key, it seems, is the fact that the direct string manipulation could lead to strings exploding in length.  We need to avoid that.\n\nMy initial thought was to simulate the replacements, but that quickly leads to exponential growth, so I have to rule that out.  I'm thinking, since we're only interested in the final value modulo a prime, maybe there's a way to track the effect of these substitutions numerically.\n\nI've realized the crucial insight: we can't process the queries sequentially. The direct replacement order matters and can cause a ton of changes. The most important queries are the last applied. Let's process the queries in reverse.  This way, each query defines the final mapping for a digit at that point.  If a query involves other digits, the mappings will be whatever their current mapping is at the point in the loop.\n\nSo, I'm going to maintain two arrays, `val[d]` and `len[d]`.  `val[d]` will store the numerical value that digit `d` ultimately becomes, and `len[d]` will store the length of the string `d` eventually transforms into. Initially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\nWhen I process the queries in reverse, let's say a query `di -> ti` arrives. I'll need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]`.  For `ti`, I will iterate through its characters. Each digit within `ti` has a current mapping defined by previous calculations, and I'll use those to construct `val[di]` and `len[di]`. So, a digit `c` in `ti` will contribute its value and length according to the state of `val[c]` and `len[c]` at that time.\n\nThe value update involves a multiplication of previous results which are modular. Because the length might be huge, I'm thinking about using modular exponentiation to keep those values within bounds. To handle large lengths and powers, I will also have to apply Fermat's Little Theorem.  This means the lengths will need to be calculated modulo `MOD-1` since `10^(MOD-1) % MOD = 1`.\n\nNow that I have a mechanism for constructing the mapping for each digit, the last step will be applying the final mappings to the original string. I will have to iterate through the digits in `s`, use the final mappings from `val` and `len`, and compute the final numerical value of the resulting string modulo MOD.\n\nI also have to address edge cases. What if a digit's final mapping is an empty string? Well, an empty string represents zero and should have a length of zero. This means `val[di]` should become `0`, and `len[di]` also should be `0`. What if the final result is an empty string? The problem explicitly states that an empty string has a value of 0.\n\nBased on these points, I think I have a solid plan. The algorithm should run in time proportional to the length of the original string plus the sum of lengths of the query replacements, which is pretty efficient.  I'm going to implement this in Python now. I need to make sure to modularize the length calculations and make sure the code handles empty strings for the query replacement strings.\n",
