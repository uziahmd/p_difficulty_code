Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. I'm looking at this \"TV Game\" problem, and my first instinct is to break it down. We've got two players, Homer and Marge, each making `n` moves to create two numbers that, when summed, we want to maximize. The input is a string of `2n` digits, and the output needs to be the sequence of moves ('H' or 'M').\n\n**Understanding the Game's Dynamics**\n\nThe key here is that the *order* of the digits matters significantly. Since the digits are appended to the number, the position the digit is taken has a big impact on its final value.  I'm already seeing the need for some positional accounting to get the maximum sum. Thinking about that Example 1... clearly, a greedy approach won't work in every instance. We can’t just say “always take the highest available digit”.\n\n**Diving Deeper: Positional Values**\n\nMy mental gears are spinning on the concept of positional values. When Homer or Marge take a digit `d` on their `k`-th move, this digit gets placed at the `n - (k -1)` position in their final number. Basically, we’re looking at place values.  The digit's contribution to the final sum will be `d * 10^(n - k - 1)`. And this needs to be calculated.\n\n**Building a Strategy**\n\nThis positional value insight is the cornerstone of a proper solution. I think I need to construct a strategy to maximize this.  I’m thinking about using some kind of dynamic programming to construct the maximum number at each stage. Maybe a recursive solution with memoization, or maybe a bottom-up approach to reduce repeated calculations. I need to make sure I’m making optimal decisions at each turn.\n\nEssentially, I need to come up with a Python script that strategically chooses between Homer or Marge at each turn based on maximizing the total sum, while considering the final positions of each digit in the generated sums.\n",
