The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and the goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open.  The core rule is pretty clear: a chest and a key work together if their sum is odd.  That immediately screams \"parity\" at me – one must be even, the other odd.\n\nMy first thought is to break down the problem by parity.  I'll categorize the chests and keys: `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. This allows me to see the constraints more clearly.  I'm basically looking at a bipartite matching problem here.\n\nI realize that even chests need odd keys, and odd chests need even keys.  These are independent matching scenarios in the *type* of key/chest they use, but share the total count of keys and chests available. I'm essentially pairing up even chests with odd keys and vice-versa.  The number of matches I can make in each of these scenarios is limited by the smaller of the two groups.  For even chests, the bottleneck is `min(C_E, K_O)`. For odd chests, it's `min(C_O, K_E)`.\n\nSince these matches are mutually exclusive (an odd key can't open an odd chest), I can just sum up the maximum number of matches for each type.  Therefore, the optimal solution should be:  `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nI'm pretty confident in that logic, but let's run a quick sanity check to be sure, and verify my reasoning. I'll test it against a simple example and make sure the math checks out. Let's see...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two scenarios for this:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nLet's count the number of even and odd chests, and even and odd keys.\nLet:\n- `chests_even` be the count of chests with an even number.\n- `chests_odd` be the count of chests with an odd number.\n- `keys_even` be the count of keys with an even number.\n- `keys_odd` be the count of keys with an odd number.\n\nWe can open chests by matching them with keys of the opposite parity:\n- To open an even chest, we need an odd key. The maximum number of even chests we can open this way is limited by the number of available even chests (`chests_even`) and the number of available odd keys (`keys_odd`). So, we can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` such chests.\n- To open an odd chest, we need an even key. Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests we can open this way is limited by `chests_odd` and `keys_even`. So, we can open `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` such chests.\n\nSince an odd key can only open an even chest (and not an odd chest), and an even key can only open an odd chest (and not an even chest), these two types of matches use disjoint sets of keys and chests (in terms of parity requirements). Therefore, we can simply add the maximum matches from each scenario to get the total maximum number of chests opened.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is:\n`min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n   - If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`.\n   - Else, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n   - If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`.\n   - Else, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example 1 walkthrough:**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. **Chests:**\n   - `9` (odd)\n   - `14` (even)\n   - `6` (even)\n   - `2` (even)\n   - `11` (odd)\n   `chests_even = 3` (`14, 6, 2`)\n   `chests_odd = 2` (`9, 11`)\n\n2. **Keys:**\n   - `8` (even)\n   - `4` (even)\n   - `7` (odd)\n   - `20` (even)\n   `keys_even = 3` (`8, 4, 20`)\n   `keys_odd = 1` (`7`)\n\n3. **Calculate matches:**\n   - Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   - Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4. **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N + M) for reading inputs and counting parities, which is efficient enough for N, M up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n            \n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    \n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # Max chests opened by matching even chests with odd keys\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Max chests opened by matching odd chests with even keys\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    print(matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
