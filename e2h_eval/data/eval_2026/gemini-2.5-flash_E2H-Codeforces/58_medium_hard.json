You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this competitive programming problem, keeping in mind my deep understanding of graph theory.**\n\nMy goal is to find the minimum number of edges to add (`t`) and the number of ways to do so (`w`) to create an odd cycle in a given graph. I'll systematically check different values of `t`, starting from the simplest case.\n\n**First**, I'll determine if `t=0` is possible. If the graph already contains an odd cycle, I'm done! I can check this by performing a 2-coloring (using BFS or DFS) on each connected component. If I find an edge connecting two nodes of the same color during the 2-coloring process, I've got an odd cycle, and `t=0` with `w=1`.\n\n**If `t=0` isn't possible**, the graph is bipartite. Now I'll consider `t=1`. If I can add a single edge to form an odd cycle, then the bipartite structure is key. If I add an edge between two vertices in the same partition set, I create an odd cycle. I'll need to calculate the number of such valid edge additions for each connected component. For each component, I'll count the vertices in each color class (`C_0` and `C_1`). The number of ways is the sum of `|C_0| * (|C_0| - 1) / 2` and `|C_1| * (|C_1| - 1) / 2` across all components.  The number of pairs in same color must be greater than 0 if `t = 1` then `t = 1, w = ...`\n\n**If `t=1` isn't possible**, then every component is either an isolated vertex or an isolated edge. This means no single edge addition can create an odd cycle. Here, I'll move to consider `t=2`. I will calculate the count of isolated vertices and the count of edges in the graph.\n\n**Here's where it gets nuanced for `t=2`:**\n*   **If I have both isolated vertices and existing edges**, I can form a C3 cycle. Pick an existing edge and connect to an isolated vertex. `t=2, w=count of existing edges * count of isolated vertices`.\n\n*   **If all vertices are part of existing edges**, but I have at least two edges (otherwise `t = 3`), I have to pick two edges and connect them. If the edges are `u-v` and `x-y`, and pick `u` connect `(u,x), (u,v)`. Count number of ways to pick the edges `w = count of edges * (count of edges - 1) * 2`.\n\n*   **If only isolated vertices exist (all vertices), I need to create the smallest odd cycle, a C3, by adding 3 edges.**\n\n*   If all the components are isolated and the number of vertices is at least 3,  `w = 0`. Not possible.\n*   Otherwise, the only scenario, that `t = 2` doesn't work is `n< 3`. So we proceed to `t = 3`.\n\n**Finally, if none of the above worked, it must be the case of `t=3`**. This situation arises when all the connected components are either isolated vertices, and we need to create the smallest odd cycle of 3 vertices using 3 edges, by selecting three different vertices. I could calculate the number of ways to choose 3 vertices: `w = n choose 3`.\nIn simpler words: When the graph has less than 3 vertices, I have to proceed to `t=3`, and for this edge case where there is not any cycle, I count the ways to build this C3.\n\nI'll execute this logic in the code, handling these cases, and efficiently calculate the values of `t` and `w`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` that must be added to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. The graph can be disconnected, has no loops or parallel edges, and we cannot add loops or parallel edges.\n\nThe core concept is that a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. A simple cycle of odd length must consist of at least 3 vertices.\n\nWe will analyze the problem by checking for the minimum `t` in increasing order: `t=0`, `t=1`, `t=2`, `t=3`.\n\n**1. Check for t = 0 (Graph already contains an odd cycle)**\nTo check if the graph already contains an odd cycle, we can perform a 2-coloring (bipartite check) using BFS or DFS.\n- Initialize `color[v] = -1` for all vertices `v`.\n- For each unvisited vertex `s` (i.e., `color[s] == -1`):\n    - Start a BFS/DFS from `s`, assigning `color[s] = 0`.\n    - During traversal, if we encounter an edge `(u, v)`:\n        - If `v` is uncolored (`color[v] == -1`), assign `color[v] = 1 - color[u]` and add `v` to the queue/stack.\n        - If `v` is colored and `color[v] == color[u]`, then we have found an odd cycle.\n- If an odd cycle is found in any component, then `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's only one way to add zero edges). We can stop here.\n\n**2. Check for t = 1 (Graph is bipartite, add one edge)**\nIf `t=0` is not possible, the graph is bipartite. We have successfully 2-colored all its connected components.\nLet's denote the two partitions (colors) as 0 and 1.\nAdding a single edge `(u, v)` creates an odd cycle if and only if `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and have the same color.\nFor each connected component `i`:\n- Let `s_{0,i}` be the number of vertices colored 0 in this component.\n- Let `s_{1,i}` be the number of vertices colored 1 in this component.\n- The number of ways to pick two distinct vertices of color 0 is `s_{0,i} * (s_{0,i} - 1) / 2`.\n- The number of ways to pick two distinct vertices of color 1 is `s_{1,i} * (s_{1,i} - 1) / 2`.\n- Sum these counts over all connected components to get `w_1`.\nIf `w_1 > 0`, then `t = 1` and `w = w_1`. We can stop here.\n\n**3. Check for t = 2 (Graph is bipartite, and `w_1=0`, add two edges)**\nIf `w_1 = 0`, it means for every connected component `i`, `s_{0,i} <= 1` and `s_{1,i} <= 1`. This implies that every connected component is either an isolated vertex or an isolated edge.\nLet `num_iso_vertices` be the count of isolated vertices.\nLet `num_edges` be the count of existing edges (which means `m` in total, where each edge forms a component of size 2).\n\nWe need to add two edges to form an odd cycle. The smallest odd cycle is C3 (triangle).\nTo form a C3 with two added edges, say `(A, B)` and `(B, C)`, we need `(C, A)` to be an existing edge.\n- Pick an existing edge `(C, A)`. Let `C` be color 0 and `A` be color 1.\n- Pick an isolated vertex `B`. It can be assigned color 0 or 1.\n- Add edges `(A, B)` and `(C, B)`.\n- If `B` is color 0, then `(A, B)` connects different colors (length 1), `(C, B)` connects same colors (length 0, not possible in bipartite graph).\nThis implies `B` must be of a specific color to make `(A,B)` and `(C,B)` \"valid\" in the sense of not creating an odd cycle *before* the final edge.\nLet's simplify:\nWe want to form a C3 `A-B-C-A`.\nWe add two edges, say `(A,B)` and `(B,C)`. Then `(C,A)` must be an existing edge.\n- If `num_iso_vertices > 0` and `num_edges > 0`:\n    - Pick an existing edge `(u, v)`. There are `num_edges` ways.\n    - Pick an isolated vertex `x`. There are `num_iso_vertices` ways.\n    - Add edges `(u, x)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a C3: `u-x-v-u`. This is an odd cycle.\n    - `t = 2`, `w = num_edges * num_iso_vertices`. We can stop here.\n\n- If `num_iso_vertices == 0` (all vertices are part of edges):\n    - This means `n = 2 * num_edges`.\n    - We need at least two existing edges to form a C3. So `num_edges >= 2`.\n    - Pick two distinct existing edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`.\n    - From `(x, y)`, pick one vertex, say `x`.\n    - Add edges `(u, x)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a C3: `u-x-v-u`. This is an odd cycle.\n    - Number of ways to choose `(u, v)`: `num_edges`.\n    - Number of ways to choose `(x, y)` (distinct from `(u, v)`): `num_edges - 1`.\n    - Number of ways to choose `x` from `(x, y)`: `2` (either `x` or `y`).\n    - So, `t = 2`, `w = num_edges * (num_edges - 1) * 2`. We can stop here.\n    - If `num_edges < 2` (i.e., `num_edges = 1`, which means `n=2, m=1`), then `t=2` is not possible this way.\n\n- If `num_edges == 0` (all vertices are isolated):\n    - We need at least 3 vertices to form a C3. So `n >= 3`.\n    - To form a C3 `A-B-C-A`, we need to add 3 edges: `(A,B), (B,C), (C,A)`. This means `t=3`.\n    - So `t=2` is not possible if `num_edges == 0`.\n\n**4. Check for t = 3 (If `t=0, 1, 2` not possible)**\nThis case occurs when:\n- The graph is bipartite (`t=0` failed).\n- `w_1=0` (`t=1` failed), meaning all components are isolated vertices or isolated edges.\n- And either:\n    - `num_iso_vertices = 0` and `num_edges < 2` (i.e., `n=2, m=1` only one edge `1-2`).\n    - `num_edges = 0` (all vertices isolated).\n\nIn these scenarios, we must add 3 edges to form the smallest odd cycle (C3).\nTo form a C3, we need to pick 3 distinct vertices `A, B, C` and add edges `(A, B)`, `(B, C)`, and `(C, A)`.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from `n` available vertices is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\n- `t = 3`, `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\n  Note that if `n < 3`, this value would be 0, implying no C3 can be formed. The problem statement guarantees an odd cycle can be formed. So `n` must be at least 3 for `t=3` to be possible.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use an adjacency list for the graph.\n- Use `collections.deque` for BFS.\n- Keep track of visited vertices and their colors during BFS.\n- For `t=1` calculation, count `s_0` and `s_1` for each component.\n- For `t=2` calculation, count `num_iso_vertices` and `num_edges`.\n\nLet's walk through the examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n4 2\n4 3\n\n1. **t=0 check:**\n   - Start BFS from 1, `color[1]=0`.\n   - Neighbors of 1: 2, 3. `color[2]=1, color[3]=1`.\n   - Neighbors of 2: 1, 4. `color[1]=0` (different from `color[2]=1`). `color[4]=0`.\n   - Neighbors of 3: 1, 4. `color[1]=0` (different from `color[3]=1`). `color[4]=0`. `color[4]` is already 0, which is same as `color[3]`. Found edge `(3,4)` where `color[3]=1` and `color[4]=0`. This is fine.\n   - Wait, `(4,2)`: `color[4]=0, color[2]=1`. Fine.\n   - `(4,3)`: `color[4]=0, color[3]=1`. Fine.\n   Let's re-run BFS carefully.\n   `adj = {1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 4], 3: [1, 4], 4: [2, 3]}`\n   `color = [-1, -1, -1, -1]` (0-indexed)\n   `q = deque()`\n   - Start BFS from 1 (`idx=0`): `color[0]=0`, `q.append(0)`\n   - Pop 0 (vertex 1):\n     - Neighbor 1 (vertex 2): `color[1]=-1`. Set `color[1]=1-color[0]=1`. `q.append(1)`\n     - Neighbor 2 (vertex 3): `color[2]=-1`. Set `color[2]=1-color[0]=1`. `q.append(2)`\n   - Pop 1 (vertex 2):\n     - Neighbor 0 (vertex 1): `color[0]=0`. `color[0] != color[1]`. OK.\n     - Neighbor 3 (vertex 4): `color[3]=-1`. Set `color[3]=1-color[1]=0`. `q.append(3)`\n   - Pop 2 (vertex 3):\n     - Neighbor 0 (vertex 1): `color[0]=0`. `color[0] != color[2]`. OK.\n     - Neighbor 3 (vertex 4): `color[3]=0`. `color[3] == color[2]` (1). **Odd cycle found!**\n   The edge `(3,4)` connects vertices with colors `color[3]=1` and `color[4]=0`. This is fine.\n   The problem is with `(3,4)` where `color[3]=1` and `color[4]=0`.\n   Let's check the graph: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n   This is a C4: 1-2-4-3-1. A C4 is an even cycle. This graph is bipartite.\n   `color[1]=0, color[2]=1, color[3]=1, color[4]=0`.\n   All edges connect different colors:\n   (1,2): 0-1 OK\n   (1,3): 0-1 OK\n   (4,2): 0-1 OK\n   (4,3): 0-1 OK\n   So the graph IS bipartite. `t=0` is not possible.\n\n2. **t=1 check:**\n   The graph is bipartite. One connected component.\n   `s_0 = {1, 4}` (`color[1]=0, color[4]=0`). `s_{0,1} = 2`.\n   `s_1 = {2, 3}` (`color[2]=1, color[3]=1`). `s_{1,1} = 2`.\n   `w_1 = s_{0,1} * (s_{0,1} - 1) / 2 + s_{1,1} * (s_{1,1} - 1) / 2`\n   `w_1 = 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 + 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n   So, `t=1, w=2`.\n   The two ways are adding `(1,4)` or adding `(2,3)`.\n   Output: `1 2`. Correct.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\n1. **t=0 check:**\n   `adj = {1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1, 2]}`\n   - Start BFS from 1: `color[1]=0, q.append(1)`\n   - Pop 1:\n     - Neighbor 2: `color[2]=-1`. Set `color[2]=1`. `q.append(2)`\n     - Neighbor 3: `color[3]=-1`. Set `color[3]=1`. `q.append(3)`\n   - Pop 2:\n     - Neighbor 1: `color[1]=0`. `color[1] != color[2]`. OK.\n     - Neighbor 3: `color[3]=1`. `color[3] == color[2]`. **Odd cycle found!** (Edge `(2,3)` connects same-colored vertices).\n   So, `t=0, w=1`.\n   Output: `0 1`. Correct.\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput:\n3 0\n\n1. **t=0 check:**\n   `adj = {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}`. No edges, so no cycles. Graph is bipartite. `t=0` not possible.\n\n2. **t=1 check:**\n   Components: {1}, {2}, {3}.\n   For {1}: `s_{0,1}=1, s_{1,1}=0`. Count = 0.\n   For {2}: `s_{0,2}=1, s_{1,2}=0`. Count = 0.\n   For {3}: `s_{0,3}=1, s_{1,3}=0`. Count = 0.\n   `w_1 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`. `t=1` not possible.\n\n3. **t=2 check:**\n   `w_1 = 0`. All components are isolated vertices or isolated edges.\n   `num_iso_vertices = 3` (vertices 1, 2, 3).\n   `num_edges = 0`.\n   Condition for `t=2` (`num_iso_vertices > 0` AND `num_edges > 0`) is not met.\n   Condition for `t=2` (`num_iso_vertices == 0` and `num_edges >= 2`) is not met.\n   So `t=2` not possible.\n\n4. **t=3 check:**\n   `n=3`.\n   `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6 = 3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1`.\n   So, `t=3, w=1`.
