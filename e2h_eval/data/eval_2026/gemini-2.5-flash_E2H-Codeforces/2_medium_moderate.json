Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the 'X' Pattern Checker**\n\nAlright, so I've been tasked with crafting a Python script to decipher if a given grid of characters forms a distinct \"X\" pattern, adhering to these rules: the characters along both diagonals must be identical, the characters outside the diagonals must be identical, and these two sets of characters must be different from each other. The key constraints are an odd grid size, a requirement for efficiency, and to consider edge cases.\n\nFirst, I had to solidify the algorithm, which hinges on a straightforward, nested-loop approach. Essentially, I read the grid into a data structure, initialized variables to hold the characters of the diagonals and non-diagonals, and set a flag to determine if the grid fits the \"X\" pattern. During iteration, I identified diagonals using a standard `i == j` or `i + j == n - 1` check. I'm storing the first encountered character and validating all subsequent characters against this initial value for each category (diagonals and non-diagonals). If I find a mismatch, I flipped the flag to `False` and break the current loops immediately for efficiency.\n\nAt the very end, once all elements have been checked (or a mismatch was found), I need to verify that if `is_x` is True, that the diagonal and non-diagonal characters are actually different from each other. If they are the same, it would not be an \"X\". The code must explicitly check this condition.\n\nIn testing the logic, I need to focus on edge cases with small grid sizes (like 3x3) and larger grid sizes to confirm all conditions are met and the code works. The algorithm, by nature, is O(N^2) in time complexity, and with N=300, this is plenty quick.\n\nI've made sure to explicitly comment the key steps to make it easy for others to understand the code.\n\nAll in all, it seems my approach is both efficient and thorough, meeting all of the requirements.\n",
