The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Rudolf and Snowflakes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (hard version)\" problem.  My initial thought is to break down the problem geometrically, visualizing how the snowflake is constructed. Let's see...\n\nFirst, we start with a single central vertex.  Then, we connect `k` new vertices to it, where `k` has to be greater than 1. So, after the first step, we have `1 + k` vertices. These new `k` vertices are only connected to the central one.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting.  We're going to repeat a process `d` times. In each iteration, every vertex that's only connected to one other vertex gets connected to `k` new vertices. Initially there are k such vertices. Thus each vertex generates k new vertices, so, in total k*k = k^2 new vertices are generated. Each time we repeat this step, we'll get another layer of `k` branches off each of the leaves in the previous layer.\n\nSo, if we repeat this 'branching' process `d` times, the total number of vertices will be `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d+1)`.  Let me call this `m`, where `m = d + 1`. Since the problem specifies that we have to do the branching *at least* once, so `d >= 1` and thus `m >= 2`.\n\nThat gives us a sum, a geometric series: `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. I have `n`, the total number of vertices, and now I need to figure out if there are integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2` that satisfy this equation.\n\nOkay, let's look at the constraints. `n` can be up to 10^18.  That's a pretty large number to deal with.  I'll start with the simplest case:\n\nIf `m = 2`, then the equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`. That makes this a quadratic equation: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.  I can use the quadratic formula to solve for `k`: `k = (-1 ± sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.  For `k` to be an integer and `> 1`, `4n - 3` must be a perfect square, and the result must be an integer >1. Further the perfect square must be odd, so the square root must be odd.\n\nFrom here, I'll need to develop the algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a \"snowflake\" graph. A snowflake is constructed as follows:\n1.  Start with 1 vertex (the center).\n2.  Connect `k` new vertices to the center (`k > 1`). Total vertices: `1 + k`.\n3.  Each vertex connected to only one other vertex is connected to `k` more new vertices. This step must be done at least once.\n\nLet's trace the number of vertices:\n*   Initial: 1 vertex.\n*   After step 2 (first application): `k` new vertices are added, total `1 + k`. These `k` vertices are leaves.\n*   After step 3 (first application): Each of the `k` leaves gets `k` new children. So, `k * k = k^2` new vertices are added. Total `1 + k + k^2`. These `k^2` vertices are now leaves.\n*   If step 3 is applied a second time: Each of the `k^2` leaves gets `k` new children. So, `k^2 * k = k^3` new vertices are added. Total `1 + k + k^2 + k^3`.\n\nIn general, if step 3 is applied `d` times (where `d >= 1`), the total number of vertices `n` will be:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d+1)`\n\nLet `m = d+1`. Since `d >= 1`, we have `m >= 2`.\nSo, we need to check if `n` can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m` for some integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2`.\n\nThe sum of this geometric series is `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. So, `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nWe can split this into two cases:\n\n**Case 1: `m = 2`**\nIn this case, `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nRearranging, we get `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula, `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4(1 - n))) / 2 = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be an integer greater than 1:\n1.  `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `s = sqrt(4n - 3)`.\n2.  `s` must be an integer.\n3.  `(-1 + s)` must be even and positive. Since `s^2 = 4n - 3` is odd, `s` must be odd. If `s` is odd, then `(-1 + s)` is even. We need `(-1 + s) / 2 > 1`, which means `s - 1 > 2`, or `s > 3`.\n    If `s=3`, then `4n-3=9`, `4n=12`, `n=3`. `k=(-1+3)/2=1`. But `k` must be `> 1`. So `n=3` is \"NO\".\n    For `n=13`, `4n-3 = 4*13-3 = 52-3 = 49 = 7^2`. So `s=7`. `k = (-1+7)/2 = 3`. Since `k=3 > 1`, `n=13` is a \"YES\".\n\n**Case 2: `m > 2` (i.e., `m >= 3`)**\nIn this case, `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`.\nSince `k >= 2` and `m >= 3`:\n*   `k^m < n`\n*   `n < 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m + k^(m+1) + ...` (if `k >= 2`)\n*   `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`\nFrom `k^m < n`, we know `k < n^(1/m)`.\nAlso, `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m > k^m`. So `k < n^(1/m)`.\nAnd `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m < 1 + k + ... + k^m + k^(m+1) + ... = 1/(1-k)` (for large k, this is not useful).\nA tighter lower bound for `n` is `k^m`.\nA tighter upper bound for `n`: `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\nFor `k >= 2`, `k-1 >= 1`. So `n <= k^(m+1) - 1`.\nThus, `k^m < n < k^(m+1)`.\nThis implies `k < n^(1/m)` and `k > n^(1/(m+1))`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `m`:\nIf `k=2`, `n = 2^(m+1) - 1`. Since `n <= 10^18`, `2^(m+1) - 1 <= 10^18`.\n`2^(m+1) <= 10^18 + 1`.\n`m+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1) approx 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.32 approx 59.79`.\nSo `m+1 <= 59`. This means `m <= 58`.\nSince `m >= 3`, we only need to iterate `m` from `3` to `58`.\n\nFor each `m` in this range:\nWe need to find an integer `k > 1` such that `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m`.\nWe know `k > n^(1/(m+1))`. Let `k_low = floor(n^(1/(m+1)))`.\nWe also know `k < n^(1/m)`. Let `k_high = ceil(n^(1/m))`.\nThe search range for `k` is `[max(2, k_low), k_high + 1]`.\nSince `n^(1/m)` will be small for large `m`, the range for `k` is typically small.\nFor example, for `m=3`, `k_high = ceil(n^(1/3))`. For `n=10^18`, `k_high = ceil((10^18)^(1/3)) = ceil(10^6) = 10^6`.\nThis means for each `m`, we might iterate `k` up to `10^6`.\nThe total number of iterations for `k` would be about `56 * 10^6`, which is too slow (approx `5 * 10^7` iterations, each involving `m` multiplications, making it `5 * 10^7 * 50` operations).\n\nA better approach for finding `k` for a fixed `m`:\nSince `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m`, we can use binary search for `k`.\nThe function `f(k) = 1 + k + ... + k^m` is strictly increasing for `k > 1`.\nThe search range for `k` is `[2, N_max_k]`.\n`N_max_k = floor(n^(1/m)) + 2` is a safe upper bound (e.g., for `m=3`, `k` can be up to `10^6`).\nThe binary search will take `log(N_max_k)` steps.\nFor `m=3`, `log(10^6)` is about 20.\nTotal complexity: `56 * 20` (for binary search) `* m` (for power calculation inside `f(k)`).\nStill too slow if `m` is large. Summing `1+k+...+k^m` takes `O(m)` time.\nWe can compute `k^m` and `k^(m+1)` using `pow(k, m)` and `pow(k, m+1)` which might be `O(log m)` or `O(m)` depending on implementation.\nA better way to calculate `1 + k + ... + k^m` is `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)`. This takes `O(log(m+1))` for `k^(m+1)` and then division.\n\nSo, for each `m` from `3` to `58`:\n1.  Binary search for `k` in the range `[2, 10^18^(1/3) + 2]` (a safe upper bound, `10^6 + 2` for `m=3`, smaller for larger `m`).\n2.  In binary search, for a candidate `k_mid`, calculate `val = (k_mid^(m+1) - 1) / (k_mid - 1)`.\n    *   Need to handle potential overflow if `k_mid^(m+1)` exceeds `10^18`. If `k_mid` is large enough that `k_mid^m` already exceeds `n`, then `k_mid` is too large.\n    *   A safer check: if `k_mid > n^(1/m) + 1`, then `k_mid^m > n`, so `val > n`.\n    *   More precisely, for a given `k`, calculate `current_sum = 1`. Then loop `i` from `1` to `m`, `current_sum = current_sum * k + 1`. Check for overflow at each step (`current_sum > n / k` before multiplication, or `current_sum > n` after addition). This takes `O(m)` time.\n    *   Using `pow(k_mid, m+1)` directly might be faster if it's optimized for large exponents and handles overflow implicitly (Python integers handle arbitrary size, but `pow` might be slow for huge intermediate results).\n    *   A simple `O(m)` loop with overflow check:\n        `current_sum = 1`\n        `term_k = 1`\n        `for _ in range(m):`\n            `if n / k < term_k: current_sum = n + 1; break` (check for `term_k * k` overflow)\n            `term_k *= k`\n            `if n - term_k < current_sum: current_sum = n + 1; break` (check for `current_sum + term_k` overflow)\n            `current_sum += term_k`\n        `return current_sum`\n        This `O(m)` check inside binary search is `56 * 20 * 58`, which is `64960`, fast enough.\n\nLet's refine the binary search bounds for `k`.\nFor `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m`:\n*   `k^m < n` implies `k < n^(1/m)`.\n*   `1 + k + ... + k^m < (k^(m+1))/(k-1)`.\n    If `k=2`, `n = 2^(m+1) - 1`.\n    If `k > 2`, `n < k^(m+1) / (k-1)`. Since `k-1 >= 1`, this is `n < k^(m+1)`.\n    So `k > n^(1/(m+1))`.\nThe search range for `k` is `[2, floor(n^(1/m)) + 2]`. This is small enough.\nFor `m=3`, `k_max = floor((10^18)^(1/3)) + 2 = 10^6 + 2`.\nFor `m=58`, `k_max = floor((10^18)^(1/58)) + 2`. `10^(18/58) = 10^(9/29) approx 10^(0.31) approx 2.04`. So `k_max` is small (e.g., 2 or 3).\n\n**Combined Strategy:**\n1.  Initialize `found = False`.\n2.  **Check `m = 2` case:**\n    Calculate `val = 4n - 3`.\n    If `val >= 0`, calculate `s = int(val**0.5)`.\n    If `s*s == val` and `s > 3` and `(s - 1) % 2 == 0`:\n        `k = (s - 1) // 2`. If `k > 1`, set `found = True`.\n3.  **Check `m >= 3` cases:**\n    Iterate `m` from `3` up to `58` (or `60` for safety).\n    For each `m`:\n        Define `check(k)` function:\n        `current_sum = 1`\n        `term_k_power = 1`\n        `for _ in range(m):`\n            `if term_k_power > n // k: return n + 1` (potential overflow for `term_k_power * k`)\n            `term_k_power *= k`\n            `if current_sum > n - term_k_power: return n + 1` (potential overflow for `current_sum + term_k_power`)\n            `current_sum += term_k_power`\n        `return current_sum`\n\n        Binary search for `k` in range `[2, high_k_bound]`.\n        `high_k_bound = int(n**(1/m)) + 2` (e.g., `10^6 + 2` for `m=3`, smaller for larger `m`).\n        `low = 2`, `high = high_k_bound`.\n        While `low <= high`:\n            `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n            `res = check(mid)`\n            If `res == n`: `found = True; break`\n            If `res < n`: `low = mid + 1`\n            Else (`res > n`): `high = mid - 1`\n        If `found` is `True`, break from `m` loop.\n\n4.  Print \"YES\" if `found`, \"NO` otherwise.\n\nEdge cases:\n`n=1`: `1 = 1 + k + ...`. Smallest `n` is `1+k+k^2`. For `k=2`, `n=7`. So `n=1,2,3,4,5,6` are \"NO\".\n`n=1` is `NO` because `k>1` and `m>=2` means `n >= 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7`.\nThe problem states `k > 1`.\nThe smallest snowflake has `m=2` and `k=2`, which gives `n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7`.\nSo `n < 7` should always be \"NO\".\n\nLet's test `n=1`: `4*1-3 = 1`. `s=1`. `s>3` is false. So `m=2` gives `NO`.\nFor `m>=3`, `k^m < n`. `2^3 < 1` is false. So `m>=3` gives `NO`. Correct.\n\nFinal considerations for `high_k_bound`:\n`k^m < n`. So `k < n^(1/m)`.\n`k_max_val = int(n**(1/m)) + 2` is a good upper bound.
