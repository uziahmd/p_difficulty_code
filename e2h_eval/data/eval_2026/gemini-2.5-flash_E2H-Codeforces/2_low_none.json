Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Valera and X\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"Valera and X\" problem. It's a classic competitive programming scenario, and I need to write a Python script to solve it. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and output. The input is an odd integer 'n' and an n x n grid of lowercase letters. The output is either \"YES\" if the grid forms an \"X\" according to specific rules, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear: all letters on the diagonals must be the same, all other letters must be the same, and these two sets of letters must be different from each other.\n\nI can represent the grid as a 2D list of characters, `grid[row][col]`.  The diagonals are identified by the conditions `row == col` (main diagonal) and `row + col == n - 1` (anti-diagonal).\n\nNow for the algorithm. I'll start by reading in the input, the value of `n`, and the grid.\n\nThen, I'll select a character that represents the diagonals. I can get this by taking the element `grid[0][0]` which is on the main diagonal. Let's call this `diag_char`.\n\nNext, I'll choose a non-diagonal character which will be `other_char`. I can use `grid[0][1]` since `n` is always greater than or equal to 3.\n\nI need to make sure `diag_char` and `other_char` are different, as per Rule 3. If they are equal, it's an immediate \"NO\".\n\nNow, I'll iterate through every cell in the grid. For each cell, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it is, its value must match `diag_char`. If the cell is not on a diagonal, its value must match `other_char`. If I encounter any mismatch, I can immediately print \"NO\" and exit.\n\nIf I get through the entire grid without finding a mismatch, it means the grid forms a valid \"X\", so I'll print \"YES\".\n\nI could work through a small example to make sure this all makes sense. If `n=3` and the input grid is `[\"wsw\", \"sws\", \"wsw\"]`, the main diagonal will be `w`, and the non-diagonal elements will be `s`.  All elements on the main diagonal are w, and all other elements are s. And w!=s so the answer should be YES.  That seems solid!\n\nNow, it's time to code this up in Python.\n",
