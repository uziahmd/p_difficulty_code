He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The task is to maximize profit over *k* days by assigning a set of *n* problems with varying difficulties. The profit for a day is the highest difficulty of the problems solved that day, and the overall goal is to maximize the sum of these daily profits.\n\nThe constraints are pretty standard - limits on *n*, *k*, and difficulty values. I need to output the maximum profit possible and the distribution of problems for each day.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the problem into key components. We are essentially partitioning the *n* problems into *k* continuous sub-segments. Each day has to solve at least one problem, and we cannot skip any. This means the number of problems solved on each day, which I'll denote as `t_1`, `t_2`, ... `t_k`, has to sum up to *n*.\n\nTo maximize the overall profit, I should concentrate on making the daily maximum difficulties as large as possible. If I focus on using the *k* largest difficulties from the entire list and make them the maximums on each day, then I can achieve the highest possible profit, because any other choice of problems would have a smaller daily maximum. The sum of these *k* largest difficulties will give me the absolute maximum possible.\n\nSo, the strategy is this:\n\n1.  Identify the *k* largest difficulties from the given list.\n2.  Sum those *k* difficulties - this will be the maximum profit.\n3.  Now, the crucial part is partitioning the problems into *k* segments, ensuring that each of those *k* largest difficulties is the maximum of its segment.\n\nThe tricky part of this strategy is, knowing how to create valid sub-segments such that those maximum values occur, and that the order is maintained.\n\nLet me take an example to make this concrete: if the original list is something like `[5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` with `k=3`. The three largest difficulties are `9, 6, 5`. We need to construct three segments, each of which has one of these values as the max.\n\nI'm thinking dynamic programming *might* work here, but let's see. This seems like a promising approach, let's explore this idea further. I need to make sure I consider all possible valid segmentations and select the one that generates the optimal partition.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into `k` contiguous segments (days). Each day must have at least one problem. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits. We need to output this maximum total profit and the number of problems solved each day.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we should aim to make the `k` largest difficulties in the entire list `a` be the maximums for each of the `k` days. If we can achieve this, the total profit will be the sum of these `k` largest difficulties. This sum is the absolute maximum possible, because any other set of `k` daily maximums would involve at least one problem with a difficulty smaller than one of these `k` largest, leading to a smaller or equal sum.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties**: Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, index)` for all problems. Sort this list in descending order of difficulty. Take the first `k` elements. These represent the `k` problems with the largest difficulties.\n2.  **Calculate maximum total profit**: Sum the difficulties of these `k` problems. This is our maximum total profit.\n3.  **Determine day boundaries**: The `k` problems identified in step 1 must each fall into a different day segment and act as that day's maximum. To ensure they act as maximums and define day boundaries, we can use their original indices. Collect the original indices of these `k` problems. Sort these indices in ascending order. Let these sorted indices be `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k`.\n4.  **Construct the partition**:\n    *   The first day will end at problem `idx_1`. So, it will solve `idx_1 + 1` problems.\n    *   The second day will start right after `idx_1` and end at `idx_2`. So, it will solve `idx_2 - idx_1` problems.\n    *   In general, the `j`-th day (for `j > 1`) will start right after `idx_{j-1}` and end at `idx_j`. It will solve `idx_j - idx_{j-1}` problems.\n    *   The last day (`k`-th day) will start right after `idx_{k-1}` and solve all remaining problems until `n-1`. So, it will solve `n - idx_{k-1}` problems.\n\n    This partitioning ensures that each of the `k` chosen problems `a[idx_j]` falls into a distinct day. Since these `k` problems are the largest difficulties overall, `a[idx_j]` will be the maximum for its respective day.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Problems with difficulties and indices**:\n    `(5, 0), (4, 1), (2, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6), (2, 7)`\n\n2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending) and take top `k=3`**:\n    *   `(9, 6)`\n    *   `(6, 3)`\n    *   `(5, 0)` (or `(5, 4)`, either is fine. Let's pick `(5, 0)`)\n    The `k` largest difficulties are `9, 6, 5`.\n\n3.  **Maximum total profit**: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n4.  **Original indices of these `k` problems**: `6, 3, 0`.\n\n5.  **Sort these indices**: `0, 3, 6`. These are `idx_1=0, idx_2=3, idx_3=6`.\n\n6.  **Calculate problems per day**:\n    *   Day 1: ends at `idx_1=0`. Problems: `a[0]`. Number of problems: `0 + 1 = 1`.\n        (This is `a[0]` itself. The segment is `[5]`. Max is `5`.)\n    *   Day 2: starts after `idx_1=0`, ends at `idx_2=3`. Problems: `a[1], a[2], a[3]`. Number of problems: `3 - 0 = 3`.\n        (The segment is `[4, 2, 6]`. Max is `6`.)\n    *   Day 3: starts after `idx_2=3`, ends at `n-1=7`. Problems: `a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]`. Number of problems: `8 - 3 = 5`.\n        (The segment is `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max is `9`.)\n\n    The problem counts are `[1, 3, 5]`. The example output is `[3, 2, 3]`. This shows that my choice of `(5,0)` vs `(5,4)` matters. The strategy is robust, but the exact indices chosen for ties can lead to different valid partitions. Let's re-evaluate the day boundary calculation more precisely for the example output.\n\n    The example output `[3, 2, 3]` means:\n    *   Day 1: `[5, 4, 2]` (max 5)\n    *   Day 2: `[6, 5]` (max 6)\n    *   Day 3: `[1, 9, 2]` (max 9)\n    The maximums are `5, 6, 9`. These are indeed the `k=3` largest values.\n    The indices of these maximums in the original array are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`.\n    Sorted indices: `0, 3, 6`.\n\n    Let's refine the day boundary calculation:\n    The `k` problems with largest difficulties are `a[idx_1], a[idx_2], \\dots, a[idx_k]` (sorted by index).\n    These `k` problems must be the *last* problem of `k-1` days, and the `k`-th problem can be anywhere in the last day.\n    More simply, these `k` problems define `k` \"break points\" or \"anchor points\".\n    We need `k-1` cuts to divide `n` problems into `k` segments.\n    The `k-1` cuts must be placed *after* `k-1` of these `k` problems.\n    To ensure each segment has at least one problem, and all `n` problems are covered, we can place cuts right after `k-1` of the chosen indices.\n    The `k` largest difficulties are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`. Their indices are `0, 3, 6`.\n    We need `k-1 = 2` cuts. We can place cuts after `idx_1` and `idx_2`.\n    The `k-1` smallest indices among the chosen `k` indices will be the points *before* which we make a cut.\n    Indices: `0, 3, 6`.\n    We need `k-1=2` cuts. The first `k-1` sorted indices are `0, 3`.\n    *   First cut after index `0`. Problems: `a[0]`. Segment length: `0 - (-1) = 1`.\n    *   Second cut after index `3`. Problems: `a[1 \\dots 3]`. Segment length: `3 - 0 = 3`.\n    *   Remaining problems: `a[4 \\dots 7]`. Segment length: `7 - 3 = 4`.\n    This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. Total profit 20. This is a valid answer.\n\n    The example output `[3, 2, 3]` implies cuts after index `2` and index `4`.\n    `a[0]=5, a[1]=4, a[2]=2` (max 5) -> index of max is 0\n    `a[3]=6, a[4]=5` (max 6) -> index of max is 3\n    `a[5]=1, a[6]=9, a[7]=2` (max 9) -> index of max is 6\n    This means the cuts are placed after `a[2]` and `a[4]`. The indices of the *maximums* are `0, 3, 6`.\n    The indices of the *cuts* are `2, 4`.\n    The strategy should be:\n    1. Find the `k` largest values and their indices.\n    2. Sum these `k` values for the total profit.\n    3. Take the `k-1` smallest indices among these `k` chosen indices. These are the positions *after* which we make a cut.\n    4. Sort these `k-1` cut positions.\n    5. Calculate segment lengths:\n        *   `t_1 = (first cut position) + 1`\n        *   `t_j = (j-th cut position) - ( (j-1)-th cut position )` for `j` from 2 to `k-1`\n        *   `t_k = n - ( (k-1)-th cut position )`\n\n    Let's re-run Example 1 with this refined strategy:\n    `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n    1.  **Problems with difficulties and indices**:\n        `[(5, 0), (4, 1), (2, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6), (2, 7)]`\n\n    2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending)**:\n        `[(9, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 4), (4, 1), (2, 2), (2, 7), (1, 5)]`\n\n    3.  **Take top `k=3`**:\n        `[(9, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0)]`\n        Difficulties: `9, 6, 5`. Indices: `6, 3, 0`.\n\n    4.  **Maximum total profit**: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n    5.  **Indices of cuts**: We need `k-1 = 2` cuts. We take the `k-1` smallest indices from `{0, 3, 6}`. These are `0, 3`.\n        These are 0-indexed positions. A cut *after* position `p` means the first segment ends at `p`.\n\n    6.  **Calculate problems per day**:\n        *   `cut_indices = [0, 3]` (sorted indices of the chosen `k` problems, excluding the largest one, or simply the first `k-1` smallest indices)\n        *   `t_1 = cut_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n        *   `t_2 = cut_indices[1] - cut_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`\n        *   `t_3 = n - cut_indices[1] - 1 = 8 - 3 - 1 = 4` (This is `n - (last cut index + 1)`. Or `n - (last cut position + 1)` problems from the previous cut.)\n        This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. This is a valid output.\n\n    The crucial part is that the problem statement says \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\" So `[1, 3, 4]` is a perfectly valid solution, even if it differs from the example's `[3, 2, 3]`. The total profit `20` is correct.\n\nLet's implement this refined strategy:\n1.  Read `n, k`.\n2.  Read `a`.\n3.  Create a list of `(difficulty, original_index)` pairs.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order of difficulty. If difficulties are equal, the order doesn't matter for total profit, but for cut points, it might slightly change the output. Sorting by index for ties might be stable.\n5.  Select the top `k` problems. Sum their difficulties for `max_profit`.\n6.  Extract the original indices of these `k` problems.\n7.  Sort these `k` indices in ascending order.\n8.  The `k-1` cut points are `indices[0], indices[1], ..., indices[k-2]`.\n9.  Calculate `t_j` values:\n    *   `current_idx = -1` (represents the end of the previous segment, conceptually before problem 0)\n    *   For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        *   `t_j = indices[j] - current_idx`\n        *   `current_idx = indices[j]`\n    *   `t_{k-1} = n - 1 - current_idx` (remaining problems for the last day)\n    *   Store these `t_j` values.\n\nLet's trace Example 1 again with this logic:\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n1. `(difficulty, index)` pairs: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2. Sorted by difficulty (descending), then by index (ascending for stability in ties):\n   `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3. Top `k=3`: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n   `max_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n4. Original indices of these `k` problems: `[6, 3, 0]`\n5. Sort these indices: `[0, 3, 6]`\n6. `t` values:\n   `current_idx = -1`\n   `cut_points = [0, 3]` (the first `k-1` sorted indices)\n   *   `j=0`: `t_0 = cut_points[0] - current_idx = 0 - (-1) = 1`. `current_idx = 0`.\n   *   `j=1`: `t_1 = cut_points[1] - current_idx = 3 - 0 = 3`. `current_idx = 3`.\n   *   Last day: `t_2 = n - 1 - current_idx = 7 - 3 = 4`.\n   Resulting `t` list: `[1, 3, 4]`. This matches my previous derivation and is a correct answer.\n\nFinal check on constraints: `1 <= k <= n <= 2000`.\nSorting `n` elements takes `O(N log N)`.\nExtracting `k` elements and sorting `k` indices takes `O(k log k)`.\nCalculating `t` values takes `O(k)`.\nOverall time complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N=2000`, `N log N` is roughly `2000 * 11 = 22000`, which is very efficient.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for storing pairs and indices.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) pairs\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order.\n    # For ties in difficulty, the original index doesn't matter for the total profit,\n    # but it can affect which specific problems are chosen, and thus the cut points.\n    # Sorting by index for ties ensures a deterministic output, though any valid one is fine.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))\n\n    # Step 3: Select the top k problems (those with the largest difficulties)\n    top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the maximum total profit\n    max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n\n    # Step 5: Get the original indices of these top k problems\n    # These indices will define our day boundaries\n    chosen_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 6: Determine the number of problems solved each day\n    # We need k-1 cuts.
