            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Finding the Minimum Draws for a Mentsu**\n\nMy objective here is to determine the least number of additional tiles I need to draw from a hand of three tiles to form a valid mentsu, which is either a koutsu (three identical tiles, like [1m, 1m, 1m]) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbered tiles of the same suit, like [1m, 2m, 3m]).  I'm approaching this by systematically analyzing the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, I examine if I can achieve a mentsu with the initial three tiles. I check for a koutsu by ensuring all three tiles are identical. For a shuntsu, I verify that all three tiles are from the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence. If either a koutsu or shuntsu is present right away, the answer is zero draws.\n\nIf zero draws don't work, I investigate if drawing one tile would suffice.  To do this, I look for a pair among the original tiles that, when combined with a specific new tile, could form a mentsu.  I go through all pairs of tiles and check for two specific scenarios.  First, if any two tiles are identical, drawing one more of that tile completes a koutsu.  Second, if the two tiles are from the same suit, and their numbers differ by one or two, drawing a specific tile creates a shuntsu. For example, if I have [1m, 2m], drawing a 3m completes a shuntsu. If any of these conditions are met, the answer is one draw.\n\nIf neither zero nor one draw leads to a mentsu, I conclude that two draws are always sufficient. Regardless of the original three tiles, I can always draw two more of any tile to complete a koutsu (for example, take the first tile and draw two copies of it, completing a koutsu with the first one from the initial three-tile hand). Or, if they are from the same suit, if I draw a suitable tile that complete a sequence, I am good too.\n\nTo make the code more efficient, I sort the input tiles by number (if they're the same suit) and check a series of cases based on the number and suit of the tiles.  This way, I can quickly determine the minimum number of draws needed. The final decision is either zero, one, or two draws to form at least one mentsu.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nWe need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are required. The maximum number of draws needed will be 2, because she can always pick any tile she already has (say, `X`) and draw two more `X` tiles to form a koutsu `[X, X, X]`. Therefore, the answer will always be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nThe strategy is to check these possibilities in increasing order:\n1. Can a mentsu be formed with 0 draws?\n2. If not, can a mentsu be formed with 1 draw?\n3. If not, the answer must be 2.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`, where `number` is an integer from 1 to 9, and `suit` is 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n\n**Step 1: Parse Input and Prepare Tiles**\nRead the three tile strings, convert them into `(int, str)` tuples, and store them in a list. It's beneficial to sort this list to simplify checks for sequences. Python's default tuple sorting will sort by the first element (number), then by the second (suit).\n\n**Step 2: Check for 0 Draws**\nWith the three initial tiles `t1, t2, t3`:\n*   **Koutsu:** Check if all three tiles are identical (`t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`).\n*   **Shuntsu:** Check if all three tiles are of the same suit AND their numbers form a sequence (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`). Since the tiles are sorted, this means `t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]` and `t2[0] == t1[0] + 1` and `t3[0] == t2[0] + 1`.\nIf either condition is met, print `0` and exit.\n\n**Step 3: Check for 1 Draw**\nIf 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if one draw can form a mentsu. This means we need to find two of the original tiles that can form a mentsu with one additional drawn tile.\n\n*   **Koutsu with 1 Draw:** If any two of the initial three tiles are identical, we can draw a third identical tile to form a koutsu. For example, if the hand is `[1m, 1m, 5s]`, we can draw another `1m` to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`. We can check this by counting the occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears 2 or more times, print `1` and exit.\n\n*   **Shuntsu with 1 Draw:** We need to find two tiles `(nx, sx)` and `(ny, sy)` from the original hand such that they are of the same suit and their numbers differ by 1 or 2.\n    *   If `sx == sy` and `abs(nx - ny) == 1` (e.g., `[1m, 2m]`): We can draw `(nx-1, sx)` (if `nx > 1`) or `(ny+1, sy)` (if `ny < 9`). For example, `[1m, 2m, 5s]` can form `[1m, 2m, 3m]` by drawing `3m`.\n    *   If `sx == sy` and `abs(nx - ny) == 2` (e.g., `[1m, 3m]`): We can draw `(min(nx,ny)+1, sx)`. For example, `[1m, 3m, 5s]` can form `[1m, 2m, 3m]` by drawing `2m`.\n    \n    We iterate through all possible pairs of tiles from the initial hand (there are three such pairs). If any pair satisfies these conditions, print `1` and exit. The condition `abs(nx - ny) <= 2` covers both `abs(nx - ny) == 1` and `abs(nx - ny) == 2`. Note that `abs(nx - ny) == 0` implies identical tiles, which is already covered by the \"Koutsu with 1 Draw\" check.\n\n**Step 4: If 2 Draws are Needed**\nIf neither 0 draws nor 1 draw is sufficient, it means we need 2 draws. As explained earlier, 2 draws are always enough (e.g., by drawing two copies of any existing tile to form a koutsu). Print `2` and exit.\n\n**Example Trace: `3p 9m 2p`**\n\n1.  **Parse and Sort:**\n    `tiles = [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n    `sorted_tiles = [(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws:**\n    *   Koutsu: `(2, 'p') == (3, 'p')` is false.\n    *   Shuntsu: Suits are not all the same (`'p'`, `'p'`, `'m'`).\n    *   Result: 0 draws not possible.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw:**\n    *   **Koutsu with 1 Draw:**\n        `counts = Counter({(2, 'p'): 1, (3, 'p'): 1, (9, 'm'): 1})`.\n        `any(c >= 2 for c in counts.values())` is false (all counts are 1).\n    *   **Shuntsu with 1 Draw:**\n        Let `t0=(2, 'p')`, `t1=(3, 'p')`, `t2=(9, 'm')`.\n        *   Pair `(t0, t1)`: Suits are same (`'p'`). Numbers are `2, 3`. `3 - 2 = 1`. Since `1 <= 2`, this pair can form a shuntsu with one draw (e.g., drawing `1p` or `4p`).\n        *   Result: Print `1` and exit.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tile_strings = line.split()\n\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tile_strings:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Sort tiles for easier sequence checking.\n    # Default tuple sorting (by first element, then second) is suitable.\n    sorted_tiles = sorted(tiles)\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu can be formed immediately from the three tiles.\n\n    # Case 1: Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    # If all three tiles are identical.\n    if sorted_tiles[0] == sorted_tiles[1] and sorted_tiles[1] == sorted_tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    # Check if all suits are the same AND numbers form a sequence (n, n+1, n+2).\n    if sorted_tiles[0][1] == sorted_tiles[1][1] and sorted_tiles[1][1] == sorted_tiles[2][1]:\n        n1 = sorted_tiles[0][0]\n        n2 = sorted_tiles[1][0]\n        n3 = sorted_tiles[2][0]\n        if n2 == n1 + 1 and n3 == n2 + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We need to form a mentsu using two of the original tiles and one new tile.\n\n    # Option A: Koutsu with 1 draw\n    # If any two tiles are identical, we can draw a third identical tile to form a koutsu.\n    # Use a Counter to easily check frequencies of tiles.\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    if any(c >= 2 for c in counts.values()):\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Option B: Shuntsu with 1 draw\n    # If any two tiles (tx, ty) are of the same suit and their numbers are close enough\n    # to form a shuntsu with one additional tile.\n    # Specifically, if num(ty) - num(tx) is 1 (e.g., 1m 2m, need 3m or 0m)\n    # or 2 (e.g., 1m 3m, need 2m).\n    \n    # Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the hand.\n    # There are 3 tiles, so 3 pairs: (t0, t1), (t0, t2), (t1, t2).\n    # Using `sorted_tiles` ensures numbers are in ascending order for same-suit pairs.\n    \n    t0, t1, t2 = sorted_tiles\n\n    # Check pair (t0, t1)\n    if t0[1] == t1[1]: # Same suit\n        # Check if numbers are 1 or 2 apart\n        # If diff is 0, it means t0 and t1 are identical, already covered by koutsu check (any(c>=2))\n        if t1[0] - t0[0] <= 2: \n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Check pair (t0, t2)\n    if t0[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n        if t2[0] - t0[0] <= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Check pair (t1, t2)\n    if t1[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n        if t2[0] - t1[0] <= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # --- If neither 0 nor 1 draw, then 2 draws are always sufficient ---\n    # For example, pick any tile from the hand (e.g., the first tile) and draw two more of it\n    # to form a koutsu.
