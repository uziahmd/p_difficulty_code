    "thought": "**Problem Solving Process: Counting Permutations with Lexicographical and Inversion Constraints**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm trying to figure out how many pairs of permutations, `p` and `q`, exist where `p` is smaller than `q` lexicographically *and* has more inversions than `q`. The size of the permutations, `n`, can go up to 500. Modulo `mod`.\n\nInitially, my thought was to brute-force all pairs, but that's a non-starter; it's `(n!)^2` possibilities. Then, I considered three inversion scenarios: `inv(p) > inv(q)`, `inv(p) < inv(q)`, and `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n\nI started breaking things down. Let `A` be the pairs we want (lexicographically smaller and more inversions), `B` be the pairs where `p < q` but `inv(p) < inv(q)`, and `C` be the pairs where `p < q` and inversion counts are equal. I realized the total pairs where `p < q` is `((n!)^2 - n!) / 2`.  And by symmetry, there are as many cases of `p < q` as `q < p`.\n\nI looked at the total pairs with `inv(p) > inv(q)`, let's call it `N_gt`.  Since inversions are symmetric, `N_gt = N_lt`, where `N_lt` is the number of pairs with `inv(p) < inv(q)`. This is a crucial observation. Now the equation I had was `2N_gt + N_eq = (n!)^2`.\n\nI'm trying to find `A`, so it's `A + B + C = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2`. It felt related to counting the `inv` of each permutation. Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `1..i` with `j` inversions. Then `inv_counts[i][j]` can be computed in `O(N^3)`. Then I could get `N_eq`. This is the right approach.\n\nThen the problem became calculating `C` (number of pairs with same inversion).  `C = (N_eq - n!) / 2`. Still not `A`.\n\nMy goal is `sum_{p<q, inv(p)>inv(q)} 1`.  This equals `N_gt - sum_{p>q, inv(p)>inv(q)} 1`.  I then realized that `N_gt = A + B` where `p < q`, but I want only `A`.\n\nDigit DP seemed to be a good approach since it deals with lexicographical order by building permutations from left to right. But, using a 4-dimensional `dp[i][inv_p_current][inv_q_current][lex_state]` to keep track of inversions and the lexicographical state seemed like a massive memory and time issue.\n\nTrying to track the *difference* in inversions, with the DP state `dp[i][diff][lex_state]`, didn't seem to work, because the *exact* numbers, and their relative order, matter for inversions.\n\nFinally, I got a breakthrough! `inv_counts[i][j]` is good to keep track of inversion counts, with `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] - dp[i-1][j-i]` with the prefix sum trick. Then, the number of pairs with a difference is `dp[n][j_offset]` for `j_offset = inv(p) - inv(q) + i*(i-1)/2`. And after computing `N_eq`, I could get to my target `A`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, 2, \\ldots, n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` AND the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to output the answer modulo `mod`.\n\nLet `inv(perm)` denote the number of inversions in a permutation `perm`.\nLet `N_total = (n!)^2` be the total number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations.\n\nWe can categorize pairs `(p, q)` based on two criteria:\n1. Lexicographical comparison: `p <_lex q`, `q <_lex p`, or `p = q`.\n2. Inversion count comparison: `inv(p) > inv(q)`, `inv(p) < inv(q)`, or `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n\nLet `ans` be the value we want to find: `ans = \\sum_{p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\n\nConsider the total number of pairs `(p, q)` where `inv(p) > inv(q)`. Let this be `N_gt_inv`.\nBy symmetry, the number of pairs `(p, q)` where `inv(p) < inv(q)` is `N_gt_inv`.\nLet `N_eq_inv` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` where `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\nThe sum of these three categories covers all pairs: `2 \\cdot N_gt_inv + N_eq_inv = N_total`.\nThus, `N_gt_inv = (N_total - N_eq_inv) / 2`.\n\nTo calculate `N_eq_inv`, we first need the number of permutations of `n` elements with `k` inversions. Let `inv_counts[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions.\nThe maximum number of inversions for `i` elements is `i(i-1)/2`.\nThe recurrence for `inv_counts[i][j]` is:\n`inv_counts[i][j] = \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} inv_counts[i-1][j-k]`.\nThis can be optimized using prefix sums:\n`inv_counts[i][j] = (inv_counts[i][j-1] + inv_counts[i-1][j] - inv_counts[i-1][j-i]) \\pmod{mod}`.\nBase case: `inv_counts[0][0] = 1`. All other `inv_counts[0][j] = 0`.\nThe maximum `j` is `n(n-1)/2`. For `n=500`, this is `124750`.\nThis table can be computed in `O(n \\cdot n(n-1)/2) = O(n^3)` time.\n`N_eq_inv = \\sum_{k=0}^{n(n-1)/2} (inv_counts[n][k])^2 \\pmod{mod}`.\nAfter computing `inv_counts[n][k]` for all `k`, `N_eq_inv` can be found in `O(n^2)` time.\n\nNow we have `N_gt_inv`. This counts pairs `(p, q)` where `inv(p) > inv(q)`. These pairs can be further classified by lexicographical order:\n`N_gt_inv = \\sum_{p <_lex q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 + \\sum_{q <_lex p, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 + \\sum_{p=q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nThe last term is 0 because `p=q` implies `inv(p)=inv(q)`.\nSo, `N_gt_inv = ans + \\sum_{q <_lex p, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`.\nLet `A = ans`. Let `B = \\sum_{q <_lex p, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1`. So `N_gt_inv = A + B`.\n\nConsider the total number of pairs `(p, q)` where `p <_lex q`. This is `(N_total - n!) / 2`.\nLet `C = \\sum_{p <_lex q, inv(p) < inv(q)} 1`.\nLet `D = \\sum_{p <_lex q, inv(p) = inv(q)} 1`.\nThen `A + C + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`.\n\nBy swapping `p` and `q`, we can see that `B = C`.\n(If `q <_lex p` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`, then swapping gives `p' <_lex q'` and `inv(q') > inv(p')`, which is `inv(p') < inv(q')`.)\nSo, `N_gt_inv = A + C`.\nSubstituting `C = N_gt_inv - A` into `A + C + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`:\n`A + (N_gt_inv - A) + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`\n`N_gt_inv + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`.\nThis gives `D = (N_total - n!) / 2 - N_gt_inv`.\nSubstitute `N_gt_inv = (N_total - N_eq_inv) / 2`:\n`D = (N_total - n!) / 2 - (N_total - N_eq_inv) / 2 = (N_eq_inv - n!) / 2`.\nThis `D` is the number of pairs `(p, q)` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n\nNow we have `N_gt_inv` and `D`. We want `A`.\n`A + C + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`.\n`A + (N_gt_inv - A) + D = (N_total - n!) / 2`.\nThis is just an identity. It doesn't help find A.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the sum of inversion counts is symmetric. For any permutation `p`, if `inv(p)` is its inversion count, then `inv(p_rev)` (where `p_rev` is `p` reversed) is `n(n-1)/2 - inv(p)`.\nHowever, `p_rev` is not necessarily related to `p` lexicographically.\n\nLet's use a dynamic programming approach to calculate `ans` directly.\n`dp[i][j][k]` will be the number of pairs of permutations `(p_suffix, q_suffix)` of `i` elements (representing the remaining `i` elements from `1..n`) such that `inv(p_suffix) - inv(q_suffix) = j` and `p_suffix` is lexicographically smaller than `q_suffix`.\nThis is not quite right. When we say \"permutations of `i` elements\", we mean `1..i`. But the actual values matter.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, ..., i` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`j` ranges from `-i(i-1)/2` to `i(i-1)/2`. We can use an offset `MAX_INV_i = i(i-1)/2` for `j`.\n`dp[i][j_offset]` for `j_offset = j + MAX_INV_i`.\nWhen we go from `i-1` to `i`:\nWe add `i` to permutations of `1, ..., i-1`.\nSuppose `p'` and `q'` are permutations of `1, ..., i-1`.\nTo form `p` and `q` of `1, ..., i`:\n1. Insert `i` into `p'` at some position `pos_p` (0-indexed). This adds `pos_p` inversions to `p'`.\n2. Insert `i` into `q'` at some position `pos_q` (0-indexed). This adds `pos_q` inversions to `q'`.\nThe new difference in inversions is `(inv(p') + pos_p) - (inv(q') + pos_q) = inv(p') - inv(q') + pos_p - pos_q`.\n\nThe lexicographical condition is trickier.\nIf `p'` is already lexicographically smaller than `q'`, then `p` will also be lexicographically smaller than `q` regardless of where `i` is inserted, as long as `i` is inserted at the same positions in `p'` and `q'`.\nNo, this is not true. `p_1...p_{k-1}` might be equal, then `p_k < q_k`. If we insert `i` before `k`, it changes the prefix.\nThis DP state is not sufficient.\n\nLet's use the precomputed `inv_counts` table.\n`inv_counts[k][x]` is the number of permutations of `k` elements with `x` inversions.\nLet `dp[k][diff]` be the number of pairs `(p', q')` of permutations of `k` elements such that `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff`.\n`dp[k][diff_offset] = \\sum_{x} inv_counts[k][x] \\cdot inv_counts[k][x - diff]`.\nThis is a convolution. `dp[k]` can be computed in `O(k^3)` time for all `k`.\nFor `k=n`, `dp[n][diff_offset]` gives counts for `inv(p) - inv(q) = diff`.\nSumming `dp[n][diff_offset]` for `diff > 0` gives `N_gt_inv`.\n\nThe actual solution approach:\nThe problem constraints `N <= 500` suggest an `O(N^3)` or `O(N^4)` solution. `O(N^3)` for `inv_counts` is feasible.\n\nLet `f[i][diff]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p_1...p_i, q_1...q_i)` of `1, ..., i` such that `inv(p_1...p_i) - inv(q_1...q_i) = diff`, and `p_1...p_i` is lexicographically smaller than `q_1...q_i`.\nThis is the state we want for `i=n`.\n`dp[i][j]` = sum of `inv_counts[i][k] * inv_counts[i][k-j]` for all `k`. This is `dp[i][j_offset]` from above.\nThis `dp[i][j]` is the number of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with inversion difference `j`.\nLet `S[i]` be the sum of `dp[i][j]` for `j > 0`. This is `N_gt_inv` for permutations of `1..i`.\nLet `E[i]` be `dp[i][0]`. This is `N_eq_inv` for permutations of `1..i`.\nLet `total_pairs[i] = (i!)^2`.\n\nWe need to iterate on the first position `k` where `p_k \\neq q_k`.\nIf `p_k < q_k`, then `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`.\n`p_1=q_1, ..., p_{k-1}=q_{k-1}`.\nThe values `p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` are `x_1, ..., x_{k-1}`.\nThe remaining `n-(k-1)` values are available for `p_k, ..., p_n` and `q_k, ..., q_n`.\nLet `used_values` be the set `{x_1, ..., x_{k-1}}`.\nLet `unused_values` be the set `{1, ..., n} \\setminus used_values`.\nThe values `p_k, ..., p_n` and `q_k, ..., q_n` must be permutations of `unused_values`.\nThis is complicated because the inversion counts depend on the actual values, not just their relative order.\n\nLet's use a different DP state: `dp[i][j]` = sum of `inv(p) - inv(q)` over all pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` where `p <_lex q`. This is not what we want.\n\nThe standard approach for problems involving sum/difference of inversions and lexicographical order is to use a specific DP state:\n`dp[i][j][k]` = number of pairs `(p_prefix, q_prefix)` of length `i` using `i` distinct values, such that `inv(p_prefix) = j`, `inv(q_prefix) = k`, and `p_prefix` is lexicographically smaller than `q_prefix`.\nThis is too complex.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p,q)` of `1, \\dots, i` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\nThe state space for `j` is `O(i^2)`, so `O(N^3)` states.\nWhen computing `dp[i][j]`, we consider adding `i` to permutations of `1, \\dots, i-1`.\nLet `(p', q')` be a pair of permutations of `1, \\dots, i-1`.\nWe insert `i` into `p'` at position `x` (0-indexed), creating `p`. `inv(p) = inv(p') + x`.\nWe insert `i` into `q'` at position `y` (0-indexed), creating `q`. `inv(q) = inv(q') + y`.\nThe new inversion difference is `(inv(p') - inv(q')) + (x - y)`.\n\nThe lexicographical part:\n1. If `p' <_lex q'`, then `p <_lex q` for any `x, y`.\n   `dp[i-1][j']` contributes to `dp[i][j' + x - y]`.\n   For each `j'`, `dp[i-1][j']` pairs contribute.\n   Total ways to choose `x, y` is `i*i`.\n   So sum over `x, y \\in [0, i-1]` of `dp[i-1][j']` contributes to `dp[i][j'+x-y]`.\n   This is `dp[i-1][j'] * i^2`.\n   The `x-y` part is a convolution. For a fixed `j'`, `dp[i-1][j']` contributes to `dp[i][j' + d]` for `d \\in [-(i-1), i-1]`.\n   The number of ways to get `x-y=d` for `x,y \\in [0,i-1]` is `i-|d|`.\n   So `dp[i][j']` contributes `dp[i-1][j'] * (i-|d|)` to `dp[i][j'+d]`.\n   This covers `p <_lex q` part.\n2. If `p' = q'`, then `p` can be `p <_lex q`, `q <_lex p`, or `p = q`.\n   Number of pairs `(p',q')` of `1..i-1` with `p'=q'` and `inv(p') - inv(q') = 0` is `inv_counts[i-1][k]`.\n   If `p'=q'`, `inv(p')=inv(q')`.\n   If `x < y`, then `p <_lex q`. This contributes to `dp[i][x-y]`.\n   If `x > y`, then `q <_lex p`.\n   If `x = y`, then `p = q`.\n\nThis leads to the DP state:\n`dp[i][j][state]` where `i` is current length, `j` is `inv(p) - inv(q)`.\n`state = 0`: `p_prefix = q_prefix`.\n`state = 1`: `p_prefix <_lex q_prefix`.\n`state = 2`: `q_prefix <_lex p_prefix`. (We don't need this, but it simplifies reasoning).\n\nLet `dp[i][j_offset][0]` be count of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` with `p=q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\nThis only has `j=0`. So `dp[i][MAX_INV_i][0] = inv_counts[i][k]^2` for `j=0`.\nNo, `dp[i][MAX_INV_i][0]` is just `inv_counts[i][0]`. No, it's `inv_counts[i][k]` for `p=q`.\n`dp[i][MAX_INV_i][0]` is the number of permutations of `1..i` with `k` inversions.\nThis means `dp[i][MAX_INV_i][0]` should store `inv_counts[i][k]`.\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\nAnd `dp_lex[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\n\nThe maximum `diff = n(n-1)/2`. Offset `MAX_DIFF = n(n-1)/2`.\n`dp[i][d_idx]` stores `dp_lex[i][d_idx - MAX_DIFF]`.\n`inv_counts[len][inv]` has already been computed.\n\n`N = 500`. `MAX_DIFF = 124750`.\n`dp[i][d_idx]` is a 1D array of size `2*MAX_DIFF+1`.\n`dp[i]` depends on `dp[i-1]`.\n`dp[i][d_idx]` = sum of `dp[i-1][d_idx - (x-y)]` for all `x,y \\in [0, i-1]`.\nThis is a convolution.\n`dp[i][d_idx]` = `sum_{d' = -(i-1)}^{i-1} dp[i-1][d_idx - d'] * (i-|d'|)`.\nThis is `O(i^2)` for each `i`. Total `O(N^3)`.\nThis `dp` calculates the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` where `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be `ans` for `i` elements and `j` inversion difference.\n`dp[i][j]` is the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)-inv(q) = j`.\nBase case: `dp[0][0] = 0`.

This is a common pattern.\nThe issue is likely with the `j_prev` values in Part 1. `j_prev` is `inv(p') - inv(q')`.\nWhen `p'` and `q'` are permutations of `1, ..., i-1`, their inversion counts are for those `i-1` values.\nWhen we insert `i`, the number of inversions added by `i` is indeed `x` and `y` respectively.\nThis part seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the definition of `dp[i][j]` is not what I think.\n`dp[i][j]` is the number of pairs `(p', q')` of permutations of `1..i` such that `p' <_lex q'` and `inv(p') - inv(q') = j`.\nThis interpretation seems standard for this kind of DP.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `n=3` case.\n`p=[1,3,2], q=[2,1,3]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=1`. `j=0`.\n`p=[1,3,2], q=[2,3,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=2`. `j=-1`.\n`p=[1,3,2], q=[3,1,2]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=2`. `j=-1`.\n`p=[1,3,2], q=[3,2,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=3`. `j=-2`.\n`p=[2,1,3], q=[2,3,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=2`. `j=-1`.\n`p=[2,1,3], q=[3,1,2]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=2`. `j=-1`.\n`p=[2,1,3], q=[3,2,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=1, inv(q)=3`. `j=-2`.\n`p=[2,3,1], q=[3,1,2]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=2, inv(q)=2`. `j=0`.\n`p=[2,3,1], q=[3,2,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=2, inv(q)=3`. `j=-1`.\n`p=[3,1,2], q=[3,2,1]`: `p <_lex q`, `inv(p)=2, inv(q)=3`. `j=-1`.\n\nCounts:\n`j=0`: 2 pairs\n`j=-1`: 6 pairs\n`j=-2`: 2 pairs\nTotal `p <_lex q` pairs: `2+6+2 = 10`. Correct: `(3!^2 - 3!)/2 = (36-6)/2 = 15`. No, `(3!^2 - 3!)/2 = (6^2 - 6)/2 = (36-6)/2 = 15`. Oh, `p=q` is excluded.\n`p=[1,2,3], q=[1,2,3]`: `inv=0`.\n`p=[1,3,2], q=[1,3,2]`: `inv=1`.\n`p=[2,1,3], q=[2,1,3]`: `inv=1`.\n`p=[2,3,1], q=[2,3,1]`: `inv=2`.\n`p=[3,1,2], q=[3,1,2]`: `inv=2`.\n`p=[3,2,1], q=[3,2,1]`: `inv=3`.\nThere are 6 such pairs. So `(36-6)/2 = 15` pairs where `p \\neq q`.\nAmong these 15 pairs, `p <_lex q` is `15/2` if we assume symmetry.\nThe `10` pairs I listed are those where `p <_lex q`.\nThe remaining `5` are `q <_lex p`.\nFor `n=3`, the sum for `j>0` is 0. My DP gave 2.\n\nThe issue is with `current_total_factorial`.\nPart 2 is for `p_1...p_{i-1} = q_1...q_{i-1}`.\nThe number of such permutations `p'` of `1..i-1` with `inv(p') = k` is `inv_counts[i-1][k]`.\nSo `\\sum_{k=0}^{max_inv_{i-1}} inv_counts[i-1][k] * (i-|d|)` is correct.\nThe sum is `(i-1)! * (i - |d|)`.\nSo `current_total_factorial` in Part 2 should be `(i-1)!`.\nAt the start of iteration `i`, `current_total_factorial` holds `(i-1)!`. So it's correct.\n\nLet's re-verify the `n=3` calculation with `current_total_factorial = 2` for `i=3`.\n`dp[1] = (4 + 2 * (3-2)) = 6`.\n`dp[2] = (6 + 2 * (3-1)) = 10`.\nFinal `dp` for `i=3`: `[2,6,10,4,2,0,0]`.\nSum for `j>0`: `dp[4]+dp[5]+dp[6] = 2+0+0 = 2`. Still 2.\n\nWhat if `MAX_DIFF_N` is not `n*(n-1)/2` but `n*(n-1)`? No, `diff` range is `[-MAX_INV_N, MAX_INV_N]`.\n\nThe problem is that my `dp[i]` is not for `1..i`. It's for `i` items.\nThe problem is `n` elements.\nThe `inv_counts` table counts permutations of `1..i`.\nMy `dp[i]` table is also for permutations of `1..i`.\n\nMaybe the issue is with `current_total_factorial` being `(i-1)!`.\nFor `i=1`, `current_total_factorial` is `0! = 1`.\nFor `i=2`, `current_total_factorial` is `1! = 1`.\nFor `i=3`, `current_total_factorial` is `2! = 2`.\nThis is correct.\n\nConsider `n=3` again. The expected answer is 0.\n`dp[MAX_DIFF_N + j]` is `dp[3+j]`.\n`dp[4]` (for `j=1`): `2`.\n`dp[5]` (for `j=2`): `0`.\n`dp[6]` (for `j=3`): `0`.\nSum is 2.\n\nThe problem could be in the definition of \"insert `i` into `p'` at position `x`\".\nIf `p' = [p_1, ..., p_{i-1}]`, inserting `i` at position `x` (0-indexed) means `[p_1, ..., p_x, i, p_{x+1}, ..., p_{i-1}]`.\nThis adds `x` inversions with elements to its left (`p_1, ..., p_x`).\nAnd it adds `i-1-x` inversions with elements to its right (`p_{x+1}, ..., p_{i-1}`).\nNo, it adds `(number of elements to its left that are greater than i)` + `(number of elements to its right that are smaller than i)`.\nWhen `i` is the largest element, it adds `x` inversions where `x` is its position.\nMy code correctly assumes `i` is the largest element.\n\nThe problem is that `p_k` and `q_k` are NOT necessarily `i`. They can be any of the `n-k+1` remaining elements.\nThis is the standard problem with \"permutations of `1, ..., n`\" vs \"permutations of `k` elements\".\nMy DP builds permutations of `1, ..., i`. This is a simplification.\n\nThe problem should be solved by iterating on `k` from `1` to `n`.\n`k`: current index in `p` and `q`.\n`dp[k][inv_diff][lex_state]` where `lex_state` is `0` (equal prefix) or `1` (`p <_lex q`).\n`inv_diff` is `inv(p_{1..k}) - inv(q_{1..k})`.\nWhen we choose `p_k, q_k`:\n1. `p_k = q_k`.\n   We choose `val` from `1..n` not used.\n   `inv(p_k)` adds `num_used_greater_than_val`.\n   `inv(q_k)` adds `num_used_greater_than_val`.\n   So `inv_diff` does not change.\n   `dp[k][inv_diff][0]` from `dp[k-1][inv_diff][0]`.\n2. `p_k < q_k`.\n   We choose `val_p, val_q` from `1..n` not used.\n   `inv(p_k)` adds `num_used_greater_than_val_p`.\n   `inv(q_k)` adds `num_used_greater_than_val_q`.\n   `inv_diff` changes.\n   `dp[k][inv_diff][1]` from `dp[k-1][prev_inv_diff][0]` and `dp[k-1][prev_inv_diff][1]`.\n\nThis DP state is `dp[k][inv_diff][lex_state][mask]` where `mask` is for used numbers. `N=500` makes `mask` impossible.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` DP structure I implemented is for \"permutations of `1..i`\". This is a common simplification for inversion count problems. If the problem meant \"permutations of `k` chosen elements\", then it's different.\nThe problem is about permutations of `1..n`.\nThe values `p_i` and `q_i` are from `1..n`.\nThe number of inversions `a_i` creates is `sum_{j<i, a_j > a_i} 1`.\nWhen we fill `p_i` and `q_i`, we choose them from `n-(i-1)` available numbers.\nThe number of inversions `p_i` creates with `p_1, ..., p_{i-1}` is `count(p_j > p_i | j < i)`.\nThis depends on the actual values `p_j` and `p_i`.\n\nThis means the `inv_counts[i][j]` table is correct. It's for permutations of `1..i`.\nThe `dp[i][j]` should be the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i`.\nThe `n=4` example output `17` is for permutations of `1..4`.\nThe DP I have been trying is the one for \"permutations of `1..i`\".\nThis is a standard DP for counting permutations with `k` inversions.\n\nThe crucial observation usually involves relative ranks.\nWhen we choose `p_i` and `q_i` from the `N-(i-1)` available numbers, we can map these available numbers to `1, ..., N-(i-1)` based on their sorted order.\nThen the number of inversions can be tracked using these relative ranks.\n\nThis is a hard problem for `N=500`.\nLet `f[i][diff]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `i` elements such that `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff`.\n`f[i][diff]` is `sum_{x} inv_counts[i][x] * inv_counts[i][x-diff]`.\nThis `f[i][diff]` can be computed in `O(i^3)` using convolutions.\nTotal `O(N^4)` for all `f[i]`. Still too slow.\n`f[i]` can be computed in `O(i^2)` from `f[i-1]` if we use generating functions.\n\nThe problem is exactly `dp[i][j_diff]` as I defined it: number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)-inv(q) = j_diff`.\nThe transitions:\n`dp[i][j_curr + MAX_DIFF] += dp[i-1][j_prev + MAX_DIFF] * (i-|d|)` for `d = j_curr - j_prev`.\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\n`dp[i][j_curr + MAX_DIFF] += (i-1)! * (i-|d|)` for `d = x-y < 0`. This is `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe `n=3` example output is 0. My code gives 2.\nThe only possible source of error is the logic of `current_total_factorial * (i - abs(d))`.\nThis is `(i-1)!` permutations `p'` and `q'` where `p'=q'`.\nFor each `p'`, `inv(p')=k`.\nWe insert `i` at `x` in `p'` to get `p`. `inv(p) = k+x`.\nWe insert `i` at `y` in `p'` to get `q`. `inv(q) = k+y`.\nWe need `x < y`.\nSo `inv(p)-inv(q) = x-y`.\nThe count is `inv_counts[i-1][k]`.\nSo `dp[i][x-y + MAX_DIFF] += inv_counts[i-1][k]`.\nSumming over `k`: `dp[i][x-y + MAX_DIFF] += (i-1)!`.\nThis is for each specific pair `(x,y)` with `x < y`.\nSo for a specific `d = x-y < 0`, the contribution is `(i-1)! * (number of pairs (x,y) with x<y and x-y=d)`.\nThe number of pairs `(x,y)` with `x<y` and `x-y=d` is `i-|d|`.\nThis part seems correct.\n\nThe `n=4` example output is `17`.\nMy `n=4` calculation gives `206`.\n\nWhat if `mod` is not prime? It doesn't matter for additions and subtractions.\nThe issue is likely in the problem interpretation or DP state.\n\nThis problem is very similar to \"Counting Permutation Pairs\" on Codeforces (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1399/F).\nThe solution for that problem involves `dp[i][j]` = number of pairs of permutations of `1..i` such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\nAnd `dp_lex[i][j]` = number of pairs of permutations of `1..i` such that `p <_lex q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n\nLet `f[i][j]` be `inv_counts[i][j]`.\n`dp[i][diff]` is the number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` such that `inv(p)-inv(q) = diff`.\n`dp[i][diff] = sum_{x,y} f[i-1][x] * f[i-1][y] * (i-|diff-(x-y)|)` if `diff-(x-y)` is the difference from inserting `i`.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's trust my `O(N^3)` DP logic and re-check the `n=3` values.\n`inv_counts[2][0]=1, inv_counts[2][1]=1`.\n`i=3`: `prev_dp` is `[0,0,2,0,0,0,0]`. `MAX_DIFF_N=3`.\nPart 1: `j_prev_offset = 2` (`j_prev = -1`). `prev_dp[2]=2`.\n  `d` from `-2` to `2`.\n  `d=-2`: `j_curr_offset = 0` (`j_curr = -3`). `dp[0] += 2 * (3-2) = 2`.\n  `d=-1`: `j_curr_offset = 1` (`j_curr = -2`). `dp[1] += 2 * (3-1) = 4`.\n  `d=0`: `j_curr_offset = 2` (`j_curr = -1`). `dp[2] += 2 * (3-0) = 6`.\n  `d=1`: `j_curr_offset = 3` (`j_curr = 0`). `dp[3] += 2 * (3-1) = 4`.\n  `d=2`: `j_curr_offset = 4` (`j_curr = 1`). `dp[4] += 2 * (3-2) = 2`.\n  `temp_conv_dp` is `[2,4,6,4,2,0,0]`.\n  `dp` is `[2,4,6,4,2,0,0]`.\n\nPart 2: `current_total_factorial = 2`.\n  `d` from `-2` to `-1`.\n  `d=-2`: `j_curr_offset = 1` (`j_curr = -2`). `dp[1] += 2 * (3-2) = 2`.

My DP gives `dp[1]` for `j=-2` as `6`, but it should be `2`.\nMy DP gives `dp[2]` for `j=-1` as `10`, but it should be `6`.\nMy DP gives `dp[3]` for `j=0` as `4`, but it should be `2`.\n\nThe problem is likely in `Part 1`.\n`dp[i][j_curr_offset] += prev_dp[j_prev_offset] * (i - abs(d))`.\nThis `(i - abs(d))` is the count of pairs `(x,y)` such that `x-y=d`.\nThis is correct.\nThe issue is that `prev_dp[j_prev_offset]` is already a count of `p' <_lex q'`.\nWhen we insert `i` into `p'` and `q'`, it is `[p_1..p_x i p_{x+1}..p_{i-1}]` and `[q_1..q_y i q_{y+1}..q_{i-1}]`.\nThis new `p` is *still* `p <_lex q` because the first differing element is before `i`.\nThis logic seems sound.\n\nThe problem is that the `prev_dp` is for permutations of `1..i-1`.\nWhen we insert `i`, it is the largest element.\nThe first differing element `k` can be `i`.\nIf `p_1..p_{i-1} = q_1..q_{i-1}` (prefix of length `i-1`), then `p_i` and `q_i` are the first differing elements.\nThis is handled in Part 2.\nIf `p_1..p_{k-1} = q_1..q_{k-1}` and `p_k < q_k` for `k < i`, then `p_1..p_{i-1} <_lex q_1..q_{i-1}`.\nThis is handled in Part 1.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` DP for this problem is correct. The values are `(n!)^2` so modulo is important.\nMy manual calculation for `n=3` is `[0,2,6,2,0,0,0]`. Sum for `j>0` is 0.\nMy code generates `[2,6,10,4,2,0,0]`. Sum for `j>0` is 2.\nThe difference is `[2,4,4,2,0,0,0]`.\nThis difference is exactly `sum_{k} inv_counts[i-1][k] * (i-|d|)` for `d=x-y` for `x,y \\in [0,i-1]`.\nThis is `(i-1)! * (i-|d|)`.\nFor `i=3`, `(i-1)! = 2`.\n`d=-2`: `2 * (3-2) = 2`. My code `dp[0]` is `2`. Correct.\n`d=-1`: `2 * (3-1) = 4`. My code `dp[1]` is `6`. Should be `2`.\n`d=0`: `2 * (3-0) = 6`. My code `dp[2]` is `10`. Should be `2`.\n`d=1`: `2 * (3-1) = 4`. My code `dp[3]` is `4`. Should be `0`.\n`d=2`: `2 * (3-2) = 2`. My code `dp[4]` is `2`. Should be `0`.\n\nThe issue is that `Part 1` and `Part 2` are not disjoint.\n`Part 1`: `prev_dp[j_prev_offset]` contains pairs `(p',q')` where `p' <_lex q'`.\n`Part 2`: `current_total_factorial` represents pairs `(p',p')`.\nThese are disjoint.\n\nAh, `dp[i]` is a new array.\n`temp_conv_dp` is for Part 1.\n`dp` is for Part 2.\n`dp[j_offset] = (temp_conv_dp[j_offset] + dp_from_part2[j_offset]) % mod`.\n\nThe `temp_conv_dp` is computed from `prev_dp`.\nThen `dp` is computed by adding `temp_conv_dp` and Part 2 contributions.\nThe `dp` values for `i=3` after Part 1: `[2,4,6,4,2,0,0]`.\nPart 2: `current_total_factorial` is `2`.\n`d=-2`: `dp[1] = (4 + 2 * (3-2)) = 6`.\n`d=-1`: `dp[2] = (6 + 2 * (3-1)) = 10`.\nThis is exactly what I got.\nThe problem is `dp` values for `j=0,1,2,3`.\n`dp[3]` for `j=0` is 4. Manual is 2.\n`dp[4]` for `j=1` is 2. Manual is 0.\n\nThe implementation seems to be a standard one for this problem.\nMaybe the issue is with `MAX_DIFF_N`.\n`n=4`, `MAX_INV_N = 6`. `MAX_DIFF_N = 6`.\n`dp` has indices `0..12`. `j_offset = j + 6`.\n`j=0` is at `dp[6]`. `j=1` is at `dp[7]`. `j=6` is at `dp[12]`.\nSumming `dp[j+MAX_DIFF_N]` for `j=1..MAX_INV_N`.\nThis is `dp[7]` through `dp[12]`.\n\nThe values for `n=4` from the example are:\n`p=[1,3,4,2], q=[2,1,3,4]`: `(1,1)`. `j=0`.\n`p=[1,4,2,3], q=[2,1,3,4]`: `(1,1)`. `j=0`.\n`p=[1,4,3,2], q=[2,1,3,4]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[1,4,3,2], q=[2,1,4,3]`: `(3,2)`. `j=1`.\n`p=[1,4,3,2], q=[2,3,1,4]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[1,4,3,2], q=[3,1,2,4]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[2,3,4,1], q=[3,1,2,4]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[2,4,1,3], q=[3,1,2,4]`: `(2,1)`. `j=1`.\n`p=[2,4,3,1], q=[3,1,2,4]`: `(4,1)`. `j=3`.\n`p=[2,4,3,1], q=[3,1,4,2]`: `(4,2)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[2,4,3,1], q=[3,2,1,4]`: `(4,1)`. `j=3`.\n`p=[2,4,3,1], q=[4,1,2,3]`: `(4,1)`. `j=3`.\n`p=[3,2,4,1], q=[4,1,2,3]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[3,4,1,2], q=[4,1,2,3]`: `(3,1)`. `j=2`.\n`p=[3,4,2,1], q=[4,1,2,3]`: `(5,1)`. `j=4`.\n`p=[3,4,2,1], q=[4,1,3,2]`: `(5,2)`. `j=3`.\n`p=[3,4,2,1], q=[4,2,1,3]`: `(5,2)`. `j=3`.\n\nCounts for `n=4`:\n`j=0`: 2 pairs.\n`j=1`: 2 pairs.\n`j=2`: 8 pairs.\n`j=3`: 4 pairs.\n`j=4`: 1 pair.\nTotal: `2+2+8+4+1 = 17`. This is the example output.\n\nMy DP for `n=4` gives:\n`dp[7]` (`j=1`): 98 (should be 2)\n`dp[8]` (`j=2`): 66 (should be 8)\n`dp[9]` (`j=3`): 32 (should be 4)\n`dp[10]` (`j=4`): 8 (should be 1)\n`dp[11]` (`j=5`): 2 (should be 0)\n`dp[12]` (`j=6`): 0 (should be 0)\n\nThere is a systematic overcounting in my DP.\nThe overcounting factor is `(i-|d|)`.\nIn part 1, `dp[i-1][j_prev_offset]` is the number of pairs `(p', q')` of permutations of `1..i-1` such that `p' <_lex q'` and `inv(p')-inv(q') = j_prev`.\nWhen we form `p` and `q` by inserting `i` at positions `x` and `y` respectively, the lexicographical order `p <_lex q` is preserved.\nThe number of ways to insert `i` at `x` and `y` is `i*i`.\nThe `(i-|d|)` factor means we sum over `x,y` where `x-y=d`. This is correct.\n\nThe issue is that `p_k` and `q_k` are chosen from `1..n`.\nThe DP I am using is for `1..i`.\nThe values `p_k` and `q_k` are not necessarily `i`. They are chosen from the remaining `n-(k-1)` values.\nThe standard way to handle this is to use \"relative ranks\".\nThis means `inv_counts[i][j]` is correct, but the `dp` transitions are not.\n\nThis problem is harder than it seems.\nThe `O(N^3)` solution is likely based on a different DP state.\nThis problem is typically solved by iterating on the first differing element `k`.\n`p_1=q_1, ..., p_{k-1}=q_{k-1}` and `p_k < q_k`.\nThe values `p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` are some `v_1, ..., v_{k-1}` from `1..n`.\nThe remaining `n-k+1` values are `S_rem`.\n`p_k, ..., p_n` and `q_k, ..., q_n` are permutations of `S_rem`.\nThis means we need to count permutations of `n-k+1` elements whose values are from `S_rem`.\nThe number of inversions for `p_k` depends on `v_1, ..., v_{k-1}` and `S_rem`.\n\nThis is the hard version.\nThe `dp[i][j]` is actually `dp[i][inv_p_diff]` = number of pairs of permutations of length `i` where `p <_lex q` and `inv(p)-inv(q) = j`.\nThe values of the permutations are not `1..i`. They are taken from `1..n`.\nThis means the `inv_counts[i][j]` table is correct for permutations of `i` elements, but those `i` elements are not necessarily `1..i`.\nThis is where the problem lies.\n\nFinal attempt at DP state:\n`dp[i][j]` = number of pairs `(p_prefix, q_prefix)` of length `i` using `i` distinct values, such that `p_prefix` is lexicographically smaller than `q_prefix`, and `inv(p_prefix) - inv(q_prefix) = j`.\nThis interpretation is what I've been using, which is typically for permutations of `1..i`.\n\nThe solution for this problem usually involves a DP state `dp[len][diff]` where `len` is the number of remaining elements, and `diff` is the difference in inversions.\n`dp[len][diff]` = `sum_{p,q of len elements, inv(p)-inv(q)=diff} 1`.\nThis is `sum_k inv_counts[len][k] * inv_counts[len][k-diff]`.\nThis is `O(N^4)` total.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` solution for this problem type is usually like this:\n`dp[k][inv_diff][eq_prefix]`: `k` elements processed, `inv_diff` is `inv_p - inv_q`. `eq_prefix` is a boolean.\nThe number of available values for `p_k` and `q_k` is `n-k+1`.\nThe number of inversions a value `v` contributes when placed at index `k` is `count(u > v, u already placed)`.\nThis is hard to track.\n\nThe fact that `n=500` and `O(N^3)` is feasible suggests that the `inv_counts` table is used and then something similar to my `O(N^3)` DP.\nThe issue must be in how `current_total_factorial` is used.\nIt should be `inv_counts[i-1][k]`.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `1, ..., i` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\nLet `inv_dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `1, ..., i` such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`inv_dp[i][j] = \\sum_k inv_counts[i][k] \\cdot inv_counts[i][k-j]`.\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\nThe `inv_dp` table can be computed by `inv_dp[i][d] = \\sum_{d' = -(i-1)}^{i-1} inv_dp[i-1][d-d'] * (i-|d'|)`. This is `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe actual solution for this problem type is:\n`dp[i][j]` = sum of `inv(p) - inv(q)` over all pairs of permutations of `1..i` where `p <_lex q`.\nNo, `dp[i][j]` is the number of pairs.\nThe `n=4` example and my values are so far off, that it's likely a conceptual error.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # MAX_INV_N is the maximum number of inversions for a permutation of n elements\n    MAX_INV_N = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # MAX_DIFF_N is the maximum possible difference in inversions (abs value)\n    MAX_DIFF_N = MAX_INV_N\n    \n    # inv_counts[i][j] stores the number of permutations of 1...i with j inversions\n    # Max j for i elements is i*(i-1)/2\n    inv_counts = [[0] * (MAX_INV_N + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    inv_counts[0][0] = 1\n\n    # Precompute inv_counts table\n    # O(N * MAX_INV_N) = O(N^3)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        max_j_i = i * (i - 1) // 2\n        for j in range(max_j_i + 1):\n            # inv_counts[i][j] = inv_counts[i-1][j] + inv_counts[i-1][j-1] + ... + inv_counts[i-1][j-(i-1)]\n            # This can be computed in O(1) using prefix sums:\n            # inv_counts[i][j] = inv_counts[i][j-1] + inv_counts[i-1][j] - inv_counts[i-1][j-i]\n            \n            val = 0\n            if j > 0:\n                val = inv_counts[i][j-1]\n            \n            val = (val + inv_counts[i-1][j]) % mod\n            \n            if j - i >= 0:\n                val = (val - inv_counts[i-1][j-i] + mod) % mod\n            \n            inv_counts[i][j] = val\n\n    # dp[j_offset] stores the number of pairs (p, q) of permutations of 1...i\n    # such that p is lexicographically smaller than q, and inv(p) - inv(q) = j\n    # j_offset = j + MAX_DIFF_N\n    dp = [0] * (2 * MAX_DIFF_N + 1)\n    \n    # current_factorial stores (i-1)! for the current iteration i\n    current_factorial = 1 \n\n    # O(N^3) overall DP\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prev_dp = list(dp) # Make a copy of dp from (i-1)\n        dp = [0] * (2 * MAX_DIFF_N + 1) # Reset dp for current i\n        \n        max_inv_i_minus_1 = (i - 1) * (i - 2) // 2\n\n        # Part 1: p_1...p_{i-1} was already lexicographically smaller than q_1...q_{i-1}\n        # For each such pair (p', q') with inv(p') - inv(q') = j_prev,\n        # we insert 'i' into p' at position x and into q' at position y.\n        # The new p remains lexicographically smaller than q.\n        # The new inversion difference is j_prev + x - y.\n        # Contribution for a given j_prev is sum_{x,y} prev_dp[j_prev_offset]\n        # where x-y = d_diff.
