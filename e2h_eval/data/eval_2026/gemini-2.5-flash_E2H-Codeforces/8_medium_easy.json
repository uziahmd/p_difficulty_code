Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on \"Flawed Flow\"**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this \"Flawed Flow\" problem. It's a graph problem, which immediately makes me think about flow networks, but with a twist. The core challenge is to direct the edges of an undirected graph to create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) while respecting flow conservation and the source/sink constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the conditions:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** Except for the source and sink, the incoming flow must equal the outgoing flow for all intermediate nodes. Standard flow constraint.\n2.  **No incoming to Source:** The source node can only have outgoing edges.\n3.  **No Cycles:** This is the most critical constraint. It makes the graph a DAG. I can't have any loops in the directed graph. The implicit assumption is that there's a sink, but the problem's formulation is a bit vague. It doesn't explicitly mention the sink having no outgoing edges. But the lack of incoming edges to the source and the flow conservation, combined with the acyclic constraint, usually means there is flow to one \"sink\" node. I will assume this.\n4.  I know that a solution *always* exists, so this gives me confidence I can find a way.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition screams topological sort or Kahn's algorithm in my mind, as a common way of processing DAGs. Vertex 1 must be at the \"beginning\" of a topological order and vertex `n` should be at the \"end\" (sink).\n\nGiven that the problem guarantees a solution, there must be a way to establish a correct edge direction for each edge that does *not* result in a cycle. This suggests a greedy approach might work.\n\nSince all intermediate nodes conserve flow, and the source only has outgoing flow, this suggests the flow must reach the sink. This also implies that all nodes must have an even degree (sum of adjacent edge capacities).\n\nI think in terms of `degree[v]` (the sum of flows incident to a vertex), and maintaining a `balance[v]` representing incoming - outgoing flow. Initially, `balance[v]` is zero for all. The key here is to make all intermediate node balances 0 and to make the balance positive on the sink, negative on the source, and to find a procedure to direct edges.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" constraint suggests a specific order of direction assignment. I want to build a strategy to avoid having edges in a cycle.\n\nI'm thinking about:\n*   Maintaining a `current_flow_deficit[v]` per node, which gets updated as I make direction assignments.\n*   Maintaining a queue of nodes that are ready to be processed, likely starting with the source (1) as I can immediately determine its outgoing edges. This is reminiscent of Kahn's Algorithm.\n\nTo maintain acyclicity, I can process nodes in an order which will not create a cycle. I think that the best way is to set up a queue, where each node has a \"target flow in\", based on the node degree. When that target has been reached, there are two possibilities: the node is a source and outgoing connections can be assigned, or it's an intermediate node, in which case all remaining outgoing edges can be assigned. In the latter case, these are edges leaving the queue.\n\nSo, I can use a queue of \"ready\" nodes, processing source and nodes that have received the incoming flow required for flow conservation. For nodes in the queue, I can only direct edges *out* of them.\n\nNow, I think I have a plan:\n1.  Read the graph.\n2.  Maintain degree information per node and the edges incident to it.\n3.  Start with vertex 1, assign direction to outgoing edges (1 -> u).\n4.  Then iterate, and add all nodes whose \"required flow in\" is satisfied to a queue. For each node in the queue, assign all undirected edges to be outgoing. Add neighbor nodes to the queue if their targets are met.\n5.  If, at the end, I've correctly set edge directions for the given flow demands, the code should work, and the resulting structure should be acyclic.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge of an undirected graph, given its flow volume, such that three conditions are met:\n1.  **Flow Conservation**: For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of flow on incoming edges equals the sum of flow on outgoing edges.\n2.  **Source Condition**: Vertex 1 (the source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  **Acyclicity**: The resulting directed graph contains no cycles.\n\nThe problem guarantees that a solution always exists.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n*   **Source 1 has no incoming edges**: This means all edges connected to vertex 1 must be directed *out* from 1.\n*   **Acyclicity**: This is a strong condition. A directed graph with no cycles is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This implies there exists a topological ordering of vertices. If we process vertices in a topological order, we can always direct edges from an earlier vertex to a later vertex, ensuring no cycles.\n*   **Flow Conservation for 1 < v < n**: For these vertices, the net flow must be zero. If `total_flow_incident[v]` is the sum of capacities of all edges connected to `v`, then `sum(flow_in[v]) = sum(flow_out[v]) = total_flow_incident[v] / 2`. This means `total_flow_incident[v]` must be an even number.\n*   **Sink n**: Although not explicitly stated, in a max-flow problem with source 1 and sink `n`, and the acyclicity condition, it's generally implied that all flow eventually reaches `n` and `n` has no outgoing edges. Thus, for vertex `n`, `sum(flow_in[n]) = total_flow_incident[n]` and `sum(flow_out[n]) = 0`.\n\nCombining these ideas, we can devise a strategy based on a queue, similar to a topological sort:\n\nWe'll track `current_incoming_flow[v]` for each vertex `v`, which is the sum of flow capacities of edges already directed *into* `v`.\nWe also need `target_incoming_flow[v]` for each vertex `v`:\n*   For the source `v = 1`: `target_incoming_flow[1] = 0` (no incoming edges).\n*   For intermediate vertices `1 < v < n`: `target_incoming_flow[v] = total_flow_incident[v] / 2` (half of total incident flow must be incoming).\n*   For the sink `v = n`: `target_incoming_flow[n] = total_flow_incident[n]` (all incident flow must be incoming).\n\nThe core idea is: once a vertex `u` has received all its `target_incoming_flow`, any *remaining* undirected edges incident to `u` *must* be directed *out* of `u`. This ensures flow conservation for `u` and helps build a DAG.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Store original edges: `edges_info[i] = (u, v, c)` for each edge `i`.\n    *   Create an adjacency list: `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_index)` for neighbors `v` of `u`.\n    *   Calculate `total_flow_incident[v]` for all `v`: sum of capacities of all edges connected to `v`.\n    *   Initialize `current_incoming_flow[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n    *   Initialize `ans[m]` to store the direction for each edge (0 for `a_i -> b_i`, 1 for `b_i -> a_i`).\n    *   Initialize a queue `q`.\n    *   Initialize `edges_processed[m]` to `False` for all edges.\n\n2.  **Seed the Queue**:\n    *   Vertex 1 (source) requires 0 incoming flow. Since `current_incoming_flow[1]` is initially 0, it has already met its incoming flow requirement. Add `1` to `q`.\n\n3.  **Main Loop (BFS-like traversal)**:\n    *   While `q` is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a vertex `u`.\n        *   Iterate through all neighbors `v` of `u` using `(v, c, idx)` from `adj[u]`:\n            *   If `edges_processed[idx]` is `True`, this edge has already been directed, so skip it.\n            *   **Direct the edge**: Since `u` has received all its required incoming flow, any unprocessed edge `(u, v)` must be directed *out* of `u*. So, we direct it `u -> v`.\n            *   Mark `edges_processed[idx] = True`.\n            *   Determine `ans[idx]`: If the original edge was `(u_orig, v_orig, c_orig)` and `u_orig == u`, then `ans[idx] = 0`. Otherwise (`v_orig == u`), `ans[idx] = 1`.\n            *   **Update `v`'s incoming flow**: `current_incoming_flow[v] += c`.\n            *   **Check if `v` is ready**:\n                *   Calculate `target_incoming_flow[v]` based on whether `v` is 1, `n`, or an intermediate node.\n                *   If `current_incoming_flow[v] == target_incoming_flow[v]`, then `v` has received all its required incoming flow. Add `v` to `q`.\n\n4.  **Output**: Print the `ans` array.\n\nThis approach guarantees acyclicity because we only direct edges *out* of a node `u` once all its *incoming* flow requirements are met. This effectively processes nodes in a topological order (or an order consistent with one).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Test Case):**\n`n=3, m=3`\nEdges:\n0: (3, 2, 10)\n1: (1, 2, 10)\n2: (3, 1, 5)\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    `adj = [[], [(2,10,1), (3,5,2)], [(3,10,0), (1,10,1)], [(2,10,0), (1,5,2)]]`\n    `edges_info = [(3,2,10), (1,2,10), (3,1,5)]`\n    `total_flow_incident = [0, 15, 20, 15]` (for v=1,2,3)\n    `current_incoming_flow = [0,0,0,0]`\n    `ans = [-1,-1,-1]`\n    `q = deque()`\n    `edges_processed = [F,F,F]`\n\n2.  **Seed Queue**:\n    `q.append(1)` (since `current_incoming_flow[1]=0` and `target_incoming_flow[1]=0`)\n\n3.  **Main Loop**:\n    *   **Pop `u=1`**:\n        *   Edge (1,2,10,1): Not processed.
