            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Polycarp's Practice\n\nPolycarp is practicing his problem solving skill. He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this competitive programming problem.**\n\nFirst, I had to understand the core mechanics: partitioning a list of problem difficulties into *k* days, maximizing the total profit (which is the sum of daily maximums), and figuring out the distribution of problems across days. The constraints were clear, and I kept them in mind.\n\nMy initial instinct was to maximize each day's profit individually.  Since the profit for a day is the highest difficulty of the problems solved that day, making each daily maximum as large as possible seemed like the key. This led me to consider the *k* largest values in the entire list of problem difficulties. If I could somehow guarantee that each of these large values became the daily maximum for one of the *k* days, I'd achieve the absolute highest possible profit.\n\nThe question then was, \"Can I *always* achieve this optimal sum?\". I realized the answer was yes, but it required some clever partitioning.  I decided to sort the problems by difficulty in descending order and identify the indices of the *k* largest problems. I saw a pattern here, but the ordering and the starting point was a challenge. That gave me an idea on how to perform the split. I need the last split points to make each index a maximum value.\n\nMy next step was to figure out how to split the problems into *k* segments so that each of the largest *k* values was the maximum for one of these segments. After thinking about it, I realized that sorting the original indices of the *k* largest values and positioning the cut points after them. By placing these cut points just after the indices of the *k* largest problems, I could ensure the algorithm will work. I worked through an example to test this logic. The cut points determine the ending position, while the sorted indices represent the positions of the max problems on each day.\n\nThe lengths of the segments were the final piece of the puzzle. I devised a way to calculate these lengths by taking into account the sorted indices. This calculation gave me the precise number of problems that needed to be assigned to each day. I needed to confirm whether my strategy was valid or not. I needed to evaluate if the approach produces a result that satisfies all problem constraints. To ensure the daily profit is the max value, I needed to check that the chosen values are the greatest in their respective group. I had to prove that the *k* selected problems will be part of the final profit.\n\nI verified the strategy and logic, it seemed to cover all cases. I walked through the code, including the edge cases. I needed to prove this worked to find the best runtime. Overall, the logic appears sound, both in terms of correctness and efficiency.\n",
