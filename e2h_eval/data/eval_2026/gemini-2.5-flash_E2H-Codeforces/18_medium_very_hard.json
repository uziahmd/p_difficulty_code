The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Frog's Leap: A Journey into Reachability**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is this \"Frog Jumping\" problem. It's about figuring out how many unique positions a frog can land on within a specific range, given its jumping abilities (+a and -b). My initial thought is to break it down. We're interested in the *number* of reachable positions (let's call it f(x)) up to some value 'x'. Crucially, the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x]. The problem screams \"graph traversal\" to me, but the potentially huge value of 'x' forces a more clever approach.\n\nThe frog starts at 0, and any reachable number must be achievable using a combination of +a and -b jumps. I quickly realize that any reachable point will be a multiple of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b'. That's a good first observation. It suggests the problem has a strong connection to modular arithmetic. Now, the condition of staying within [0, x] is the key. It means that the path from 0 to any reachable number must *also* stay within the given range.\n\nMy first instinct is to try a Breadth-First Search (BFS) for each x, but the size of 'm' (up to 10^9) makes that impossible. The idea of using Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths crossed my mind, but that's still too slow with such a big 'm'. The size of 'a' and 'b' (up to 10^5) seems important, I need to exploit it.\n\nI then start thinking about reachability as a function of x, and how f(x) changes. It seems clear that f(x) increases as x increases. Moreover, f(x) changes when some number gets newly reachable, which means that the constraints will change. I'm focusing on \"min_max_val[i]\", the smallest `X` where `i` is reachable in `[0, X]`, and thinking about if the jumps keep `max` value as small as possible. The concept of \"minimum maximum\" pops up.\n\nI considered that we might need Dijkstra's again, but this time only in the space of [0, a+b] which can potentially reduce running time. The thought is that anything outside this range can be reached from smaller values. \nWe can calculate `dist[i]` which is the minimum max value in the path such that i can be reached. I have to minimize `dist[i]`. So my final thought, is to have a Dijkstra approach, and using `a+b` as the upper limit in order to calculate `dist[i]`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`. A jump is only allowed if the destination is within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `dist[p]` be the minimum `X` such that `p` is reachable from `0` without any intermediate jump going outside `[0, X]`. This means `dist[p]` is the minimum of `max(path)` over all valid paths from `0` to `p`.\nWe can compute `dist[p]` for all `p` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[p] = infinity` for `p > 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue `PQ` storing `(current_max_val, current_pos)`. Initially, `PQ = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhen extracting `(X, p)` from `PQ`:\n1. If `X > dist[p]`, continue (we've found a better path to `p` already).\n2. Consider jumping to `p+a`: If `p+a` is within `[0, m]`, update `dist[p+a] = min(dist[p+a], max(X, p+a))` and push `(dist[p+a], p+a)` to `PQ`.\n3. Consider jumping to `p-b`: If `p-b` is within `[0, m]`, update `dist[p-b] = min(dist[p-b], X)` and push `(dist[p-b], p-b)` to `PQ`. (Note `p-b` is smaller than `p`, so `p-b` cannot be the new maximum on the path from `0` to `p-b` if `p` was the maximum).\n\nThe maximum value of `m` is `10^9`, so a direct Dijkstra on `[0, m]` is too slow. However, `a, b <= 10^5`. This suggests that the behavior of `dist[p]` might stabilize for `p` larger than some threshold related to `a` and `b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points `p` must be multiples of `g`.\nThe maximum value `a+b` is `2 * 10^5`. Let's define `K = a+b`.\nWe can run Dijkstra on the nodes `0, 1, ..., K`.\nFor `p > K`, `dist[p]` will behave predictably.\nIf `p` is reachable with `dist[p] = X`, then `p+g` is reachable.\nSpecifically, `g = s*a - t*b` for some integers `s, t`. We can choose `s, t` such that `0 < s <= b/g` and `0 < t <= a/g` (or similar small values).\nA path from `p` to `p+g` involves `s` jumps of `+a` and `t` jumps of `-b`. The maximum value encountered on this path would be `p + s*a`.\nIf `p` is large enough such that `p >= max(a,b)` and `dist[p] = p`, then `dist[p+g]` would be `max(p, p+s*a) = p+s*a`. This is not `p+g`.\nHowever, if `p` is large enough, `dist[p]` will eventually become `p`.\nConsider the values `p` modulo `g`. Let `d_rem[rem]` be the minimum `p` such that `p % g == rem` and `dist[p] = p`.\nThis is still not quite right.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is that for `p` sufficiently large, `dist[p]` will be `p`. This is because any `p` (that is a multiple of `g`) can be represented as `s*a - t*b` for some `s,t >= 0` if `p` is greater than the Frobenius number `a*b/g - a - b`. If we can find such `s,t` that `s*a <= p`, then `dist[p]=p`. This is not guaranteed.\n\nA simpler observation: if `p` is reachable with `dist[p] = X`, and `p >= b`, then `p-b` is reachable with `dist[p-b] = min(dist[p-b], X)`.\nIf `p` is reachable with `dist[p] = X`, and `p+a <= m`, then `p+a` is reachable with `dist[p+a] = min(dist[p+a], max(X, p+a))`.\n\nLet's compute `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `K = a+b`. This takes `O(K log K)` time.\nFor `p > K`:\nIf `p` is reachable, then `p-g` must be reachable.\nConsider `p` such that `p >= K`. If `dist[p] = p`, then `p+g` is reachable with `dist[p+g] = p+g`.\nIf `dist[p] = X > p`, then `p+g` is reachable with `dist[p+g] = max(X, p+g)`.\nThe `dist[p]` values for `p > K` will be `p` if `p` is reachable and `p` is a multiple of `g`.\nThis is because `dist[p]` is always at least `p`. If `p` is large enough, we can always find a path from `0` to `p` that never goes above `p`.\nFor any `p` that is a multiple of `g` and `p >= a*b/g - a - b` (the Frobenius number for `+a` and `+b` jumps, which is a common upper bound for these problems), `p` can be written as `s*a - t*b` for `s,t >= 0`.\nThe maximum value on such a path `0 -> a -> 2a -> ... -> s*a -> s*a-b -> ... -> s*a-t*b=p` is `s*a`.\nIf `s*a <= p`, then `dist[p]=p`.\nWe can choose `s, t` such that `s` is minimized. `s = (p % b_over_g) * a_inv_mod_b_over_g` where `b_over_g = b/g`. This `s` is `O(b/g)`.\nThen `s*a` can be up to `(b/g)*a = lcm(a,b)`. `lcm(a,b)` can be `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n\nThe actual value `K` for the threshold is `a+b`.\nThe set of reachable points for `x` is `S_x = {p | dist[p] <= x}`.\n`f(x) = |S_x|`.\nWe need to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`.\nThis sum can be rewritten as `sum( (m - dist[p] + 1) for p in [0, m] if dist[p] <= m )`.\nLet `N = a+b`.\nWe run Dijkstra to find `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `N`. `dist` array size `N+1`.\n`dist[0] = 0`. Other `dist[p] = infinity`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n`while pq`:\n  `X, p = heappop(pq)`\n  If `X > dist[p]`: continue\n  If `p+a <= N`:\n    `new_X = max(X, p+a)`\n    If `new_X < dist[p+a]`:\n      `dist[p+a] = new_X`\n      `heappush(pq, (new_X, p+a))`\n  If `p-b >= 0`:\n    `new_X = X`\n    If `new_X < dist[p-b]`:\n      `dist[p-b] = new_X`\n      `heappush(pq, (new_X, p-b))`\nThis computes `dist[p]` for `p` up to `N`.\nFor `p > N`, `dist[p]` must be `p` if `p` is a multiple of `g`.\nProof: For `p > N = a+b`, we can write `p = k*a - l*b` for some `k, l >= 0` such that `p % g == 0`.\nSpecifically, we can write `p = k_0 a - l_0 b` with `k_0, l_0 >= 0`.\nWe can adjust `k_0, l_0` by `k_0' = k_0 + t*(b/g)` and `l_0' = l_0 + t*(a/g)`.\nThe maximum value on the path `0 -> a -> ... -> k_0'a -> ... -> p` is `k_0'a`.\nWe need `k_0'a <= p`.\nIf `p` is a multiple of `g` and `p >= a*b/g`, then `p` can be written as `s*a - t*b` for `s, t >= 0` such that `s*a <= p`.\nThe bound `a*b/g` can be `10^{10}`. This is too large.\nThe actual bound is `a+b`. For `p >= a+b`, `dist[p] = p` if `p` is a multiple of `g`.\nThis is a known result for problems of this type: after `a+b` (or `max(a,b)`), the minimum maximum value is simply the value itself, if it is reachable.\nSo, for `p > N`, if `p % g == 0`, then `dist[p] = p`. Otherwise, `dist[p] = infinity`.\n\nNow we have `dist[p]` for all `p` up to `m`:\n1. For `p <= N`: `dist[p]` is computed by Dijkstra.\n2. For `p > N`: `dist[p] = p` if `p % g == 0`, else `dist[p] = infinity`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m) = sum_{p=0 to m, dist[p] <= m} (m - dist[p] + 1)`.\nLet's filter `dist` values: `vals = [(dist[p], p) for p=0 to m if dist[p] <= m]`.\nSort `vals` by `dist[p]`.\nLet `vals_filtered = []`.\nFor `p` from `0` to `N`: if `dist[p]` is finite, add `(dist[p], p)` to `vals_filtered`.\nFor `p` from `N+1` to `m`: if `p % g == 0`, add `(p, p)` to `vals_filtered`.\nSort `vals_filtered` by `dist_val`.\nLet `(X_j, p_j)` be the sorted pairs.\nThe sum is `sum_{j} (m - X_j + 1)`.\n\nThis is still summing over `m` elements. We need a faster way.\nThe sum is `sum_{i=0 to m} f(i)`.\n`f(i)` is the count of `p` such that `dist[p] <= i`.\nLet `count_le[X]` be the number of `p` such that `dist[p] <= X`.\nThen `f(i) = count_le[i]`.\nWe need `sum_{i=0 to m} count_le[i]`.\nThis is `sum_{p=0 to m, dist[p] <= m} (m - dist[p] + 1)`. This is correct.\n\nLet `max_a_b = max(a,b)`. We can use `N = max_a_b + b` (or `max_a_b + a`). Actually, `N = a+b` is fine.\n`g = gcd(a,b)`.\n`dist` array size `N+1`.\n`dist[p]` for `p <= N`: computed by Dijkstra.\n`dist_values = []`\nFor `p` from `0` to `N`:\n  If `dist[p] <= m`: `dist_values.append(dist[p])`.\nFor `p` from `N+1` to `m`:\n  If `p % g == 0`: `dist_values.append(p)`.\n\nThe second loop `p` from `N+1` to `m` is too long.\nThe values `dist[p]` for `p > N` are simply `p` (if `p % g == 0`).\nLet `S_1 = sum_{p=0 to N, dist[p] <= m} (m - dist[p] + 1)`.\nLet `S_2 = sum_{p=N+1 to m, p % g == 0} (m - p + 1)`.\nThe total sum is `S_1 + S_2`.\n\n`S_1`: Iterate `p` from `0` to `N`. If `dist[p]` is finite and `dist[p] <= m`, add `m - dist[p] + 1` to `S_1`.\nThis takes `O(N)` time.\n\n`S_2`: This is an arithmetic progression sum.\nThe values of `p` are `N' = (N/g + 1)*g`, `N'+g`, `N'+2g`, ..., `m'` where `m'` is the largest multiple of `g` not exceeding `m`.\nLet `first_p = ((N/g) + 1) * g`.\nIf `first_p > m`, then `S_2 = 0`.\nOtherwise, `p` goes from `first_p` to `m` in steps of `g`.\nThe terms are `(m - first_p + 1)`, `(m - (first_p+g) + 1)`, ..., `(m - (first_p + k*g) + 1)`.\nLet `k_max = (m - first_p) / g`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k=0 to k_max} (m - (first_p + k*g) + 1)`.\nThis is `sum_{k=0 to k_max} ( (m - first_p + 1) - k*g )`.\nLet `C = m - first_p + 1`.\nSum `C - k*g` for `k=0` to `k_max`.\nThis is `(k_max + 1)*C - g * sum_{k=0 to k_max} k`.\n`sum_{k=0 to k_max} k = k_max * (k_max + 1) / 2`.\nSo `S_2 = (k_max + 1)*C - g * k_max * (k_max + 1) / 2`.\nThis can be calculated in `O(1)` time.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)` for Dijkstra + `O(N)` for `S_1` + `O(1)` for `S_2`.\n`N = a+b <= 2 * 10^5`. `N log N` is about `2*10^5 * 18` which is `3.6 * 10^6`.

Some sources use `a` or `b` as the modulus for Dijkstra, then `N` would be `a+b-1`.\nSince `a,b <= 10^5`, `a+b` is `2*10^5`. This is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nimport math\n\n# Function to compute gcd\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    g = gcd(a, b)\n\n    # N is the threshold after which dist[p] = p (if p % g == 0)\n    # A common safe upper bound for such problems is a+b-1 or similar.\n    # Given a, b <= 10^5, a+b is ~2*10^5.
