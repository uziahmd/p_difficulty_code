Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Solver**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to determine if a character grid forms the letter 'X' according to some specific rules. It's an `n x n` grid, with `n` being an odd number between 3 and 299. The grid is represented by `grid[row][col]`, which seems straightforward.\n\nMy first thought is to break down the rules:  all the characters on the diagonals must be identical, and all the characters *not* on the diagonals must also be identical.  Finally, the character on the diagonals has to be *different* from the character outside the diagonals. Got it.\n\nNow, how to implement this?  I figure I'll read the input: `n`, and then `n` lines of the grid.  I'll store the grid as a 2D list. I'll need to define what it means for a cell to be on a diagonal. Main diagonal is when `row == col`, and the anti-diagonal is when `row + col == n - 1`.  So, if either of those conditions are true, it's on a diagonal.\n\nI'll initialize two variables, `diag_char` and `nondiag_char`, to hold the expected characters, and two boolean flags, `diag_char_set` and `nondiag_char_set`, to track whether I've encountered a diagonal/non-diagonal character yet.  I'll iterate through the grid using nested loops, `for r in range(n): for c in range(n):`.\n\nInside the loop, I'll check if a cell `grid[r][c]` is on a diagonal. If it *is*, and I haven't set `diag_char` yet, I'll set it to the cell's character. If it *is* on a diagonal and the character is *different* from `diag_char`, then I can immediately print \"NO\" and exit.  Same logic for the non-diagonal cells: if the cell isn't on a diagonal, and I haven't set `nondiag_char`, I set it, and if it is different, \"NO\" and exit.\n\nIf the loops complete without exiting, that means I've successfully verified the first two conditions. Now, the final check: are `diag_char` and `nondiag_char` different? If they are, I print \"YES\"; otherwise, I print \"NO\".\n\nThe edge case is that `n` is odd. But that seems to work out since the center cell will be part of both diagonals. And the constraint on `n` means that the loop will be O(n^2), which is perfectly fine. It's a clean, efficient implementation.  I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for potentially faster I/O.\n",
