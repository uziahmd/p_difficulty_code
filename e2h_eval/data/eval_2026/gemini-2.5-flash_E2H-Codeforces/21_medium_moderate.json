The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where the goal is to maximize the number of chests I can open. It's a classic pairing problem. I've got `n` chests and `m` keys, each with a number on it. A key unlocks a chest if their sum is odd, meaning one is even and the other is odd. Simple enough so far.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to maximize this. Each key can be used only once, and each chest can only be opened once. The crucial insight is to count the even and odd chests, and the even and odd keys. Call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`, respectively.\n\nThe problem breaks down into two independent scenarios: pairing even chests with odd keys, and odd chests with even keys. I can't mix and match parities. So, the number of even chests I can open is limited by either the number of even chests (`chests_even`) or the number of odd keys (`keys_odd`).  I take the minimum of those two, let's call it `count1`.  Similarly, `count2` is the minimum of `chests_odd` and `keys_even`.\n\nSince the two pairings are independent, the total number of chests I can open is just `count1 + count2`. It's really that simple.  I've double-checked my logic with some examples. It all seems solid.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward: read the inputs, count the evens and odds, and then apply the formula `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  The time complexity will be linear in the input size - O(n+m). The space complexity is constant, since I'm only storing a few integer counts. This should be fast enough. There's no fancy algorithm here, just some careful counting and the right observation. Ready to code it up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two ways this condition can be met:\n1. `a_i` is an even number and `b_j` is an odd number.\n2. `a_i` is an odd number and `b_j` is an even number.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys by their parity:\n- Count the number of chests with even numbers (`chests_even`).\n- Count the number of chests with odd numbers (`chests_odd`).\n- Count the number of keys with even numbers (`keys_even`).\n- Count the number of keys with odd numbers (`keys_odd`).\n\nNow, let's consider the two types of pairings independently:\n\n**Pairing Type 1: Even chest with an odd key**\nTo open an even-numbered chest, Neko needs an odd-numbered key.\nThe maximum number of such pairings is limited by:\n- The total number of available even chests (`chests_even`).\n- The total number of available odd keys (`keys_odd`).\nSo, the number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\n**Pairing Type 2: Odd chest with an even key**\nTo open an odd-numbered chest, Neko needs an even-numbered key.\nThe maximum number of such pairings is limited by:\n- The total number of available odd chests (`chests_odd`).\n- The total number of available even keys (`keys_even`).\nSo, the number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nCrucially, these two pairing types use completely disjoint sets of resources:\n- Even chests are distinct from odd chests.\n- Odd keys are distinct from even keys.\nTherefore, the choices made for one pairing type do not affect the resources available for the other pairing type. We can maximize each type of pairing independently and sum their results to get the overall maximum.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Read the `n` chest numbers (`a_i`). Iterate through them and count `chests_even` and `chests_odd`.\n3. Read the `m` key numbers (`b_j`). Iterate through them and count `keys_even` and `keys_odd`.\n4. Calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n5. Calculate `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n6. Sum the results from steps 4 and 5, and print the total.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. **Chests:**\n   - Even chests: `14, 6, 2` (count = 3) -> `chests_even = 3`\n   - Odd chests: `9, 11` (count = 2) -> `chests_odd = 2`\n\n2. **Keys:**\n   - Even keys: `8, 4, 20` (count = 3) -> `keys_even = 3`\n   - Odd keys: `7` (count = 1) -> `keys_odd = 1`\n\n3. **Pairing Type 1 (Even chest + Odd key):**\n   `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n\n4. **Pairing Type 2 (Odd chest + Even key):**\n   `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n5. **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis approach is efficient. Counting parities takes `O(n + m)` time, and the final calculation is `O(1)`. Given `n, m <= 10^5`, this solution will run well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line of input.\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the chest numbers.
