After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem. It's about figuring out how many students are \"successful,\" which means they're the best at at least one subject.  Here's what I'm thinking:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input. It's `n` students and `m` subjects, and each student's grade in each subject is a single digit from 1 to 9. The goal is to find the number of successful students.\n\nMy initial approach is to read in the data, which seems straightforward. I'll read `n` and `m` first, then the gradebook, probably as a list of lists of integers, where `grades[i][j]` represents the mark of student `i` in subject `j`.\n\nTo identify successful students, I'll need to figure out the maximum mark in each subject.  I can iterate over each subject, finding the maximum mark across all students for that subject. Then, I can iterate over students again, checking if their mark for *any* subject equals the maximum for that subject. If it does, they're \"successful.\"  I'll use a set to store the indices of the successful students. This will prevent double-counting if a student is the best at multiple subjects.\n\nTo optimize, I think I can combine finding the maximums *and* identifying successful students in a single pass.  I'll iterate through each subject, find the maximum mark, and then, while I'm at it, check which students achieved that maximum mark and add their indices to the `successful_students_indices` set.\n\nSo the refined plan is:\n\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Read the gradebook into a 2D list called `grades`.\n3.  Initialize an empty set called `successful_students_indices`.\n4.  Iterate through the *subjects* first.  For each subject `j`:\n    *   Find the maximum mark (`max_mark_for_subject_j`).\n    *   Then, iterate through the students and add their index to `successful_students_indices` if their mark in subject `j` is the maximum.\n5.  Finally, the size of `successful_students_indices` is the answer.\n\nThis refined approach is more efficient, as it processes both the max calculation and student index tracking in a single loop. I think this will be a good approach for writing the Python script.\n",
