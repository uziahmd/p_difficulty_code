Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise.

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Flawed Flow Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and it's a bit of a puzzle.  We've got an undirected graph, and the challenge is to figure out the *direction* of flow for each edge, given the flow amounts.  Vertex 1 is the source, vertex *n* is the sink, and the conditions are key: flow must be conserved at all intermediate vertices (the sum of flow in equals the sum of flow out), vertex 1 has no incoming flow, and crucially, there can't be any cycles in the resulting directed graph.\n\nThis \"no cycles\" rule is a big hint – it screams \"topological sort!\"  The flow must move in a consistent direction across the graph, and a topological ordering of the nodes should help. My immediate thought is that flow goes from \"earlier\" nodes to \"later\" nodes in this ordering.  The total flow *F* is another important piece; it's the maximum flow leaving the source and entering the sink.\n\nTo solve this, I'll need to calculate this total flow *F* and maintain a \"balance\" for each vertex. The idea is to track the *net* flow entering or leaving a node, initially set to zero for all except the source and sink. At the source, this \"balance\" or \"excess\" is `-F` (since all flow leaves). At the sink, the \"balance\" is *F* (all flow enters). Intermediate nodes need a balance of zero, implying the flow into the node equals the flow out of the node.\n\nAs I go through each edge, I need to choose a direction (u -> w or w -> u). If I choose u -> w, I need to adjust the balance of u (subtract the edge's flow) and the balance of w (add the edge's flow). This sounds like a constraint satisfaction problem, where my goal is to satisfy these flow balance conditions at each vertex.\n\nIt's tempting to use Kahn's algorithm or something like that since the \"no cycles\" thing keeps popping into my head. The key is in maintaining the balance. I'll probably iterate through the edges and dynamically update the balance of each node and store the direction of the edge. Since the total flow is given, I should be able to determine the directions in a greedy way, satisfying flow conservation.\n\nThere's this vital constraint that the sum of the capacities of all incident edges for any intermediate vertex must be even. If not, the flow won't balance and there won't be a solution.  I need to calculate the flow from the edges connected to the source. The directions of the edges connected to the source are fixed - all must be out. After that, I iterate through the other vertices to fix the other directions. It's a greedy approach with a clear goal: make sure the net flow for each intermediate node is zero.\n\nThe solution looks like it's a process of balancing and deciding the direction of the edge in such a way that it minimizes the difference between the actual flow and the required flow. I am getting close to the solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge `(a_i, b_i)` with a given flow volume `c_i` such that three conditions are met:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of incoming flow volumes equals the sum of outgoing flow volumes.\n2.  **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  **No Cycles:** The resulting directed graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\nWe need to output `0` if the flow is `a_i -> b_i` and `1` if the flow is `b_i -> a_i`.\n\nLet's define `net_outflow[v]` for each vertex `v` as `(sum of outgoing flow from v) - (sum of incoming flow to v)`.\nThe conditions can be restated in terms of `net_outflow[v]`:\n*   For `1 < v < n`: `net_outflow[v] = 0`.\n*   For `v = 1`: `net_outflow[1]` must be equal to the total flow `F` from source to sink.\n*   For `v = n`: `net_outflow[n]` must be equal to `-F` (since all flow `F` must eventually enter the sink).\n\nThe total flow `F` can be determined from vertex 1. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, all flow through its incident edges must be outgoing. Thus, `F` is the sum of capacities `c_i` of all edges connected to vertex 1.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is crucial. It implies that there exists a topological ordering of the vertices. While we don't know the directions beforehand to compute a topological sort, we can use a property of DAGs and flow conservation: if a vertex `v` (not the source or sink) has a fixed amount of \"excess\" flow that needs to be pushed out or pulled in, and only one incident edge remains undecided, its direction can be uniquely determined.\n\nThis leads to a greedy approach using a queue, similar to Kahn's algorithm for topological sort or a process of \"fixing\" balances.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    *   `adj`: An adjacency list where `adj[u]` stores tuples `(v, c, edge_idx)` for all edges `(u, v)` with capacity `c` and original index `edge_idx`.\n    *   `ans`: An array of size `m` to store the final directions (0 or 1). Initialize with -1 (undecided).\n    *   `current_net_outflow`: An array of size `n+1` to store the current `net_outflow` for each vertex. Initialize to 0.\n    *   `undecided_edges_count`: An array of size `n+1` to store the number of undecided edges incident to each vertex. Initialize based on graph structure.\n    *   `q`: A `collections.deque` for vertices whose incident edge directions can be determined.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Flow `F` and Initialize `current_net_outflow`:**\n    *   Iterate through all edges incident to vertex 1. Sum their capacities to get `F`.\n    *   Set `current_net_outflow[1] = F`.\n    *   Set `current_net_outflow[n] = -F`.\n    *   For all other vertices `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), `current_net_outflow[v]` remains 0.\n\n3.  **Initialize `undecided_edges_count` and Queue `q`:**\n    *   For each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`:\n        *   `undecided_edges_count[v]` is initially the total degree of `v`.\n        *   If `v` is an intermediate vertex (1 < `v` < `n`) and `undecided_edges_count[v] == 1`:\n            *   Add `v` to the queue `q`. (A vertex with only one undecided edge is a candidate for fixing its balance.)\n\n4.  **Process Vertices in Queue:**\n    *   While `q` is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a vertex `u`.\n        *   If `u` is the source (1) or sink (n), skip it. (Their balances are fixed by `F` and `-F` respectively, and their incident edges are not constrained by `current_net_outflow[u] == 0`.)\n        *   If `undecided_edges_count[u]` is not 1, skip `u`. (Its balance cannot be uniquely determined by its last edge.)\n        *   Find the unique undecided edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` incident to `u`.\n        *   **Determine Direction:**\n            *   If `current_net_outflow[u] > 0`: `u` has an excess of outgoing flow. To reach `0` net outflow, it needs to *receive* flow. So, the edge must be directed `v -> u`.\n                *   `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (flow `b_i -> a_i`, assuming `u` is `a_i` and `v` is `b_i`, or vice versa).\n                *   Update `current_net_outflow[u] -= c`.\n                *   Update `current_net_outflow[v] += c`.\n            *   If `current_net_outflow[u] < 0`: `u` has a deficit of outgoing flow (or excess incoming flow). To reach `0` net outflow, it needs to *send* flow. So, the edge must be directed `u -> v`.\n                *   `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (flow `a_i -> b_i`).\n                *   Update `current_net_outflow[u] += c`.\n                *   Update `current_net_outflow[v] -= c`.\n            *   (Note: `current_net_outflow[u]` must be non-zero and `c` must be `abs(current_net_outflow[u])` for this to work. The problem guarantees a solution, so this will hold.)\n\n        *   **Update Neighbors:**\n            *   Decrement `undecided_edges_count[u]` and `undecided_edges_count[v]`.\n            *   If `undecided_edges_count[v]` becomes 1 and `v` is an intermediate vertex (1 < `v` < `n`), add `v` to `q`.\n\n5.  **Handle Source and Sink Edges (and any remaining undecided edges):**\n    *   After the queue is empty, all intermediate vertices (1 < `v` < `n`) should have `current_net_outflow[v] = 0`.\n    *   The remaining undecided edges must be incident to vertex 1 or `n`.\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` that is still undecided (`ans[edge_idx] == -1`):\n        *   If `u == 1`: The edge must be `1 -> v`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` if `a_i=1, b_i=v` or `ans[edge_idx]=1` if `a_i=v, b_i=1`.\n        *   If `v == 1`: The edge must be `1 -> u`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` if `a_i=1, b_i=u` or `ans[edge_idx]=1` if `a_i=u, b_i=1`.\n        *   Similarly for `n`. If `u == n`, `v -> n`. If `v == n`, `u -> n`.\n\n    This final step can be simplified. The queue processing should handle all edges, including those connected to 1 and `n`, if they are the *last* undecided edge for an intermediate node. The problem guarantees a solution and no cycles, which implies that this greedy process will eventually determine all directions. The \"no cycles\" condition ensures that we won't get stuck in a situation where `current_net_outflow[u]` is non-zero but all incident edges are already decided.\n\nLet's refine step 4 and 5 slightly. The initial `current_net_outflow` values for 1 and `n` are their *target* values. For intermediate nodes, the target is 0.\nWe can use `balance[v]` to track `target_net_outflow[v] - current_net_outflow[v]`.\nInitially: `balance[1] = F`, `balance[n] = -F`, `balance[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`.\nWhen we decide `u -> v` with capacity `c`:\n`balance[u]` decreases by `c`.\n`balance[v]` increases by `c`.\nWe want all `balance[v]` to become 0.\n\nLet's use `excess[v]` as the amount of flow that *must* eventually leave `v` through its undecided edges to satisfy its final balance.\nInitially:\n`excess[1] = F` (all flow must leave 1)\n`excess[n] = -F` (all flow must enter n)\n`excess[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`.\n\nWhen an edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` is directed:\nIf `u -> v`: `excess[u] -= c`, `excess[v] += c`.\nIf `v -> u`: `excess[v] -= c`, `excess[u] += c`.\n\nA node `u` is added to the queue if `u` is not 1 or `n`, and `undecided_edges_count[u]` becomes 1.\nWhen processing `u` from queue:\nFind the unique undecided edge `(u, w, c, edge_idx)`.\nIf `excess[u] > 0`: `u` needs to *output* `excess[u]` flow. This edge must be `u -> w`.\n    `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (if `u` is `a_i` and `w` is `b_i`) or `1` (if `u` is `b_i` and `w` is `a_i`).\n    Update `excess[u] -= c`, `excess[w] += c`.\nIf `excess[u] < 0`: `u` needs to *input* `abs(excess[u])` flow. This edge must be `w -> u`.\n    `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (if `u` is `a_i` and `w` is `b_i`) or `0` (if `u` is `b_i` and `w` is `a_i`).\n    Update `excess[w] -= c`, `excess[u] += c`.\n\nAfter processing all intermediate nodes this way, all remaining undecided edges must be incident to 1 or `n`. For these edges:\nIf edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` connects to 1: it must be directed away from 1.\nIf edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` connects to `n`: it must be directed towards `n`.\nThis final step correctly sets the directions for edges directly connected to source/sink which were not determined by the intermediate nodes.\n\nThe problem guarantees a solution exists, so this process will successfully determine all directions. The \"no cycles\" condition is implicitly handled because we fix directions based on local flow conservation and propagate changes, effectively building a topological order.\n\nExample 1 walkthrough:\n3 3\n3 2 10 (idx 0)\n1 2 10 (idx 1)\n3 1 5  (idx 2)\n\n`n=3, m=3`\n`adj`:\n1: [(2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)]\n2: [(3, 10, 0), (1, 10, 1)]\n3: [(2, 10, 0), (1, 5, 2)]\n\n1.  `F = 10 + 5 = 15`.\n    `excess = [0, 15, 0, -15]` (for indices 0, 1, 2, 3)\n    `ans = [-1, -1, -1]`\n\n2.  `undecided_edges_count`:\n    `undecided_edges_count = [0, 2, 2, 2]` (for indices 0, 1, 2, 3)\n    `q = deque()`\n    Vertex 2 is intermediate. `undecided_edges_count[2]=2`.

This means we should prioritize fixing edges connected to 1 or `n` (if they are not fixed by the queue).\n\nLet's modify the queue processing:\nInstead of `undecided_edges_count[v] == 1`, we can use a simpler rule:\nInitialize `q` with all edges connected to 1.\n`q = [(1, 2, 10, 1), (1, 3, 5, 2)]` (represented as `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` where `u` is the source)\nNo, this is not a queue of edges. It's a queue of vertices whose balances are determined.\n\nA better way:\n1.  Initialize `excess[v]` as above.\n2.  For each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`:\n    *   `undecided_edges_count[v] = len(adj[v])`\n    *   If `v != 1` and `v != n` and `undecided_edges_count[v] == 1`: add `v` to `q`.\n\n3.

If not, something is wrong.\n        Wait, `excess[u]` is the *target* net outflow. We want to make it `0` by directing edges.\n        The current sum of flow values of edges directed *out* of `u` minus sum of flow values of edges directed *into* `u` must be `excess[u]`.\n        Let `current_sum_out_minus_in[u]` be `0` initially.\n        When we decide `u -> w`, `current_sum_out_minus_in[u] += c`, `current_sum_out_minus_in[w] -= c`.\n        We want `current_sum_out_minus_in[v] = excess[v]` for all `v`.\n\nLet's use the `current_balance` approach again, as it worked for the example.\n`current_balance[v]` is the *current* `sum(incoming flow) - sum(outgoing flow)`.\nTarget: `current_balance[1] = 0`, `current_balance[n] = F`, `current_balance[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`. (This definition is more standard for flow conservation problems)\nNo, this is not right. The problem states \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\". So `in_flow(1)=0`. This means `out_flow(1)=F`. So `in_flow(1) - out_flow(1) = -F`.\nSimilarly `out_flow(n)=0`, so `in_flow(n)=F`. So `in_flow(n) - out_flow(n) = F`.\nFor `1 < v < n`, `in_flow(v) - out_flow(v) = 0`.\n\nSo, `target_balance[1] = -F`, `target_balance[n] = F`, `target_balance[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`.\nInitialize `actual_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nInitialize `ans = [-1]*m`.\n`undecided_edges[v]` stores `(neighbor, capacity, edge_idx, original_a, original_b)` for edges incident to `v` that are not yet directed.\n`q = collections.deque()`\n\n1.
