Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. It's pretty straightforward, but let's break it down. We've got an array *a* of *n* integers, and we need to remove exactly one element to minimize the instability of the resulting array. Instability, as defined, is just the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\nMy immediate thought is to sort the array. Let's call the sorted array *a_sorted*, with elements s1 <= s2 <= ... <= sn. The initial instability is obviously sn - s1. Now, where do we cut?\n\nIf we remove anything other than the minimum (s1) or the maximum (sn), the range stays the same – sn - s1. That's a waste. So, the optimal solution must involve removing either s1 or sn.\n\nIf we drop s1, the new minimum becomes s2, and the maximum remains sn. The instability becomes sn - s2.\n\nIf we remove sn, the new minimum is s1, and the new maximum is s(n-1). The instability is now s(n-1) - s1.\n\nAny other removal is always greater than or equal to sn - s1, which is always greater than or equal to both sn - s2 and s(n-1) - s1.\n\nThe answer, then, is the minimum of those two possibilities: min(sn - s2, s(n-1) - s1).  It's a simple comparison after sorting the array. I just need to read in the input, sort it, and calculate that minimum instability. Easy peasy.\n",
