Find the minimum number of nodes required to create a $$$p$$$-reachable directed graph.Also, among all such $$$p$$$-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let $$$G$$$ denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to design a Python script, and I need to figure out how to approach this.  Essentially, the task boils down to finding the smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to create a *p*-reachable directed graph and then maximizing the unidirectional pairs within that minimal graph. I need to understand the definitions first.\n\nLet's see, a *p*-reachable graph is where exactly *p* pairs of nodes `(u, v)` exist such that `u < v` and there is a path from `u` to `v` and from `v` to `u` (meaning, the nodes are in the same strongly connected component - SCC). A unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means a path exists from `u` to `v` but not the reverse.\n\nNow, if I have an SCC with *k* nodes, the number of pairs that can reach each other and satisfy u < v is k*(k-1)/2. This comes from the fact any two distinct nodes are reachable from each other within an SCC. So, if I have `SCC_1, SCC_2, ... SCC_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of such pairs should add up to exactly *p*. This total will be `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2) = p`.  Also, I need to minimize the total number of nodes, which is just the sum of the sizes of the SCCs,  `n = sum(k_i)`.\n\nTo minimize `n` given *p*, my intuition tells me I should maximize the `k_i` values somehow. Because the function `k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, splitting one big SCC into several small ones would result in a less efficient number of nodes to achieve `p`. Think about it: splitting *k* into `k_a` and `k_b`. `k = k_a + k_b`. So, intuitively I need to keep the sizes of the SCCs as big as possible to minimize the overall number of nodes. So, I will focus on finding SCC sizes that will help me minimize the overall nodes used while getting to the *p* target.\n",
