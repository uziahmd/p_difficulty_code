Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Substitutes in Number Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where you have a starting string of digits, and then a series of rules that replace digits with other strings. The ultimate goal is to figure out the final numerical value of this transformed string, modulo a specific prime number. The catch? The string can grow insanely large due to these replacements, so direct manipulation won't cut it.\n\nThe core idea here is to avoid building the entire giant string. Instead, I need to track how each *original* digit contributes to the final number.  I'm thinking I'll represent each digit's \"value\" and \"length\" after all the transformations. \"Value\" is the numerical contribution (modulo the big prime), and \"length\" is the number of digits it will eventually become. Length needs a separate modulo operation with a number one less than the original prime, due to how it will be used as an exponent.\n\nThe key insight is the order of queries matters. If I process them in reverse, I can figure out what each digit ultimately becomes *after* all the replacements. Starting from the end and working backward seems like the smartest move here. The initial values for digits is easy, just their numeric value, and their length is one.\n\nFor each query, I'll update the values and lengths. When a digit is replaced, I need to compute the new value and length based on what the replacement string has become *so far*. This is done recursively as each character in the replacement string can also be replaced by queries.\n\nI'm thinking of initializing two arrays, `val` and `length`, for each digit from 0 to 9. I'll then process the queries in reverse. When I have the current state, and a query `di -> ti` I'll have to compute new `val[di]` and `len[di]` with the existing `val` and `len` that reflect the transformations so far. For ti, loop over each character of ti and use a formula. `new_val_di = (new_val_di * 10^length[digit_c] + val[digit_c])`. Each `char_c` in the string `ti` will contribute to the value of new `di`.\n\nFinally, after all replacements have occurred, I'll iterate through the original string and compute the final number, using the `val` and `length` arrays to determine the contribution of each digit in the initial string.\n\nThe code will iterate in reverse, doing a character by character loop in each replacement. The final calculation also has a loop for each character. It looks like it is going to be O(n*S + |s|) with n being the number of queries, S the total length of the query strings, and |s| the initial string.\n\nLet's test this with some examples to make sure the logic is sound. Looks like the approach should work!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become very long, so direct string manipulation is not feasible.\n\n**Key Idea: Reverse Processing and Dynamic Programming**\n\nInstead of applying replacements to the string `s` directly, we can determine what each digit `0` through `9` ultimately transforms into. Let's define:\n*   `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that digit `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n*   `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD - 1`. (Lengths are used as exponents for powers of 10, so by Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) (mod MOD)`).\n\nThe crucial observation is that a query `di -> ti` affects all occurrences of `di`. If we process queries in their given order, a later query `d_j -> t_j` might change a digit `d_j` that was part of some `t_i` from an earlier query. This makes forward processing complicated.\n\nHowever, if we process queries in **reverse order**, the problem simplifies:\n1.  **Initial State (after all queries conceptually applied):** Each digit `d` maps to itself. So, `val[d] = d` and `length[d] = 1` for `d = 0, ..., 9`.\n2.  **Processing a query `di -> ti` (in reverse):** When we process `di -> ti`, we are determining what `di` maps to *before this specific query was applied*, given what all other digits `c` map to *after this query was applied*.\n    Therefore, the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` will be derived from the string `ti`. For each character `c` in `ti` (from left to right):\n    *   The value `val[c]` and length `length[c]` (which are the *current* values in our arrays, reflecting the transformations from queries *after* the current one) are used.\n    *   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD`\n    *   `new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[c]) % (MOD - 1)`\n    After iterating through all characters in `ti`, we update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `length[di] = new_length_di`.\n    If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` and `new_length_di` will remain `0`, which correctly represents an empty string having value 0 and length 0.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:** After processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will store the ultimate value and length for each original digit `d`. We then iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n    *   `final_result_val = (final_result_val * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD`\n    *   `final_result_length = (final_result_length + length[c]) % (MOD - 1)` (This is not strictly needed for the answer, but helps track the total length).\n\n**Modulo and Exponents:**\nThe modulus is `MOD = 1000000007`.\nFor exponents in `pow(10, exp, MOD)`, we use `exp % (MOD - 1)`. This is because `MOD` is a prime number, and by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(p-1) % p = 1` for prime `p` and integer `a` not divisible by `p`. So, `10^L % MOD = 10^(L % (MOD - 1)) % MOD`.\n\n**Example Trace (from problem): s = \"222\", queries: \"2->0\", \"0->7\"**\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_EXP = 1000000006`\n\n1.  **Initial state (for reverse processing):**\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  **Process query \"0->7\" (last query in input, first in reverse):**\n    `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_length_0 = 0`\n    For `c = '7'`: `digit_c = 7`. Current `val[7]=7`, `length[7]=1`.\n    `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_length_0 = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    Update: `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n\n3.  **Process query \"2->0\" (first query in input, second in reverse):**\n    `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_length_2 = 0`\n    For `c = '0'`: `digit_c = 0`.

Given constraints, this is roughly `(10^5 + 10^5) * log(10^9) = 2 * 10^5 * 30`, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space:** `O(N + S_L)` for storing queries (if needed, otherwise `O(1)` for `val` and `length` arrays).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the initial string s\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Read the number of queries\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        di = int(parts[0])  # The digit to be replaced\n        ti = parts[1]       # The string to replace it with\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = 1000000006 # MOD - 1, used for exponents in pow(10, exp, MOD)\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9.\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value that digit 'd' eventually transforms into.\n    # length[d] stores the length of the string that digit 'd' eventually transforms into.\n    # Initially, each digit 'd' transforms into itself, so value is d, length is 1.\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order.\n    # This allows us to determine the final mapping for each digit based on\n    # what digits *after* the current query would map to.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_length_di = 0\n\n        # Calculate the new value and length for di based on ti.\n        # Iterate through characters in ti from left to right.\n        for char_c in ti:\n            digit_c = int(char_c)\n            \n            # To append val[digit_c] to new_val_di, we need to shift new_val_di\n            # left by length[digit_c] positions (i.e., multiply by 10^(length[digit_c])).\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD\n            \n            # The new length is the sum of current new_length_di and length[digit_c].\n            new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[digit_c]) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        # Update the mappings for di.\n        # If ti was an empty string, new_val_di and new_length_di correctly remain 0.\n        val[di] = new_val_di\n        length[di] = new_length_di\n    \n    # After all queries are processed in reverse, val[] and length[] arrays\n    # hold the final transformation rules for each original digit.\n    # Now, calculate the final value of the initial string s.\n    final_result_val = 0\n\n    for char_c in s:\n        digit_c = int(char_c)\n        # Apply the final transformation for each digit in the original string s.\n        final_result_val = (final_result_val * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD\n    \n    # Print the final result.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result_val) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
