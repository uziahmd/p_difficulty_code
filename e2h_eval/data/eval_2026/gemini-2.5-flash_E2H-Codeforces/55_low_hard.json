    "thought": "**My Approach to Minimizing a Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string given these specific swap rules. My first instinct is to break down what the allowed moves *actually* mean. Clearly, '0' and '1' can swap, and '1' and '2' can swap, but not '0' and '2' directly. \n\nThis leads me to think about what kind of movement each digit enables. '0's can essentially move past '1's, '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, and '2's can move past '1's. The crucial piece is that '0's and '2's *cannot* pass each other.\n\nI tried to visualize this with an example string like \"012\", but it became pretty clear that there's no way to directly or indirectly swap a '0' and a '2' across each other.  Whether I try to move the '0' past the '2' or vice versa, the disallowed \"02\" or \"20\" swap always pops up.\n\nThis is where the real insight hits me: the relative order of '0's and '2's is *invariant*.  If a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it'll *always* come before that '2' in any string achievable via these swaps. Similarly, if a '2' comes before a '0', that order will be preserved. This is a game-changer. \n\nSo, I realize that '0's and '2's act as sort of \"boundaries\" for each other. '1's, on the other hand, are the free agents; they can move anywhere relative to the '0's and '2's.  Now, the problem is about efficiently sorting the '1's relative to those fixed '0's and '2's to produce the lexicographically smallest string. This key observation simplifies the problem significantly!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are:\n1. '0' and '1' (e.g., \"01\" <-> \"10\")\n2. '1' and '2' (e.g., \"12\" <-> \"21\")\nCrucially, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly (e.g., \"02\" <-> \"20\" is not allowed).\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these rules:\n- A '0' can move past a '1'.\n- A '1' can move past a '0' and a '2'.\n- A '2' can move past a '1'.\n\nConsider the relative order of '0's and '2's. Can a '0' ever move past a '2', or vice versa?\nSuppose we have \"0X2\".\nIf X is '1': \"012\".\n  - Swap '0' and '1': \"102\". Now '0' is still before '2'.\n  - Swap '1' and '2': \"021\". Now '0' is still before '2'.\n  In \"102\", '0' cannot swap with '2'. '1' can swap with '0' (\"012\") or with nothing.\n  In \"021\", '0' cannot swap with '2'. '2' can swap with '1' (\"012\") or with nothing.\nIt seems that the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the initial string, it will always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it will always stay before that '0'.\n\nThis observation is key: the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot change.\n'1's, on the other hand, can move past both '0's and '2's. This means '1's are highly mobile.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- Count of '0's: `count_0`\n- Count of '1's: `count_1`\n- Count of '2's: `count_2`\n\nSince '0's and '2's cannot change their relative order, we can think of the string as being composed of segments. A '1' can move freely through any segment of '0's and '2's.\nHowever, to put '0's first, we would move all '0's to the left. Any '0' can move past any '1' to its left.\nSimilarly, to put '2's last, we would move all '2's to the right. Any '2' can move past any '1' to its right.\n\nConsider the '1's. Since they can swap with both '0's and '2's, they can essentially move anywhere.\nIf we want the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\nThe only constraint is the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nLet's try to construct the minimum string:\n1. All '0's should come first. We can move any '0' past any '1' to its left.\n2. All '2's should come last. We can move any '2' past any '1' to its right.\n\nWhat about '1's? They can move freely.\nSuppose we have a string like \"021\". We want to make it \"012\".\n\"021\" -> \"012\" (swap '2' and '1'). This is possible.\n\nSuppose we have \"201\". We want to make it \"012\".\n\"201\" -> \"210\" (swap '0' and '1').\nNow we have \"210\". Can '2' move past '1' to the right? No, '2' is already at the left.\nCan '0' move past '2'? No, relative order of '0' and '2' is fixed.\nSo \"201\" cannot become \"012\". It can become \"210\".\n\"210\" is lexicographically larger than \"201\". So \"201\" is the best we can do if we start with \"201\".\n\nThis confirms the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's. These will form the prefix of our result.\n2. Collect all '2's. These will form the suffix of our result.\n3. The '1's are flexible. They can be placed anywhere between the '0's and '2's, or even within '0's or '2's if there are no '0'/'2' boundaries.\n\nHowever, the '1's can move past '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can effectively coalesce.\nWhere should these '1's go to make the string lexicographically minimal?\nThey should go after all '0's and before all '2's.\n\nLet's trace the characters:\n- All '0's that appear *before* the first '1' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\n- All '0's that appear *after* a '1' can also be moved to the left, past that '1'.\n- Any '0' can move past any '1'. So all '0's can be grouped together at the beginning.\n- Any '2' can move past any '1'. So all '2's can be grouped together at the end.\n\nThe only constraint is the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nThis means we can essentially separate the string into parts:\n- A prefix of '0's.\n- A block of '1's.\n- A suffix of '2's.\nBut this is not quite right because of the '0' vs '2' relative order.\n\nConsider the string `s`.\nExtract all '0's and '2's, keeping their relative order. Let this sequence be `s_02`.\nExample: \"100210\" -> \"0020\"\nNow, where do the '1's go?\nAll '1's can move past any '0' and any '2'.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest:\n- '0's should be as far left as possible.\n- '1's should be after '0's.\n- '2's should be after '1's.\n\nThis means we should put all '0's first. Then all '1's. Then all '2's.\nThe only characters that can break this pattern are '0's and '2's that are in the \"wrong\" relative order.\nExample: \"20\"\n`s_02` is \"20\".\nNumber of '1's is 0.\nResult: \"20\". This is correct.\n\nExample: \"100210\"\nNumber of '1's: 2.\nString without '1's: \"0020\".\nThis \"0020\" maintains the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nWe want to insert the two '1's into \"0020\" to make it lexicographically smallest.\nThe '1's should be placed as far left as possible, but *after* any '0's.\nSo, the '1's should be placed right after all the '0's in the \"0020\" sequence.\n\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\". This is the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems to work:\n1. Count all '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `num_ones`.\n2. Construct a new string `s_prime` by taking all characters from `s` that are NOT '1', keeping their original relative order.\n3. Find the first occurrence of '2' in `s_prime`.\n   - If `s_prime` contains no '2's (i.e., it's all '0's), then the result is `s_prime` followed by `num_ones` '1's. (e.g., \"000\" + \"11\" = \"00011\")\n   - If `s_prime` contains '2's, then the result is `s_prime` up to (but not including) the first '2', followed by `num_ones` '1's, followed by the rest of `s_prime` starting from the first '2'. (e.g., \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\")\n\nLet's test this strategy with the given examples:\n\nInput: \"100210\"\n1. `num_ones` = 2\n2. `s_prime` = \"0020\" (remove '1's from \"100210\")\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 2.\n   - Prefix of `s_prime` before first '2': \"00\"\n   - Suffix of `s_prime` from first '2' onwards: \"20\"\n   Result: \"00\" + \"11\" (two '1's) + \"20\" = \"001120\". Matches example output.\n\nInput: \"11222121\"\n1. `num_ones` = 4\n2. `s_prime` = \"2222\" (remove '1's from \"11222121\")\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 0.\n   - Prefix of `s_prime` before first '2': \"\" (empty string)\n   - Suffix of `s_prime` from first '2' onwards: \"2222\"\n   Result: \"\" + \"1111\" (four '1's) + \"2222\" = \"11112222\". Matches example output.\n\nInput: \"20\"\n1. `num_ones` = 0\n2. `s_prime` = \"20\" (no '1's to remove)\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 0.\n   - Prefix of `s_prime` before first '2': \"\"\n   - Suffix of `s_prime` from first '2' onwards: \"20\"\n   Result: \"\" + \"\" (zero '1's) + \"20\" = \"20\". Matches example output.\n\nThis strategy seems robust. The reasoning is that '1's are completely mobile relative to '0's and '2's. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's. The only constraint is the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's. So, we place all '0's and '2's in their fixed relative positions. Then, we insert all the '1's at the earliest possible position in this '0'-'2' sequence to minimize the string. This position is right after all '0's that appear before any '2's, or simply at the beginning if there are no '0's, or right before the first '2' if there are '2's. This is equivalent to finding the first '2' in the `s_prime` string and inserting all '1's there. If no '2' is found, it means `s_prime` consists only of '0's, so the '1's go at the very end of `s_prime`.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string `s`.\n- Count '1's.\n- Build `s_prime` by appending '0's and '2's.\n- Find the index of the first '2' in `s_prime`. Python's `str.find()` method is suitable.\n- Construct the result string using string concatenation or `join`.\n\nEdge cases:\n- String contains only '1's: e.g., \"111\". `num_ones` = 3. `s_prime` = \"\". First '2' not found. Result: \"111\". Correct.\n- String contains only '0's: e.g., \"000\". `num_ones` = 0. `s_prime` = \"000\". First '2' not found. Result: \"000\". Correct.\n- String contains only '2's: e.g., \"222\". `num_ones` = 0. `s_prime` = \"222\". First '2' at index 0. Result: \"\" + \"\" + \"222\" = \"222\". Correct.\n- String is empty: Problem statement says length is between 1 and 10^5, so not possible.\n\nThe approach seems solid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    # Use a list to build s_prime for efficient character appending\n    s_prime_chars = [] \n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_prime_chars.append(char)\n    \n    s_prime = \"\".join(s_prime_chars)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's\n    # If there are '2's, they should be placed right before the first '2' in s_prime\n    # If there are no '2's, they should be placed at the end of s_prime\n    \n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_prime)):\n        if s_prime[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    result_list = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in s_prime, so s_prime consists only of '0's (or is empty)\n        # All '1's go at the end\n        result_list.append(s_prime)\n        result_list.append('1' * num_ones)\n    else:\n        # '2's exist.
