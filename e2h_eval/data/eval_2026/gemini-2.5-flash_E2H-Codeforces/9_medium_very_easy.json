Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem. My main focus is on efficiency given the constraints.**\n\nIt's clear I'm dealing with a knapsack variation. I need to select souvenirs to maximize their total cost while staying within a weight limit (`M`). Each souvenir has a weight (`w_i`) and a cost (`c_i`). The significant thing here is that the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. This is the key, as it's not a general knapsack where the weight could be huge.\n\nThe naive approach (dynamic programming with all weights) is too slow -  `O(N * M)` would be a disaster given `N=10^5` and `M=3*10^5`. I can't iterate through every single combination directly.\n\nSince the weights are small, I should use this to my advantage. I'm thinking of sorting the souvenirs by their weights and costs (within each weight group) in descending order to prioritize the most valuable items. This means I'll have `costs1`, `costs2`, and `costs3` (items of weight 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Pre-computing prefix sums (`ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3`) for each group is essential for quick cost lookups later.\n\nI need to figure out how many items of each weight I take, let's call them `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The total weight constraint is  `1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= M`. My goal is to maximize `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]`.\n\nIterating through all possible combinations of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is probably too slow. Trying to fix one and optimizing the rest is the way to go here. I tried fixing the number of weight-3 items (`k3`), but iterating all the combinations of `k1` and `k2` for each `k3` proved to be the bottleneck.\n\nI considered dynamic programming to fill the remaining capacity after taking items of weight 3. A subproblem would be:  Given a weight capacity `W`, what is the maximum cost I can get using weight 1 and 2 items? It seems I should precompute `dp_1_2[w]` the max cost to get weight `w` using 1s and 2s and solve this beforehand.\n\nThe tricky part is that `dp_1_2[w]` is not so easy to calculate fast. I think there is an efficient `O(M)` solution, where I take the items in `costs2` one by one, and build the solution by iterating backwards in `dp_1_2[w]`.\n\nIt might also be possible to simplify the problem into one item type (after having the weight 3 items determined). This would involve combining two weight-1 items to simulate a weight-2 item, which might over-complicate things. It may not even be helpful.\n\nAfter all, I decided to go with a two-pass approach. First, determine how to make the best weight using 1 and 2, and then how to combine it with weight-3 items. This might be faster because of the precalculated weight solution.\n\nMy intuition says the solution lies in a clever way of using the precomputed prefix sums and making use of the small weight to improve the efficiency. I still need to find a way to avoid any nested loop as they are slowing down my algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`, such that the total weight does not exceed `m` and the total cost is maximized. The key constraints are `1 <= n <= 100000`, `1 <= m <= 300000`, and most importantly, `1 <= w_i <= 3`.\n\nSince the weights `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3, we can categorize the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights. To maximize the total cost, for each group, we should always pick the most expensive items first. So, we sort the costs within each group in descending order.\n\nLet `costs1`, `costs2`, and `costs3` be lists of costs for souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3 respectively, sorted in descending order.\nLet `ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3` be their respective prefix sum arrays. `psX[k]` will store the sum of the top `k` costs from `costsX`.\n\nThe problem then becomes: find `k1, k2, k3` (number of items taken from each group) such that `1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m` and `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]` is maximized.\n\nA common technique for knapsack problems with small item weights is to iterate over one or two types of items and use a precomputed DP table or a two-pointer approach for the remaining types.\nHere, `m` can be up to `300000`. Iterating over `k1`, `k2`, or `k3` directly for the outer loop would be too slow if the loop runs `O(m)` times.\n\nLet's define `dp[w]` as the maximum cost achievable for *exactly* weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`.\n1. Initialize `dp[w] = -1` for `w > 0` and `dp[0] = 0`. This indicates that `w` is not achievable yet or has 0 cost.\n2. Fill `dp` using items of weight 1:\n   For `k1` from `0` to `len(costs1)`:\n     If `k1 <= m`: `dp[k1] = ps1[k1]`.\n   (Note: `dp[w]` now stores the max cost for weight `w` using only weight 1 items, or -1 if `w` is not possible with weight 1 items).\n3. Now, incorporate items of weight 2. This is where the standard 0/1 knapsack DP for multiple items of the same type comes in.\n   For `k2` from `1` to `len(costs2)`:\n     Let `c2 = costs2[k2-1]` (the `k2`-th most expensive item of weight 2).\n     For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n       If `dp[w-2]` is not `-1` (meaning `w-2` weight is achievable by previous items):\n         `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-2] + c2)`.\nThis DP calculation takes `O(len(costs1) + len(costs2) * m)`. Since `len(costs2)` can be `O(n)` and `m` can be `3*10^5`, this is `O(n*m)`, which is too slow (`10^5 * 3*10^5 = 3*10^{10}`).\n\nThe key insight for `dp[w]` using items of weight 1 and 2 efficiently:\nFor a given total weight `W`, we want to find `k1, k2` such that `k1 + 2*k2 = W` and `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` is maximized.\nWe can iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(costs2)`. For each `k2`:\n  `current_cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `current_weight_2 = 2 * k2`\n  If `current_weight_2 > W`, we can't use this many weight 2 items.\n  `remaining_weight = W - current_weight_2`.\n  We take `k1 = min(len(costs1), remaining_weight)` items of weight 1.\n  `current_cost_1 = ps1[k1]`.\n  The total cost for this `k2` choice is `current_cost_1 + current_cost_2`.\n  We need to find the maximum among these choices.\nThis calculation for a single `W` takes `O(len(costs2))` time.\nIf we do this for all `W` from `0` to `m`, it's `O(m * len(costs2))`, still too slow.\n\nHowever, `dp[w]` is the maximum cost for exactly weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp[w]` for all `w` in `O(m)` time using a different approach:\n`dp[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= w/2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(costs1), w - 2*k2)])`.\nThis still looks like `O(m * m/2)`.\n\nThe crucial part is that `ps1[min(len(costs1), w - 2*k2)]` is a non-increasing function of `k2` for fixed `w`. `ps2[k2]` is non-decreasing. This structure suggests a two-pointer approach or similar optimization.\n\nLet's precompute `dp12[w]` as the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp12 = [-1] * (m + 1)`\n`dp12[0] = 0`\n`j = 0` (index for `costs1`)\n`current_cost1 = 0`\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n    While `j < len(costs1)` and `w + 1 <= m` and `current_cost1 + costs1[j] > dp12[w+1]` (if `dp12[w+1]` is not set yet, or we can improve it):\n        `current_cost1 += costs1[j]`\n        `j += 1`\n        `dp12[j] = current_cost1` (This is not correct, `dp12[w]` should be the max cost for exactly `w`)\n\nLet's reformulate `dp12[w]` properly:\n`dp12 = [-1] * (m + 1)`\n`dp12[0] = 0`\n`k1_max = min(len(costs1), m)`\nFor `k1` from `0` to `k1_max`:\n    `dp12[k1] = ps1[k1]`\nNow we iterate over `k2` (number of weight 2 items).\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(costs2)`:\n    `c2 = costs2[k2-1]`\n    For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n        If `dp12[w-2] != -1`:\n            `dp12[w] = max(dp12[w], dp12[w-2] + c2)`\nThis is `O(N_2 * M)`, which is too slow.\n\nThe correct and efficient way to compute `dp12[w]` for all `w` in `O(M)` time:\nWe need `dp12[w]` to be the maximum cost for *exactly* weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp12 = [-1] * (m + 1)`\n`dp12[0] = 0`\n`j = 0` (index for `costs1`)\n`current_cost1 = 0`\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n    If `j < len(costs1)`:\n        `current_cost1 = ps1[j+1]`\n    `dp12[w] = current_cost1`\n    `j += 1`\n\nThis is for only items of weight 1.\nTo combine items of weight 1 and 2 efficiently:\nIterate over `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\nFor each `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs2), m/2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = 2 * k2`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - weight_k2`\n  We need to fill `remaining_capacity` with items of weight 1.\n  The maximum cost for this is `ps1[min(len(costs1), remaining_capacity)]`.\n  The total cost for this `k2` is `cost_k2 + ps1[min(len(costs1), remaining_capacity)]`.\n  We want to find the maximum possible cost.\n\nThis is a single loop over `k2`, which runs `O(M)` times. Inside the loop, `ps1` and `ps2` lookups are `O(1)`. So this approach is `O(M)`.\nThis computes the max cost using only items of weight 1 and 2, but it sums up costs for `k1` and `k2` where `1*k1 + 2*k2 <= W`.\nWe need `dp_1_2[W]` to be the max cost for *exactly* `W`.\n\nLet `max_cost_1_2[w]` be the maximum cost using items of weight 1 and 2 to achieve *at most* weight `w`.\n`max_cost_1_2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1 = 0`\n`k2 = 0`\n`current_cost = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n    `max_cost_1_2[w] = max_cost_1_2[w-1]` (can always take fewer items)\n    If `k1 < len(costs1)` and `current_cost + costs1[k1] > max_cost_1_2[w]`:\n        `k1_cost = costs1[k1]`\n        `k1_count = k1 + 1`\n        `current_cost_1 = ps1[k1_count]`\n        `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], current_cost_1)`\n        `k1 += 1`\n    If `k2 < len(costs2)` and `w >= 2` and `current_cost + costs2[k2] > max_cost_1_2[w]`:\n        `k2_cost = costs2[k2]`\n        `k2_count = k2 + 1`\n        `current_cost_2 = ps2[k2_count]`\n        `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], current_cost_2)`\n        `k2 += 1`\nThis is still not correct.\n\nLet's use the standard DP approach for small weights, but optimize it with prefix sums.\n`max_cost_1_2[w]` = maximum cost for *exactly* weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`max_cost_1_2 = [-1] * (m + 1)`\n`max_cost_1_2[0] = 0`\n\nFor `k1` from `0` to `len(costs1)`:\n    If `k1 <= m`:\n        `max_cost_1_2[k1] = ps1[k1]`\n\nNow, iterate over `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\nFor `k2_idx` from `0` to `len(costs2) - 1`:\n    `c2 = costs2[k2_idx]`\n    For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n        If `max_cost_1_2[w-2] != -1`:\n            `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], max_cost_1_2[w-2] + c2)`\nThis is `O(N_2 * M)`. It is too slow.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M)` or `O(N log N)`.\nThe key observation for `w_i <= 3` is that we can iterate on the number of items of weight 3.\nLet `k3` be the number of items of weight 3 we take.\n`k3` can range from `0` to `min(len(costs3), m/3)`.\nThe maximum value of `k3` is `m/3`, which is `300000/3 = 100000`. This is `O(N)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost3 = ps3[k3]`\n  `remaining_weight = m - 3 * k3`\n  We need to fill `remaining_weight` with items of weight 1 and 2.\n  Let `f(W)` be the maximum cost for *at most* weight `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n  `f(W)` can be computed efficiently.\n  For a given `W`, we iterate over `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\n  `0 <= k2 <= min(len(costs2), W/2)`.\n  For each `k2`, we use `2*k2` weight and `ps2[k2]` cost.\n  Remaining weight `W - 2*k2`.\n  We use `k1 = min(len(costs1), W - 2*k2)` items of weight 1, with cost `ps1[k1]`.\n  So `f(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(costs2), W/2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(costs1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n  This computation for a single `W` takes `O(len(costs2))` time.\n  If we compute `f(remaining_weight)` for each `k3` in the loop, total time is `O(N_3 * N_2)`. Still too slow.\n\nWe need to precompute `f(W)` for all `W` from `0` to `m`.\nLet `dp_val_12[w]` be the maximum cost for *at most* weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_val_12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`ptr_1 = 0` (pointer for `costs1`)\n`ptr_2 = 0` (pointer for `costs2`)\n`current_cost_1 = 0`\n`current_cost_2 = 0`\n\nThis is a classic variation of the change-making problem or knapsack with small item types.\nThe most efficient way to compute `dp_val_12[w]` for all `w` is as follows:\n`dp_val_12 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`k1_idx = 0`\n`k2_idx = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n    `val1 = 0`\n    If `k1_idx < len(costs1)`:\n        `val1 = costs1[k1_idx]`\n    \n    `val2 = 0`\n    If `k2_idx < len(costs2)` and `w >= 2`:\n        `val2 = costs2[k2_idx]`\n\n    `dp_val_12[w] = dp_val_12[w-1]` (Option to not take any item at `w`)\n\n    If `val1 > 0`:\n        `dp_val_12[w] = max(dp_val_12[w], dp_val_12[w-1] + val1)`\n    If `val2 > 0`:\n        `dp_val_12[w] = max(dp_val_12[w], dp_val_12[w-2] + val2)`\n\nThis is still not right.

Iterate `k1` from `0` to `min(len(w1_items), m)`:\n   `current_cost = ps1[k1]`\n   `remaining_weight = m - k1`\n   Now, we need to fill `remaining_weight` with items of weight 2 and 3.\n   This subproblem is solved by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_items), remaining_weight // 2)`.\n   For each `k2`:\n     `cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n     `rem_w_2 = remaining_weight - 2 * k2`\n     `k3 = min(len(w3_items), rem_w_2 // 3)`\n     `cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n     `max_total_cost = max(max_total_cost, current_cost + cost_2 + cost_3)`\nThis is `O(M * M/2)` which is `O(M^2)`. This is too slow.\n\nThe correct and fast approach for this problem is to iterate over the number of items of weight 3 (`k3`).\nFor each `k3`, we calculate `cost_3 = ps3[k3]` and `rem_w = m - 3*k3`.\nThen, we need to find the maximum cost for `rem_w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nThis subproblem is solved by iterating over `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\nFor each `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs2), rem_w // 2)`:\n    `cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n    `rem_w_1 = rem_w - 2*k2`\n    `k1 = min(len(costs1), rem_w_1)`\n    `cost_1 = ps1[k1]`\n    `max_total_cost = max(max_total_cost, cost_3 + cost_2 + cost_1)`\nThe problem here is that `k3` loop is `O(M/3)` and `k2` loop is `O(M/2)`. So `O(M^2)`.\n\nThe actual solution is to iterate over the number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) and for each `k2`, calculate the best `k1` and `k3`.\nThe total weight is `2*k2 + k1 + 3*k3 <= M`.\n`k1 + 3*k3 <= M - 2*k2`.\nLet `W' = M - 2*k2`.
