She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Tab-Closing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the fastest way to close tabs outside of a specific range, `[l, r]`.  I've got `n` tabs total, and the cursor is currently at position `pos`. The key is to minimize the total time, and the available operations are moving the cursor left or right (both take 1 second), and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also 1 second).\n\nMy immediate thought is to analyze the target state: I only want tabs `[l, r]` to remain open.  This means I'll definitely have to close tabs from `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.  That's a minimum of one or two close operations. The remaining time will be spent moving the cursor to the appropriate locations.\n\nLet me break down some scenarios to handle this efficiently.\n\nIf `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, then I am done, as the desired tabs are already the only ones open.  The cost is 0 seconds in this scenario.\n\nIf only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r = n`), the cursor has to be at `l` to close left. If the current position `pos` is to the right of `l`, or at `l`, I can simply move the cursor to `l` and then close to the left, with the steps being the absolute value of the difference between `pos` and `l`, plus 1 second for the close.  Otherwise (`pos < l`), I must move the cursor `l - pos` steps right, and then one second to close. This seems like it can be summarized as `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, and the cursor is at `pos`. Each move operation (left or right) costs 1 second, and each close operation (close all tabs to the left of cursor, or close all tabs to the right of cursor) also costs 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the target state: we need to keep tabs `l` through `r` open. This means we must close any tabs `1` through `l-1` and any tabs `r+1` through `n`.\n\nThere are a few cases:\n\n**Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l=1` and `r=n`. In this situation, all tabs are already within the desired range `[1, n]`.\nThe time required is `0` seconds.\n\n**Case 2: Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r=n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` or any tab to its right. We then perform a \"close tabs to the left\" operation.\nThe most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close.\n- Time to move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n- Time to perform the close operation: `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l=1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` or any tab to its left. We then perform a \"close tabs to the right\" operation.\nThe most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then close.\n- Time to move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n- Time to perform the close operation: `1` second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 4: Both tabs to the left of `l` and tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close `[1, l-1]` AND `[r+1, n]`.\nThis will always require two close operations, costing 2 seconds. The remaining time is for cursor movement.\nWe need to move the cursor to `l` to close left, and to `r` to close right. The order of closing doesn't matter, but the cursor movement path does.\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n*   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)` seconds. (This is always `r - l` since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n    Total time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)` seconds. (This is always `r - l` since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n    Total time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe minimum time for Case 4 is `min(Strategy A, Strategy B)`.\n`min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations into a single logic:\n\n1.  Initialize `time = 0`.\n2.  **Check if left side needs closing:** If `l > 1`:\n    *   We need to perform one close operation: `time += 1`.\n    *   We need to move the cursor to `l` at some point.\n3.  **Check if right side needs closing:** If `r < n`:\n    *   We need to perform one close operation: `time += 1`.\n    *   We need to move the cursor to `r` at some point.\n\nNow, let's consider the movement cost based on which sides need closing:\n\n*   **If `l=1` and `r=n` (Case 1):** `time = 0`.\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r=n` (Case 2):** `time = 1`. Movement cost is `abs(pos - l)`. Total: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n*   **If `l=1` and `r < n` (Case 3):** `time = 1`. Movement cost is `abs(pos - r)`. Total: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r < n` (Case 4):** `time = 2`.\n    We need to move from `pos` to `l` and from `pos` to `r`. Since `l` and `r` are the boundaries of the desired segment, the cursor must visit both `l` and `r` (or pass through them) to perform the respective close operations. The segment `[l, r]` must be traversed.\n    The total movement cost is `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l), abs(pos - r) + (r - l))`.\n    This simplifies to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l)`.\n    Total: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nExample 1: `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n`l > 1` and `r < n`. This is Case 4.\n`time = min(abs(3 - 2), abs(3 - 4)) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n`time = min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n`time = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n\nExample 2: `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\n`l = 1` and `r < n`. This is Case 3.\n`time = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n`time = abs(3 - 3) + 1`\n`time = 0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\nExample 3: `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\n`l = 1` and `r = n`. This is Case 1.\n`time = 0`. Correct.\n\nThis logic covers all cases correctly.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    time = 0\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed (r is already n).\n    if l > 1 and r == n:\n        time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed (l is already 1).\n    if l == 1 and r < n:\n        time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(time)\n        return\n\n    # Case 4: Both tabs to the left of l and tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n    # This implies l > 1 and r < n.\n    # We need 2 close operations (+2 seconds).\n    # We also need to traverse the segment [l, r] and reach both ends.\n    # The movement cost is min(distance from pos to l + distance from l to r,\n    #                          distance from pos to r + distance from r to l).\n    # Distance from l to r (or r to l) is always (r - l).\n    \n    # Option A: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right.\n    # Cost = abs(pos - l) (move to l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (move to r) + 1 (close right)\n    cost_A = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    # Option B: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left.\n    # Cost = abs(pos - r) (move to r) + 1 (close right) + (r - l) (move to l) + 1 (close left)\n    cost_B = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    \n    time = min(cost_A, cost_B)\n    print(time)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
