    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Ternary String Lexicographic Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a ternary string and need to find the lexicographically smallest version achievable through specific swaps. The allowed moves are the adjacent swapping of '0' and '1', and '1' and '2'. The crucial thing here is that '0' and '2' cannot directly swap.  This restriction immediately got me thinking about character mobility and relative order preservation.\n\nI realized that '0' can effectively pass through '1's, '1' can pass through both '0's and '2's, and '2' can pass through '1's. This leads to some interesting implications: '0's can arrange themselves freely among other '0's and '1's. '1's have even more freedom, and '2's are similarly restricted to their own space.\n\nNow, this gave me the hunch that the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed. I started testing it: Could a '0' ever get past a '2', or vice-versa? The answer, as I figured out, is a solid \"no\".  Even with intermediary '1's, the core issue is that a '0' and a '2' can't be switched. So, if a '0' is initially to the left of a '2', it'll *always* remain to the left. The same applies to a '2' being initially on the left of a '0'.\n\nTo solidify this understanding, I looked at a scenario where `s_i = '0'` and `s_j = '2'`, with `i < j`.  No matter how the swaps happen, that '0' from position `i` cannot bypass that '2' from `j`.  It is just not feasible to swap a '0' and '2'.  Hence, the final string's lexicographical order is directly influenced by the initial relative order of '0's and '2's. So, the only way to minimize the ternary string lexicographically is to arrange the characters based on their relative positions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping '0's and '2's is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means '0's and '1's can freely reorder among themselves. A '0' can effectively \"pass through\" any '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means '1's and '2's can freely reorder among themselves. A '1' can effectively \"pass through\" any '2', and vice versa.\n\nCrucially, '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. What does this imply for their relative order?\nIf we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j`:\n- If `i < j` (i.e., `...0...2...`), the '0' can never move past the '2' to its right, and the '2' can never move past the '0' to its left. This is because neither '0' nor '2' can swap with the other. Any '1's in between can move out of the way, but they don't enable a '0-2' swap.\n- If `i > j` (i.e., `...2...0...`), similarly, the '2' can never move past the '0' to its right, and the '0' can never move past the '2' to its left.\n\nThis means the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. If an original '0' appears before an original '2', it must always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. If an original '2' appears before an original '0', it must always appear before that '0'.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nConsider the '1's:\nA '1' can swap with any '0' (to move left or right).\nA '1' can swap with any '2' (to move left or right).\nThis means a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or '2'. Therefore, all '1's are completely mobile and can be grouped together anywhere in the string.\n\nSince we want the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to place '0's first.\nAll '0's can move past '1's. They cannot move past '2's.\nAll '2's can move past '1's. They cannot move past '0's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n`count_0`: number of '0's\n`count_1`: number of '1's\n`count_2`: number of '2's\n\nThe '1's can be moved to any position. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nAll '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the string, *as long as they don't have to move past any '2's*.\nSimilarly, all '2's can be moved to the very end of the string, *as long as they don't have to move past any '0's*.\n\nHowever, the '0's and '2's cannot cross each other. This is the key constraint.\nThis means all '0's that appear before *any* '2' in the original string can be moved to the beginning of the resulting string.\nAll '2's that appear after *any* '0' in the original string can be moved to the end of the resulting string.\n\nConsider the '1's. Since they are completely mobile with respect to '0's and '2's, they can be placed anywhere. To minimize the string lexicographically, they should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's.\n\nLet's find the first occurrence of '1' in the original string. Let this be `first_one_idx`.\nAll '0's appearing before `first_one_idx` can be moved to the beginning.\nAll '0's appearing after `first_one_idx` can also be moved to the beginning, because they can swap with '1's.\nThe only characters that can block '0's from moving to the very beginning are '2's.\n\nSo, the '0's will occupy the initial positions.\nThe '2's will occupy the final positions.\nThe '1's will be in the middle.\n\nHowever, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\nIf we have `0...2`, the '0' must stay before the '2'.\nIf we have `2...0`, the '2' must stay before the '0'.\n\nThis implies that if there is at least one '2' in the string, any '0's that appear *after* the first '2' cannot be moved to the left of that '2'.\nAnd any '2's that appear *before* the last '0' cannot be moved to the right of that '0'.\n\nLet's find the index of the first '2' in the string. If there are no '2's, then all '0's can be moved to the front, followed by all '1's.\nIf there are '2's, let `first_two_idx` be the index of the first '2'.\nAll '0's in the string can be moved to the left of `first_two_idx` (by swapping with '1's). They cannot move past `first_two_idx`.\nSo, all '0's will form a prefix.\nAll '2's will form a suffix.\nThe '1's will be placed *between* the '0's and '2's.\n\nExample: \"100210\"\n'0's: 3, '1's: 2, '2's: 1.\nThe first '2' is at index 3.\nAll '0's can move to the left of this '2'.\nSo, \"000\" should come first.\nThe '1's can be moved anywhere. To be lexicographically smallest, they should come after the '0's.\nSo, \"00011\".\nThen the '2's. \"000112\".\nThis logic is almost correct, but it ignores the fact that '0's cannot move past '2's.\nThe crucial observation is that all '1's are completely mobile. They can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nThen '1's.\nThen '2's.\n\nLet's find all '0's. Let's find all '2's.\nAll '1's can be removed from the string and stored separately.\nThe remaining string consists only of '0's and '2's. Let's call this `s_02`.\nExample: \"100210\" -> `s_02` = \"0020\" (after removing '1's)\nNow, `s_02` has fixed relative order. We cannot change \"02\" to \"20\".\nThe '1's can be inserted anywhere into `s_02`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to insert all '1's at the latest possible position, such that they don't block '0's from being at the front.\nThis means we should insert all '1's right before the first '2' in `s_02`.\nIf there are no '2's in `s_02`, then all '1's should be appended to `s_02`.\nIf there are no '0's in `s_02`, then all '1's should be prepended to `s_02`.\n\nLet's refine this:\n1. Count all '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `count_1`.\n2. Construct a new string `res` by taking all characters from `s` that are not '1'. This `res` string now only contains '0's and '2's, and their relative order is fixed.\n3. Find the first occurrence of '2' in `res`.\n   - If '2' is not found in `res` (meaning `res` only contains '0's, or is empty): Append `count_1` '1's to `res`. The result is `res` + \"1\"*`count_1`.\n   - If '2' is found in `res` at index `idx`: Insert `count_1` '1's at this position `idx`. The result is `res[0:idx]` + \"1\"*`count_1` + `res[idx:]`.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the examples:\n\nExample 1: \"100210\"\n1. `count_1 = 2` (at indices 0 and 4).\n2. `res` = \"0020\" (original string without '1's).\n3. First '2' in `res` is at index 2 (`res[2]`).\n4. `res[0:2]` = \"00\".\n   `res[2:]` = \"20\".\n   Insert two '1's: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 2: \"11222121\"\n1. `count_1 = 4`.\n2. `res` = \"2222\" (original string without '1's).\n3. First '2' in `res` is at index 0 (`res[0]`).\n4. `res[0:0]` = \"\".\n   `res[0:]` = \"2222\".\n   Insert four '1's: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 3: \"20\"\n1. `count_1 = 0`.\n2. `res` = \"20\".\n3. First '2' in `res` is at index 0 (`res[0]`).\n4. `res[0:0]` = \"\".\n   `res[0:]` = \"20\".\n   Insert zero '1's: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems correct and covers all cases. The logic is that '0's and '2's cannot change their relative order. All '1's are completely mobile. To get the lexicographically smallest string, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's. The only way '0's can be forced to appear after '1's is if they are blocked by '2's. By placing all '1's immediately before the first '2' (or at the end if no '2's), we allow all '0's to come first, and then the '1's appear as early as possible without disturbing any '0's.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the string once to count '1's and build `res`.\n- Use `res.find('2')` to find the insertion point.\n- String concatenation in Python can be `O(N)` for each operation, potentially leading to `O(N^2)`. For `N=10^5`, this is too slow.\n- A better approach for string building is to use a list of characters and then `\"\".join()`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    non_ones_chars = [] # This will store '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            non_ones_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # The '1's should be placed after all '0's that are not blocked by a '2',\n    # and before all '2's.\n    # Since '0's and '2's cannot cross each other, the effective boundary\n    # for '1's is right before the first '2' in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n    \n    result_list = []\n    inserted_ones = False\n\n    for char_non_one in non_ones_chars:\n        if char_non_one == '2' and not inserted_ones:\n            # This is the first '2' encountered in the non-ones sequence.\n            # Insert all '1's here.\n            result_list.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n            inserted_ones = True\n        result_list.append(char_non_one)\n    \n    # If no '2's were found in the non-ones sequence, or if all '0's came after all '2's\n    # (which isn't possible if '2's are found first and '1's are inserted),\n    # the '1's should be appended at the end.\n    # This specifically handles the case where non_ones_chars contains only '0's or is empty.\n    if not inserted_ones:\n        result_list.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_list) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
