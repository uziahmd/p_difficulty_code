The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Analysis of the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to deal with. The core of this problem is figuring out which positions a frog can reach within a specific range, considering its jump constraints. The input is kind of straightforward: a starting position, two jump sizes (`a` and `b`), and a range limit (`x`). The trick is the definition of `f(x)`. It's not just *can the frog reach x*, it's *how many distinct positions can the frog reach when the jump path to each position lies entirely within the [0, x] range.* This \"entire path within range\" is a major constraint.\n\nMy first thought was that this looks like a graph traversal problem. Each position is a node, and the jumps are edges. But I quickly realized the range `x` makes it a bit dynamic, with a new graph for each `x`. I considered BFS or DFS, but the large `x` value made that seem inefficient.\n\nI tried simplifying the problem by focusing on the `gcd(a, b)`. I initially thought if `g = gcd(a, b) > 1`, then the frog could only reach multiples of `g`. That's not the right interpretation, as the frog can take intermediary steps. The issue is that the frog must not leave the bounds of the range `[0, x]` by taking an intermediary step. I also thought about normalizing `a`, `b`, and `x`, so the overall formula becomes `sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`. This also is not the correct approach as this is not the property of this problem.\n\nThen I realized a standard approach: reachability modulo `b`. No matter the range, the frog's possible locations have remainders that always exist in a pattern. I can make an array, `reachable[k]` = true/false if `k` is reachable. The range `x` makes the approach inefficient.\n\nNow, with `gcd(a,b)=1`, I focused on *finding the \"minimum\" value for each residue modulo `b`.* This idea came from previous similar problems. Let `d[r]` be the smallest value congruent to `r` (mod `b`) that the frog can reach. Using the bounds of each residue class as the nodes, I can use a standard Dijkstra algorithm to solve this in a bounded time. Each node in this graph has edges connecting to `(+a, -b)`, which are bounded by the size of `b` and also the size of the jumps. This will have complexity `O(b)`. The main takeaway is that for a *given* `x`, I need the reachable positions, and I can compute them using this minimum distance. \n\nThis gives me the right methodology: solve this problem for a range `i` from `0 to m`, with the key factor being how the \"jump\" rules restrict reachability. For each `i`, I can calculate the reachable spots by applying the constraint and using the calculated minimum values. It also seems that the `min_val[r]` can be at most `a`, so this optimization makes the Dijkstra feasible. This allows me to compute `f(i)` efficiently, avoiding a brute-force approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`. All intermediate positions during any path must also stay within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. If `g > 1`, then all reachable positions must be multiples of `g`. We can scale down the problem: let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`. Then `f(x)` for `(a,b)` is equal to `f'(floor(x/g))` for `(a',b')`. The sum becomes `sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`. This sum can be rewritten as:\n`sum_{k=0}^{floor(m/g)-1} f'(k) * g + f'(floor(m/g)) * (m - floor(m/g)*g + 1)`.\nSo, we can first divide `a, b` by `g = gcd(a, b)` and adjust `m` and the summation accordingly. From now on, we assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\n\nLet `S(x)` be the set of reachable points for a given `x`. `f(x) = |S(x)|`.\nThe condition that all intermediate points must be in `[0, x]` is crucial. This means we can model the problem for a fixed `x` as a graph where nodes are `0, ..., x`. From node `k`, there are edges to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`). We want to count the number of nodes reachable from `0`.\n\nThe maximum value of `x` is `m = 10^9`, which is too large for a direct BFS for each `x`. However, `a` and `b` are up to `10^5`. This suggests that the solution should depend on `a` and `b` more directly than `m`.\n\nLet `d[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where the only constraint is `p >= 0`. We can find all `d[r]` for `r \\in [0, b-1]` using a 0-1 BFS (Dijkstra's with a deque).\nInitialize `d[0] = 0` and `d[r] = infinity` for `r \\ne 0`.\nPush `0` to a deque.\nWhile the deque is not empty:\n  Pop `rem` from the front.\n  1. Consider jumping `+a`: `next_rem_a = (rem + a) % b`. `val_a = d[rem] + a`.\n     If `val_a < d[next_rem_a]`: `d[next_rem_a] = val_a`. Push `next_rem_a` to the back of the deque (cost `a` is positive).\n  2. Consider jumping `-b`: `val_b = d[rem] - b`.\n     If `val_b >= 0` and `val_b < d[rem]`: `d[rem] = val_b`. Push `rem` to the front of the deque (cost `-b` is like a 0-cost edge if we consider relative changes, or negative cost for absolute values, so prioritize).\nThe values `d[r]` are bounded by `max(a, b)`. More precisely, `d[r] <= a` for all `r`. This is because if `d[r] > a`, then `d[r]-b` is also reachable and `d[r]-b \\equiv r \\pmod b`. If `d[r]-b \\ge 0`, then `d[r]` would not be the minimum. This implies `d[r]-b < 0` for all `d[r] > a`. This can only happen if `b` is very large compared to `a`, or `d[r]` is small. The maximum `d[r]` is `a`.\nThe complexity of this 0-1 BFS is `O(b)`.\n\nNow, for a given `x`, a point `p` is reachable if `p \\in [0, x]` and `p` can be reached from `0` with all intermediate points in `[0, x]`.\nThis means `p` must be of the form `d[p % b] + k*b` for some `k \\ge 0`.\nAlso, `p` must be reachable *without violating the upper bound `x`*.\nThis means that for `p` to be in `S(x)`, `p` must be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_k=p` where `0 \\le p_j \\le x`.\nThe set of points `S(x)` is exactly the set of points `p` such that `0 \\le p \\le x` and `p \\ge d[p % b]`.\nThis is because if `p \\ge d[p % b]`, then `p` can be reached from `d[p % b]` by adding `b` repeatedly. And `d[p % b]` is reachable from `0` without exceeding `a` (which is usually `max(a,b)`). If `d[p % b] \\le x`, then any path from `0` to `d[p % b]` stays within `[0, d[p % b]] \\subseteq [0, x]`. Then from `d[p % b]`, we can reach `d[p % b] + b, d[p % b] + 2b, ...` as long as they are `\\le x`.\nSo, `f(x) = |{p \\mid 0 \\le p \\le x \\text{ and } p \\ge d[p % b]}|`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n`f(i) = sum_{r=0}^{b-1} |{p \\mid p \\equiv r \\pmod b, d[r] \\le p \\le i}|`.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{b-1} max(0, floor((i - d[r])/b) + 1)` (if `i >= d[r]`, count `d[r], d[r]+b, ..., d[r]+k*b <= i`).\nThis sum is `sum_{r=0}^{b-1} sum_{i=d[r]}^{m} (floor((i - d[r])/b) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - d[r]`. Then `i = j + d[r]`.\nThe inner sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m-d[r]} (floor(j/b) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - d[r]`. We need `sum_{j=0}^{N} (floor(j/b) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently.\n`sum_{j=0}^{N} (floor(j/b) + 1) = sum_{j=0}^{N} floor(j/b) + sum_{j=0}^{N} 1`.\n`sum_{j=0}^{N} 1 = N+1`.\n`sum_{j=0}^{N} floor(j/b)`:\nThe term `floor(j/b)` takes value `0` for `j=0, ..., b-1` (b terms).\nIt takes value `1` for `j=b, ..., 2b-1` (b terms).\n...\nIt takes value `k` for `j=k*b, ..., (k+1)*b-1` (b terms).\nLet `q = N // b` and `rem = N % b`.\n`sum_{j=0}^{N} floor(j/b) = sum_{k=0}^{q-1} k*b + q*(rem+1)`.\n`sum_{k=0}^{q-1} k*b = b * sum_{k=0}^{q-1} k = b * q*(q-1)/2`.\nSo, `sum_{j=0}^{N} floor(j/b) = b * q*(q-1)/2 + q*(rem+1)`.\nThe total sum for a given `r` is `b * q*(q-1)/2 + q*(rem+1) + N+1`.\nWhere `q = (m - d[r]) // b` and `rem = (m - d[r]) % b`.\nThis needs to be calculated for each `r` from `0` to `b-1` and summed up.\nThe maximum value of `d[r]` is `a` (which is `10^5`).\n`m` is `10^9`. So `N` can be `10^9`. `q` can be `10^9 / 1 = 10^9`.\n`q*(q-1)/2` can be `(10^9)^2 / 2 = 0.5 * 10^{18}`. This fits in a 64-bit integer.\nThe final sum `sum_{r=0}^{b-1}` can be `b * 0.5 * 10^{18} = 10^5 * 0.5 * 10^{18} = 0.5 * 10^{23}`. This requires Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n\n**Summary of Algorithm:**\n1. Read `m, a, b`.\n2. Compute `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n3. If `g > 1`:\n   `m_prime = m // g`\n   `a_prime = a // g`\n   `b_prime = b // g`\n   `m_rem = m % g`\n   Call the function recursively/internally with `m_prime, a_prime, b_prime` to get `sum_f_prime`.\n   The final answer is `sum_f_prime * g + f_prime(m_prime) * (m_rem + 1)`.\n   To get `f_prime(m_prime)`, we need to compute `f(m_prime)` using the `d` array for `a_prime, b_prime`.\n   This is `sum_{r=0}^{b_prime-1} max(0, floor((m_prime - d[r])/b_prime) + 1)`.\n   Let's just compute `f(i)` for `i` up to `m_prime` and sum them up.\n   `ans = 0`\n   `current_sum_f_prime = 0`\n   `d_arr = compute_d(a_prime, b_prime)` (using `a_prime, b_prime`)\n   `for k in range(m_prime):`\n     `f_k = 0`\n     `for r in range(b_prime):`\n       `if k >= d_arr[r]:`\n         `f_k += (k - d_arr[r]) // b_prime + 1`\n     `current_sum_f_prime += f_k`\n     `ans += f_k * g`\n   `last_f_m_prime = 0`\n   `for r in range(b_prime):`\n     `if m_prime >= d_arr[r]:`\n       `last_f_m_prime += (m_prime - d_arr[r]) // b_prime + 1`\n   `ans += last_f_m_prime * (m_rem + 1)`\n   Return `ans`.\n   This is still `O(m_prime * b_prime)` which is too slow if `m_prime` is large.\n\nThe formula `sum_{r=0}^{b-1} (b * q_r*(q_r-1)/2 + q_r*(rem_r+1) + N_r+1)` is the correct way to sum `f(i)` directly.\nSo, the full algorithm is:\n1. Read `m, a, b`.\n2. Compute `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n3. Set `m_eff = m // g`, `a_eff = a // g`, `b_eff = b // g`.\n4. Compute `d[r]` for `r \\in [0, b_eff-1]` using 0-1 BFS with `a_eff, b_eff`.\n   `d` values are bounded by `a_eff`. Max `a_eff` is `10^5`. Max `b_eff` is `10^5`.\n   This takes `O(b_eff)` time.\n5. Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n6. For each `r` from `0` to `b_eff-1`:\n   If `m_eff < d[r]`: continue (no points reachable for this `r` up to `m_eff`).\n   `N_r = m_eff - d[r]`\n   `q_r = N_r // b_eff`\n   `rem_r = N_r % b_eff`\n   `sum_for_r = b_eff * q_r * (q_r - 1) // 2 + q_r * (rem_r + 1) + N_r + 1`\n   `total_sum += sum_for_r`\n7. The final answer is `total_sum * g`.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`. `g=gcd(5,3)=1`.\n`m_eff=7, a_eff=5, b_eff=3`.\nCompute `d` for `a=5, b=3`:\n`d[0]=0, d[1]=1, d[2]=2`.\n`total_sum = 0`.\n`r=0, d[0]=0`: `N_0 = 7-0=7`. `q_0 = 7//3 = 2`. `rem_0 = 7%3 = 1`.\n  `sum_for_0 = 3*2*(1)//2 + 2*(1+1) + 7+1 = 3 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n  `total_sum = 15`.\n`r=1, d[1]=1`: `N_1 = 7-1=6`. `q_1 = 6//3 = 2`. `rem_1 = 6%3 = 0`.\n  `sum_for_1 = 3*2*(1)//2 + 2*(0+1) + 6+1 = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12`.\n  `total_sum = 15 + 12 = 27`.\n`r=2, d[2]=2`: `N_2 = 7-2=5`. `q_2 = 5//3 = 1`. `rem_2 = 5%3 = 2`.\n  `sum_for_2 = 3*1*(0)//2 + 1*(2+1) + 5+1 = 0 + 3 + 6 = 9`.\n  `total_sum = 27 + 9 = 36`.\nFinal answer: `total_sum * g = 36 * 1 = 36`.\nWait, example output is `19`. What is wrong?\n\nThe mistake is in `f(x) = |{p \\mid 0 \\le p \\le x \\text{ and } p \\ge d[p % b]}|`.\nThis formula for `f(x)` is only correct if `x` is large enough that `d[r]` are all reachable within `[0, x]`.\nThe problem states: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis is a much stronger condition. `d[r]` is the minimum non-negative reachable `p` where `p \\equiv r \\pmod b`. But the path to `d[r]` itself might go above `x`.\nFor example, if `a=5, b=3, x=4`. `d[2]=2`. But to reach `2`, we might have a path `0 -> 5 -> 2`. This path goes through `5`, which is outside `[0, 4]`. So `2` is not reachable for `x=4`.\nFor `x=4`, `f(4)=1` (only `0` is reachable). My formula gives:\n`f(4) = sum_{r=0}^{2} max(0, floor((4 - d[r])/3) + 1)`\n`r=0, d[0]=0`: `max(0, floor(4/3)+1) = 1+1 = 2` (points `0, 3`).\n`r=1, d[1]=1`: `max(0, floor(3/3)+1) = 1+1 = 2` (points `1, 4`).\n`r=2, d[2]=2`: `max(0, floor(2/3)+1) = 0+1 = 1` (point `2`).\n`f(4) = 2+2+1 = 5`. This is wrong.\nThe set of reachable points for `x` is `S(x)`. It can be computed by BFS for small `x`.\nThe `d[r]` values are the minimum reachable values *without* an upper bound `x`.\nThe problem states \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\". This implies that for a point `p` to be reachable, all points on a path from `0` to `p` must be in `[0, x]`.\nThis is a standard BFS problem on `[0, x]`.\nFor small `x` (up to `a+b`), we can compute `f(x)` by BFS.\nLet `MAX_K = a+b`. For `x < MAX_K`, we can run BFS.\n`visited = [False] * (MAX_K + 1)`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`visited[0] = True`\n`current_f = 0`\n`ans = 0`\n`for i in range(MAX_K + 1):`\n  `while q:`\n    `u = q.popleft()`\n    `current_f += 1`\n    `if u + a <= i and not visited[u+a]:`\n      `visited[u+a] = True`\n      `q.append(u+a)`\n    `if u - b >= 0 and not visited[u-b]:`\n      `visited[u-b] = True`\n      `q.append(u-b)`\n  `ans += current_f`\nNo, this is not how `f(i)` works. `f(i)` is the count of reachable points *up to `i`*.\nThe BFS must be for each `i`. This is too slow.\n\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum upper bound `x` required to reach `k`.\n`dist[0] = 0`. All other `dist[k] = infinity`.\nUse a 0-1 BFS. Nodes are `0, ..., a+b-1`.\n`q = deque([0])`\n`dist[0] = 0`\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `u = q.popleft()`\n  // Jump `u+a`. The path `... -> u -> u+a` must be within `[0, max(dist[u], u+a)]`.\n  `new_x_for_ap = max(dist[u], u+a)`\n  `if u+a < MAX_K and new_x_for_ap < dist[u+a]:`\n    `dist[u+a] = new_x_for_ap`\n    `q.append(u+a)`\n  // Jump `u-b`. The path `... -> u -> u-b` must be within `[0, max(dist[u], u)]`.\n  `if u-b >= 0 and dist[u] < dist[u-b]:`\n    `dist[u-b] = dist[u]`\n    `q.appendleft(u-b)` (this is a 0-cost edge, so push_front)\nThe values `dist[k]` can be up to `a+b`.\nThe maximum `k` we care about is `a+b`. If `k >= a+b`, then `k-b` is still positive and `k` is reachable.\nSo the `dist` array can be computed for `k` up to `a+b`.\n`MAX_VAL = a+b`. `dist` array of size `MAX_VAL`.\n`dist[k]` stores the minimum `x` for which `k` is reachable.\nInitialize `dist = [infinity] * MAX_VAL`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `u = q.popleft()`\n  // Jump `u+a`\n  `v_a = u + a`\n  `new_x_a = max(dist[u], v_a)`\n  `if v_a < MAX_VAL and new_x_a < dist[v_a]:`\n    `dist[v_a] = new_x_a`\n    `q.append(v_a)`\n  // Jump `u-b`\n  `v_b = u - b`\n  `new_x_b = dist[u]`\n  `if v_b >= 0 and new_x_b < dist[v_b]:`\n    `dist[v_b] = new_x_b`\n    `q.appendleft(v_b)`\n\nAfter computing `dist` array for `k \\in [0, MAX_VAL-1]`:\n`f(x)` is the count of `k` such that `dist[k] <= x`.\nFor `x >= MAX_VAL`:\nAny `k \\ge MAX_VAL` can be reached if `dist[k-(MAX_VAL)] <= x-(MAX_VAL)`. This is not right.\nIf `x >= a+b-1`, then any `p` such that `p \\ge 0` and `p \\equiv k*a - l*b \\pmod g` is reachable.\nSince we assumed `g=1`, all `p \\ge 0` are reachable *eventually*.\nThe maximum `dist[k]` value is `a+b-1`.\nLet `max_dist = max(dist[k] for k in range(MAX_VAL))`.\nIf `x >= max_dist`, then all `k \\in [0, MAX_VAL-1]` with `dist[k] <= x` are reachable.\nAnd any `k >= a+b-1` is reachable.\nThe maximum value in `dist` array is `a+b-1`.\nFor `x >= a+b-1`: `f(x) = x+1`.\nThis is because for `x \\ge a+b-1`, any `p \\in [0, x]` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]`.\nThis is because all `p \\in [0, a+b-1]` are reachable (with `x=a+b-1` as upper bound).\nAnd if `p` is reachable with `x` as upper bound, then `p+b` is reachable with `x+b` as upper bound.\nIf `x >= a+b-1`, then all `p \\in [0, x]` are reachable. So `f(x) = x+1`.\nThis is the key insight. The \"Frobenius number\" for `a,b` is `a*b-a-b`. But this is for `k*a+l*b`.\nFor `k*a-l*b`, all values `p \\ge a*b-a-b` are reachable (if `gcd(a,b)=1`).\nThe actual bound for `f(x)=x+1` is `x >= a-1`. (This is for `b=1`).\nThe actual bound for `f(x)=x+1` is `x >= a+b-1`.\nExample: `a=5, b=3`. `a+b-1 = 7`.\n`f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8`.\n`f(7)=8` means `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are all reachable. So `f(x)=x+1` for `x \\ge 7`.\nThis matches the example.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n1. Handle `g = gcd(a, b)`: Scale `a, b` to `a_eff, b_eff`. The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` becomes `sum_{i=0}^{m_eff} f_scaled(i) * g + f_scaled(m_eff) * (m % g + 1)`.\n   Let's just compute `sum_{i=0}^{m_eff} f_scaled(i)` directly.\n   `m_eff = m // g`, `a_eff = a // g`, `b_eff = b // g`.\n2. Compute `dist[k]` for `k \\in [0, a_eff + b_eff - 1]`.\n   `MAX_K_BFS = a_eff + b_eff`.\n   `dist = [infinity] * MAX_K_BFS`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n   `q = deque([0])`.\n   While `q` is not empty:\n     `u = q.popleft()`\n     `v_a = u + a_eff`\n     `new_x_a = max(dist[u], v_a)`\n     `if v_a < MAX_K_BFS and new_x_a < dist[v_a]:`\n       `dist[v_a] = new_x_a`\n       `q.append(v_a)`\n     `v_b = u - b_eff`\n     `new_x_b = dist[u]`\n     `if v_b >= 0 and new_x_b < dist[v_b]:`\n       `dist[v_b] = new_x_b`\n       `q.appendleft(v_b)`\n   The value `a_eff + b_eff - 1` is the threshold `X_0` after which `f(x) = x+1`.\n3. Calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m_eff} f_scaled(i)`.\n   Let `X_0 = a_eff + b_eff - 1`.\n   `ans_sum_f_scaled = 0`.\n   `current_f_val_at_X0 = 0` (this is `f_scaled(X_0)`)\n   `for i in range(min(m_eff, X_0) + 1):`\n     `count_reachable = 0`\n     `for k in range(MAX_K_BFS):`\n       `if dist[k] <= i:`\n         `count_reachable += 1`\n     `ans_sum_f_scaled += count_reachable`\n     `if i == X_0:`\n       `current_f_val_at_X0 = count_reachable`\n   \n   If `m_eff > X_0`:\n     The remaining sum is `sum_{i=X_0+1}^{m_eff} (i+1)`.\n     This is an arithmetic series: `(X_0+2) + (X_0+3) + ... + (m_eff+1)`.\n     The number of terms is `m_eff - (X_0+1) + 1 = m_eff - X_0`.\n     Sum is `(m_eff - X_0) * ( (X_0+2) + (m_eff+1) ) // 2`.\n     `ans_sum_f_scaled += (m_eff - X_0) * (X_0 + 2 + m_eff + 1) // 2`.\n     `ans_sum_f_scaled += (m_eff - X_0) * (m_eff + X_0 + 3) // 2`.\n4. The final answer is `ans_sum_f_scaled * g`.\n\nLet's recheck Example 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`. `g=1`. `m_eff=7, a_eff=5, b_eff=3`.\n`MAX_K_BFS = a_eff + b_eff = 5+3 = 8`.\n`dist` array (size 8):\n`dist = [inf]*8`. `dist[0]=0`. `q = deque([0])`.\nPop `0`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=5, new_x_a=max(0,5)=5`. `dist[5]=5`. `q.append(5)`.\n  `-3`: `v_b=-3` (invalid).\nPop `5`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=10` (invalid, `v_a >= MAX_K_BFS`).\n  `-3`: `v_b=2, new_x_b=dist[5]=5`. `dist[2]=5`. `q.appendleft(2)`.\nPop `2`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=7, new_x_a=max(dist[2],7)=max(5,7)=7`. `dist[7]=7`. `q.append(7)`.\n  `-3`: `v_b=-1` (invalid).\nPop `7`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=12` (invalid).\n  `-3`: `v_b=4, new_x_b=dist[7]=7`. `dist[4]=7`. `q.appendleft(4)`.\nPop `4`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=9` (invalid).\n  `-3`: `v_b=1, new_x_b=dist[4]=7`. `dist[1]=7`. `q.appendleft(1)`.\nPop `1`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=6, new_x_a=max(dist[1],6)=max(7,6)=7`. `dist[6]=7`. `q.append(6)`.\n  `-3`: `v_b=-2` (invalid).\nPop `6`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=11` (invalid).\n  `-3`: `v_b=3, new_x_b=dist[6]=7`. `dist[3]=7`. `q.appendleft(3)`.\nPop `3`:\n  `+5`: `v_a=8` (invalid).\n  `-3`: `v_b=0, new_x_b=dist[3]=7`. `dist[0]=0`. `new_x_b=7` is not `< dist[0]=0`.

BFS for `dist`: `O(a_eff + b_eff)`. Max `2 * 10^5`.\n3. Loop `i` from `0` to `min(m_eff, X_0)`: `X_0` is `a_eff+b_eff`. Max `2 * 10^5`.\n   Inner loop for `k` from `0` to `MAX_K_BFS`: `MAX_K_BFS` is `a_eff+b_eff`. Max `2 * 10^5`.\n   So this part is `O((a_eff+b_eff)^2)`. Max `(2*10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}`. This is too slow.\n\nThe `O((a_eff+b_eff)^2)` part needs to be optimized.\n`ans_sum_f_scaled = sum_{i=0}^{min(m_eff, X_0)} (sum_{k=0}^{MAX_K_BFS-1} (1 \\text{ if } dist[k] \\le i \\text{ else } 0))`.\nThis is `sum_{k=0}^{MAX_K_BFS-1} (sum_{i=dist[k]}^{min(m_eff, X_0)} 1)`.\n`sum_{k=0}^{MAX_K_BFS-1} max(0, min(m_eff, X_0) - dist[k] + 1)`.\nThis can be computed in `O(a_eff+b_eff)`.\nSo the optimized algorithm:\n1. Handle `g = gcd(a, b)`: Scale `a, b` to `a_eff, b_eff`. `m_eff = m // g`.\n2. Compute `dist[k]` for `k \\in [0, a_eff + b_eff - 1]` using 0-1 BFS.\n   `MAX_K_BFS = a_eff + b_eff`.\n   This takes `O(a_eff + b_eff)` time.\n3.
