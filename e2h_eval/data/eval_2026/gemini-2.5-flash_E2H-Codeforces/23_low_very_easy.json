            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Finding the Minimum Tiles to Form a Mentsu**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a mahjong hand of three tiles, represented as strings, and my goal is to figure out the fewest additional tiles I need to draw to create a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). Since I'm aiming for the *minimum*, I'll use a brute-force approach, checking zero, one, and then two draws, in that order, to find the lowest possible number. The absolute worst case is needing two draws, as any single tile can be made into a koutsu with two more of the same tile.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input strings into something more manageable, like a list of tuples, `(number, suit)`.  Sorting these tiles will likely be crucial, especially for efficiently checking for shuntsu.  I'll sort by suit first, then by number within each suit.\n\nNow, let's break down the process by the number of draws:\n\n**Zero Draws:** I'll begin by analyzing the initial hand. Can I immediately form a mentsu?\n\n*   **Koutsu Check:** Is this hand a koutsu? Are all three tiles identical? Easy enough to check: `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu Check:** If it's not a koutsu, is it a shuntsu?\n    1.  First, make sure all tiles are of the same suit.\n    2.  After sorting, check if the numbers are sequential:  If `tiles = [t1, t2, t3]` (already sorted), is `t1.number + 1 == t2.number` and `t2.number + 1 == t3.number`?  If yes, then a shuntsu is found!\n\nIf I find either a koutsu or a shuntsu, the answer is 0.\n\n**One Draw:** If zero draws didn't work, I'll consider drawing a single tile (`t_new`). Now I have four tiles. I need to check all combinations of three tiles from these four to see if any form a mentsu.  This is a combinatorial check - which means 4 choose 3 or four combinations (t1, t2, t3), (t1, t2, t_new), (t1, t3, t_new) and (t2, t3, t_new). Each of these combinations need to be checked for a koutsu and shuntsu as in the zero-draws case.\n\n**Two Draws:** Finally, if one draw isn't enough, I'll assume I draw two new tiles. Since with two draws I can *always* form a koutsu, I just need to return 2.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). She starts with three tiles.\n\nA mentsu is:\n1.  **Koutsu (triplet):** Three identical tiles (e.g., `1m 1m 1m`).\n2.  **Shuntsu (sequence):** Three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit (e.g., `1m 2m 3m`, `5s 6s 7s`).\n\nWe need to find the minimum draws, so we check possibilities in increasing order of draws: 0 draws, then 1 draw, then 2 draws. The maximum possible answer is 2, because with 2 draws, she can always pick one of her existing tiles (or any tile) and draw two more identical copies to form a koutsu.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, `1m` becomes `(1, 'm')`.\n\n**1. Parse Input:**\nRead the three tile strings and convert them into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples. It's often helpful to sort these tiles for easier comparison, especially for shuntsu checks. Sorting can be done by suit first, then by number.\n\n**2. Check for 0 Draws:**\nCan the initial three tiles form a mentsu?\nLet the tiles be `T1, T2, T3`.\n\n*   **Koutsu:** Check if `T1 == T2` and `T2 == T3`.\n*   **Shuntsu:**\n    1.  Ensure all three tiles have the same suit.\n    2.  Check if their numbers are consecutive (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`). After sorting by number, this means `T1.num + 1 == T2.num` and `T2.num + 1 == T3.num`.\nIf either is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**3. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can she form a mentsu by drawing one tile?\nThis means we need to find if any two of her initial tiles `T_i, T_j` can be combined with *one* drawn tile `T_new` to form a mentsu.\n\n*   **Koutsu with 1 draw:**\n    If she has two identical tiles (e.g., `T1 == T2`), she can draw a third `T1` to form a koutsu.\n    So, check if `T1 == T2` OR `T1 == T3` OR `T2 == T3`.\n*   **Shuntsu with 1 draw:**\n    If she has two tiles of the same suit, she might be able to form a shuntsu. Let these two tiles be `(n1, s)` and `(n2, s)`. Assume `n1 < n2`.\n    She can form a shuntsu if:\n    1.  She draws `(n1-1, s)` (if `n1 > 1`) to make `(n1-1, s), (n1, s), (n2, s)` (requires `n2 == n1+1`).\n    2.  She draws `(n1+1, s)` to make `(n1, s), (n1+1, s), (n2, s)` (requires `n2 == n1+2`).\n    3.  She draws `(n2+1, s)` (if `n2 < 9`) to make `(n1, s), (n2, s), (n2+1, s)` (requires `n2 == n1+1`).\n\n    More generally, for any two tiles `(n_a, s_a)` and `(n_b, s_b)`:\n    If `s_a == s_b`:\n        Let `d = abs(n_a - n_b)`.\n        If `d == 0` (tiles are identical), she can draw another identical tile for a koutsu (covered above).\n        If `d == 1` (e.g., `1s 2s`): she can draw `3s` or `9s` (e.g., `1s 2s 3s`) OR `9s` (e.g., `9s 1s 2s`). Specifically, she can draw `min(n_a, n_b) - 1` (if >0) or `max(n_a, n_b) + 1` (if <10).\n        If `d == 2` (e.g., `1s 3s`): she can draw `2s` to complete the sequence `1s 2s 3s`.\n    \n    A simpler way to check for shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    Consider all pairs of tiles `(T_i, T_j)` from the initial three. If they share the same suit:\n    Let their numbers be `n_i` and `n_j`.\n    *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) <= 2`: A shuntsu can be formed.\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 0` (e.g., `1m 1m`): Draw `1m` for koutsu.\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 1` (e.g., `1m 2m`): Draw `3m` or `9m`.\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 2` (e.g., `1m 3m`): Draw `2m`.\n        In all these cases, one draw is sufficient to complete a mentsu using these two tiles.\n\nIf any of these conditions for 1 draw are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**4. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf 0 or 1 draw is not enough, the answer must be 2. As explained, she can always form a koutsu by drawing two copies of any tile she possesses (or any tile she wants). For example, if she has `1m`, she draws two `1m`s to make `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n\n1.  Read the three tile strings `s1, s2, s3`.\n2.  Convert them to a list of `(number, suit)` tuples: `tiles = [(int(s[0]), s[1]) for s in [s1, s2, s3]]`.\n3.  Create a sorted version of `tiles` for shuntsu checks: `sorted_tiles = sorted(tiles)`. (Sorting by suit then number helps).\n\n4.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   `if sorted_tiles[0] == sorted_tiles[1] and sorted_tiles[1] == sorted_tiles[2]:` (Koutsu)\n        `print(0)` and exit.\n    *   `if sorted_tiles[0][1] == sorted_tiles[1][1] and sorted_tiles[1][1] == sorted_tiles[2][1]:` (Same suit)\n        `if sorted_tiles[0][0] + 1 == sorted_tiles[1][0] and sorted_tiles[1][0] + 1 == sorted_tiles[2][0]:` (Sequential numbers)\n            `print(0)` and exit.\n\n5.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    *   Initialize `can_form_in_1_draw = False`.\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from `tiles`:\n        *   `if t_i == t_j:` (Two identical tiles, can draw a third for koutsu)\n            `can_form_in_1_draw = True; break`\n        *   `if t_i[1] == t_j[1]:` (Same suit)\n            `diff = abs(t_i[0] - t_j[0])`\n            `if diff <= 2:` (Can form a shuntsu, e.g., 1-2 needs 3 or 9, 1-3 needs 2)\n                `can_form_in_1_draw = True; break`\n    *   `if can_form_in_1_draw:`\n        `print(1)` and exit.\n\n6.  **If neither 0 nor 1 draw works:**\n    `print(2)` and exit.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`\n\n1.  Tiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n    Sorted: `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`\n\n2.  **0 Draws?**\n    *   Koutsu: `(2, 'p') != (3, 'p')` -> No.\n    *   Shuntsu: Not all same suit (`p`, `p`, `m`) -> No.\n    Answer is not 0.\n\n3.  **1 Draw?**\n    Pairs from `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`:\n    *   `((3, 'p'), (9, 'm'))`: Different suit.\n    *   `((3, 'p'), (2, 'p'))`: Same suit (`p`). Numbers `3, 2`. `abs(3-2) = 1`. Since `diff <= 2`, we can form a shuntsu.\n        (e.g., draw `1p` to make `[1p, 2p, 3p]`, or draw `4p` to make `[2p, 3p, 4p]`).\n    `can_form_in_1_draw = True`.\n\n    Answer is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in s:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier comparison, especially for shuntsu\n    # Sort by suit first, then by number\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # Case 1: Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Case 2: Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]: # Same suit\n        if tiles[0][0] + 1 == tiles[1][0] and tiles[1][0] + 1 == tiles[2][0]: # Sequential numbers\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We need to find if any two tiles can form a mentsu with one extra tile.\n    # This means we iterate through all unique pairs of initial tiles.\n    \n    # Use a set to store unique tiles for easy checking of duplicates\n    unique_tiles = list(set(tiles)) # This removes duplicates if any\n    \n    # Check for Koutsu with 1 draw:\n    # If two tiles are identical, we can draw a third identical one.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2]: # After sorting, if there are duplicates, they will be adjacent\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    # Iterate through all pairs of tiles to see if they can form a shuntsu with one draw.\n    # The initial tiles are already sorted by suit then number.\n    # This simplifies checking pairs.\n    \n    # Consider pairs (tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    \n    # Check pair (tiles[0], tiles[1])\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1]: # Same suit\n        diff = tiles[1][0] - tiles[0][0]\n        if diff <= 2: # Can form a shuntsu (e.g., 1-2 needs 3 or 9; 1-3 needs 2)\n            print(1)\n            return\n    \n    # Check pair (tiles[0], tiles[2])\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[2][1]: # Same suit\n        diff = tiles[2][0] - tiles[0][0]\n        if diff <= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # Check pair (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    if tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]: # Same suit\n        diff = tiles[2][0] - tiles[1][0]\n        if diff <= 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # --- If 0 or 1 draw didn't work, then 2 draws are needed ---\n    # With 2 draws, we can always form a koutsu (e.g., pick any tile, say 1m, and draw two more 1m's).\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
