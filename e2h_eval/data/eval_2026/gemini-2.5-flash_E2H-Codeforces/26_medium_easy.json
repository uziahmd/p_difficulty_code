Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The problem at hand involves counting non-degenerate triangles with integer sides, given constraints on the side lengths.** I've carefully analyzed the conditions for a valid triangle, focusing on the implications of the ordering `x <= y <= z`. This simplifies the triangle inequality to `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial approach was to iterate through possible `x` and `y` values and then calculate the possible `z` values. However, I realized this would be too computationally expensive, leading to a nested loop that could exceed the time limit.\n\nI then sought a more efficient method. After considering different iteration orders (iterating over z or y), I landed on an approach where I fix the sum `s = x + y`, which I define `x_lower = max(A, s-C)`, `x_upper = min(B, s-B)`.\nI then efficiently determine the number of pairs `(x, y)` that sum to `s` within the given constraints `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`. This, in turn, helps me to derive number of valid `z` values from  `C <= z <= D` and `z < s`. I have to sum this product over a specific range of values of `s`.\n\nBy precomputing and calculating the count for values of `s`, I've reduced the complexity significantly, ensuring an efficient solution. This should lead to a much faster execution time. Finally, the total triangle count is the sum of these products across the valid range of `s` values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nThe given constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D` imply `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x, y, z` being positive integers and `x <= y <= z`:\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`. So `y + z >= x + 1 > x`.\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`. So `x + z >= y + 1 > y`.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to satisfy is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to count integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet's re-arrange the conditions. For a given `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n`C <= z <= D`\n`z < x + y` (from triangle inequality)\n\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C`, and for each `(x, y)` pair, calculate the number of `z` values. This would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be up to `(5 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}` in the worst case, too slow.\n\nWe can optimize by iterating over the sum `s = x + y`.\nThe range of `s` is `A + B <= s <= B + C`. Since `A, B, C <= 5 \\cdot 10^5`, `s` can range up to `10^6`. This range is manageable.\n\nFor each possible sum `s = x + y`, we need to:\n1. Count the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = s` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\n2. For each such `(x, y)` pair (or rather, for the sum `s`), determine the number of valid `z` values.\n\nLet's find the number of `(x, y)` pairs for a fixed `s`:\n`x + y = s` implies `y = s - x`.\nSubstituting `y` into its constraints:\n`B <= s - x <= C`\nThis implies `s - C <= x <= s - B`.\n\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`:\n`x` must satisfy `max(A, s - C) <= x <= min(B, s - B)`.\nLet `x_lower = max(A, s - C)` and `x_upper = min(B, s - B)`.\nThe number of valid `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs for a fixed `s`) is `num_xy_pairs = max(0, x_upper - x_lower + 1)`.\n\nNow, for a fixed `s = x + y`, the number of valid `z` values is `num_z_values = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\nNote that `num_z_values` is positive only if `s - 1 >= C`, i.e., `s >= C + 1`.\n\nThe total count of triangles is the sum over all possible `s` values:\n`TotalTriangles = sum_{s=A+B}^{B+C} (num_xy_pairs(s) * num_z_values(s))`\n\nThe sum for `s` effectively starts from `max(A+B, C+1)` because if `s < C+1`, `num_z_values(s)` will be 0.\nThe loop for `s` runs from `max(A+B, C+1)` up to `B+C`.\nThe number of iterations is at most `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1`.\nIn the worst case, `A=1, C=5 \\cdot 10^5`, so there are about `5 \\cdot 10^5` iterations. Each iteration involves a few constant-time operations (`max`, `min`, arithmetic).\nThis makes the overall time complexity `O(C-A)`, which is efficient enough for `C, A <= 5 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThe maximum value of `TotalTriangles` can be large (up to `10^{17}`), so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable.\n\nExample walkthrough (from problem description): `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n1. `s` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n2. `C+1 = 4`. So `s` loop effectively runs from `max(3, 4) = 4` to `5`.\n\n- For `s = 4`:\n  - `x_lower = max(A, s-C) = max(1, 4-3) = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n  - `x_upper = min(B, s-B) = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2`.\n  - `num_xy_pairs = x_upper - x_lower + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    (Pairs are (x=1, y=3) and (x=2, y=2)).\n  - `num_z_values = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(4, 4-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = 1`.\n    (For `s=4`, `z` must be `3`. This is `z=C`).\n  - Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n- For `s = 5`:\n  - `x_lower = max(A, s-C) = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n  - `x_upper = min(B, s-B) = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n  - `num_xy_pairs = x_upper - x_lower + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`.\n    (Pair is (x=2, y=3)).\n  - `num_z_values = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(4, 5-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, 4) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = 2`.\n    (For `s=5`, `z` can be `3` or `4`. These are `z=C` to `z=D`).\n  - Contribution: `1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nTotal triangles = `2 + 2 = 4`.
