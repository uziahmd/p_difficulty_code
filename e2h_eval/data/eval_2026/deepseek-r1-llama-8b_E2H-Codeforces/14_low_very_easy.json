He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of 25, 125, etc., since they contribute more than one 5.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.\n\nBut how do I find all n's that give exactly m zeros? I think binary search can be useful here. Because the function that counts trailing zeros is monotonic increasing as n increases. So for a given m, there's a range of n's that all have exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, right. The number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes it jumps by more than one when n crosses a multiple of 5, 25, etc. So for a particular m, there might be a consecutive range of n's where the count is m. For example, in the sample input where m is 5: 5! has 1 zero, but 6! adds another, so wait no. Wait the sample input says for m=1, the output is 5. So 5! is 120, which has 1 zero. But 6! has 720, which is 1 zero as well? Wait, wait, wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Oh wait no—wait, let me calculate:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero?\nWait, no. 6! is 720, which ends with one zero. So 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 all have 1 trailing zero? Or am I making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero.\n7! = 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! = 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! = 362880 → 1 zero.\n\nYes, so from 5 to 9, inclusive, each factorial has exactly one trailing zero. So the answer is 5,6,7,8,9, which is 5 numbers. So the output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. So I need to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are at least m, and then see how many n's in a row give exactly m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the lower bound (the first n where trailing zeros >= m).\n2. Then check if the trailing zeros at this n is exactly m. If not, then there are zero solutions.\n3. If it is m, then find the next n where trailing zeros exceed m. Then all n's between the lower bound and (upper bound -1) are the solutions.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Implement a function to count the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n- Use binary search to find the starting point where the count is >= m.\n- Once found, check if the count is exactly m. If not, output 0.\n- Else, find the upper bound where the count is > m. The numbers from start to upper-1 are the solutions.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nWait, the function count_trailing_zeros(n) can be implemented as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the binary search would look for the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce I have that n, say low, I need to check if count_zeros(low) == m.\n\nIf it's not equal, then there's no solution.\n\nIf it is equal, then I need to find the largest n where count_zeros(n) is still m.\n\nHow to find the upper bound?\n\nWe can perform another binary search for the smallest n where count_zeros(n) > m. Let's call this high.\n\nThen the numbers from low to high-1 (inclusive) are the valid n's.\n\nSo the count of numbers is high - low.\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nlow is 5, because 5! is 1 zero.\n\nhigh is 10, because 10! has two zeros (since 10//5=2, 10//25=0; 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to output all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This includes counts from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Range of Valid \\( n \\)**: Once the bounds are found, all integers between the lower bound and one less than the upper bound will yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * (10**18)\n\n# Find the lower bound where count >= m\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz < m:\n        low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        high = mid\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the upper bound where count > m\n    upper = low\n    while upper >= low:\n        current = count_zeros(upper)\n        if current > m:\n            break\n        upper += 1\n    # Now, the valid numbers are from low to upper-1 inclusive\n    k = upper - low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, upper))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the quotients until the quotient becomes zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: The binary search efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values where the number of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\). The lower bound is the smallest \\( n \\) with at least \\( m \\) zeros, and the upper bound is the smallest \\( n \\) with more than \\( m \\) zeros.\n\n3. **Output the Results**: After determining the valid range, the code prints the count of such \\( n \\) values followed by the values themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the solution using binary search, making the algorithm both optimal and scalable for large values of \\( m \\).",
