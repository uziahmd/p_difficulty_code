The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and she needs to have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before. So the order of tasks matters because each subsequent task depends on the previous ones being done.\n\nMy goal is to find the minimal time she needs to complete all her tasks. Each move from one house to an adjacent one takes one unit of time.\n\nHmm. So, let's think about how to model this. Since the ring is circular, each house is connected to two others—its previous and next in the clockwise direction. But since the movement is only allowed clockwise, once you go past a certain point, you can't go back.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is such that each house is connected to the next one in the clockwise direction. So, for example, house 1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, and so on until house n, which connects back to 1.\n\nSo, moving from any house to the next takes one step. But to get from a higher-numbered house to a lower one would require going all the way around the ring, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut the problem is that Xenia can't move counter-clockwise; she can only move clockwise. So, for example, if she's at house 4 and wants to get to house 2, she has to go through 4 → 1 → 2, which is three steps. But wait, is that correct? Or does the ring allow moving both ways? Wait, no. The ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So she can only move in the direction of increasing house numbers. So each house can only move to the next one in the clockwise direction. So house 1 can go to 2, 2 to 3, etc., and house n can only go to 1.\n\nSo, to get from a higher-numbered house to a lower one, she has to go all the way around the ring. Like from 4 to 2: 4 →1→2, which is two steps. Wait, no, 4 to 1 is one step (since 4 and 1 are adjacent in the ring). Then 1 to 2 is another step, so total of two steps.\n\nWait, but what about moving from 3 to 1? That's just one step: 3 →1. Oh right, because they are adjacent in the ring.\n\nSo, the key here is that the movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, meaning the next house in the sequence. So, when planning the path, we have to make sure that Xenia moves in the correct direction, possibly looping around the ring as needed.\n\nNow, considering the tasks. The tasks are given in a certain order, but the problem states that she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before the i-th task. So the order is fixed as per the given list a1, a2, ..., am. So, she needs to process them in the given order, but each task depends on the previous ones.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because each task is a point that must be visited, but the dependencies are that for task j, she must have already done all tasks i where i < j. So, the earliest she can do task j is after all tasks i < j are done.\n\nBut how does this affect the path she takes?\n\nI think the optimal approach is to process the tasks in the order they are given, and for each task, determine the minimal path that allows her to reach it after all prior tasks.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nInitially, she is at position 1.\n\nFor each task a_i in the list:\n\n- She must be at a_i at some point after having done all earlier tasks.\n\n- She must have arrived at a_i in the minimal possible time, considering all the previous constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps for each task, we can compute the earliest time she can arrive there, given the previous positions.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be modeled by tracking the current position and the time taken so far, and for each task, determining the minimal steps required to reach that task, considering the previous state.\n\nBut since m can be up to 105, and n up to 105, perhaps a dynamic programming approach could work. The state would be the current position, and the last task processed. But given that m is up to 105, the number of possible states is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula that determines the minimal time without explicitly simulating every possibility.\n\nLet me think about the first example:\n\nInput:\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSo, the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. She starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. She needs to reach 3. How?\n\nShe can go 1 → 2 → 3, which is 2 steps. So after task 1, she's at 3, time is 2.\n\nSecond task is 2. She needs to reach 2 after task 1. So from 3, she can't go back to 2 directly because movement is only clockwise. So she has to go 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. So total time is 2 + 3 =5.\n\nThird task is 3 again. She is already at 3, so no steps needed. Total time is 5.\n\nWait, but the sample output says 6. Hmm, I must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample. The output is 6.\n\nIn the note, the sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So, let's see:\n\nTask 1: 3. Steps taken: 1→2→3: 2 steps.\n\nTime so far: 2.\n\nThen, task 2: 2. So she needs to go from 3 to 2. But since movement is only clockwise, she can't go directly. So she must go 3→4, then 4→1, then 1→2. That's 3 steps. Time becomes 5.\n\nThen, task 3: 3. She is currently at 2, so she needs to go from 2 to 3. That's one step. Time becomes 6.\n\nAh, right. So the third task is after the second, so she must go from 2 to 3.\n\nSo, the initial approach was wrong because I thought the second task was done after the first, but the third depends on the second.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is that for each task i, she must visit a_i after all the previous a_j for j < i.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased is that she needs to be at a_i when she completes the i-th task, but the order is fixed as a_1, a_2, ..., a_m.\n\nSo, the path must include visiting a_1, then a_2, then a_3, etc., in that order. Each a_i must be visited at least once, but possibly more times if multiple tasks are in the same house.\n\nSo, the minimal path is the sum of the minimal distances between consecutive positions, plus any loops around the ring due to the dependency on previous tasks.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal time is the sum of the distances from the starting point (1) to a_1, plus the distance from a_1 to a_2, plus the distance from a_2 to a_3, and so on, considering that each step must be made in the correct direction.\n\nBut wait, no. Because sometimes, after processing a_i, she may loop around the ring before returning to a_i+1.\n\nLike in the first example, after processing a_1=3, she goes to 4, then 1, then 2 (for a_2=2), which is a longer path than going directly from 3 to 2 via the ring.\n\nWait, but in the sample, she had to go from 3 to 2 via the ring, because she couldn't move counter-clockwise.\n\nSo, the movement direction is strictly clockwise. So, from any position, you can only move to the next higher-numbered house, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nThis implies that the minimal path between two points is determined by whether you can move directly or need to go the long way around the ring.\n\nWait, but the ring is circular, so the minimal distance between two points can be the minimum between (a - b) mod n and (b - a) mod n, but considering the direction.\n\nWait, for example, between house 1 and 4 in a 4-house ring:\n\nThe direct clockwise distance is 3 steps (1→2→3→4).\n\nThe other way around is 1 step (4→1), but since movement is only clockwise, that's not allowed. So, the minimal distance is 3 steps.\n\nWait, no. Wait, house 4 is followed by 1. So, from 1, moving clockwise, you can't go back to 4. You can only go to 2.\n\nSo, in terms of movement, the path from 4 to 1 is only possible by moving 4→1 in one step.\n\nSo, for any two houses, the clockwise distance is the minimal steps required when moving only in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo, the minimal distance between a and b is (b - a) mod n if a < b, but since movement is only clockwise, that's the only option.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, if a is 3 and b is 2, and n is 4.\n\nSo, 3 to 2: movement is only allowed clockwise. So, 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps.\n\nBut if n is 5, 3 to 2 would require 3 steps as well.\n\nSo, the general formula for the distance between a and b when moving clockwise is (b - a) % n. Because when a > b, you have to wrap around.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf a is 3, b is 2, n is 4.\n\n(b - a) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b when moving clockwise is (b - a) mod n.\n\nBut wait, in the first case, when a is 1 and b is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the distance is (b - a) mod n.\n\nBut wait, when a is 4 and b is 2, n=4: (2-4) mod 4 is (-2) mod4 = 2. But moving from 4 to 2 in a 4-house ring requires 4→1→2, which is 2 steps. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, the distance between a and b is (b - a) mod n.\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to finding a path that starts at 1, then goes to a1, then from a1 to a2, then a2 to a3, etc., each time adding the minimal distance, but also considering that each step must be in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut wait, the path isn't necessarily the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's. Because sometimes, it's better to loop around the ring once, especially if the next a_i is much smaller than the current position.\n\nWait, for example, if current position is 3 and the next a_i is 2, then the distance is (2-3) mod 4 = ( -1 ) mod4 = 3 steps.\n\nWhich is 3→4→1→2: 3 steps.\n\nSo, the minimal path is indeed 3 steps.\n\nBut what if the current position is 4, and the next a_i is 2. Distance is (2-4) mod4 = (-2 mod4)=2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the distance formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, the minimal time is the sum of the distances between the previous position and the current a_i, for each i from 1 to m.\n\nWait, but wait: in the first example, the sum of the distances would be:\n\nStart at 1.\n\na1 is 3: distance is 2 steps.\n\na2 is 2: distance is 3 steps.\n\na3 is 3: distance is 1 step.\n\nTotal is 2+3+1=6, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n['4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\nSo, the tasks are [2,3,3].\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\na1=2: distance from 1 is (2-1) mod4=1 step.\n\nTime is 1.\n\na2=3: distance from 2 is (3-2) mod4=1 step. Time is 2.\n\na3=3: 0 steps. Time remains 2.\n\nSo the total is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, that seems to align.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate the sum of the distances between the current position and the next a_i, using the (next_a - current_pos) mod n formula.\n\nBut wait, what about the starting point? She starts at 1, so the first step is from 1 to a1.\n\nSo, for each task a_i, the distance added is (a_i - current_pos) mod n, where current_pos is the previous position.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_pos to 1.\n\ntime = 0.\n\nfor each a in the list of a_i:\n\n    distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    time += distance\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of these distances.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the a list is [3,2,3]. Let's compute:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\na1=3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. time=2. current_pos=3.\n\na2=2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1 mod4) =3. time=5. current_pos=2.\n\na3=3: (3-2) mod4=1. time=6. current_pos=3.\n\nWhich gives 6, correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,3,3], current_pos=1.\n\na1=2: (2-1) mod4=1. time=1. current_pos=2.\n\na2=3: (3-2) mod4=1. time=2. current_pos=3.\n\na3=3: 0. time remains 2.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nWhat about a case where the a_i's are not in order?\n\nWait, for example, n=5, m=2, a=[3,1].\n\nSo, she starts at 1.\n\na1=3: distance is 2 steps (1→2→3). time=2.\n\na2=1: (1-3) mod5 = (-2 mod5)=3. time increases by 3 →5.\n\nSo, total time is 5.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see:\n\nShe must process a1=3, then a2=1.\n\nSo, after a1, she is at 3.\n\nTo reach a2=1, she has to go 3→4→5→1, which is 3 steps. So yes, total 5 steps.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=3, a = [5,4,3].\n\nSo, steps:\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\na1=5: (5-1) mod5=4. time=4. current_pos=5.\n\na2=4: (4-5) mod5=4. time +=4 →8. current_pos=4.\n\na3=3: (3-4) mod5=4. time +=4 →12. current_pos=3.\n\nTotal time is 12.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nPath:\n\n1 →2→3→4→5 (4 steps to reach 5).\n\nThen 5 →1 (step 1?), no, wait, movement is only clockwise. From 5, the next is 1. So, 5→1 is one step.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is 1→2→3→4→5→1. So, moving from 5 to 1 is one step.\n\nSo, after a1=5, she is at 5.\n\na2=4: from 5 to 4, movement is only allowed in clockwise. So, 5→1 is one step, but 1 is less than 4. So, she has to go 5 →1 →2 →3 →4: 4 steps.\n\nSo, time increases by 4 →4+4=8.\n\nThen, a3=3: from 4, to 3: (3-4) mod5=4 steps. So, 4 →5 →1 →2 →3: 4 steps. Time becomes 12.\n\nSo, the formula correctly computes this.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nThus, the solution is to iterate through each a_i in the list, compute the distance from the current position to a_i, add it to the total time, and update the current position.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of m integers a.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntime =0.\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but wait: the modulo operation in Python can return negative numbers if the numerator is negative.\n\nWait, no: in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So, for (ai - current_pos) which could be negative, the mod n will give a positive value.\n\nFor example, (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\ndistance for 3: (3-1) mod4=2.\n\ntime=2.\n\ncurrent_pos=3.\n\ndistance for 2: (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3.\n\ntime=5.\n\ncurrent_pos=2.\n\ndistance for 3: (3-2) mod4=1.\n\ntime=6.\n\nPrint 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=[2,3,3], n=4.\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\ndistance 2-1=1.\n\ntime=1.\n\ncurrent_pos=2.\n\ndistance 3-2=1.\n\ntime=2.\n\ncurrent_pos=3.\n\ndistance 3-3=0.\n\ntime remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a = [5,4,3], n=5.\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\n5-1=4 → time=4.\n\ncurrent_pos=5.\n\n4-5 = -1 mod5=4 → time=8.\n\ncurrent_pos=4.\n\n3-4 = -1 mod5=4 → time=12.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of m integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, initialize current_pos = 1, time =0.\n\nLoop through each number in a:\n\nfor num in a:\n    distance = (num - current_pos) % n\n    time += distance\n    current_pos = num\n\nFinally, print(time).\n\nWait, but looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is given as '4 3\\n3 2 3'.\n\nWait, but in the code, the second line is read as a list of integers, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise along the ringroad. Each task must be completed in the given order, and each subsequent task must be done after all previous ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a given order.\n   - Movement is only allowed in a clockwise direction, so from any house `i`, she can only move to house `i+1` (modulo `n` if necessary).\n   - The minimal distance between two houses `a` and `b` when moving clockwise is calculated as `(b - a) % n`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each task `a_i`, compute the distance from the current position to `a_i` using the formula `(a_i - current_pos) % n`.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values for `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks).\n   - Read the list of tasks.\n   - Initialize the current position to 1 and the total time to 0.\n   - For each task in the list, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house, update the total time, and set the current position to the task's house.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    distance = (num - current_pos) % n\n    time += distance\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of tasks.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `time` initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house, add this distance to the total time, and update the current position.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes all tasks in the minimum possible time by always moving clockwise and efficiently calculating the required distances.",
