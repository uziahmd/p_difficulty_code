After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. For each student, for each subject, we check if their mark is the maximum among all students in that subject. If any subject satisfies this, the student is successful.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. For each subject across all students, determine which student has the highest mark.\n3. For each student, check if they are the top in any subject.\n4. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the data. Each student's marks can be stored as a list of integers. So, for each student, I have a list where each element corresponds to a subject's mark.\n\nFor example, if a student has grades '223', then their marks would be [2,2,3].\n\nNow, for each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum value and note which student(s) achieved it. Wait, but each subject can have multiple students with the same maximum. But in that case, those students are tied for the best in that subject. So, any of them would be considered the best for that subject.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark.\" So if two students have the same maximum, both are considered the best for that subject because no one has a higher mark.\n\nWait, no. Because the definition says that a student is the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, each is the best in that subject. Because for each, there's no one higher.\n\nSo for each subject, the best students are all those who have the maximum value in that subject.\n\nThus, for a student to be successful, they just need to be in the best set of at least one subject.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each subject, determine the maximum mark.\n- Collect all students who have that mark in that subject.\n- Then, for each student, check if they are present in the best set for any subject.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's more efficient to track, for each subject, the maximum, and for each student, whether they are the maximum in that subject.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, for each subject, check if their mark is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then the student is a candidate for being the best in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are the best in at least one subject, count them as successful.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines, each line is a string of m characters, representing the marks for each subject.\n3. Convert each line into a list of integers. For example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n4. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), collect all the marks from all students in that subject. Find the maximum mark for that subject.\n5. For each student, check for each subject whether their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n6. If any subject does so, the student is successful. Otherwise, not.\n7. Count the number of successful students.\n\nThis approach seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The first line is n and m. Then, n lines follow. Each line is a string of length m, digits from 1-9.\n\nSo in Python, I can read the first line using input().split(), converting to integers n and m.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines, I'll process each character as an integer.\n\nSo for each student's line, say s = '232', convert it to a list of integers: [2,3,2].\n\nSo, I can store all students' marks as a list of lists.\n\nOnce I have all the students' marks, for each subject index j (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum value among all students in that column.\n\nSo for j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max of all student[j]\n    then, for each student, check if student[j] == max_mark. If yes, add to a set for that subject.\n\nWait, but for each subject, we can find the max once, and then for each student, see if their mark in that subject is equal to the max. If any subject does that, the student is successful.\n\nSo, perhaps for each subject j:\n\n- Find the maximum mark in that subject.\n- For each student, check if their mark in j is equal to max_j.\n\nIf any j exists where this is true, the student is successful.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nsuccessful_students = 0\n\nfor each student in students:\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in 0..m-1:\n        max_j = max of all students[j]\n        if student[j] == max_j:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        successful_students += 1\n\nreturn successful_students\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nIn Python, for each subject j, compute the maximum.\n\nSo, for each j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( student[j] for student in students )\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their j's mark equals max_marks[j].\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = max( student[j] for student in students )\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait. For each student, we check each subject until we find one where they are the max. So, if a student is the max in any subject, they are counted.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo the students' marks are:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nCompute max for each subject:\n\nSubject 0: max is 2.\n\nSubject 1: max is 3.\n\nSubject 2: max is 3.\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: Check subject 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So counted.\n\nStudent 1: Check subject 0: 2 < 2? No. Subject 1: 3 == 3 → yes. So counted.\n\nStudent 2: subject 0: 1 < 2. Subject 1: 1 < 3. Subject 2: 2 < 3. So not counted.\n\nTotal is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nStudents' marks:\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nMax per subject:\n\nsubject 0: max is 9.\n\nsubject 1: max is 1.\n\nsubject 2: max is 8.\n\nsubject 3: max is 2.\n\nsubject 4: max is 8.\n\nNow, check each student:\n\nStudent 0: subject 0 is 9 → yes. Counted.\n\nStudent 1: subject 0 is 1 <9. subject 1 is 1 ==1 → yes. Counted.\n\nStudent 2: none of the subjects has max higher than his marks. His marks are all 1 except maybe others? Wait, for subject 1, his mark is 1, which is the max? Or wait, no. Because in subject 0, all have lower except student 0. So for student 2, in subject 0, his mark is 1 <9. In subject 1, his mark is 1, which is the max? Because others are 1 as well?\n\nWait, no. Because in the second sample, the output is 3. So each student is considered successful.\n\nWait, what's going on here.\n\nWait, let's recompute:\n\nWait, the students are:\n\nStudent 0: '91728' → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: '11828' → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: '11111' → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nCompute max per subject:\n\nsubject 0: max is 9.\n\nsubject 1: all have 1, so max is 1.\n\nsubject 2: max is 8.\n\nsubject 3: max is 2.\n\nsubject 4: max is 8.\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0, he has 9 which is max. So yes.\n\nStudent 1: in subject 1, he has 1 which is max. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: in subject 1, he has 1 which is max. Also, in subject 0, 1 is not max. But in subject 1, his mark is 1, which is the max. So he is considered successful.\n\nSo all 3 are counted.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: what if a student has the same max as others, but not the sole maximum.\n\nE.g., n=2, m=1. Students have '9' and '9'. Max is 9. Both are considered best. So both are successful.\n\nSo the code counts them both.\n\nWhat if a student has a mark equal to the max in a subject, but not the maximum in any other subject? Like, in a different subject, someone else is the max.\n\nYes, but as long as they are the max in at least one subject, they're counted.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. The only student is the best in that subject. So output is 1.\n\nn=1, m=2: each subject is compared against itself. So the student is the best in both, so counted.\n\nWhat about when all students have the same mark in a subject? All are considered best.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead n, m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read n lines:\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(row)\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = max( student[j] for student in students )\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\nThen, for each student, check if any subject has their mark equal to max_marks[j].\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines after n and m:\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents will be [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks:\n\nj=0: max is 2.\n\nj=1: max is 3.\n\nj=2: max is 3.\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0: j=0: 2 ==2 → count 1.\n\nstudent 1: j=1: 3 ==3 → count 2.\n\nstudent 2: no j where mark is 2 or 3.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nstudents are [[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\nmax_marks:\n\nj=0: 9\n\nj=1:1\n\nj=2:8\n\nj=3:2\n\nj=4:8\n\nEach student:\n\nstudent 0: j=0 → 9 ==9 → count 1.\n\nstudent 1: j=1 →1==1 → count 2.\n\nstudent 2: j=1 →1==1 → count 3.\n\nSo output is 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n\n99\n\n88\n\nstudents: [[9,9], [8,8]]\n\nWait no, wait, in this case, m=1, each line is a single digit.\n\nWait, n=2, m=1. Each student's line is a single digit.\n\nSo students are [ [9], [8] ]\n\nmax_marks for j=0 is 9.\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0: j=0: 9 ==9 → count 1.\n\nstudent 1: j=0:8 <9 → no. So total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nLines:\n\n91\n\n92\n\nstudents: [[9,1], [9,2]]\n\nmax_marks:\n\nj=0:9\n\nj=1:2.\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0: j=0 is 9 ==9 → count.\n\nstudent 1: j=0 is 9 ==9 → count.\n\nSo total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",

A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Store Marks**: For each student, read their marks for each subject and store these marks as a list of integers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the maximum mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n4. **Check Success**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Count Successful Students**: Count how many students are successful based on the above check.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = max(student[j] for student in students)\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for each subject.\n2. **Storing Marks**: Each student's marks are converted from a string into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject, we determine the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps us identify which students are the best in each subject.\n4. **Checking Success**: For each student, we compare their marks against the maximum marks for each subject. If a student matches the maximum mark in any subject, they are marked as successful.\n5. **Counting Successful Students**: We maintain a count of how many students are successful and print this count at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging simple loops and conditional checks, ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.",
