    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nHmm, so for each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4? Because for each ring, we're adding a border of 1 cell on each side, but since it's two sides, it's 2 cells each for width and height. So each ring effectively subtracts 2 from each dimension, but since each ring is built on top of the previous, maybe it's cumulative?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. For the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The ring is all the cells around the perimeter. So for a rectangle with r rows and c columns, the perimeter is 2*(r + c - 2). Because the perimeter is the outer cells: top row (c cells), right column minus the top and bottom (r-2 cells), bottom row (c), and left column minus the top and bottom (r-2). So total is 2*(r + c) -4.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) rows and (h -4*(i-1)) columns. But wait, each subsequent ring is inside the previous one. So for i=1, the rectangle is w x h. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4), because each ring takes up one cell on each side, so subtracting 4 each time.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each ring is based on the inner rectangle of size (w -4(i-1)) × (h -4(i-1)). So yes, for each ring, the rectangle is reduced by 4 in both directions compared to the previous.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle, which is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Then sum all these perimeters for each ring.\n\nWait, let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 3 1\nFor i=1, current_w=3, current_h=3.\nPerimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. So output is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n7 9 1\ni=1: 7+9=16, perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)=2*14=28. Output is 28. Correct.\n\nThird example:\n7 9 2\nFirst ring: 7x9 gives perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\nSecond ring: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to loop through each ring from 1 to k, compute for each the perimeter, and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, how many rings can there be? Because for each ring, the current_w and current_h must be at least 3, because otherwise, if it's 2x2, the perimeter would be 4, but the problem allows rings as long as the min(n,m)+1)/4 floored is >=k.\n\nWait, the constraints say that k is such that it won't exceed the maximum possible rings. So we don't have to worry about invalid k values beyond what's given.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_gilded = 0.\n\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   c. If current_w < 3 or current_h <3, then the perimeter is zero because the rectangle is too small. But wait, the problem's note says that k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for i up to k, current_w and current_h will be >=3 - 4*(k-1) + something. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, if w=7, h=9, and k=2:\n\ncurrent_w for i=2 is 7-4=3, which is okay.\n\nIf w=3, h=3, and k=1, that's fine.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=1: perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nIf k=2, current_w=5-4=1, which is less than 3. So the perimeter would be 2*(1 +5-2) = 2*(4)=8, but since the rectangle is 1x5, the perimeter is 1+5-2)*2=8? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 2*(r + c -2), but if r=1, then the perimeter is 2*(1 + c -2) = 2*(c-1). For c=5, that's 8.\n\nBut wait, for a 1x5 rectangle, the perimeter is all 5 cells because it's a single row. So the formula seems correct.\n\nSo regardless of current_w and current_h being >=3, we can compute the perimeter.\n\nSo, no need to check for current_w or current_h being less than 3. We just proceed.\n\nSo, the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the input line as three integers.\n\nCompute the sum for each i from 1 to k:\n\nsum += 2 * ( (w -4*(i-1) ) + (h -4*(i-1)) -2 )\n\nWait, that's equivalent to 2*(current_w + current_h -2).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (cw + ch - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if cw or ch becomes zero or negative? Well, according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it's within the maximum possible rings, so that should not happen.\n\nTesting this code against the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1\n\nLoop runs once, i=1:\n\ncw=3, ch=3 → perimeter= 2*(3+3-2)=8. Total is 8. Output is 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2:\n\ni=1: 28\n\ni=2: 3 and 5 → 3+5-2=6 → 12. Total 40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: suppose w=5, h=5, k=1 → 5+5-2=8 → 2*8=16.\n\nIf k=2: i=1: 5x5 → 16. i=2: 1x1 → perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) → 0. So total is 16.\n\nWait, wait, no: wait 1x1 is a single cell, so the perimeter is 1*4? Or is it considered 0 because it's a single cell surrounded by nothing?\n\nWait, in the problem description, the perimeter is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. For a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 1 cell. So according to the formula, 2*(1+1-2) = 0, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 1, not 0.\n\nAh! So the formula may not hold when either cw or ch is 1.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the perimeter formula.\n\nEarlier, for a rectangle of r rows and c columns, the perimeter is 2*(r + c - 2). Let's see:\n\nFor r=1, c=1: 2*(1+1-2)=0. But in reality, it's 1 cell.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWhat's the correct way to calculate the perimeter for a rectangle?\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe perimeter is the number of cells on the border.\n\nFor a rectangle of r rows and c columns:\n\nTop and bottom rows: each has c cells. So 2*c.\n\nLeft and right columns, excluding the top and bottom cells: each has (r-2) cells. So 2*(r-2).\n\nTotal: 2c + 2(r-2) = 2(c + r -2).\n\nWhich is the same as the formula.\n\nBut for r=1, c=1:\n\n2*(1+1-2) = 0. But the actual perimeter is 1 cell.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo the formula works only when r >=2 and c >=2.\n\nBecause for r=1 and c=1, the perimeter is 1 cell, but the formula gives 0.\n\nSo, in our code, we might be missing some cases.\n\nSo how do we handle when the current_w or current_h is 1?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, for each ring, the rectangle is (w -4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)).\n\nSo for the last ring, if w or h is such that after subtracting 4*(k-1), it's 1, then the rectangle is 1 x something.\n\nWait, but in that case, the perimeter is 2*(1 + ch -2) = 2*(ch -1). But for ch=1, that's 0, but the actual perimeter is 1.\n\nSo, for cases where either cw or ch is 1, the formula overcounts.\n\nThis suggests that the initial formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so I need to adjust the perimeter calculation.\n\nAlternative approach: for each ring, the perimeter is:\n\nif cw <=1 or ch <=1: then the perimeter is max(0, 2*(cw + ch -2)) ?\n\nNo, that won't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct when the rectangle is at least 2x2.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWhat is the perimeter of a 1x5 rectangle?\n\nIt's 5 cells. Because it's a single row of 5 cells. So the perimeter is 5.\n\nAccording to the formula, 2*(1+5-2) = 2*4=8. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the formula is incorrect for cases where either dimension is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 1x1, it's 1, but formula gives 0.\n\nSo, the formula needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo what's the correct perimeter calculation?\n\nThe perimeter is the number of cells on the border.\n\nFor any rectangle, including those with 1 row or 1 column.\n\nHow to calculate it correctly?\n\nWell, another approach is to consider:\n\nperimeter = 2*(rows + columns - 2) if rows >=2 and columns >=2.\n\nElse:\n\nif rows == 1 and columns ==1: perimeter is 1.\n\nif rows ==1 and columns >1: perimeter is columns.\n\nif columns ==1 and rows>1: perimeter is rows.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after computing cw and ch, we need to handle these cases.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the rings are formed on rectangles that are (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), which could be any positive integers, including 1x1.\n\nSo, for each ring, we need to compute the perimeter correctly.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, compute cw and ch, then compute perimeter as follows:\n\nif cw == 1 and ch ==1: perimeter is 1.\n\nelif cw ==1: perimeter is ch.\n\nelif ch ==1: perimeter is cw.\n\nelse: perimeter is 2*(cw + ch -2).\n\nThat's the correct way.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code.\n\nSo, the code will have:\n\nfor each i in 1..k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   if cw <1 or ch <1:\n\n       # but according to problem constraints, this shouldn't happen.\n\n   if cw ==1 and ch ==1:\n\n       perimeter =1\n\n   elif cw ==1:\n\n       perimeter = ch\n\n   elif ch ==1:\n\n       perimeter = cw\n\n   else:\n\n       perimeter = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nSo, let's test this with the earlier case.\n\nTest case 1: 5 5 2.\n\ni=1: cw=5, ch=5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)=16.\n\ni=2: cw=5-4=1, ch=5-4=1 → perimeter is 1. Total 17.\n\nAnother test case: 1x5, k=1.\n\nperimeter is 5.\n\nAnother test case: 5x1, k=1 → perimeter 5.\n\nAnother test case: 2x2, k=1.\n\nperimeter is 2*(2+2-2) = 2*2=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 2x3, k=1.\n\nperimeter is 2*(2+3-2) = 2*3=6.\n\nWhich is correct: the top and bottom rows (each 3 cells) and the left and right columns (each 1 cell) → 3+3+1+1=8, but wait no, 2x3: perimeter is 8? No, wait 2 rows, 3 columns.\n\nTop row: 3 cells.\n\nRight column: 2 cells (but top and bottom are already counted).\n\nSame for left column.\n\nSo perimeter is 3 (top) + (2-2)*2 (sides) + 3 (bottom) → 3 + 0 +3 =6. Wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nIn a 2x3 grid:\n\nThe perimeter cells are:\n\nRow 1: all 3 cells.\n\nRow 2: all 3 cells.\n\nBut the columns: for column 1, row 2 is already counted in row 2. Similarly for column 3.\n\nSo, the total is 3 (row1) + 3 (row2) = 6.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 2*(2+3-2) = 2*3=6. So correct.\n\nWait, but the grid is 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\nVisualizing:\n\nCell (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nCell (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nSo the perimeter is 6 cells: all except (2,2)? No, wait, that's 6 cells.\n\nWait, no: in 2x3, the center cell is (2,2), which is not on the perimeter. So the perimeter has 6 cells. So formula is correct.\n\nSo the formula works for 2x3.\n\nBut when the rectangle is 1x5, the formula would give 2*(1+5-2)=8, but the correct perimeter is 5.\n\nSo, the formula isn't handling that case.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect, and the code needs to handle these edge cases.\n\nSo, in code, for each ring, after computing cw and ch, decide which case we are in.\n\nSo, now, the code structure is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   if cw <1 or ch <1:\n\n       # this shouldn't happen as per problem constraints.\n\n       # but just in case, set perimeter to 0.\n\n       perimeter =0\n\n   else:\n\n       if cw ==1 and ch ==1:\n\n           perimeter =1\n\n       elif cw ==1:\n\n           perimeter = ch\n\n       elif ch ==1:\n\n           perimeter = cw\n\n       else:\n\n           perimeter = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nSo, let's test this with some cases.\n\nTest case 1: 1x5, k=1.\n\ncw=1, ch=5.\n\nSince cw==1 and ch>1 → perimeter=5. So total is 5.\n\nTest case 2: 5x1, k=1.\n\nSimilarly, ch=1, so perimeter=5.\n\nTest case 3: 2x2, k=1.\n\ncw=2, ch=2. So perimeter= 2*(2+2-2)=4. Correct.\n\nTest case 4: 3x3, k=1 → 8.\n\nTest case 5: 7x9, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7+9-2=14 → 2*14=28.\n\ni=2: 3x5. 3+5-2=6 → 12. Total 40.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5x5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → 16.\n\ni=2: 1x1 → perimeter 1.\n\nTotal 17.\n\nAnother test case: 5x5, k=1 → 16.\n\nAnother test case: 1x1, k=1 → perimeter 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed along the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w` rows and `h` columns. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that gets smaller by 2 cells on each side for each subsequent ring. The task is to compute the total number of gilded cells after adding `k` such rings.\n\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are reduced by 4 cells (2 cells from each side) compared to the previous ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `rows` and `columns` is calculated as `2 * (rows + columns - 2)`. However, special cases where either dimension is 1 must be handled separately to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    cw = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    ch = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if cw == 1 and ch == 1:\n        perimeter = 1\n    elif cw == 1:\n        perimeter = ch\n    elif ch == 1:\n        perimeter = cw\n    else:\n        perimeter = 2 * (cw + ch - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width (`cw`) and height (`ch`) of the rectangle.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: Depending on the values of `cw` and `ch`, compute the perimeter correctly, handling edge cases where either dimension is 1.\n- **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately compute the number of gilded cells for any valid input within the problem constraints.",
