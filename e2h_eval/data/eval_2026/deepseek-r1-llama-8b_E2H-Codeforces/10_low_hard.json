Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about feeding a golorp, which is some kind of creature that eats variables. The input is the name of the golorp, and I need to output the lex smallest sequence of variable values that can feed it. If it's impossible, output 'false'.\n\nHmm. So, each golorp's diet is defined by its name. The variables can take values 0-9, and the golorp wants the lex smallest possible sequence. Also, if there are multiple valid sequences, it picks the lex smallest one. And if it's impossible, output false.\n\nWait, what's the structure of the golorp's name? Oh right, it's similar to Befunge programs. So the name represents the structure of the golorp's jaws and stomach.\n\nI remember that in Befunge, the program is a grid of characters, where each character is part of the code. The golorp's name probably defines a series of steps for variables to pass through.\n\nSo, the variables are consumed by the golorp's jaws, and they go into the stomach in some order. Each variable can only be used once, I think. Or wait, maybe not—since variables can be redefined as we go.\n\nBut how do the variables flow through the golorp's name?\n\nLet me think about the example given:\n\nIn the sample input, one of the outputs is '0010'. So the golorp's name must require four variables, each set to 0, 0, 1, 0.\n\nWait, but how does the structure of the name determine the number of variables needed?\n\nI think the structure of the golorp's name is a series of paths that variables can take. Each path leads to the stomach, and each step along the path might require a variable to be assigned a value. For example, in Befunge, the code is executed by moving the data pointer, and each instruction can modify the current value or move the pointer in different directions.\n\nSo, perhaps the golorp's name consists of a series of segments (like lines) that the variables follow. Each segment requires certain conditions to be met, and each condition may involve a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps each line in the golorp's name represents a condition that the variables must satisfy. For example, each line could represent a step that the variables must take, and each step may require certain constraints on the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the golorp's name represents a series of choices. For each choice point, the variables can take certain paths, and each path corresponds to a specific assignment of variables.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe key is that for each golorp, the name defines the way variables are consumed. So, the name is a string that represents the program. Variables are like tokens, and the program uses them in certain ways.\n\nWait, perhaps the golorp's name is structured such that each variable is used in a specific position, and the order in which variables are used determines the sequence we need to output.\n\nAnother approach: the problem requires us to model the golorp's name as a graph of variable dependencies. Each variable is a node, and edges represent the order in which variables are used. The goal is to assign each variable a digit (0-9) such that all constraints are satisfied, and the resulting sequence is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to model the constraints?\n\nMaybe the golorp's name is a series of operations that consume variables in a certain order. Each operation may require that certain variables are present and meet certain conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps each part of the golorp's name represents a function that transforms the current set of variables. For instance, certain operations may split the variables into different branches, each requiring certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the golorp's name is a series of lines that the variables must navigate. Each line may require a certain variable to be set based on previous variables.\n\nThis is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should look for a way to parse the golorp's name into a structure that can be processed step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the golorp's name is similar to a Befunge program, and the way variables are consumed is determined by the movement of the data pointer in the grid.\n\nIn Befunge, the data pointer starts at position (0,0), and the code is a grid. The pointer moves around according to the code, modifying the current value as it goes. The pointer can change direction based on the code, and when it hits the end of the grid, it wraps around.\n\nSo, perhaps the golorp's name is a Befunge-like grid, and the variables correspond to the data pointer's path through this grid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each variable can take values from 0 to 9.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can feed a golorp based on its name. The golorp's name is structured similarly to a Befunge program, and the goal is to find the smallest valid sequence of digits (0-9) for feeding it. If it's impossible to feed the golorp, we should return \"false\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse the Input**: The input is a string representing the golorp's name, which is parsed into a grid structure.\n2. **Identify Segments**: The golorp's name is divided into segments (lines) that represent paths the variables must take.\n3. **Track Variables**: Each segment may require certain variables to be set, and these variables must be tracked in the order they are consumed.\n4. **Generate Possible Values**: For each segment, generate all possible valid sequences of digits (0-9) that satisfy the constraints imposed by the segment.\n5. **Check Validity**: Ensure that the generated sequences are valid and consistent across all segments.\n6. **Find Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**: Among all valid sequences, select the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef parse_golorp(name):\n    grid = []\n    max_row = 0\n    rows = name.split('\\n')\n    for r in rows:\n        if len(r) > max_row:\n            max_row = len(r)\n    grid.append([''] * max_row)\n    for i, row in enumerate(rows):\n        if len(row) < max_row:\n            row += ' ' * (max_row -
