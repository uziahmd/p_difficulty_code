After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach of the three lines represents a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nI need to process each subject across all students to find the best mark for each subject.\n\nWait, but each subject is a position in the string. For example, for the first subject, it's the first character of each student's string; for the second subject, the second character, etc.\n\nSo for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I need to look at all students' j-th character, find the maximum, and note which student(s) have that maximum.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they have at least one such maximum in any subject.\n\nThe approach I can take is:\n\n1. For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each subject, record which student(s) achieved this maximum.\n3. For each student, count how many subjects they are the maximum in. If the count is >=1, they are successful.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, iterate through each subject and check if their mark is the highest in that subject.\n\nBut wait, for each subject, we can precompute the maximum value and who achieved it. Then, for each student, we can just see if they are the best in any subject by checking against these precomputed values.\n\nYes, that seems efficient.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read each student's grade string.\n- For each of the m subjects:\n   - Iterate over all students to collect their marks for this subject.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n   - Record the maximum mark and the list of students who have this mark.\n- Once all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are present in the best list of any subject.\n- Count the number of students who are successful.\n\nWait, but for a subject, only one student can be the best? Or multiple students can have the same maximum mark. But according to the problem statement, a student is the best at a subject if there's no student with a higher mark. So even if others have the same max, the student is considered the best because no one is higher.\n\nWait, no. Because \"best\" is defined as having the maximum. So if two students have the same max in a subject, then neither is better than the other. Because for a student to be the best, he must be the unique maximum. Otherwise, if two students have the same max, then both are considered the best.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"A student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nAh! So even if another student has the same maximum, the student is still the best because no one has a higher mark. So for a subject, all students who have the maximum mark are considered bests. So each such student contributes to their success.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So for each subject, the set of students who have the maximum mark are all considered bests for that subject. So a student can be the best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo, for each subject, I need to find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject. Then, for each student, if they are in any of these sets for any subject, they are successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each subject j (0 to m-1):\n\n- Collect all the marks from each student's j-th character.\n- Find the maximum mark in this collection.\n- Collect all students whose j-th mark equals this maximum.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are present in any of the best sets for any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nNow, how to represent this data?\n\nI can create a list of sets. For each subject, a set containing the indices of students (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing) who are best in that subject.\n\nWait, but the students are given in order. So perhaps for each subject j, I can have a list (or a set) of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Data Collection**: For each student, read their grades for all subjects and store them in a list.\n3. **Subject-wise Maximum Calculation**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n4. **Identify Best Students**: For each subject, identify all students who achieved the maximum mark in that subject.\n5. **Count Successful Students**: Check each student to see if they are among the best students in at least one subject and count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append(s)\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = '0'\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = students[i][j]\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in[j].add(i)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if len(best_in[j]) >= 1 for some j where i is in best_in[j]:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Each subsequent line represents a student's grades for each subject.\n2. **Storing Grades**: Each student's grades are stored in a list where each element corresponds to a student's performance in each subject.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved. This helps in determining which students are the best in each subject.\n4. **Tracking Best Students**: Using a list of sets, track which students are the best in each subject based on the maximum marks found.\n5. **Counting Success**: For each student, check if they are part of the best students in any subject. If they are, increment the count of successful students.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging data collection and set operations to track the best performers in each subject.",
