Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vasily is trying to maximize the number of hours his candles can burn. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take a certain number of these burned-out candles (let's say 'b') and make a new candle. So the question is, given the initial number of candles 'a' and the exchange rate 'b', how many total hours can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm. So, initially, he has 'a' candles. Each burns for 1 hour, adding to the total. Then, every time he has enough burned candles, he can exchange them for more. But wait, each new candle also produces another burned one when used.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For input 4 2, the output is 7. So:\n\n- He starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours.\n- After burning, he has 4 stubs. He can exchange 4/2 = 2 new candles. So he burns those, adding 2 hours, now he has 2 stubs from these plus the remaining 0 from the previous (since 4 / 2 was exact). Wait, no—wait, after burning 4, he had 4 stubs. He makes 2 new candles by using 4 stubs. So he burns those 2, which adds 2 hours, making the total 6. Now he has 2 stubs again. Can he exchange them? Well, if b is 2, yes: 2/2=1 new candle. Burn that, adding 1 hour, total 7. Now he has 1 stub. Since 1 is less than b=2, he can't make any more. So total is 7.\n\nSo the process is: each time you have some stubs, you can exchange them into as many new candles as possible. Each new candle gives you a stub when burned, so you have to track the leftover stubs after each exchange.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Start with a candles, add to the total.\n2. Collect the stubs as you burn each candle.\n3. When the number of stubs is >= b, you can exchange them for new candles. The number of new candles is s // b, where s is the current stub count.\n4. Add this number to the total (each new candle burns for an hour).\n5. The stubs are now the remainder (s % b) + the new stubs from the newly burned candles (which is the number of new candles made, since each new candle gives a stub).\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, in step 3, when you exchange s stubs for s//b new candles, you spend s//b * b stubs. So the new stubs would be (s - (s//b)*b) + (number of new candles), because each new candle is burned and thus adds a stub.\n\nWait, no. Because each new candle is burned, so for each new candle, you get one more stub. So when you exchange s stubs for k new candles (k = s // b), you add k to the total, and the leftover stubs are s % b + k.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you burn k candles, each gives a stub, so you get k stubs added.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize total = 0\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nOnce this loop exits, the total is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if the initial a is zero? But according to the input constraints, a is at least 1.\n\nWait, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nLoop steps:\n\nstubs =4.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2, total becomes 4+2=6. stubs becomes (4%2)=0 +2=2.\n\nNow stubs=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=1, total becomes 7. stubs=0+1=1.\n\nNow stubs <2, exit. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: a=6, b=3.\n\nInitial stubs=6.\n\nnew_candles=6//3=2, total=6+2=8. stubs=0+2=2. 2<3, so loop ends. So output is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\nTotal starts at 5. stubs=5.\n\nnew_candles=1, total becomes 6. stubs=0+1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles and the ability to exchange burned-out candles for new ones. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` and initialize the total hours of illumination to 0.\n2. **Burn Candles and Collect Stubs**: Each candle burns for exactly one hour, so we add `a` hours to the total initially. After burning these candles, we collect `a` stubs.\n3. **Exchange Stubs for New Candles**: While we have enough stubs to make at least one new candle (i.e., the number of stubs is at least `b`), we exchange them. Each exchange gives us `stubs // b` new candles. Each of these new candles burns for an hour, contributing to the total hours. Additionally, each new candle produces a stub when burned.\n4. **Update Stubs**: After each exchange, update the number of stubs to the remainder of the division plus the new stubs from the burned new candles.\n5. **Termination**: The process stops when we no longer have enough stubs to make a new candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with `a` candles, which burn for `a` hours. This sets our initial total hours.\n- **Loop Through Exchanges**: In each iteration, we check if we have enough stubs to make new candles. If we do, we calculate how many new candles we can make and add that to the total hours. We then update the stub count to reflect the remainder of the stubs after the exchange plus the new stubs from the newly burned candles.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently processes each possible exchange, ensuring we maximize the number of hours the candles can burn without unnecessary computations.\n\nThis method ensures that we optimally use every possible stub to extend the illumination time, providing the correct result in minimal steps.",
