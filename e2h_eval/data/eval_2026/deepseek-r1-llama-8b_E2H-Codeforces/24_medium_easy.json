She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Luba has n open tabs, and she's at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but not beyond the current a and b, which are the min and max of the remaining tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps she needs to take.\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to a position where she can close a bunch of tabs at once. Like, moving to l-1 so she can close everything to the left, but wait, no—because if she's at l, then closing to the left would close nothing. Wait, no. Wait, when she closes to the left, she closes all tabs to the left of the current position. So if she's at position i, closing to the left will close [a, i-1], and closing to the right will close [i+1, b].\n\nSo the plan is: she needs to decide whether to close the left side first or the right side, and then perhaps move to a position that allows her to close the other side efficiently.\n\nWait, but what's a and b? Initially, a is 1 and b is n. But as she starts closing tabs, a and b change. For example, if she closes some on the left, a increases, and similarly for the right.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nShe needs to close all tabs outside l to r. That means, any tabs less than l must be closed, and any tabs greater than r must be closed.\n\nSo the initial state is all tabs open.\n\nShe can perform the following actions each second:\n\n1. Move left: from i to i-1 (but can't go below a)\n2. Move right: from i to i+1 (can't go above b)\n3. Close left: closes all tabs [a, i-1]\n4. Close right: closes all tabs [i+1, b]\n\nEach action takes one second.\n\nOur task is to find the minimal number of steps to close all tabs except those in [l, r].\n\nSo, first, we need to figure out how to model the problem.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: There are tabs to the left of l that need to be closed.\n\nCase 2: There are tabs to the right of r that need to be closed.\n\nIf both are present, she needs to close both sides.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the steps she can take:\n\nShe needs to get to a position where she can close the left side, then possibly get to another position to close the right side, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close one side, then the other without needing to move much.\n\nWait, for example, suppose she needs to close the left and right.\n\nShe starts at pos. Maybe she should move to l, then close left. Then move to r, then close right. Or perhaps she can do better by moving directly to the optimal positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close the right first, then the left.\n\nWait, but depending on the initial position, the order may vary.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, determine whether there are tabs to the left of l or to the right of r that need to be closed.\n\nLet me define:\n\nleft_to_close = True if l > 1, because there are tabs before l that need to be closed.\n\nright_to_close = True if r < n, because there are tabs after r that need to be closed.\n\nSo, if neither is true (like l=1 and r=n), then she doesn't need to do anything. The answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, she needs to perform some operations.\n\nNow, the steps involve:\n\n1. Moving to the leftmost position to close the left side.\n2. Closing the left side.\n3. Moving to the rightmost position to close the right side.\n4. Closing the right side.\n\nAlternatively, she could close the right side first, then the left.\n\nWe need to calculate the minimal steps for both options and choose the smaller one.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's not necessary to do both. For example, if she can close both in a single movement.\n\nWait, but no. Because the initial position may not allow that.\n\nWait, perhaps she can close the left in one step, then the right in another. Or perhaps she can close both in two steps, but perhaps some steps can be combined.\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nLet me outline the steps for closing left and then right.\n\nSteps for left then right:\n\n- Determine the position where she can close the left side. That's position l, because closing to the left of l (e.g., at l) will close all tabs to the left of l, which are the ones before l.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if she's at position i, then closing left will close [a, i-1]. So, for the left side, the optimal position to close is i = l. Because then, [a, l-1] is the part to be closed.\n\nSo, she needs to move to l, then close left. Then, move to r, then close right.\n\nBut wait, after closing the left, a becomes l. So, when she moves right from l, she can go to l+1, etc.\n\nWait, let's see an example.\n\nSuppose n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nIn the sample input, the output is 5.\n\nWhat's happening here?\n\nShe moves to 2 (1 step). Then closes left (tabs 1 are closed). Then moves to 3 (another step). Then moves to 4 (step 4). Then closes right (closing tabs 5,6). So total 5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Move to l (2): 1 step.\n\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n\n3. Move to r (from 2 to 4, which requires moving right twice): 2 steps.\n\n4. Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo, in this case, the steps are: move to l, close left, move to r, close right.\n\nSo the general approach for left then right is:\n\ntime = (steps to move from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to move from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nSimilarly, for right then left:\n\ntime = (steps to move to r) + 1 (close right) + (steps to move from r to l) + 1 (close left).\n\nWe can calculate both options and pick the minimal.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that after closing left, some parts of the right can be accessed more quickly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to close the right first, then the left.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because after closing right, the a and b change, but I think in this problem, once you close a side, the a and b adjust accordingly, but the other side can still be handled.\n\nWait, but when you close left, the new a is l, so when you want to close the right, you can go to r, which is now within [l, r], but perhaps the initial movement is from l to r.\n\nWait, perhaps in some cases, it's better to close the right first.\n\nFor example, suppose pos is at the far right, and r is small.\n\nLike, n=6, pos=6, l=1, r=3.\n\nShe needs to close the right (tabs 4-6), but she's already at 6. So she can just close right (1 step), then she's done. Because after that, a becomes 1, b becomes 3.\n\nSo, time is 1.\n\nWait, but what about the left side? She doesn't need to close any tabs on the left since l=1.\n\nSo, in this case, she only needs to close the right, which is one step.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nShe doesn't need to close anything because l=1 and r=5. So time is 0.\n\nSo, the key is to determine whether there are tabs to the left of l, and/or to the right of r.\n\nSo, let's formalize the approach.\n\nCompute the four possibilities:\n\n1. Close left first, then right.\n\n2. Close right first, then left.\n\n3. Close only left (if right_to_close is false).\n\n4. Close only right (if left_to_close is false).\n\nWait, but 3 and 4 are covered in the above two cases.\n\nSo, for each case, compute the time needed.\n\nThen choose the minimal time among all applicable options.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute left_to_close (l > 1) and right_to_close (r < n).\n\n- If both are false: return 0.\n\n- Else, compute the time for closing left first, then right.\n\n- Compute the time for closing right first, then left.\n\n- Choose the minimal between these two.\n\nAdditionally, there might be cases where the initial position is such that she can close both in fewer steps.\n\nWait, for example, if she is at l, and she can close left, then move to r and close right. Or maybe she can do it in a way that some steps overlap.\n\nBut I think the two options (left then right, or right then left) cover all possibilities.\n\nSo, let's model each option.\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from current pos to l.\n\n   Steps: |pos - l|.\n\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n\n3. Now, after closing left, the new a is l. So, the available tabs are from l to current b (which was n, but after closing left, a is l, but b remains n until we close the right.\n\nWait, no. After closing left, the a becomes l, but the b is the maximum index of the unclosed tabs. Initially, after closing left, the right side is still open up to n. So, to close the right, she needs to get to r, but r is within the current a and b.\n\nSo, after closing left, she needs to move from l to r. The steps are |l - r|.\n\n4. Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, after closing the left, the a is l, but the b is still n. So when she moves from l to r, she can't go beyond n, but in this case, r is <=n.\n\nSo, the movement is allowed.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to r: steps |pos - r|.\n\n2. Close right: 1 step.\n\n3. Now, the new b is r. So, she needs to move from r to l, but l is >=a (which is initially 1, but after closing left, a would be l.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAfter closing right, the new b is r. So, the available tabs are from a (initially 1) to r.\n\nSo, she needs to move from r to l.\n\nThe steps are |r - l|.\n\n4. Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nWait, but wait: when she closes right first, she is at r. Then she needs to move to l, but after closing right, the a is still 1, so she can move freely from r to l as long as the path is clear.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each of these two options, the time is as computed.\n\nBut what if one of the options is not possible? For example, if after closing left, she can't reach r because of a and b changing.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, after closing, a and b are updated, but during movement, she can only move within the current a and b.\n\nWait, but during the process of moving, a and b are the min and max of the currently open tabs. So, when she is moving, she can't go beyond a and b of that moment.\n\nWait, for example, when she closes left first, she moves to l, then closes left. So, a becomes l, and b remains n.\n\nThen, when she wants to move to r, she can do so because r is between l and n.\n\nSo, yes, she can always reach r.\n\nSimilarly, when she closes right first, she can move to l from r because l is >=a (since a is 1).\n\nSo, in both cases, the movement is possible.\n\nWait, but what if she closes left, then the a becomes l, and she needs to move to r. But if r is less than l, that's impossible. But in our problem, l <= r, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the movement is always possible.\n\nSo, now, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the two options:\n\noption1 = steps to move to l, close left (1 step), move to r, close right (1 step). So total is (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1.\n\noption2 = steps to move to r, close right (1 step), move to l, close left (1 step). So total is (distance from pos to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) + 1.\n\nBut wait, wait. Because after closing left or right, the a and b change. So, when she moves after closing, the a and b are different.\n\nSo, for option1:\n\nAfter moving to l, she closes left. So, a is now l.\n\nThen, she needs to move from l to r. But in the current state, a is l, and b is n (since she hasn't closed the right yet). So, she can move to r, which is between l and n.\n\nSo, the distance is |l - r|.\n\nSame for option2: after closing right, b is r. So, she needs to move from r to l. Since l is <= r, she can move left to l.\n\nWait, but in option2, after closing right, the b is r. So, when she is at r, she can move to l, but l is >= a, which is 1.\n\nSo, the distance is r - l.\n\nSo, the steps are correct.\n\nBut wait, what if l == r? Then, she doesn't need to do anything, unless l > 1 or r <n, which would require closing.\n\nWait, no. If l == r, then the segment is a single tab. So, she needs to close tabs to the left and/or right of that.\n\nSo, for example, if l == r == 3, and pos is 3, then if there are tabs on the left (like 1 and 2) and/or right (like 4,5,6), she needs to close them.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCalculate left_to_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_to_close = (r < n)\n\nIf both are false, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1: move to l, close left, move to r, close right.\n\nsteps_option1 = (abs(pos - l)) + 1 + (abs(l - r)) + 1.\n\nCompute option2: move to r, close right, move to l, close left.\n\nsteps_option2 = (abs(pos - r)) + 1 + (abs(r - l)) + 1.\n\nAlso, consider if one of the options is unnecessary.\n\nWait, for example, if l is 1, then closing left is not needed.\n\nWait, no. If l is 1, then left_to_close is false. So, we don't have to close the left side.\n\nWait, I think the initial condition is correct.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nread n, pos, l, r\n\nleft_to_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_to_close = (r < n)\n\nif not left_to_close and not right_to_close:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # compute steps for option1 and option2\n\n    steps_option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    steps_option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    min_steps = min(steps_option1, steps_option2)\n\n    print(min_steps)\n\nWait, but wait! What if she can close both in fewer steps?\n\nWait, perhaps she can close both in a single step if she is already in a position that allows her to close both.\n\nWait, for example, if she is at l, and she can close both left and right in two steps: move to l, close left (1 step), move to r, close right (1 step). Or, perhaps she can close right first, then left.\n\nWait, but the steps are the same as in the options.\n\nWait, no, because in some cases, perhaps the movement steps can be optimized.\n\nWait, for example, what if she can close the left and right in one step each, but the movement is such that she can combine the movement and closing.\n\nWait, but no. Because each action is a separate step. So, each movement is a step, each close is a step.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think about another example.\n\nSuppose n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nAs in the sample input.\n\nOption1: steps to move to l (2): 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nMove to r (4): 2 steps (from 2 to 3, then 3 to 4).\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nOption2: steps to move to r (4): 1 step (from 3 to 4).\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nMove to l (2): 2 steps (4 to 3, then 3 to 2).\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo, both options give 5 steps. So, the code would output 5.\n\nAnother example: sample input 2 is ['6 3 1 3']\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nSo, left_to_close is false because l=1.\n\nRight_to_close is true because r=3 <6.\n\nSo, she needs to close the right.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nMove to r (3): 0 steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal 1 step.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: ['5 2 1 5'].\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nleft_to_close is false (l=1), right_to_close is false (r=5= n).\n\nSo, no steps needed.\n\nThus, the code returns 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nWhat about another test case?\n\nTest case: n=7, pos=5, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_to_close: 3>1 → True.\n\nright_to_close:5<7→True.\n\nSo, compute option1:\n\nmove to l (3) from 5: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove to r (5): 2 steps (3→4→5).\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+2+1=6.\n\nOption2:\n\nmove to r (5): 0 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to l (3): 2 steps (5→4→3).\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 0+1+2+1=4.\n\nSo, option2 is better.\n\nThus, the code would choose 4.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nAfter closing right, the new b is 5. So, when she is at 5, she can move to 3, as 3 >= a (which is 1).\n\nYes, so 2 steps.\n\nSo, the code's calculation is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, pos=2, l=2, r=3.\n\nleft_to_close:2>1 → yes.\n\nright_to_close:3<4 → yes.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (0 steps), close left (1), move to 3 (1 step), close right (1). Total 3.\n\nOption2: move to 3 (1 step), close right (1), move to 2 (1 step), close left (1). Total 4.\n\nSo, option1 is better.\n\nSo, the code would return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, pos=2, l=2, r=2.\n\nleft_to_close:2>1 → yes.\n\nright_to_close:2<3 → yes.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (0 steps), close left (1), move to 2 (0 steps), close right (1). Total 2 steps.\n\nOption2: move to 2 (0 steps), close right (1), move to 2 (0 steps), close left (1). Total 2 steps.\n\nSo, both options give 2 steps.\n\nSo, code returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, pos=4, l=2, r=3.\n\nleft_to_close:2>1 → yes.\n\nright_to_close:3<4 → yes.\n\nOption1: move to 2 from 4: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove to 3: 1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nOption2: move to 3 from 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nSo, option2 is better.\n\nThus, code returns 4.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_to_close and right_to_close.\n\nIf both are false, output 0.\n\nElse, compute steps for both options.\n\nChoose the minimal.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input line as four integers.\n\nCompute left_to_close and right_to_close.\n\nIf not left_to_close and not right_to_close: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nsteps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\nsteps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\nprint min(steps1, steps2)\n\nWait, but wait: what about when l == r?\n\nIn that case, the steps are same as above.\n\nBut also, if l == r, then after closing left and right, the tabs are exactly [l, r].\n\nSo, the code still applies.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → steps1 = 1+1+2+1=5; steps2 = 1+1+2+1=5 → min 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:6 3 1 3 → left_to_close is false, right_to_close is true. So, steps1 is not considered because left_to_close is false.\n\nWait, no: in this case, left_to_close is false because l=1.\n\nSo, for option1, since left_to_close is false, perhaps we don't need to consider option1.\n\nWait, wait. Oh no! Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, I assumed that both options are considered regardless of left_to_close and right_to_close.\n\nWait, that's incorrect.\n\nBecause in the case where left_to_close is false, option1 is not needed because she doesn't need to close left. Similarly, if right_to_close is false, option2 is not needed.\n\nWait, no. Because in option1, even if left_to_close is false, she can still close the right, but option1 is the steps for closing left then right. But if she doesn't need to close left, why would she do that?\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, I assumed that both options are computed, but that's incorrect.\n\nBecause, for example, in the second sample input, the correct approach is to close right (only), but the code would compute steps1 and steps2, but steps1 includes closing left, which is unnecessary.\n\nSo, the code as written is wrong.\n\nOh no, this is a big mistake.\n\nSo, what's the problem here?\n\nThe code is computing steps for both options, but in reality, if she doesn't need to close the left, then option1 is not an option, because she wouldn't need to do that part.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWe need to compute the steps for each option only if both the left and right closures are needed.\n\nWait, no. Because in some cases, the option may be partially needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nIf left_to_close is True, then option1 requires closing left and right.\n\nBut if left_to_close is False, then option1 is not needed, because she doesn't have to close left.\n\nWait, no. Option1 is the sequence of closing left then right. So, if she doesn't need to close left, then she shouldn't do that part.\n\nSo, the steps for option1 are only required if left_to_close is True.\n\nSimilarly, option2 is only required if right_to_close is True.\n\nWait, no. Because in option1, she closes left and right regardless of whether she needs to. So, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is that for option1, the time is only considered if both left_to_close and right_to_close are True.\n\nSimilarly for option2.\n\nNo, because in some cases, perhaps she can close only one side.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute steps1 as follows: steps to move to l, close left, move to r, close right. But this is only needed if both left_to_close and right_to_close are True.\n\nSimilarly, steps2 is only needed if both are True.\n\nWait, no. Because if only one side needs to be closed, then she can skip that part.\n\nWait, but the code as written is considering steps for both options even when one is not needed.\n\nWhich is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nIf left_to_close and right_to_close:\n\n    compute steps1 and steps2.\n\nElse:\n\n    if left_to_close: compute steps for option1 (but not option2)\n\n    elif right_to_close: compute steps for option2 (but not option1)\n\n    else: 0.\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps for each option are only computed when both left_to_close and right_to_close are True.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in some cases, perhaps she can close one side first, then the other, even if the other side is not needed.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because, for example, if she doesn't need to close the left, then why would she move to l and close it?\n\nIt's unnecessary.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute steps for option1 only if left_to_close and right_to_close are both True.\n\nSimilarly, compute steps for option2 only if left_to_close and right_to_close are both True.\n\nWait, no. Because if she needs to close only one side, perhaps she can do it with fewer steps.\n\nFor example, if she only needs to close the left, then the steps are:\n\nmove to l, close left: steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nNo need to close right, so no further steps.\n\nSimilarly, if she only needs to close the right, steps are |pos - r| +1.\n\nSo, the code should account for all possibilities:\n\n- Both left and right need to be closed: compute both options, choose the minimal.\n\n- Only left: compute steps for option1 (only close left part).\n\n- Only right: compute steps for option2 (only close right part).\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nWe have four possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both left and right need to be closed.\n\n2. Only left needs to be closed.\n\n3. Only right needs to be closed.\n\n4. Neither needs to be closed.\n\nSo, for each scenario, the steps are:\n\n1. Both: compute steps1 and steps2.\n\n2. Only left: steps1' = steps to move to l and close left.\n\n   steps1' = |pos - l| + 1.\n\n3. Only right: steps2' = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nif left_to_close and right_to_close:\n\n   compute steps1 and steps2.\n\nelif left_to_close:\n\n   steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nelif right_to_close:\n\n   steps = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nelse:\n\n   steps =0.\n\nSo, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, let's rework the code.\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nleft_to_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_to_close = (r < n)\n\nif not left_to_close and not right_to_close:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_to_close and right_to_close:\n\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\n\nelif left_to_close:\n\n    # only close left.\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelse:\n\n    # only close right.\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nThis way, the code correctly handles all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input 2:\n\n['6 3 1 3'] → l=1, r=3.\n\nleft_to_close is False (1 is not >1), right_to_close is True (3 <6).\n\nSo, code goes to the else clause.\n\nsteps = |3 -3| +1 = 0 +1 =1 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 → both need to be closed.\n\nsteps1 = 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nsteps2 =1+1+2+1=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, pos=2, l=2, r=3.\n\nleft_to_close=True, right_to_close=True.\n\nsteps1=0+1 +1+1=3.\n\nsteps2=2+1 +1+1=5.\n\nso, minimal is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5 → no steps needed.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=5, l=3, r=5 → both need to be closed.\n\nsteps1=5-3=2 +1 +5-3=2 +1 → total 2+1+2+1=6.\n\nsteps2=5-5=0 +1 +5-3=2 +1 → 0+1+2+1=4.\n\nSo, minimal is 4.\n\nSo, the code would compute that correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, pos=4, l=2, r=3.\n\nleft_to_close=True, right_to_close=True.\n\nsteps1: move to 2 from 4 (2 steps) +1 + move to3 from 2 (1 step) +1 → total 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nsteps2: move to 3 from4 (1) +1 + move to2 from3 (1) +1 → 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nso, minimal is4.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted as per the corrected approach.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment in her browser. The approach involves calculating the optimal steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Steps for Each Scenario**:\n   - **Both Sides Need Closing**: Compute the steps required to close both sides either by moving to `l` first then `r`, or moving to `r` first then `l`.\n   - **Only Left Side Needs Closing**: Calculate the steps needed to move to `l` and close the left tabs.\n   - **Only Right Side Needs Closing**: Calculate the steps needed to move to `r` and close the right tabs.\n3. **Select the Minimum Steps**: Compare the computed steps for each scenario and choose the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_to_close = (l > 1)\nright_to_close = (r < n)\n\nif not left_to_close and not right_to_close:\n    print(0)\nelif left_to_close and right_to_close:\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n    print(min(steps1, steps2))\nelif left_to_close:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if `l` is greater than 1 (tabs to the left) and if `r` is less than `n` (tabs to the right).\n- **Steps Calculation**:\n  - **Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, calculate steps for two scenarios: closing left first then right, and vice versa. Choose the minimum steps from both.\n  - **Single Side**: If only one side needs closing, compute the steps required to move to the relevant position and close the tabs.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently computes the steps in constant time, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle all edge cases and compute the minimum steps required using straightforward arithmetic and conditional checks.",
