Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, n is odd, which means the grid has a single central square where both diagonals meet.\n\nLet me break down the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input: The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters.\n2. Check the two main diagonals:\n   - All elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) must be the same.\n   - All elements on the secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must be the same.\n3. Additionally, all non-diagonal elements must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nSo, how do I approach checking these conditions?\n\nFirst, I'll read the grid into a 2D array. Let's say grid[i][j] represents the row i and column j.\n\nFor the diagonals:\n- The main diagonal consists of positions where i == j.\n- The secondary diagonal consists of positions where i + j = n - 1.\n\nI need to check two things for both diagonals:\na) Are all their elements the same?\nb) Are they the same as each other? Because for it to form an X, both diagonals must have the same character, but wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that both diagonals must consist of the same letter. So, for example, if one diagonal is all 'x' and the other is all 'o', that's not allowed. Both must be the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\" So the two diagonals must be composed of the same letter. So the main and secondary diagonals must have the same character.\n\nSo first, check that all elements on both diagonals are the same, and then ensure that all other elements are the same and different.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Extract the main diagonal and check if all characters are the same. Also extract the secondary diagonal and check the same.\n3. Check if both diagonals have the same character.\n4. Then, check all the non-diagonal cells. They must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement each part.\n\nExtracting the diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal is straightforward. For a grid of size n x n, the main diagonal is grid[0][0], grid[1][1], ..., grid[n-1][n-1].\n\nSecondary diagonal is grid[0][n-1], grid[1][n-2], ..., grid[n-1][0].\n\nFor each diagonal, collect all the characters and check if they are all the same.\n\nSo for the main diagonal, get all grid[i][i]. For the secondary, get grid[i][n-1-i].\n\nCheck if all elements in main_diag are same and all in secondary_diag are same.\n\nThen, check if the main_diag_char equals secondary_diag_char.\n\nWait, but what if n is 3, like in the sample input? For n=3, main_diag has 3 elements, secondary also 3.\n\nOnce the diagonals are confirmed to be same, proceed.\n\nNext, check all the non-diagonal cells. They must be same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, collect all cells where i != j and i + j != n-1. For each such cell, check if all are the same as each other and not equal to the diagonal character.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, create main_diag and secondary_diag.\n\nmain_diag = []\nsecondary_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    secondary_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nThen, check if all elements in main_diag are same:\n\ndef all_same(s):\n    return len(set(s)) == 1\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(secondary_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != secondary_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ndiagonal_char = main_diag[0]\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diagonal = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diagonal:\n    # n=1? But n >=3 per problem statement.\n    pass\n\nif not all_same(non_diagonal):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif diagonal_char == list(non_diagonal)[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nElse, print YES.\n\nWait, but what about the case when non_diagonal is empty? Like when n=1, but n is given as >=3, so no.\n\nWait, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 6 in total (since 3+3 = 9, subtract 3 from main diag and 3 from secondary, but the center is counted in both, so 9-3-3+1=4? Wait no, for n=3, the cells are:\n\nPositions:\n\n(0,0), (0,2) -> diag\n\n(1,1)\n\n(2,0), (2,2)\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four cells.\n\nYes, for n=3, non_diagonal has 4 cells.\n\nBut for n=5, there are more non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoox\nxooox\n\nThe main diagonal is x, o, o, o, x.\n\nWait, no. Wait grid is zero-based:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o o x\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nWait, the main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'x', grid[3][3] = 'x', grid[4][4] = 'x'.\n\nSo main_diag is ['x','x','x','x','x'] → same.\n\nSecondary diagonal: grid[0][4] = 'x', grid[1][3]='x', grid[2][2]='x', grid[3][1]='x', grid[4][0]='x'. So same as main.\n\nSo main_diag_char is 'x'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: all should be same and not 'x'.\n\nLooking at the grid, non-diagonal cells:\n\nFrom row 0: columns 1,2,3 → 'o','o','o'\n\nRow 1: columns 0,2,4 → 'o','o','o'\n\nRow 2: columns 0,1,3 → 's','o','o'\n\nWait, row 2, column 0 is 's'—so non-diagonal includes 's', which is different from 'o's.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1]='s', grid[2][2]='w' → 'w', 's', 'w' → not same. So condition fails, output NO? But wait the sample output for this case is YES.\n\nWait wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait let me re-examine the second sample input.\n\nThe input is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo grid[0] is 'wsw', grid[1] is 'sws', grid[2] is 'wsw'.\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] is 'w', grid[1][1] is 'w', grid[2][2] is 'w'. So all 'w's.\n\nSecondary diagonal: grid[0][2] is 'w', grid[1][1] is 'w', grid[2][0] is 'w'. So all 'w's.\n\nSo main and secondary are same.\n\nThen, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\ngrid[0][1] = 's', grid[1][0] = 's', grid[1][2] = 's', grid[2][1] = 's'.\n\nAll 's's, which are different from 'w's.\n\nSo conditions are met: output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1] = 'p', grid[2][2] = 'e' → not same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nSo the code correctly handles the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\naba\naaa\n\nMain diag: a, a, a.\n\nSecondary diag: a, a, a.\n\nSo same.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: b's and a's.\n\nWait no: grid[0][1] is 'a' (same as diag?), wait no.\n\nWait the non-diagonal cells are:\n\ngrid[0][1] = 'a' → same as diag.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells include 'a's and others.\n\nSo the code would check if all non-diagonal are same and different from diag.\n\nIn this case, the non-diagonal cells are 'a', 'b', 'a', 'a' → not all same. So condition fails.\n\nThus, output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all non-diagonal are same, and diag same.\n\nLike:\n\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nWait, then non-diagonal cells are all 'x's, same as diag. So condition fails because non-diagonal can't be same as diag.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nWhat about when n=1? Well, the problem states n is odd and >=3, so n=1 is not allowed.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, all non-diagonal are same as each other but different from diag.\n\nLike:\n\nw w w\nw w w\nw w w\n\nWait, no. Because non-diagonal cells are all 'w's, same as diag. So condition fails.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5.\n\nLet me think of a valid 'X':\n\nThe grid is:\n\na a a a a\na b a b a\na a a a a\na b a b a\na a a a a\n\nWait, main diag is all 'a's, secondary diag is all 'a's.\n\nNon-diagonal: all 'b's, which are same and different.\n\nSo code should return YES.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- How to handle reading the input correctly. Since in Python, the input is read via input().strip(), but sometimes, when the input is given as a string with newlines, like in the first sample input, perhaps the input is being read correctly.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input, the first input is given as a string like '5\\nxooox\\n...' etc. So in Python, using input().strip() will read the entire line, including the newline, but wait no: the newline is stripped by .strip(), so perhaps the actual line is stored without the trailing newline.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — so each line is exactly n characters, no leading/trailing spaces. So in code, after reading each line, we can just take the first n characters, but perhaps .strip() is unnecessary. Or, perhaps, better to read each line as is, without stripping.\n\nWait, because if someone enters a line with a space, .strip() would remove it. But the problem states that each line is n small English letters, so no whitespace.\n\nSo in the code, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)] — but since each line is exactly n letters, perhaps it's better to read as:\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    if len(line) != n:\n        # invalid input, but according to problem statement, it's correct.\n        pass\n    grid.append(line)\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the first way is sufficient.\n\nAnother issue: checking if main_diag and secondary_diag are same.\n\nWait, for example, in n=3, suppose main_diag is ['x','x','x'], secondary is ['y','y','y']. Then, the code would check if main_diag[0] == secondary_diag[0], which is 'x' vs 'y' — so condition fails, output NO.\n\nWhich is correct because the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\nAnother thing: what about when n is larger, like 5. Need to ensure that all the main and secondary diagonals are same.\n\nSo code seems solid.\n\nPossible optimizations: for very large n, but n is up to 299, so it's manageable.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main_diag and secondary_diag.\n\nCheck if all same in each.\n\nCheck if they are same.\n\nCheck non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef all_same(chars):\n    return all(c == chars[0] for c in chars)\n\nmain_diag = []\nsecondary_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    secondary_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(secondary_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != secondary_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ndiagonal_char = main_diag[0]\n\nnon_diagonal = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diagonal:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    exit()\n\nif not all_same(non_diagonal):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif non_diagonal[0] == diagonal_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but for n=3, non_diagonal is 4 elements, as discussed.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5.\n\nAfter extracting main and secondary diag, they are all 'x's.\n\nnon_diagonal has a mix, like 'o's and 's's.\n\nSo non_diagonal is not all same, so output NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nmain_diag is 'w's, secondary_diag is 'w's.\n\nnon_diagonal is all 's's. So same and different.\n\nOutput YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3.\n\nmain_diag is 'x','p','e' — not same. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all non-diagonal same as each other and different from diag.\n\nE.g., grid:\n\na a a\na b a\na a a\n\nmain diag: a,a,a.\n\nsecondary diag: a,a,a.\n\nnon-diagonal: all 'b's.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: non-diagonal has a mix.\n\nLike:\n\na a a\na b c\na a a\n\nnon-diagonal cells include b, c, a, a. So non_diagonal has a, b, c. Not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: main and secondary diag are same, but non-diag has some same but not all.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nI think this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules.
