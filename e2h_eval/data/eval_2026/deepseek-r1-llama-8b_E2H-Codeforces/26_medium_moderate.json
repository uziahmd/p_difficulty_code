Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is between A and B, y is between B and C (so at least B), and z is at least C, which is ≥ y. So z is definitely the largest side. So the triangle inequality reduces to x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to count all triplets (x, y, z) such that:\n\nx is in [A, B]\ny is in [B, C]\nz is in [C, D]\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the ranges. The variables are within specific intervals, and the condition depends on x and y.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to fix x and y first, and then find how many z's satisfy z < x + y, but also z must be ≥ C (since z starts from C). So for each (x, y), the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). Wait, because z can be from C up to min(D, x + y -1), inclusive. So the count is max(0, min(x+y-1, D) - C + 1).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible x in [A, B].\n2. For each x, iterate through all possible y in [B, C], but considering that y >= B and y >= x (wait, no—no, because x is ≤ y? Wait, the problem says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So yes, x ≤ y. So y ranges from max(B, x) to C. Because x can be as low as A, which is ≤ B. So for x fixed, y starts at B (since x ≤ B and y >= B), but wait, no: x can be up to B, and y starts at B and goes up to C. So for each x, y can range from B to C, but y must be >= x. Wait, no: because x is up to B, and y is starting at B. So x can be less than or equal to y. So for x, when we loop, y can be from B to C, but y must be >= x. Because x can be as small as A, which may be less than B. But wait, no: because y is in [B, C]. So for example, if x is 3 and B is 5, then y can't be less than 5. So for x, y will always be >= B, which is >= x (since x <= B). So y is automatically >= x. So I don't have to worry about y being less than x.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], for each y in [B, C], calculate the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n    Loop y from B to C:\n        compute lower_z = C\n        upper_z = min(D, x + y - 1)\n        if upper_z < lower_z: continue (no z's)\n        else: add (upper_z - lower_z + 1) to the total.\n\nBut wait, this approach could be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which for B=5e5 and C=5e5 is 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each x, the possible range of y, and then find how many y's contribute a certain number of z's.\n\nWait, let's reorganize the problem.\n\nFor a given x, the condition on y is that y ≥ B and y ≤ C. Also, for each y, the number of z's is the number of integers z in [C, D] such that z < x + y.\n\nBut for a given x, what's the minimum y that can contribute to a valid z?\n\nWell, z must be at least C, so x + y must be > C. Because if x + y ≤ C, then z can't be >= C and < x + y, so there are zero z's for that y.\n\nSo for a given x, y must be >= (C - x + 1). But y is already in [B, C], so y must be >= max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are those y in [max(B, C - x + 1), C].\n\nBecause for y less than that, x + y <= C, so no z's.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1). Let's call this y_min(x).\n\nAnd y can go up to C.\n\nSo for each x, the y's start at y_min(x) and go up to C.\n\nIf y_min(x) > C, then for this x, there are no y's, hence no triangles.\n\nSo the next step is to compute, for each x, the number of y's in [y_min(x), C], and for each such y, the number of z's.\n\nBut even this seems like O(B) iterations, which for B=5e5 is manageable, but for each x, we need to find the count of y's multiplied by the average number of z's per y. Or perhaps find a mathematical formula to compute the sum quickly.\n\nWait, for a given x, the number of y's is (C - y_min(x) + 1), provided that y_min(x) <= C. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut for each y in [y_min(x), C], the number of z's is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C, else zero.\n\nSo the total contribution for x is sum over y in [y_min(x), C] of (max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)).\n\nThis is still O(B) time, but each x requires an O(1) calculation if we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if for a given x, the function f(y) = min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 is a linear function in y.\n\nYes, because:\n\nf(y) = min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1\n= min(D - C +1, (x + y -1) - (C - D +1)) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to split into cases based on whether x + y -1 is less than D or not.\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: x + y -1 <= D → z can go from C to x + y -1 → count is x + y -1 - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nCase 2: x + y -1 > D → z can go from C to D → count is D - C + 1.\n\nSo the count for each y is:\n\nif x + y -1 <= D → count = x + y - C\nelse → count = D - C + 1\n\nSo for a given x, the condition depends on whether y >= (D - x + 1 - C + 1) → y >= (D - x + 1 - C + 1) → y >= (D - C + 1 - x + 1) ?\n\nWait, solving x + y -1 > D → y > D - x + 1 → y >= (D -x + 2).\n\nSo for y >= (D -x + 2), the count is D - C + 1.\n\nFor y < (D -x + 2), the count is x + y - C.\n\nSo for a given x, we can find the point y0 = max(y_min(x), D -x + 2) where the count changes.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf y >= y0, where y0 is D -x + 2, then the count is D - C +1.\n\nElse, it's x + y - C.\n\nSo for a given x, the y ranges from y_min(x) to C.\n\nWe can split this into two parts: y from y_min(x) to y0-1, and y from y0 to C.\n\nBut wait, only if y0 is within the y range [y_min(x), C].\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each x:\n\nCompute y_min = max(B, C -x + 1)\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_min, D -x + 2)\n\nIf y0 > C → then for all y in [y_min, C], the count is x + y - C.\n\nSo the sum is sum_{y=y_min}^{C} (x + y - C).\n\nWhich is an arithmetic series.\n\nSum from a to b of (k) is (b - a +1)*(a + b)/2.\n\nSimilarly, if y0 <= C:\n\nsum_part1: for y from y_min to y0-1: sum (x + y - C) \n\nsum_part2: for y from y0 to C: sum (D - C + 1)\n\nSo for each x, the total is sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute these sums efficiently.\n\nLet's formalize this.\n\nFor each x:\n\ny_low = y_min(x) = max(B, C -x + 1)\ny_high = C\n\nIf y_low > y_high:\n    continue (no contribution)\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_low, D -x + 2)\n\nif y0 > y_high:\n    Then all y in [y_low, y_high] are in case 1.\n    sum = sum_{y=y_low}^{y_high} (x + y - C)\n    which is sum (y) - (C - x) * n, where n is the number of terms.\n    sum = (sum from a to b of y) - (C - x) * (b - a + 1)\n    sum_y = (y_low + y_high) * (y_high - y_low + 1) // 2\n    sum = sum_y - (C - x) * (y_high - y_low + 1)\nelse:\n    Now, split into two parts:\n    part1: y from y_low to y0-1 → case1\n    part2: y from y0 to y_high → case2\n\n    Compute for part1:\n    num_terms_part1 = y0 - y_low\n    sum_part1 = sum_{y=y_low}^{y0-1} (x + y - C)\n    = sum (x - C + y) \n    = (x - C) * num_terms_part1 + sum(y from a to b)\n    sum_part1 = (x - C) * (y0 - y_low) + ((y_low + (y0-1)) * (y0 - y_low)) // 2\n\n    Compute for part2:\n    num_terms_part2 = y_high - y0 + 1\n    sum_part2 = num_terms_part2 * (D - C + 1)\n\n    total = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], compute y_low = max(B, C -x +1), y_high = C.\n\nIf y_low > y_high → continue.\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_low, D -x + 2).\n\nIf y0 > y_high → compute part1 sum as above.\n\nElse → compute part1 and part2.\n\nSo now, the question is, how to compute this efficiently for all x.\n\nBut even with this, for x ranging up to 5e5, this would be O(5e5) operations, which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's try to model this.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to find the ranges of x where certain conditions hold, and compute the contribution in bulk rather than per x.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's proceed with implementing the per x approach, as it's manageable.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- When D is very small, say C is larger than D. But in that case, for any x and y, x + y > D would require that z can be at most D, but x + y might be larger than D. So z can be from C to D.\n\nWait, but in any case, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y <= C. Then z must be >= C, but x + y must be > z. So x + y > z >= C → x + y > C.\n\nSo if x + y <= C → no solutions.\n\nHence, y must be >= C -x + 1.\n\nWhich is already accounted for in y_low = max(B, C -x + 1).\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when D is less than C. Then z cannot be >= C, which contradicts the initial condition. But according to the input constraints, C ≤ D. So this case is not possible.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nCompute for each x in A..B:\n\ny_low = max(B, C -x +1)\ny_high = C\n\nif y_low > y_high → skip.\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_low, D -x + 2)\n\nif y0 > y_high → sum_part1.\n\nElse → sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nThen, sum all these contributions.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nWe need to count all (x, y, z):\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1) → max(2,3) → 3.\n\ny_high is 3.\n\nSo y can be 3.\n\nCompute y0 = max(3, 4 -1 +2)= max(3,5) →5.\n\nSince 5>3 → all y in y_low to y_high fall into case1.\n\nSo for y=3:\n\ncount = x + y - C = 1+3-3=1.\n\nSo z can be from C=3 to min(4,1+3-1)=3 → count is 1.\n\nSo total for x=1 is 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first case has 4 triangles. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample input is '1 2 3 4'.\n\nWait, let's list all possible (x, y, z):\n\nLooking at the note, the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4).\n\nSo for x=1:\n\ny must be >=3 (since C -x +1 = 3-1+1=3). So y=3.\n\nz must be <1+3=4. So z can be 3.\n\nSo one triangle.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1)= max(2, 2) →2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\nSo y can be 2 or 3.\n\nCompute y0 for x=2:\n\ny0 = max(2, D -x +2)= max(2, 4-2+2)= max(2,4) →4.\n\nSince 4 >3.\n\nSo for y=2:\n\ncount =2+2-3=1 → z can be 3 (since 3<4).\n\nFor y=3: count =2+3-3=2 → z can be 3 and 4? Wait no: z must be <5 (since x+y=5, so z must be <5. So z can be 3 and4. So count is 2.\n\nWait, but for y=3, x=2: x+y=5, D=4.\n\nSo z can be from 3 to min(4,5-1)=4.\n\nSo z can be 3,4 → count is 2.\n\nSo for x=2, the sum is (y=2: 1) + (y=3:2) → total 3.\n\nSo overall, x=1 contributes 1, x=2 contributes 3 → total 4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: Input is '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nIn this case, A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-1+1)= max(2,2) →2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\nSo y can be 2.\n\nCompute y0 = max(2, 5-1+2)=6.\n\nSince 6>2, so case1.\n\ncount is x + y - C =1+2-2=1.\n\nz can be from 2 to min(5,3) →2.\n\nSo one triangle.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2+1)=max(2,1)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny=2.\n\ny0 = max(2,5-2+2)=max(2,5)=5>2.\n\ncase1: count is 2+2-2=2.\n\nz can be from 2 to min(5,4-1=3) →2 and3.\n\nSo 2 triangles.\n\nSo total is 1+2=3, matching the sample.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nOnly x=5e5.\n\ny_low = max(5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1)=max(5e5,1)=5e5.\n\ny_high=5e5.\n\ny=5e5.\n\ny0 = max(5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +2)=max(5e5,2)=5e5.\n\nSo for y=5e5.\n\nCompute count: x+y - C =5e5 +5e5 -5e5 =5e5.\n\nBut also, since y0 is 5e5, which is same as y_high.\n\nSo we are in case2.\n\ncount is D -C +1=5e5-5e5 +1=1.\n\nSo total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo now, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nWe can read A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize the total to 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, C -x +1)\n\nif y_low > C → continue\n\nCompute y_high = C\n\nif y_low > y_high → continue\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_low, D -x + 2)\n\nif y0 > y_high:\n\n    compute part1:\n\n    a = y_low\n\n    b = y_high\n\n    sum_part1 = (x - C) * (b - a +1) + (a + b) * (b - a +1) // 2\n\nelse:\n\n    part1: a = y_low, b = y0-1\n\n    part2: c = y0, d = y_high\n\n    compute sum_part1:\n\n    if a > b → part1 is 0.\n\n    else:\n\n        num = b -a +1\n\n        sum_part1 = (x - C) * num + (a + (a + num -1)) * num // 2\n\n    sum_part2 = (d - c +1) * (D - C +1)\n\n    sum_part1 + sum_part2.\n\nAdd this to the total.\n\nBut wait, in part1, the sum is sum (x + y - C) for y from a to b.\n\nWhich is (x-C) added for each term, plus sum of y's.\n\nSo yes, the formula is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, but we have to manage large numbers. But since everything is O(5e5), it's manageable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling when y0 is beyond y_high, which results in part1 only.\n\n- Making sure that when y_low > y_high, we skip.\n\n- Edge cases where D is less than C, but the problem says C ≤ D, so it's not possible.\n\nSo, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n\n        continue\n\n    y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 2)\n\n    if y0 > y_high:\n\n        # part1 only\n\n        a = y_low\n\n        b = y_high\n\n        n = b - a + 1\n\n        sum_part = (x - C) * n + (a + b) * n // 2\n\n        total += sum_part\n\n    else:\n\n        # part1 and part2\n\n        a = y_low\n\n        b = y0 - 1\n\n        if a > b:\n\n            sum_part1 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            n1 = b - a + 1\n\n            sum_part1 = (x - C) * n1 + (a + b) * n1 // 2\n\n        # part2\n\n        c = y0\n\n        d = y_high\n\n        n2 = d - c + 1\n\n        sum_part2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n\n        total += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is x from A to B, inclusive. Yes.\n\nTesting the code with sample 1:\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nx runs 1 and 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-1+1)=3.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(3, 4-1+2=5) →5>3.\n\nSo part1:\n\na=3, b=3.\n\nn=1.\n\nsum_part = (1-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 → (-2)*1 + 6/2 = -2 +3=1.\n\nSo total +=1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(2,4-2+2=4) →4>3.\n\nSo part1:\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nn=2.\n\nsum_part = (2-3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-1)*2 + 5*1= (-2) +5=3.\n\nSo total +=3 → total=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx runs 1 and 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-1+1)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0 = max(2,5-1+2=6) →6>2.\n\nSo part1: a=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part = (1-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → (-1) +4//2= -1+2=1.\n\nTotal +=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2+1=1) →2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0 = max(2,5-2+2=5) →5>2.\n\nSo part1: a=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part = (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 →0 +4//2= 2.\n\nTotal +=2 →1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\nx=5e5.\n\ny_low = max(5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1=1) →5e5.\n\ny_high=5e5.\n\ny0 = max(5e5,5e5 -5e5 +2=2) →5e5.\n\nSo y0=5e5, which is equal to y_high.\n\nSo part1: a=5e5, b=5e5-1=499999.\n\nWait, no: y0 is 5e5, so a=5e5, b=y0-1=5e5-1.\n\nBut a=5e5 is larger than b=5e5-1.\n\nSo sum_part1 is 0.\n\nThen part2:\n\nc=5e5, d=5e5.\n\nn2=1.\n\nsum_part2 = 1*(5e5 -5e5 +1) =1.\n\nSo total +=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when D is less than C? Well, the problem says C ≤ D, so that's handled.\n\nAnother test case: what if x is such that x + y is just barely more than D.\n\nFor example, x=3, y=4, D=7.\n\nx+y=7, which is equal to D. So z must be <7 → up to 6.\n\nSo z can be from C to 6.\n\nBut wait, the condition is x + y > z. So z can be up to x + y -1.\n\nSo for x=3, y=4, D=7: z can be up to 6.\n\nSo in the code, when x=3, y=4, D=7:\n\ny0 = max(y_low, D -x +2) → D -x +2 =7-3+2=6.\n\nSo y0=6.\n\nIf y is 4, which is >= y_low, then:\n\nsum_part1 is for y=4 down to y_low, which may not include 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of another test case.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nI'll write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) such that \\( A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D \\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can simplify our check to \\( x + y > z \\) since \\( z \\) is the largest side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate through possible values of \\( x \\)**: Loop through each value of \\( x \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n2. **Determine valid range for \\( y \\)**: For each \\( x \\), determine the valid range for \\( y \\) which starts from \\( \\max(B, C - x + 1) \\) to \\( C \\). This ensures \\( x + y > C \\).\n3. **Check conditions for \\( z \\)**: For each valid pair \\( (x, y) \\), determine the range of \\( z \\) such that \\( C \\leq z < x + y \\) and \\( z \\leq D \\).\n4. **Sum contributions efficiently**: Use arithmetic series to compute the number of valid \\( z \\) values efficiently without iterating through each possible \\( z \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    y_high = C\n    if y_low > y_high:\n        continue\n    y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 2)\n    if y0 > y_high:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y_high\n        n = b - a + 1\n        sum_part = (x - C) * n + (a + b) * n // 2\n        total += sum_part\n    else:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y0 - 1\n        if a > b:\n            sum_part1 = 0\n        else:\n            n1 = b - a + 1\n            sum_part1 = (x - C) * n1 + (a + b) * n1 // 2\n        c = y0\n        d = y_high\n        n2 = d - c + 1\n        sum_part2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n        total += sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) are read and parsed.\n2. **Loop through \\( x \\)**: For each \\( x \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), calculate the minimum and maximum valid values for \\( y \\).\n3. **Calculate valid \\( y \\) range**: Ensure \\( y \\) is within the valid range and satisfies \\( x + y > C \\).\n4. **Determine \\( z \\) range**: For each valid \\( y \\), determine the range of \\( z \\) values that satisfy \\( x + y > z \\) and \\( z \\leq D \\).\n5. **Efficient Summation**: Use arithmetic series to sum the valid \\( z \\) values efficiently, avoiding nested loops and ensuring the solution is optimal even for large input sizes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid triangles by leveraging mathematical properties and avoiding unnecessary iterations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
