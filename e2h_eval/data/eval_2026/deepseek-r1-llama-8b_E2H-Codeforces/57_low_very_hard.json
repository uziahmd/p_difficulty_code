His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine how many participants have a higher or equal sum than Vasya's sum. Wait, no, because the participants are sorted by their total sum in descending order. So, the best place is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, making him as high as possible in the rankings. The worst place is when his sum is as low as possible but still ≥x, which would put him as low as possible.\n\nWait, but the way the sums are combined depends on how we pair a and b. Because the lists are given in arbitrary order, we can rearrange them to maximize or minimize Vasya's rank.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Since Vasya is one of the participants, there exists at least one such pair.\n\n2. For each possible pair (a, b) where a is from a list and b is from b list, compute s = a + b. Then, sort all possible s in descending order.\n\n3. Now, for the best case, we want Vasya's s to be as large as possible. So we need to find the maximum possible s that can be achieved, and then count how many other s are larger than it. Or wait, maybe not. Because the maximum s is fixed, but depending on how others' sums are arranged, maybe the number of people with higher or equal sums varies.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible, and as few others as possible have higher sums. Similarly, the worst rank is when his sum is as low as possible (but ≥x), and as many others as possible have higher sums.\n\nBut how do I model this? Because the pairing of a and b affects the possible sums of others.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to generate all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i is from the first list and b_j is from the second list. Each such pair represents a participant. Then, for all these participants, we can compute their sum, sort them in non-increasing order. Then, the best place is 1 if Vasya's sum is the maximum. Otherwise, it's the position where his sum fits.\n\nBut since the lists are given in arbitrary order, we can choose any permutation of a's and b's. So for each a_i, we can match it to any b_j, but each a and b must be used exactly once, because each participant has one score from each tour.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Each a_i and b_j must be paired exactly once. So the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching between the a and b lists, such that the sum of each pair is considered, and then for this particular matching, we can compute the ranking of Vasya.\n\nBut since the teacher doesn't know the actual pairing, we need to consider all possible pairings, and for each possible pairing, determine Vasya's best and worst possible ranks, then choose the best possible scenario for best rank and worst scenario for worst rank.\n\nWait, but that seems computationally heavy. Because n can be up to 105, and trying all possible pairings is impossible since 105! is way too big.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: \n\nFor each possible a_i and b_j that could form Vasya's sum (s = a_i + b_j ≥x), find the minimal and maximal possible number of participants who have a sum > s.\n\nBecause the best possible rank for Vasya is when he has the highest possible sum, and the worst rank is when his sum is as low as possible (but ≥x), and as many participants as possible have higher or equal sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i is from a list, b_j is from b list. Each pair is a candidate for Vasya's sum.\n\n2. For each candidate sum s_v (≥x), compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > s_v, and the minimum number that can have sum ≤ s_v.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nThe best",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The key is to consider all possible valid pairings of participants' scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate All Possible Sums**: We first generate all possible sums by pairing each score from the first tour with each score from the second tour.\n2. **Filter Valid Sums**: For each participant, their sum must be at least `x` to be considered valid.\n3. **Determine Best Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we look for the highest possible sum that Vasya can have. This is done by finding the maximum sum that is at least `x` and then counting how many participants can have a higher sum than this.\n4. **Determine Worst Rank**: For the worst possible rank, we look for the smallest possible sum that is still at least `x`. We then count how many participants can have a higher sum than this.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, x = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    \n    # Generate all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and their sums\n    all_sums = []\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            if ai + bj >= x:\n                all_sums.append(ai + bj)\n    \n    # Now, for each possible s_v in all_sums, compute the minimal number of people who have sum > s_v\n    # and the maximal number of people who have sum <= s_v.
