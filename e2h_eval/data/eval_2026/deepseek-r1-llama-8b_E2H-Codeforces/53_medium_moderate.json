    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I have to find the length of its longest substring that appears at least twice. The substrings can overlap, which is important because that affects how I approach checking for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about the examples provided. For instance, in the second sample input, 'ababa' gives an output of 3. The substrings here are like 'aba' appearing at positions 0-2 and 2-4. So the maximum length is 3.\n\nHmm, so the task is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists at least two occurrences (possibly overlapping) of some substring of length L.\n\nMy plan is to iterate over all possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each possible length L, I check if any substring of that length appears more than once in the string. Once I find the largest L that satisfies this condition, that's my answer.\n\nSo first, what is the maximum possible L I need to consider? It's the length of the string minus 1, but wait, no. Because for a string of length N, the maximum possible substring length that can appear twice is N-1, but only if the string starts with two identical characters. Wait, no. For example, in 'ababa', the entire string is length 5. The maximum possible L is 3, as in the example. So perhaps the maximum L I should check is up to len(s)-1, but maybe even higher isn't necessary.\n\nWait, no. The maximum possible L can be up to len(s). But in reality, for a string of length N, the maximum possible L for which two occurrences can exist is N-1, because if L is N, then the substring is the whole string, and it can only appear once. So the maximum L we need to check is from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the string is \"aaaaa\". Then the substrings of length 4 are \"aaaa\" appearing starting at 0 and 1. So L=4 is possible. Similarly, for length 5, the substring is the entire string, but it can only appear once. So for L=5, it's not possible. So the maximum possible L is len(s)-1.\n\nTherefore, I should start checking from L = len(s)-1 down to 1. For each L, I'll look for any substring of length L that occurs more than once in the string. If I find such an L, return it immediately since it's the largest possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n2. For each L, generate all possible substrings of length L in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once.\n4. If yes, return L as the answer.\n5. If none found after checking all L, return 0 (though the problem says the string is non-empty, so perhaps the minimum possible is 1? Or wait, in the case where the string is length 1, it's impossible. So the output would be 0.)\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, when the string is 'abcd' (length 4), the output is 0. Because all substrings of length 3 are unique, and for length 4, it's unique as well. So the function correctly returns 0.\n\nSo the algorithm needs to handle cases where no such substring exists, returning 0.\n\nNow, how do I implement this efficiently?\n\nFor each L, I can collect all the substrings of length L and see if any appears more than once.\n\nBut for small strings (up to 100 characters), even a brute-force approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   create a set to track seen substrings of length L\n   for i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n       current_substring = s[i:i+L]\n       if current_substring is already in the set: return L\n       else add it to the set\n   continue until found.\n\nIf after all L's, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample 1: Input 'abcd' (length 4)\nCheck L=3:\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. So move to L=2:\nsubstrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. L=1: 'a','b','c','d'—all unique. So output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (length 5)\nCheck L=4:\nsubstrings 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates.\nL=3:\nsubstrings:\n0-2: 'aba'\n1-3: 'bab'\n2-4: 'aba'\nSo when processing i=0, substring 'aba' is added. Then i=2, substring is 'aba' again, which is in the set. So return 3.\n\nAnother sample: 'zzz' (length 3)\nCheck L=2:\nsubstrings 'zz', 'zz' → duplicate. So return 2.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: string is of length 1. Output is 0.\n\nCase 2: string is all same characters, e.g., 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0 and 1). So return 4.\n\nCase 3: string has a single duplicate, but not longer than necessary. Like 'abab' (length 4). Substrings of length 3: 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1). No duplicates. Substrings of length 2: 'ab', 'ba', 'ab' → 'ab' appears at i=0 and i=2. So L=2 is the maximum.\n\nSo the algorithm would process L=3 first, then L=2, and find the duplicate at L=2.\n\nAnother case: 'abcabc'. Let's see. Length is 6.\n\nCheck L=5: substrings 'abcab' and 'bcabc' → no duplicates.\n\nL=4: 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabc' → all unique.\n\nL=3: 'abc' (i=0), 'bca' (i=1), 'cab' (i=2), 'abc' (i=3). So when i=0, add 'abc'; when i=3, substring is 'abc' again. So return 3.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, to implement this in Python.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nRead the string from standard input.\n\nIf the string is empty, but according to the problem statement, it's non-empty.\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to hold substrings of length L.\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring in seen: return L\n\n       else: add to seen.\n\nIf after all L, no duplicates, return 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n# After all L, return 0\nprint(0)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → outputs 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → outputs 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → outputs 2.\n\nAnother test: 'aaaaa' → L=4, finds 'aaaa' at i=0 and i=1 → outputs 4.\n\nWhat about 'abab' → for L=3, substrings are 'aba' and 'bab' → no duplicates. For L=2, substrings 'ab', 'ba', 'ab' → returns 2.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nI think that's correct. Now, implement this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. These substrings can overlap, meaning that the occurrences can start at different positions and still be considered valid.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to find the maximum length of a substring that appears more than once in the given string. The solution must efficiently check for such substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1.\n2. **Intuition**: By checking substrings from the longest possible length downwards, we can quickly identify the longest valid substring as soon as it is found. This approach ensures that we do not miss the longest valid substring by checking shorter lengths first.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a brute-force approach with a nested loop structure. For each possible substring length `L`, starting from the maximum possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1, we generate all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once.\n4. **Optimization**: Using a set to track seen substrings allows us to efficiently check for duplicates in constant time, ensuring the solution remains efficient even for the maximum input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: We iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length `L`, we generate all substrings of that length. Using a set, we track which substrings have been seen.\n4. **Duplicate Check**: If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, and we immediately print the length `L` and exit the program.\n5. **No Duplicates Found**: If no valid substrings are found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible substrings down to the shortest, thus optimizing the solution for the given problem constraints.",
