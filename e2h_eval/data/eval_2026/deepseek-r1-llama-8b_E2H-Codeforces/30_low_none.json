Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a TV game. The goal is to maximize their total prize by choosing the sequence of moves optimally. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe game starts with a number A that's 2n digits long. Each turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. After that, that digit is removed from A. They take turns doing this exactly n times each. So in total, there are 2n moves, each adding a digit to either S1 or S2.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'H' and 'M' characters indicating who took each digit. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2. If multiple sequences give the same maximum, any can be output.\n\nHmm. So, how do we model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each step, the choice of H or M affects the future state, and we need to keep track of what's best at each step.\n\nLet me think about the state representation. Since the order of the digits matters, the state needs to consider which digits have been taken so far and whose turn it is. But wait, the players alternate turns, so maybe the state can be represented by the current index in the string and whether it's the first player's turn or not.\n\nWait, but the key is that each move is determined by the next digit. So the initial state is the entire string, and each move reduces the string by one character from the left. So perhaps the state can be the current position (how many digits have been processed) and whether it's Homer's turn or Marge's.\n\nSo, let's say we have a DP table where dp[i][turn] represents the maximum possible value we can get from the remaining substring starting at position i, given that it's currently turn's player's move. The turn can be either 'H' or 'M', but since they alternate, maybe we can represent it as a boolean or an integer flag indicating whose turn it is.\n\nBut wait, the value we're trying to maximize isn't just the sum of S1 and S2. It's the sum of the two numbers formed by the digits assigned to each player. So when a digit is assigned to S1, it contributes its value multiplied by 10^k, where k is the number of digits after it in S1. Similarly for S2.\n\nWait, that might complicate things because the contribution depends on the position in the number. So the order in which the digits are added to S1 and S2 affects the total sum.\n\nHmm, so the state needs to track not only which digits are left but also the current length of S1 and S2, because the next digit's contribution depends on that.\n\nWait, but the digits are being taken from the front, so the order in which they're taken is fixed. So the initial string is processed from left to right. At each step, the next digit is chosen by either H or M, depending on the current turn.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the digits are taken from the left, but the decision is which player takes it. So for the first move, either H or M chooses the first digit, then the next digit goes to the other player, and so on, until all digits are assigned.\n\nSo the DP approach would model the assignment of each digit to either H or M in such a way that the order is maintained, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut considering that, the state can be the current position in the string (i), and whose turn it is. Because the choice is to assign the current digit to H or M, depending on whose turn it is. Wait, no—because the players alternate turns, so the choice of assigning the current digit depends on the current turn.\n\nWait, maybe the turn determines who takes the current digit. So at each step i, if it's H's turn, he takes the i-th digit and adds it to his number. Then it becomes M's turn for the next digit. Or is it that the turn alternates regardless of who takes which digit?\n\nWait, the problem says each player makes exactly n moves. So the sequence must consist of exactly n 'H's and n 'M's, and the order is such that they alternate, but the first move could be H or M.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So it's possible that the same player can take multiple consecutive digits if they choose to. But wait, the problem statement says each player makes exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n, each assigned to H or M, with exactly n each. So the sequence must have exactly n H's and n M's.\n\nSo the problem is to select a subset of positions (size n) for H, and the remaining for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game such that their total prize is maximized. The game involves two players taking turns to append the leftmost digit of a given number to their respective numbers until all digits are exhausted. Each player must make exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). The key insight is to model the state of the game by tracking the current position in the string and whose turn it is. The goal is to maximize the sum of the two numbers formed by the digits assigned to each player.\n\n1. **State Representation**: We use a DP table where `dp[i][turn]` represents the maximum possible value achievable from the substring starting at index `i`, given that it is currently `turn`'s turn (either Homer's or Marge's).\n\n2. **Transition**: For each state, we consider the next digit and decide whether to assign it to the current player or the other player. This decision is based on maximizing the sum of the two numbers.\n\n3. **Memoization**: We memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.\n\n4. **Base Case**: When all digits have been processed (`i == 2n`), the value is zero since there are no more digits to process.\n\n5. **Recursive Function**: The recursive function will compute the maximum value by considering both possible assignments of the current digit and transitioning to the next state accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(i, is_homer_turn):\n        if i == len(A):\n            return 0\n        max_val = 0\n        # Current digit is A[i]\n        current_digit = int(A[i])\n        next_i = i + 1\n        \n        if is_homer_turn:\n            # Assign to H, then next is M's turn\n            val1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (n - (n - (len(A) - i - 1))))) \n            # Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of place values\n            # Alternatively, for S1, each digit's place depends on how many digits are added after it.\n            # Similarly for S2.\n            # So when assigning to H, we need to calculate the contribution of this digit to S1.\n            # The place value is 10^(k-1) where k is the number of digits already in S1 plus 1.\n            # But tracking the exact place values is tricky.\n            # Another approach is to track the length of S1 and S2 as part of the state.\n            # However, that would complicate the state space.\n            # Alternative idea: for each move, compute the contribution based on the current length of S1 and S2.\n            # But this seems difficult without including those lengths in the state.\n            # So perhaps a better way is needed.\n            \n            # Alternative Plan:\n            # Instead of thinking in terms of the numerical value, model the choice as selecting which player takes the current digit, and compute the maximum possible sum based on the remaining digits.\n            # Since the order of digits is fixed, the contribution of each digit depends on its position in S1 or S2.\n            # To model this correctly, we need to know how many digits have been added to S1 and S2 so far, as the place value depends on that.\n            # Therefore, the state needs to include the count of digits in S1 and S2.\n            # Let's redefine the state as (i, s1_len, s2_len, is_homer_turn)\n            # But with n up to 18, 2n is 36, and s1_len and s2_len can each be up to 18. So the state size is 36*19*19*2 = about 140k, manageable.\n            # So let's adjust the approach.\n            # So, the initial state is (0, 0, 0, True)\n            # Then, for each state, we can transition to either adding to S1 or S2, depending on whose turn it is.\n            # The value for each state is the maximum sum achievable from that point onward.\n            # So, the DP function will return the maximum sum achievable from state (i, s1, s2, turn).\n            # Then, the transition is:\n            # if it's H's turn, he can add the current digit to S1, increasing s1_len by 1, and then M's turn.\n            # Or, if it's M's turn, she adds to S2.\n            # Wait, but the turn alternates regardless of who takes which digit. Because each player must make exactly n moves.\n            # So, the sequence must consist of exactly n H's and n M's, alternating.\n            # So the turn is determined by the number of moves made so far.\n            # So perhaps the state can be simplified to (i, is_first_move), where is_first_move indicates whether the current move is the first move (H's turn) or not.\n            # Hmm, but that might not capture the correct turn order because the players alternate regardless of their choices.\n            # Alternatively, since the players take turns in a fixed order, the state can just track the current index and whether the next move is H or M.\n            # Wait, yes! Because the moves alternate strictly between H and M, starting with either H or M. So the state can be represented by the current index and whose turn it is next.\n            # So the initial state is (0, 'H' or 'M') depending on who starts.\n            # But wait, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So they could choose to have the same player take multiple turns in a row, as long as each makes exactly n moves in total.\n            # Oh right, I misread the problem earlier. The players can decide the order of turns, but each must make exactly n moves. So the sequence can be any permutation of n H's and n M's, but the order affects the total sum.\n            # So the problem is not about choosing the next player in a fixed turn order, but about choosing the assignment of each digit to H or M, with exactly n each, to maximize the sum.\n            # That complicates things because the state must also track how many H's and M's have been used so far.\n            # So the state needs to include the current index, the number of H's and M's used, and whose turn it is next.\n            # But that might be manageable.\n            # Let's re-express the state as (i, h_count, m_count, is_homer_turn).\n            # So for each state, we can decide whether to assign the current digit to H or M, provided that h_count < n and m_count < n.\n            # But this increases the state space significantly. With n=18, 2n=36, h_count can be 0..18, m_count 0..18, and is_homer_turn (2 possibilities). So total states are 36 * 19 * 19 * 2 = ~139,968, which is manageable.\n            # So, the DP function will be something like dp(i, h, m, is_homer_turn).\n            # Now, the base case is when i == len(A), then the sum is 0.\n            # For the transitions:\n            # If it's Homer's turn, he can choose to take the current digit for his number, then move to i+1, h+1, m, is_homer_turn becomes False.\n            # Or, he can choose to pass the turn to Marge, meaning M takes the current digit, and the state becomes i+1, h, m+1, is_homer_turn becomes True.\n            # Similarly, if it's Marge's turn, she can choose to take the current digit for her number, leading to state i+1, h, m+1, is_homer_turn becomes False.\n            # Or, she can pass the turn to Homer, leading to state i+1, h+1, m, is_homer_turn becomes True.\n            # Wait, but passing the turn doesn't make sense in this context because each player must make exactly n moves. So the choice is always to take the digit if it's their turn, but the problem allows them to decide who takes the next turn. So the state must account for both possibilities: whether the current player takes the digit or passes the turn.\n            # Wait, perhaps not. Because the players can choose to take the next digit or not, but each must make exactly n moves. So, it's more accurate to model the state as the current index, the number of H's and M's taken so far, and whose turn it is now. At each step, the current player has to take the digit, but they can choose to assign it to themselves or the other player, but only if the other player hasn't reached their move limit yet.\n\n            # Wait, no. Each player must make exactly n moves. So the assignment of the current digit is to the current player, but they can choose to pass the turn to the other player for future moves. So, the current player can take the current digit for their own number, or assign it to the other player, but only if the other player hasn't exceeded their n moves.\n\n            # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\n            # Let me think differently. Since the order of digits is fixed, the contribution of each digit depends on when it is added to S1 or S2. The earlier a digit is added, the higher its place value.\n\n            # So, the optimal strategy is to assign higher digits to S1 and S2 in such a way that the sum of their contributions is maximized. But how?\n\n            # It might be optimal to alternate between assigning the highest remaining digit to S1 and S2. But this isn't necessarily the case because the place values depend on the order of addition.\n\n            # Another idea is to use a greedy approach. At each step, assign the current digit to the player whose current number would gain the most from adding this digit. But this requires knowing the current place values, which depends on the number of digits already in each S.\n\n            # Given the complexity, the DP approach is still the way to go. Let's adjust the state to include the counts of H and M moves made so far and whose turn it is.\n\n            # So, the state is (i, h_count, m_count, is_homer_turn). The value of the state is the maximum sum achievable from this point onward.\n\n            # The transitions are as follows:\n            # If it's Homer's turn:\n                # He can take the current digit for himself, leading to state (i+1, h_count+1, m_count, False).\n                # Or, he can pass the turn to Marge, leading to state (i+1, h_count, m_count, True).\n            # If it's Marge's turn:\n                # She can take the current digit for herself, leading to state (i+1, h_count, m_count+1, False).\n                # Or, she can pass the turn to Homer, leading to state (i+1, h_count+1, m_count, True).\n\n            # For each transition, we compute the contribution of the current digit to the respective player's number based on their current length.\n\n            # The contribution of a digit d when added to a number with current length l is d * 10^(l), because the new digit becomes the (l+1)-th digit from the right, which is multiplied by 10^l.\n\n            # Wait, no. Let me think: suppose S1 has l digits. Adding a new digit d to S1 makes it l+1 digits. The new digit is the most significant digit, so its place value is 10^l. So the contribution is d * 10^l.\n\n            # So, when assigning a digit to a player, we need to know their current length to compute the contribution.\n\n            # Thus, the state must include the current lengths of S1 and S2.\n\n            # So, the state becomes (i, s1_len, s2_len, is_homer_turn). The value is the maximum sum achievable from this state.\n\n            # Now, the transitions become:\n            # If it's Homer's turn:\n                # Option 1: Assign current digit to S1. Contribution is d * 10^s1_len.\n                # Then, next state is (i+1, s1_len+1, s2_len, False).\n                # Option 2: Assign current digit to S2. Contribution is d * 10^s2_len.\n                # Then, next state is (i+1, s1_len, s2_len+1, True).\n            # If it's Marge's turn:\n                # Option 1: Assign current digit to S2. Contribution is d * 10^s2_len.\n                # Next state is (i+1, s1_len, s2_len+1, False).\n                # Option 2: Assign current digit to S1. Contribution is d * 10^s1_len.\n                # Next state is (i+1, s1_len+1, s2_len, True).\n\n            # Wait, but the player can choose to pass the turn to the other player. So in each state, the current player can choose to take the digit for themselves or pass it to the other player, provided that the other player hasn't exceeded their n moves.\n\n            # But in the problem statement, each player must make exactly n moves. So, when a player is not the one whose turn it is, they cannot take the digit unless the other player passes the turn to them.\n\n            # Therefore, in the state, the player whose turn it is can choose to take the digit for themselves or pass it to the other player, but only if the other player hasn't made n moves yet.\n\n            # So, in the state, we have to consider both options for the current player.\n\n            # Therefore, the recursive function will explore both possibilities and choose the one that leads to the maximum sum.\n\n            # Now, let's outline the steps:\n\n            # 1. Read the input and initialize the necessary variables.\n            # 2. Define the DP function with memoization to cache results of subproblems.\n            # 3. In the DP function, check if all digits have been processed; if so, return 0.\n            # 4.

The state includes the current position in the string, the lengths of the numbers formed by Homer and Marge, and whose turn it is. The DP function evaluates both possible assignments of the current digit and selects the one that maximizes the sum. The reconstruction function traces back from the final state to build the optimal sequence of moves. This approach ensures that both players make exactly n moves and the total prize is maximized.",

So the state size is 36*19*19*2 = about 140k, manageable.\n            # So let's adjust the approach.\n            # So, the initial state is (0, 0, 0, True)\n            # Then, for each state, we can transition to either adding to S1 or S2, depending on whose turn it is.\n            # The value for each state is the maximum sum achievable from that point onward.\n            # So, the DP function will return the maximum sum achievable from state (i, s1, s2, turn).\n            # Then, the transition is:\n            # if it's H's turn, he can add the current digit to S1, increasing s1_len by 1, and then M's turn.\n            # Or, if it's M's turn, she adds to S2.\n            # Wait, but the turn alternates regardless of who takes which digit. Because each player must make exactly n moves.\n            # So, the sequence must consist of exactly n H's and n M's, alternating.\n            # So the turn is determined by the number of moves made so far.\n            # So perhaps the state can be simplified to (i, is_first_move), where is_first_move indicates whether the current move is the first move (H's turn) or not.\n            # Hmm, but that might not capture the correct turn order because the players alternate regardless of their choices.\n            # Alternatively, since the players take turns in a fixed order, the state can just track the current index and whether the next move is H or M.\n            # Wait, yes! Because the moves alternate strictly between H and M, starting with either H or M. So the state can be represented by the current index and whose turn it is next.\n            # So the initial state is (0, 'H' or 'M') depending on who starts.\n            # But wait, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So they could choose to have the same player take multiple turns in a row, as long as each makes exactly n moves in total.\n            # Oh right, I misread the problem earlier. The players can decide the order of turns, but each must make exactly n moves. So the sequence can be any permutation of n H's and n M's, but the order affects the total sum.\n            # So the problem is not about choosing the next player in a fixed turn order, but about choosing the assignment of each digit to H or M, with exactly n each, to maximize the sum.\n            # That complicates things because the state must also track how many H's and M's have been used so far.\n            # So the state needs to include the current index, the number of H's and M's used, and whose turn it is next.\n            # But that might be manageable.\n            # Let's re-express the state as (i, h_count, m_count, is_homer_turn).\n            # So for each state, we can decide whether to assign the current digit to H or M, provided that h_count < n and m_count < n.\n            # But this increases the state space significantly. With n=18, 2n=36, h_count can be 0..18, m_count 0..18, and is_homer_turn (2 possibilities). So total states are 36 * 19 * 19 * 2 = ~139,968, which is manageable.\n            # So, the DP function will be something like dp(i, h, m, is_homer_turn).\n            # Now, the base case is when i == len(A), then the sum is 0.\n            # For the transitions:\n            # If it's Homer's turn, he can choose to take the current digit for his number, then move to i+1, h+1, m, is_homer_turn becomes False.\n            # Or, he can choose to pass the turn to Marge, meaning M takes the current digit, and the state becomes i+1, h, m+1, is_homer_turn becomes True.\n            # Similarly, if it's Marge's turn, she can choose to take the current digit for her number, leading to state i+1, h, m+1, is_homer_turn becomes False.\n            # Or, she can pass the turn to Homer, leading to state i+1, h+1, m, is_homer_turn becomes True.\n            # Wait, but passing the turn doesn't make sense in this context because each player must make exactly n moves. So the choice is always to take the digit if it's their turn, but the problem allows them to decide who takes the next turn. So the state must account for both possibilities: whether the current player takes the digit or passes the turn.\n            # Wait, perhaps not. Because the players can choose to take the next digit or not, but each must make exactly n moves. So, it's more accurate to model the state as the current index, the number of H's and M's taken so far, and whose turn it is now. At each step, the current player has to take the digit, but they can choose to assign it to themselves or the other player, but only if the other player hasn't reached their move limit yet.\n\n            # Wait, no. Each player must make exactly n moves. So the assignment of the current digit is to the current player, but they can choose to pass the turn to the other player for future moves. So, the current player can take the current digit for their own number, or assign it to the other player, but only if the other player hasn't exceeded their n moves.\n\n            # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\n            # Let me think differently. Since the order of digits is fixed, the contribution of each digit depends on when it is added to S1 or S2. The earlier a digit is added, the higher its place value.\n\n            # So, the optimal strategy is to assign higher digits to S1 and S2 in such a way that the sum of their contributions is maximized. But how?\n\n            # It might be optimal to alternate between assigning the highest remaining digit to S1 and S2. But this isn't necessarily the case because the place values depend on the order of addition.\n\n            # Another idea is to use a greedy approach. At each step, assign the current digit to the player whose current number would gain the most from adding this digit. But this requires knowing the current place values, which depends on the number of digits already in each S.\n\n            # Given the complexity, the DP approach is still the way to go. Let's adjust the state to include the counts of H and M moves made so far and whose turn it is.\n\n            # So, the state is (i, h_count, m_count, is_homer_turn). The value of the state is the maximum sum achievable from this point onward.\n\n            # The transitions are as follows:\n            # If it's Homer's turn:\n                # He can take the current digit for himself, leading to state (i+1, h_count+1, m_count, False).\n                # Or, he can pass the turn to Marge, leading to state (i+1, h_count, m_count, True).\n            # If it's Marge's turn:\n                # She can take the current digit for herself, leading to state (i+1, h_count, m_count+1, False).\n                # Or, she can pass the turn to Homer, leading to state (i+1, h_count+1, m_count, True).\n\n            # For each transition, we compute the contribution of the current digit to the respective player's number based on their current length.\n\n            # The contribution of a digit d when added to a number with current length l is d * 10^(l), because the new digit becomes the (l+1)-th digit from the right, which is multiplied by 10^l.\n\n            # Wait, no. Let me think: suppose S1 has l digits. Adding a new digit d to S1 makes it l+1 digits. The new digit is the most significant digit, so its place value is 10^l. So the contribution is d * 10^l.\n\n            # So, when assigning a digit to a player, we need to know their current length to compute the contribution.\n\n            # Thus, the state must include the current lengths of S1 and S2.\n\n            # So, the state becomes (i, s1_len, s2_len, is_homer_turn). The value is the maximum sum achievable from this state.\n\n            # Now, the transitions become:\n            # If it's Homer's turn:\n                # Option 1: Assign current digit to S1. Contribution is d * 10^s1_len.\n                # Then, next state is (i+1, s1_len+1, s2_len, False).\n                # Option 2: Assign current digit to S2. Contribution is d * 10^s2_len.\n                # Then, next state is (i+1, s1_len, s2_len+1, True).\n            # If it's Marge's turn:\n                # Option 1: Assign current digit to S2. Contribution is d * 10^s2_len.\n                # Next state is (i+1, s1_len, s2_len+1, False).\n                # Option 2: Assign current digit to S1. Contribution is d * 10^s1_len.\n                # Next state is (i+1, s1_len+1, s2_len, True).\n\n            # Wait, but the player can choose to pass the turn to the other player. So in each state, the current player can choose to take the digit for themselves or pass it to the other player, provided that the other player hasn't exceeded their n moves.\n\n            # But in the problem statement, each player must make exactly n moves. So, when a player is not the one whose turn it is, they cannot take the digit unless the other player passes the turn to them.\n\n            # Therefore, in the state, the player whose turn it is can choose to take the digit for themselves or pass it to the other player, but only if the other player hasn't made n moves yet.\n\n            # So, in the state, we have to consider both options for the current player.\n\n            # Therefore, the recursive function will explore both possibilities and choose the one that leads to the maximum sum.\n\n            # Now, let's outline the steps:\n\n            # 1.
