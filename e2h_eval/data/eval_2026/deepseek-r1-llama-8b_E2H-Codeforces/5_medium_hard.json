Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. Two colors are compatible if they are the same or one is '?'. \n\nSo, the input gives me two strings: l for left boots and r for right boots. Each character in these strings represents a color, which could be a lowercase letter or a question mark. My goal is to maximize the number of pairs such that each left and right boot is used at most once.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, I think I should first process each possible pair of left and right boots and determine if they're compatible. But since n can be up to 150,000, checking each possible pair directly would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe I can count the frequencies of each possible color in left and right, including the question marks. Then, for each color c, determine how many lefts and rights have that color, considering that '?' can match any.\n\nBut wait, the question is about pairing specific boots, not just counts. Because each pair uses one left and one right, and each can only be used once. So it's more like a bipartite matching problem, but that's also computationally expensive for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to pair as many as possible using the most flexible options. For example, all the '?' in left can be paired with any in right, but we also need to consider the non-'?' cases.\n\nLet me think: The maximum number of pairs is the sum of all possible compatible pairs, but ensuring that each left and right is used at most once. So it's similar to finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between compatible left and right nodes.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like the Hungarian method won't work because that's O(n^3), which is impossible.\n\nSo I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a flow problem. Create a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to right nodes it can pair with. Then, the maximum matching would give the maximum number of pairs. But again, for 150k nodes, building such a graph isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a way to count the maximum possible pairs without explicitly modeling the graph. Let's think about the different types of color pairs.\n\nCase 1: Both are '?'. These can be paired together, and each such pair contributes 1 to the total.\n\nCase 2: One is '?', the other is a specific color. Since the '?' can match any, these can all be paired.\n\nCase 3: Both are specific colors and they are the same. These can be paired.\n\nWait, but how do we handle overlapping possibilities? Because after pairing some, others might not be available.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible is the minimum of the counts for each possible pair type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible the same color pairs (including those where either is '?').\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a frequency table.\n\nLet's create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts. left_counts will track how many times each color (including '?') appears in the left boots. Similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_counts, the number of rights that can pair with it is the sum of:\n\n- right_counts[c], if c is not '?'\n- left_counts['?'], because left is '?', can pair with any right\n- right_counts['?'], because right is '?', can pair with any left\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when both are '?', each pair is counted once.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to compute the number of pairs where left is '?', right is anything, plus the number of pairs where left is specific and right is the same, minus the overlap where both are '?' because they were counted twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the maximum possible pairs by considering all possible combinations:\n\nTotal pairs = pairs where left is '?', right is any + pairs where left is specific and right is same + pairs where left is specific and right is '?'.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because some specific-left and specific-right pairs may have already been considered in the 'specific' case. Also, when left is '?', it can pair with any right, including those that are '?', but those rights can't be used again.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the number of pairs where left is '?'. Let's call this A.\n\n2. Compute the number of pairs where left is specific and right is the same. Let's call this B.\n\n3. Compute the number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'. Let's call this C.\n\nBut then, the total would be A + B + C, but this might overcount because the rights used in A might include those that could also be used in C, or B.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in the A case, the left is '?', so it can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. But in the B and C cases, we are pairing specific lefts with specific rights or rights that are '?'.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: The maximum possible number of pairs is min(total_left, total_right) plus the number of same-color pairs beyond that.\n\nWait, no, because even if some lefts are '?', they can pair with any rights, possibly allowing more pairs than the min.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal number of pairs is the sum of the following:\n\n- All the pairs where left is '?': which is the count of '?' in left multiplied by the count of any in right. But wait, no, because some of those rights may have already been paired with other lefts.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to model this as a bipartitioned graph and find the maximum matching, but that's not feasible for n=15e4.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of pairs in a certain way.\n\nWait, think about the problem differently: Each left boot can be matched to a right boot if their colors are compatible. We need to select as many such pairs as possible, with each left and right used exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding a maximum bipartite matching where edges exist between compatible pairs.\n\nBut again, with 15e4 nodes, standard algorithms won't work.\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph has a certain structure that allows us to compute the maximum matching quickly.\n\nWhat's the structure of the graph? For each left i, it can connect to right j if l[i] and r[j] are compatible.\n\nSo, the edges are based on the color compatibility between l[i] and r[j].\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nWait, perhaps for each left i, the set of compatible rights j is determined by l[i]. So for each left, its compatible rights are:\n\n- All rights j where r[j] == l[i], or r[j] is '?'.\nOR\n- For left i being '?', all rights j are compatible.\n\nSo, the edges from left i to right j exist if:\n\n(l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i] == '?') OR (r[j] == '?')\n\nSo, the bipartition graph is such that each left is connected to all rights that meet the condition above.\n\nNow, how can we find the maximum matching in such a graph?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where each left can connect to multiple rights, and the maximum matching can be computed using some optimized approach.\n\nBut even then, for 15e4 nodes, it's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph with some properties that allow for a greedy approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nLet me think: In this problem, the graph is bipartitioned into two sets of size n each. Each edge exists if the two nodes are compatible.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nBut the maximum matching problem for bipartite graphs can be solved with the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which is O(EâˆšV), but E can be O(n^2), which is 2.25e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be found by considering the counts of each color and the '?' in both left and right.\n\nSo, let's think about the problem in terms of counts:\n\nLet me define:\n\nleft_counts: a dictionary where key is a color (or '?'), value is the number of times it appears in the left string.\n\nSimilarly, right_counts: same for the right string.\n\nNow, the total possible pairs can be broken down into several components:\n\n1. Pairs where left is '?': For each such left, it can pair with any right. So the total is left_q * (right_q + sum of right_counts for specific colors). But wait, no, because each right can be used at most once.\n\nWait, no. Because when left is '?', it can pair with any right, regardless of their color. But the problem is that each right can be paired with only one left.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs involving left '?' is the minimum between the number of '?' in left and the total number of right boots.\n\nWait, no, because the '?' left can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. But the rights that are '?' can also be used by other lefts, including the specific ones.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- First, count all possible pairs where left is '?': left_q * right_total.\n\nBut this includes all possible rights, including those that are '?'. But then, the rights that are specific can also be used by specific lefts.\n\nSo, this approach might overcount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?', right is any (but subtracting the overlaps where both are '?').\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is specific and same color.\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'.\n\nWait, but how to combine these without double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nCompute all possible pairs as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\na) The number of pairs where left is '?': this is equal to the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right non-'?', plus the number of right '?' that can be paired with left '?' (but each right can be used only once).\n\nWait, no. Because the left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. So the maximum number of pairs where left is '?' is the minimum between the number of left '?' and the number of right boots, but since each right can be used once, it's the number of left '?' plus the number of right '?' that are not used in same-color pairs.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should try to model this as a bipartite graph and find a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nWait, but given the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to find a way to model this as a bipartite graph where each left connects to a subset of rights, and then find a way to compute the maximum matching without explicitly processing each edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartition graph can be viewed as a bipartition where each left i is connected to all rights j where l[i] is compatible with r[j].\n\nGiven that, the maximum matching can be found using a greedy approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a flow problem where each left is connected to a super source, each right to a super sink, and edges represent compatibility. Then, the maximum flow would give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nYes! That's an interesting idea. Let's model it as a flow network:\n\n- Create a source node S and a sink node T.\n\n- For each left boot, create a node L_i, connected from S with capacity 1.\n\n- For each right boot, create a node R_j, connected to T with capacity 1.\n\n- For each pair (i, j) where l_i and r_j are compatible, add an edge from L_i to R_j with capacity 1.\n\nThen, the maximum flow from S to T in this network would be the maximum number of pairs.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each L_i can send one unit of flow to R_j, and each R_j can receive at most 1 unit.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to computing the maximum flow in this network. But with n=15e4, the number of nodes would be 2n + 2 = 3e5+, which is manageable, but the number of edges could be O(n^2), which is 2.25e10. That's impossible to handle.\n\nSo, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, so I need another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a bipartition where each left can be connected to a group of rights, and find a way to compute the maximum matching without enumerating all edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the bipartition graph has a particular structure that allows for a more efficient maximum matching computation.\n\nFor instance, each left can connect to a certain subset of rights. For example, all rights that are either the same as the left's color or '?'.\n\nSo, for each left i, the compatible rights are:\n\n- All R_j where r_j is equal to l_i, or r_j is '?'.\n\nSo, the compatible rights for L_i are:\n\nR_?.union(R_{l_i} )\n\nWait, no. R_? are the rights that are '?', and R_{l_i} are the rights with color l_i.\n\nSo, for L_i, the compatible rights are all R_j where r_j is '?' or r_j equals l_i.\n\nSo, for each L_i, the compatible R_j's are:\n\nthe union of R_? and R_{l_i}.\n\nSo, perhaps I can precompute for each color c, the number of rights that have color c or '?'.\n\nWait, but for the flow approach, that's still a lot of edges.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Let me precompute for each possible color c, the count of lefts with color c, and the count of rights with color c or '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the maximum number of pairs as the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is '?'\n- The number of pairs where left is '?' and right is specific (not '?')\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is same as left\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'\n\nBut then, the sum of these four categories can't exceed the minimum of total left and total right.\n\nWait, perhaps not, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me define:\n\n- a = number of left '?' (left_q)\n- b = number of right '?' (right_q)\n- for each color c, let left_c be the count of lefts with color c.\n- similarly, right_c is the count of rights with color c.\n\nThen, the total possible same-color pairs is sum over c of min(left_c, right_c).\n\nBut, the '?' can pair with any.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs would be:\n\nsame_color_pairs = sum over c (min(left_c, right_c))\n\nplus the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is '?', but wait, those are already included in same_color_pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because same_color_pairs for c='?' would be min(left_q, right_q). But the pairs where left is '?' and right is '?', that's exactly same_color_pairs for '?'.\n\nSo, same_color_pairs includes all same-color pairs, including those where both are '?'.\n\nThen, the remaining '?' can be used to pair with non-? rights.\n\nSo, the total would be same_color_pairs + (left_q - same_color_pairs_c) * (right_q - same_color_pairs_c) ??? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsame_color_pairs + min(left_q, right_q - same_color_pairs_c) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAnother plan:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n1. The number of pairs where left is '?': which is the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right boots that are compatible (excluding those already used in same-color pairs). Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible is the minimum between the total number of lefts and rights, plus the number of same-color pairs beyond that.\n\nNo, that's not accurate.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to model this as a bipartition graph and find a way to compute the maximum matching without considering all possible edges.\n\nWait, in the bipartition graph, each left node can connect to a subset of right nodes, specifically, those that are compatible.\n\nMoreover, for each left, the compatible rights form a superset that includes:\n\nall rights with r_j = l_i, plus all rights with r_j = '?'.\n\nSo, for each left, the compatible rights are the union of two groups: those with r_j = l_i and those with r_j = '?'.\n\nNow, the maximum matching can be found using a greedy approach if the graph has a certain structure, like bipartitioned into two independent sets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to matching in a way that for each left, the edges are to all rights that are compatible, which can be represented as a group.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the problem by grouping the rights into two categories: those that are '?', and those that are specific.\n\nThen, for each left, the edges are to all specific rights that match its color, plus all '?' rights.\n\nSo, for the specific rights, each left can be matched to at most one specific right (if their color matches). For the '?' rights, each can be matched to any left.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is '?': which is the number of '?' lefts plus the number of specific lefts that can pair with specific rights, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts:\n\n1. Matching specific lefts with specific rights of the same color.\n\n2. Using the remaining lefts (either specific or '?') and rights (either specific or '?') to form additional pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be found by:\n\n- Compute the maximum number of same-color pairs between specific lefts and specific rights. Let's call this S.\n\n- Then, the remaining lefts (including '?') and the remaining rights (including '?') can be paired as much as possible. The maximum possible here is the minimum of the remaining lefts and remaining rights.\n\nSo, the total is S + min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nBecause:\n\nAfter matching S pairs, we have some lefts and rights left. The remaining lefts can be any (since they are not used in S), and the remaining rights can be any (since they are not used in S). So, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of the counts of remaining lefts and remaining rights.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each color c, compute the minimum of left_c and right_c. Sum these to get S. This is the maximum number of same-color pairs between specific lefts and specific rights.\n\n2. Subtract S from left_counts and right_counts for each color c.\n\n3. Now, compute the number of lefts that are '?': left_q_remaining = left_q - (number of pairs where both are '?'). Because S includes pairs where left is '? and right is '?', so we have to subtract that.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, S is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for each c, including c='?'. So, the number of pairs where both are '?' is min(left_q, right_q). So, after step 1, the remaining '?' in left is left_q - same_color_pairs for '?', and same for right.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nAfter step 1, for color c, same_color_pairs_c = min(left_c, right_c). For c='?', same_color_pairs_c = min(left_q, right_q).\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are:\n\nfor each c, left_counts[c] -= same_color_pairs_c.\n\nBut for c='?', left_counts['?'] was left_q, now becomes left_q - same_color_pairs_c.\n\nSimilarly for right_counts.\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining lefts are:\n\nsum of left_counts.values() = n - S.\n\nSame for the remaining rights.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts (including '?') and the remaining rights (including '?') can form additional pairs.\n\nThe maximum number of such pairs is min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\nSo, the total is S + min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\nBut wait, what about the '?' in left and right? After step 1, the remaining '?' in left is (left_q - same_color_pairs_c for '?'), and same for right.\n\nSo, the remaining '?' can be paired together, but also with other specific lefts and rights.\n\nWait, but when adding the min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights), it includes all possibilities, including pairing the remaining '?' lefts with the remaining '?' rights.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of same-color pairs for each color, including '?'. Then compute the remaining lefts and rights, and add min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights) to S.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities. For example, some specific lefts could pair with '?' rights, but those rights might have been used in same-color pairs.\n\nWait, but in step 1, the same-color pairs are only for specific colors. Wait, no. Because in step 1, S includes all same-color pairs, including when left is '? and right is '?'. So, after step 1, the remaining lefts and rights include the leftovers from same-color pairs.\n\nSo, the min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights) would account for all possible additional pairs, including those where left is specific and right is '?', and vice versa.\n\nThus, the total is S plus this min.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nn = 10\nl = codeforces\nr = dodivthree\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 5 pairs. Let me see:\n\nSuppose l is \"codeforces\", which has 10 letters, none are '?'.\n\nr is \"dodivthree\". Let's see:\n\nLooking for same-color pairs:\n\nEach left color must match a right color. So, for each color in l, check if it appears in r.\n\nIn the sample, the output is 5 pairs. So, S would be 5.\n\nAfter that, the remaining lefts are 0 (since all 10 are used), so the min(0, ...) is 0. So total is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: Suppose l has 3 '?', and r has 4 '?'. Then S for '?' is 3. Remaining lefts: 0, so total is 3.\n\nAnother case: l has 2 '?', r has 3 '?'. S is 2. Remaining lefts: 0, total is 2.\n\nAnother case: l has 3 specific colors, say 'a', 'b', 'c'; r has 3 specific colors 'a', 'b', 'c'. Then S is 3. Remaining lefts: 0. Total is 3.\n\nAnother case: l has 2 'a's and 1 '?'; r has 1 'a' and 1 '?'. Then same-color pairs S is 1 (for 'a'). Remaining lefts: 1 'a' and 1 '?'. Remaining rights: 0 'a's, 1 '?'. So min(2, 1) is 1. So total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct: pair the remaining 'a' with the right '?', and the left '?' with the right '?'.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute for each color c (including '?'), the same-color pairs: same_c = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Sum these to get S.\n\n2. After this, subtract same_c from left_counts and right_counts for each c.\n\n3. Compute the remaining lefts: sum(left_counts.values()) = n - S.\n\n4. Compute the remaining rights: sum(right_counts.values()) = n - S.\n\n5. The additional pairs is min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\n6. Total pairs is S + additional_pairs.\n\nBut wait, this is not correct. Because, during step 1, when we subtract same_c from left and right, we're not accounting for the fact that some lefts may have been '?', which can pair with any rights.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, same_c for '?' is min(left_q, right_q). So, after step 1, left_q is left_q - same_c, and right_q is right_q - same_c.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are:\n\nsum of left_counts[c] for all c, including '?', which is (n - S).\n\nSame for rights.\n\nSo, the additional_pairs is min(n - S, n - S) = n - S.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the sum of same_color_pairs, which can't exceed n.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for each c, which for all c, sum(left_c) is n, sum(right_c) is n. So, S is <=n.\n\nBut when you sum same_c for all c, including '?', the sum is <=n.\n\nWait, but let me think: For each c, same_c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Summing over all c, same_c <= sum(left_counts[c]), same for right_counts.\n\nSo, sum(same_c) <= min(sum(left_counts), sum(right_counts)) ) = n.\n\nSo, S is <=n.\n\nThen, remaining_lefts is n - S, same for remaining_rights.\n\nSo, the additional_pairs is min(n - S, n - S) = n - S.\n\nBut that can't be, because sometimes the remaining lefts and rights are more than n - S.\n\nWait, no. Because after step 1, the sum of left_counts is n - S, same for right_counts.\n\nSo, the additional_pairs is min(n - S, n - S) = n - S.\n\nSo, the total is S + (n - S) = n.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the maximum possible pairs is n.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible is indeed n, as each left can be paired with a right.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute S as the sum of same_color pairs, then the additional pairs are n - S.\n\nSo, the total is n.\n\nBut that's only if it's possible to pair the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nWait, but the approach works because the remaining lefts and rights can be paired as follows:\n\nEach remaining left can be paired with any remaining right, regardless of color. Because the remaining lefts are either '?', or specific colors that can't form same-color pairs anymore.\n\nWait, but in the sample, after step 1, the remaining lefts are 0, so the additional_pairs is 0. So total is 5, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in another case where S is less than n, the additional_pairs would be n - S.\n\nBut how can that be, because n is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, S is the maximum possible same-color pairs, and the additional_pairs is the maximum possible cross-color pairs.\n\nBut the sum S + (n - S) is n, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, this approach seems to suggest that the maximum possible pairs is always n, which is not correct.\n\nWait, no, because in the problem statement, the sample output is 5, but n is 10.\n\nWait, in the sample, it's possible to have 5 pairs because some right boots can't be paired due to color incompatibility.\n\nAh, right. So, the approach I thought earlier is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, the maximum possible pairs is min(n, ... ), but if the colors are incompatible, the actual maximum may be less than n.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, what's the correct way?\n\nPerhaps the initial approach needs to be modified.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe maximum possible pairs is the sum of same_color_pairs plus the number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of '?' in right.\n\nBut no, because that's not considering all possible cross-pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between:\n\n- The sum of same_color_pairs + the number of '? in left and ? in right.\n\nWait, but that's not precise.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative plan: Let's think about the problem in terms of bipartition graph again, but try to find a way to compute the maximum matching without enumerating all possible edges.\n\nEach left can connect to all rights that are compatible.\n\nBut the problem is that the number of edges is O(n^2), which is too big.\n\nBut perhaps, for each left, the compatible rights can be represented in a way that allows for efficient matching.\n\nWait, perhaps each left can be connected to all rights in the form of a group, and then use a greedy approach to match them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of bipartitioned graph with edges grouped by certain properties.\n\nWait, I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the edges are such that for each left i, the compatible rights are:\n\n- all R_j where r_j is '?' \n- plus all R_j where r_j is l_i.\n\nSo, for each left, the compatible rights can be split into two groups: those that are '?' and those that are specific.\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\nFor left i, connect to all R_j where r_j is l_i, and connect to all R_j where r_j is '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum matching can be computed by first matching as many specific pairs as possible, and then using the '?' to fill in the gaps.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the maximum number of same-color pairs for specific colors, S.\n\n2. For the remaining lefts and rights, compute how many can be paired via '?'.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is S plus the minimum between the number of remaining lefts (including '?') and the number of remaining rights (including '?').\n\nBut again, this approach may not account for the possibility that some specific lefts could have been paired with '?' rights.\n\nBut perhaps it's the best we can do given the time constraints.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the maximum possible is 5, but the sum of same_color_pairs is 5. So, the additional_pairs is zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose l is \"a?\" and r is \"?b\".\n\nSame_color_pairs: 'a' in l has 1, r has 0. '?' in l has 1, r has 1. So same_color_pairs is 1 (from '?').\n\nSo S is 1.\n\nRemaining lefts: 1 (from 'a'), 0 '?'. Remaining rights: 1 (from 'b'), 0 '?'.\n\nAdditional pairs: min(1, 1) = 1.\n\nSo total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct: pair 'a' with 'b' via the specific route, and the '?' with the other '?'.\n\nSo, the approach seems to hold.\n\nAnother test case: l = \"?a\", r = \"ba\".\n\nSame_color_pairs:\n\nFor 'a' in l: 1, in r: 1 â†’ same_color_pairs +=1.\n\nFor '?' in l: 1, in r: 1 (only if r has '?'), but r is 'ba' which has no '?'. So same_color_pairs for '?' is 0.\n\nSo S=1.\n\nRemaining lefts: 1 '?', 1 'a' â†’ total 2.\n\nRemaining rights: 1 'b', 1 'a' â†’ total 2.\n\nSo additional_pairs is 2.\n\nSo total is 3.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible?\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nPair left 1 (')') with right 2 ('a') â†’ compatible.\n\nPair left 2 ('a') with right 1 ('b') â†’ incompatible.\n\nPair left 2 ('a') with right 2 ('a') â†’ compatible.\n\nSo, possible pairs are:\n\nleft1 (1) â†’ right2 (2): compatible.\n\nleft2 (2) â†’ right2 (2): compatible.\n\nSo, total 2 pairs.\n\nWait, but according to our approach, S=1, additional_pairs=2, total 3.\n\nWhich contradicts the actual possible pairs.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, the initial approach overestimates the maximum possible pairs.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 2, but the approach suggests 3.\n\nSo, the approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so I need to rethink.\n\nWhat's wrong with the initial approach?\n\nIn the example above, l is \"?a\", r is \"ba\".\n\nSame_color_pairs: 1 (from 'a' in l and 'a' in r).\n\nRemaining lefts: 1 '?' and 1 'a'.\n\nRemaining rights: 1 'b' and 1 'a'.\n\nAccording to the approach, additional_pairs is min(2, 2) = 2. So total is 3.\n\nBut in reality, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, why?\n\nBecause the '?' in left can pair with 'a' in right, but the 'a' in left can't pair with 'b' in right.\n\nSo, the approach assumes that all remaining lefts can pair with any remaining rights, which is not the case.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, what's the correct way?\n\nI think the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe need to compute the maximum number of pairs where each left and right is used once, and their colors are compatible.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a maximum bipartite matching in the graph where edges are between compatible lefts and rights.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this is not feasible with standard algorithms.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph and find a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the graph can be represented as a bipartition where each left is connected to a group of rights, and we can find a way to compute the maximum matching without considering each edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartitioned graph where each left has edges to a subset of rights, and the maximum matching can be found by greedily matching as many as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe bipartition graph can be considered as a bipartition where each left can be connected to any right that is compatible. So, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering the '?' as a wildcard that can match any.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Match as many same-color pairs as possible, excluding the '?'.\n\n2. Then, use the '?' to pair with the remaining boots.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?' can be used to pair with any remaining boots, whether they are specific or '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of pairs where left is '?', which can be paired with any right, but the right can't have been used in a same-color pair.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAn alternative approach is inspired by the problem's similarity to bipartite matching with certain constraints.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the number of same-color pairs for each color c, which is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n   Sum these to get S.\n\n2. The remaining lefts and rights are:\n\n   For each color c, left_counts[c] -= same_c.\n\n   Same for right_counts.\n\n3. Now, the number of '?' in left is left_q_remaining = left_counts.get('?', 0) - same_c_for_'?'.\n\n   Similarly for right.\n\n4. The additional_pairs is the minimum between the sum of remaining lefts and the sum of remaining rights, but considering that the '?' can pair with any.\n\nBut how to compute this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the additional_pairs is the minimum between:\n\nsum(remaining_lefts) and sum(remaining_rights)\n\nBut since the '?' can pair with any, perhaps the sum of remaining_lefts is >= sum(remaining_rights) or vice versa, and the additional_pairs is the min of those.\n\nBut in the previous example, the sum of remaining_lefts is 2, sum of remaining_rights is 2, but the additional_pairs is 1, not 2.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe additional_pairs is the minimum between:\n\nsum(remaining_lefts) and sum(remaining_rights), but also, the number of '?' in left and right can be used to form pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the additional_pairs is the sum of the following:\n\n- The number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of '?' in right.\n\nPlus, the number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of specific rights not yet paired.\n\nPlus, the number of specific lefts multiplied by the number of '?' rights not yet paired.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional_pairs is the minimum between the sum of remaining_lefts and sum of remaining_rights.\n\nBut in the previous example, the sum is 2, but the actual possible pairs are 1.\n\nSo, the approach is not sufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and perhaps need to look for hints or think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioned graph where each left is connected to all compatible rights, but the maximum matching can be found using a certain algorithm.\n\nBut I'm not aware of any algorithm that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors.
