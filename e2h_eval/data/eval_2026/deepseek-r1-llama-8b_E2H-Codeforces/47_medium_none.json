    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The first thing I notice is that a + k and b + k can be rewritten in terms of their difference. Let me denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. So, d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume that a <= b. Then, when we add k to both, their difference remains the same. Wait, no, because a + k and b + k: their difference is still (b - a). So the difference is fixed as d.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that x = a + k, y = b + k, which means x and y differ by d. We want to minimize LCM(x, y), and among all possible k's, choose the smallest one.\n\nWait, but since x and y are consecutive after adding k, their sum is (a + b) + 2k. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.\n\nLet me consider that x and y are two numbers with a fixed difference d. So x = y - d. Because x = a + k, y = b + k, and since a < b, then x = y - d. Wait, no, because if a is less than b, then (a +k) is less than (b +k). So yes, y = x + d.\n\nSo for any x, y is x + d. Now, the LCM of x and y is equal to (x * y) / GCD(x, y). Since y = x + d, the GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo LCM(x, y) = x*(x + d)/GCD(x, d). Hmm, interesting. So to minimize the LCM, perhaps we need to maximize the GCD of x and d?\n\nBecause if the GCD is larger, then the denominator in the LCM formula is larger, which would make the LCM smaller. So yes, maximizing the GCD could help.\n\nSo the problem now becomes: find x such that x is greater than or equal to a (since x = a +k, and k >=0), and y = x +d is such that y >= b, and then find the x that maximizes GCD(x, d), thereby minimizing the LCM.\n\nBut wait, since x can be any number >= a, and y is determined by x, how do we find the optimal x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal k is such that a +k is a multiple of some divisor of d. Because then, the GCD(x, d) would be as large as possible.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The optimal k should make x = a +k and y = b +k such that their GCD is as large as possible. Because that would reduce the LCM.\n\nSo, the maximum possible GCD is d itself. So if x is a multiple of d, then GCD(x, d) = d. Then the LCM would be x*(x +d)/d = x + (x^2)/d. Hmm, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, but if x is a multiple of d, say x = m*d, then y = m*d +d = (m+1)*d. So LCM(x, y) is (m*d) * ( (m+1)*d ) / (d) ) = m*(m+1)*d. That's a pretty good scenario because the LCM is d multiplied by m*(m+1), which grows quadratically. So perhaps making x a multiple of d is a good approach.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? Oh right, in the problem statement, a and b are given as integers, but they can be equal. If a equals b, then d is zero. So in that case, adding k doesn't change the value of either a+k or b+k. So the LCM is just a +k. So to minimize it, we set k=0.\n\nSo for the case where a != b, we proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. For cases where d >0, find the x = a +k, which must be >= a, such that x is a multiple of a divisor of d. Because that way, the GCD(x, d) is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but x can be any number >=a. So perhaps the optimal x is a number that is a multiple of g, where g is a divisor of d, and also as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is determined by the largest possible divisor of d, such that x = a +k is a multiple of that divisor.\n\nWait, another approach: for each possible divisor g of d, compute the minimal x >= a such that x is a multiple of g. Then compute the LCM for each such x and choose the one with the minimal LCM.\n\nBut considering that d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all divisors of d may be computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, but the number of divisors of a number up to 1e9 is at most around 1000 (for a highly composite number like 735134400 which has over 1000 divisors). So for each test case, even if d is 1e9, enumerating all its divisors is feasible.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Compute d = |a -b|.\n\n- If d ==0, output k=0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Enumerate all possible divisors g of d.\n\n   - For each g, compute the minimal x >= a such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n      - x = a + k, and x must be >=a.\n\n      - Also, since y = x +d must be >= b.\n\n      Wait, because a +k >=a and b +k >=b, since k is non-negative.\n\n      So for each g, find the smallest x >= a where x mod g ==0.\n\n      Then compute the LCM for x and x +d.\n\n   - Among all these possibilities, choose the x that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple x's giving the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k (i.e., the smallest x).\n\nWait, but what about when g is a divisor of d, but x is less than a? No, because x is a +k, so x can't be less than a. So for each g, x must be the smallest multiple of g that is >=a.\n\nWait, but wait: suppose g is a divisor of d, and the smallest multiple of g that is >=a is x. Then y = x +d is also a multiple of g (since d is a multiple of g, because g divides d).\n\nThus, the GCD(x, y) is at least g, which is a divisor of d.\n\nSo for each such x, the GCD is at least g, and hence the LCM is minimized.\n\nBut is considering all possible divisors of d sufficient to find the optimal x? Or is there a possibility that a better x exists that doesn't correspond to any divisor of d?\n\nHmm, that's a good question. Let's see.\n\nSuppose that x is such that GCD(x, d) is larger than any of the considered g's. Wait, but x is a +k, which can be any number >=a. How can we ensure that we cover all possible x's that have a high GCD with d?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is the minimal x >=a which is a multiple of a certain divisor g of d.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is a multiple of a certain g, but maybe not all g's need to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is either a or a+1, but that seems unlikely unless d is very small.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a=6, b=10. Then d=4.\n\nThe divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\ng=4: x must be a multiple of 4 and >=6. The smallest x is 8 (6+2). Then y=12. LCM(8,12)=24.\n\ng=2: x must be >=6 and even. The smallest x is 6. y=6+4=10. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\ng=1: x can be 6. y=10. LCM=30.\n\nSo comparing the options, the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when g=4. So k=2 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: input '21 31' gives d=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10: x needs to be >=21, multiple of 10. The smallest x is 30. y=40. LCM(30,40)=120.\n\ng=5: x needs to be >=21, multiple of 5. The smallest is 25. y=35. LCM(25,35)=175.\n\ng=2: x >=21 and even. 22. y=32. LCM(22,32)=352.\n\ng=1: x=21. y=31. LCM(21,31)=651.\n\nSo the minimal is 120 when g=10, so k=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input '5 10', d=5.\n\nDivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: x must be >=5, multiple of 5. x=5. y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=1: x=5, LCM is 10.\n\nSo both give the same LCM, but since we need the smallest k, which is 0, that's the answer.\n\nSo the approach of considering all divisors of d seems to work.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is 0, return k=0.\n\n2. Enumerate all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g, compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g and >=a.\n\n   - x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g.\n\n   - Then, compute y = x +d.\n\n   - Compute the LCM of x and y.\n\n4. Among all these (x, LCM) pairs, find the pair with the smallest LCM. If multiple, pick the smallest x (since k is x -a, and x is a +k, so the smaller x gives smaller k).\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the case where x is not a multiple of any of the divisors. Wait, but why would that be? Because, the GCD of x and d could be higher than any of the considered g's. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible. Because the maximum possible GCD is d itself, which is considered when g=d.\n\nWait, for any x, the GCD(x, d) can be any divisor of d. Because GCD(x, d) divides d by definition.\n\nThus, the maximum possible GCD is d, and the minimal LCM for x and y would be when GCD is as large as possible. So, perhaps the optimal x is when x is a multiple of d, but sometimes, as in the first sample, choosing g=d gives the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, when d=4, the x is 8, which is a multiple of 4, giving GCD(8,4)=4. Which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal x is always a multiple of a divisor of d. Thus, considering all possible divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute all divisors of d, including 1 and d.\n\nFor each divisor g, compute x = ceil(a/g) * g.\n\nThen compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nCompare all these LCMs and choose the x with the smallest LCM, and in case of ties, the smallest x.\n\nWait, but what about when d is 0? Well, in that case, a and b are equal, so any k will result in LCM(a +k, a +k) = a +k. So the minimal is when k=0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Compute d = |a -b|.\n\n- If d is 0: output 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Generate all divisors of d.\n\n   - For each divisor g:\n\n      - Compute x = a + k, where k is the smallest non-negative integer such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n         - So x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g.\n\n      - Compute y = x + d.\n\n      - Compute current_lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y).\n\n      - Keep track of the current minimum LCM and the corresponding x.\n\n   - After checking all divisors, select the x that gives the smallest LCM. If multiple x's have the same LCM, choose the smallest x (so that k is as small as possible).\n\nBut wait, the way x is computed is based on a and g. What if x ends up being less than a? No, because x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g. For example, if a is 6 and g is 4, 6//4 is 1, 1*4 is 4, which is less than 6. So we add g-1 before division: (6 +4 -1)//4 = (9)//4=2, 2*4=8.\n\nYes, that ensures x is the smallest multiple of g >=a.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the challenges are:\n\n1. Efficiently generating all divisors of d.\n\n2. Handling the case where d is 0.\n\n3. Comparing the LCMs correctly.\n\nSo, first, let's think about how to generate all divisors of d.\n\nTo find all divisors of d, we can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all combinations of exponents.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible because the square root of 1e9 is 3e4, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code for generating all divisors:\n\n- Initialize a list of divisors.\n\n- For i from 1 to sqrt(d):\n\n   - if i divides d, then add i and d/i to the list.\n\n- Then, remove duplicates and sort.\n\nWait, but for perfect squares, i and d/i are the same, so we need to avoid duplicates.\n\nSo, the function to get all divisors would look something like this:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    if d ==0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) +1):\n        if d % i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nOnce we have the list of divisors, we process each as described.\n\nNow, for each g in the list of divisors:\n\nCompute x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g.\n\nThen compute y = x +d.\n\nThen compute the GCD of x and y.\n\nWait, but since y = x +d, and d is a multiple of g (because g is a divisor of d), then y = x + (g * m) for some m.\n\nSince x is a multiple of g, x = g * k. Then y = g*(k + m). So the GCD of x and y is g * GCD(k, k + m).\n\nBut since m is d/g, which is an integer, then GCD(k, k + m) = GCD(k, m).\n\nBut m is (d/g), which is an integer.\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the GCD as math.gcd(x, y).\n\nIn Python, the math.gcd function returns the positive GCD, but since x and y are positive, that's fine.\n\nSo for each g, compute x, y, then compute current_gcd = gcd(x, y), and then current_lcm = (x*y) // current_gcd.\n\nWe then compare all these current_lcm values and find the minimal one, along with the minimal x in case of ties.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nIf d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n   min_lcm = infinity\n\n   best_k = None\n\n   for g in divisors:\n\n       x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n       y = x +d\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       # compare with min_lcm\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = x - a\n\n       elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n           # if current x is smaller than the best x so far, update\n\n           if x < best_x:\n\n               best_k = x -a\n\n   print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, best_x is not initialized. So, perhaps we should track x as well.\n\nWait, for each g, after computing x, we need to check whether the current_lcm is less than the previous min. If it's equal, we need to check if the x is smaller than the previous x. Because in such case, the k is x -a, which would be smaller.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize min_lcm to a very large value, best_x to None.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n   compute x as before.\n\n   compute current_gcd, current_lcm.\n\n   if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n       min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n       best_x = x\n\n   elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n       if x < best_x:\n\n           best_x = x\n\nAt the end, the k is best_x - a.\n\nWait, but what if x is a multiple of g, but adding k makes y=x+d a multiple of g as well? Because d is a multiple of g, so y = x + (multiple of g) → y is also a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the GCD(x, y) is at least g.\n\nBut perhaps for other g's, the GCD could be higher.\n\nWait, but for each g, x is a multiple of g, so x = g * m, y = g * (m + (d/g)). So the GCD is g multiplied by the GCD(m, m + (d/g)).\n\nWhich depends on m and d/g.\n\nSo, the maximum possible GCD is when m and m + (d/g) are co-prime. Or not?\n\nWell, regardless, the current approach of considering all divisors of d and for each computing x and y, and their LCM, should capture the minimal possible LCM.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when d is 0, which we handle as a separate case.\n\nTesting the third sample:\n\nInput: 5 10 → d=5.\n\ndivisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nx = ((5 +5-1) //5)*5 → (9//5)=1 → 5.\n\ny=5+5=10.\n\nLCM(5,10)=10.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nx = ((5 +1-1)//1)*1 →5.\n\ny=10. LCM is 10.\n\nSo both options give LCM 10. So between x=5 and x=5, same. So k=0 is chosen.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7. d=4.\n\ndivisors of 4: 1,2,4.\n\ng=4: x=4 (since 3+4-1=6, 6//4=1 →4). y=8. LCM is 8.\n\ng=2: x=4 (since 3+2-1=4, 4//2=2 →4). y=8. Same as before.\n\ng=1: x=3. y=7. LCM is 21.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 8, achieved when g=4. So k=1.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=4. d=2.\n\ndivisors are 1,2.\n\ng=2: x=2. y=4. LCM is 4.\n\ng=1: x=2. y=4. Same LCM.\n\nSo k=0 is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if a=2, b=4, but we choose k=1:\n\nx=3, y=5. LCM is 15, which is larger.\n\nSo, indeed, k=0 is better.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6. d=2.\n\ndivisors are 1,2.\n\ng=2: x=4. y=6. LCM=12.\n\ng=1: x=4. y=6. Same LCM.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nAnother example: a=7, b=14. d=7.\n\ndivisors are 1,7.\n\ng=7: x=7. y=14. LCM is 14.\n\ng=1: x=7. Same.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=3. d=2.\n\ndivisors are 1,2.\n\ng=2: x=2. y=4. LCM is 4.\n\ng=1: x=1. y=3. LCM is 3.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 3, achieved when g=1, x=1. So k=0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because x=1, y=3: LCM is 3. Which is better than x=2, y=4 (LCM 4). So in this case, the minimal LCM is achieved when g=1, so the code would choose x=1.\n\nBut according to our code, for each g, we compute x and y, then calculate the LCM, and keep the minimal.\n\nSo in this case, the code would find that for g=1, the LCM is 3, which is less than the 4 for g=2. So it would choose x=1, which gives k=0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=6. d=3.\n\ndivisors: 1,3.\n\ng=3: x=3. y=6. LCM 6.\n\ng=1: x=3. y=6. Same.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=8, b=13. d=5.\n\ndivisors of 5: 1,5.\n\ng=5: x=10. y=15. LCM(10,15)=30.\n\ng=1: x=8. y=13. LCM=8*13=104.\n\nSo the minimal is 30, achieved with g=5, x=10. So k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when a > b? Because the code computes d as absolute difference. So no problem.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read a and b.\n\nThen compute d.\n\nIf d is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, compute all divisors of d.\n\nFor each g in the divisors, compute x.\n\nCompute y = x +d.\n\nCompute current_gcd = gcd(x, y).\n\ncurrent_lcm = (x*y)//current_gcd.\n\nTrack the minimal lcm and the corresponding x.\n\nFinally, print the k = x - a.\n\nBut wait, what if x is a multiple of a divisor g, but the corresponding x is a +k, and that k is minimal.\n\nWait, but the code is designed to find the x that gives the minimal LCM, and in case of tie, the minimal x.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a = b.\n\nOutput is 0.\n\nCase 2: a =1, b=1e9.\n\nd = 999,999,999.\n\nCompute all divisors of d, which could be time-consuming, but for 1e9, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but 1e9 is 10^9, which is 2^9 * 5^9, so the number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100.\n\nSo, the code would handle that quickly.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=2.\n\nd=1.\n\ndivisors are 1.\n\nx=1, y=2. LCM is 2.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2.\n\nWait, no, the code would compute d=1, and for g=1, x=1. y=2. LCM is 2.\n\nSo, k=0.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=3.\n\nd=1.\n\ng=1, x=2. y=3. LCM 6.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nBut what if a=1, b=4.\n\nd=3.\n\ndivisors: 1,3.\n\ng=3: x=3. y=6. LCM=6.\n\ng=1: x=1. y=4. LCM=4.\n\nSo, the minimal is 4, achieved when g=1. So k=0.\n\nBut wait, x=1 is a +k → k=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly chooses g=1.\n\nAnother example: a=1, b=5.\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,4.\n\ng=4: x=4. y=8. LCM=8.\n\ng=2: x=2. y=6. LCM(2,6)=6.\n\ng=1: x=1. y=5. LCM=5.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 5, achieved when g=1, x=1.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nBut wait, is there a better k? Let's see.\n\nk=0: x=1, y=5. LCM=5.\n\nk=1: x=2, y=6. LCM=6.\n\nk=2: x=3, y=7. LCM=21.\n\nk=3: x=4, y=8. LCM=8.\n\nk=4: x=5, y=9. LCM=45.\n\nSo yes, k=0 is the best.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=12.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=2: x=10. y=12. LCM=60/(gcd(10,12)=2) → 60/2=30.\n\ng=1: x=10. y=12. same as above.\n\nSo, k=0.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",

This means we can focus on finding two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( x = a + k \\) and \\( y = b + k \\) with \\( y = x + d \\).\n\n2. **Divisors Consideration**: To minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). The optimal values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) occur when \\( x \\) is a multiple of a divisor of \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute \\( d \\) as the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - If \\( d \\) is zero, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, so \\( k = 0 \\) is the answer.\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each valid pair \\( (x, y) \\) and track the minimum LCM along with the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Efficiency**: Generating all divisors of \\( d \\) is efficient because the number of divisors grows logarithmically with respect to \\( d \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    if d == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    best_x = None\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        x = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = x - a\n            best_x = x\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if x < best_x:\n                best_k = x - a\n                best_x = x\n                \n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Compute Difference**: Calculate the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Divisors Calculation**: Generate all divisors of \\( d \\) to consider potential multiples for \\( x \\).\n- **Evaluate Each Divisor**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\). Calculate the corresponding \\( y \\) and the LCM.\n- **Track Minimum LCM**: Keep track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \\( k \\). In case of ties, the smallest \\( x \\) (and thus \\( k \\)) is chosen.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, leading to an optimal solution.",
