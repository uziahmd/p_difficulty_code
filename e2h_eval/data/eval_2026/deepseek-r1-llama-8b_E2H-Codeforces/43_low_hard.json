He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way by three friends appending certain characters. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe problem says that A starts with some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and then C appends 'c's. But C has to append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string after B's addition. Also, the order must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, any other arrangement would make it invalid.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input string and count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. But I also need to ensure the order is correct. So the string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's. If any part of this is violated, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-empty and follows the order a's -> b's -> c's.\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n3. Ensure that there is at least one a and one b (since B appends some 'b's after A's initial string which already had some a's).\n4. The count of c's must equal the count of a's or the count of b's. It could be equal to both, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that since C appends some number of 'c's, the count must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So the count of c's is either equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo first, let's structure the approach.\n\nStep 1: Check the order.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and make sure that all a's come first, then b's, then c's.\n\nHow? We can find the first occurrence of 'b' after the initial a's, and from there on, only allow 'b's until the first 'c'. Then, after the 'c's start, all must be 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into segments of a's, b's, c's. Each segment must consist of the same character, and they must appear in order.\n\nSo for example, the string 'aaabccc' is valid because it's a's followed by b's followed by c's. The string 'aabc' is not because after the first a, we have another a, then b, then c. Wait no, wait 'aabc' is a's, then b's, then c's. So why in the sample input, the third example 'aabc' is considered YES?\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input, the third example is 'aabc', which is 'aa', 'b', 'c'. So that's a's, then b's, then c's. So the order is correct. So the output is YES because the count of c's is equal to the count of b's.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third case is 'aabc' which is 'a','a','b','c'. So the counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. So c_count is 1, which equals b_count (1). So it's valid.\n\nBut what about a string like 'abac'? That's a's, then b, then a again. So the order is broken. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check the order. How to do that?\n\nOne approach is to find the indices where each new character type starts.\n\nFor example, the string must start with one or more a's, then one or more b's, then one or more c's.\n\nSo the string can be divided into three parts:\n\n- Part 1: all a's\n- Part 2: all b's\n- Part 3: all c's\n\nIf the string doesn't follow this, it's invalid.\n\nSo how can I implement this?\n\nI can loop through the string and track the current allowed characters.\n\nStart with expecting 'a's.\n\nOnce a 'b' is encountered, switch to expecting 'b's.\n\nThen, when a 'c' is encountered, switch to expecting 'c's.\n\nIf any character is encountered that is not the expected one, the string is invalid.\n\nSo for example, in 'aaabccc', the process is:\n\nExpecting a: first three are a's → switch to expecting b.\n\nNext is b, so okay. Then more b's → still expecting b. Then the next is c → switch to expecting c.\n\nAll remaining are c's → valid.\n\nIn 'aabc':\n\nIndices 0:a, 1:a, 2:b,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by three friends appending specific characters in a particular order. The string must start with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and end with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of either 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order Validity**: Ensure the string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with one or more 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Verify that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is empty\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncurrent_char = None\nfor c in s:\n    if current_char is None:\n        if c != 'a':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n        current_char = 'a'\n    elif current_char == 'a':\n        if c == 'b':\n            current_char = 'b'\n        elif c == 'a':\n            continue  # still 'a's allowed\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif current_char == 'b':\n        if c == 'c':\n            current_char = 'c'\n        elif c == 'b':\n            continue  # still 'b's allowed\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif current_char == 'c':\n        if c != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\na_count = s.count('a')\nb_count = s.count('b')\nc_count = s.count('c')\n\nif a_count < 1 or b_count < 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif c_count != a_count and c_count != b_count:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code iterates through each character in the string to ensure it follows the sequence 'a's -> 'b's -> 'c's. If any character breaks this order, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: After validating the order, the code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Validation of Counts**: It checks if the number of 'c's matches the number of 'a's or 'b's. If either condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures the string meets all the required conditions using a single pass for order validation and additional counts for verification.",
