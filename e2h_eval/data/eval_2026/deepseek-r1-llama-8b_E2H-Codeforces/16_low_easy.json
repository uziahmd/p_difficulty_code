Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks, and moving from one block to another requires crossing a border of non-zero length. The task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. So each step is moving across a single road's boundary. But wait, how do we model this? Maybe think in terms of regions divided by lines.\n\nWait, the key insight here might be that each time you cross a road, you switch the side of that road. So for each road, the home and university are either on the same side or opposite sides. If they're on the same side, then that road doesn't contribute to the path. But if they are on opposite sides, then you have to cross that road once.\n\nSo the minimal number of steps would be the count of roads where home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\nYes! Because each such road must be crossed exactly once, and the order of crossing doesn't matter because each step can only traverse a single road's boundary. So the total steps required is equal to the number of such roads.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each road, determine whether home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBut how do we check if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nFor a given line ax + by + c = 0, substitute the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) into the equation.\n\nCompute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\nCompute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nIf f1 and f2 have the same sign, then both points are on the same side of the line. If they have opposite signs, they are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, what if f1 or f2 is zero? Oh, but the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road, so f1 and f2 can't be zero.\n\nSo for each road, compute f1 and f2. If f1 * f2 > 0, same side; else, opposite.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read home and university coordinates.\n- Read each of the n roads.\n- For each road, compute f1 and f2.\n- Check if f1 and f2 have different signs (f1 * f2 < 0).\n- Count the number of such roads.\n- Output that count as the minimal steps.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0\nCompute f1 for home: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0\nf2 for uni: 0*(-1)+1*(-1) +0= -1 <0\nSo different signs → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 1x + 0y + 0=0 → x=0\nf1=1*1+0*1+0=1>0\nf2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 <0\nDifferent signs → count +=1. Total 2 steps. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example in the input:\nWait, the user provided two inputs, perhaps it was a typo. But regardless, the logic holds.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead x1,y1\nRead x2,y2\nRead n\ncount = 0\nfor each of n lines:\n    a, b, c = map(int, line.split())\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's all.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nWhat about the case when a=0 and b=0? No, the input constraints say that ai and bi are not both zero.\n\nAlso, since home and university are not on any road, f1 and f2 are never zero.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code is simple. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nWait, the input format is a bit unclear. The first line is x1 y1, second x2 y2, third n, then n lines. So read them accordingly.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead lines from standard input. But sometimes, when reading via input(), it's line by line. But",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step involves crossing a road defined by an infinite line equation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads are defined by linear equations that divide the plane into regions (blocks). Moving from one block to another requires crossing a road's boundary. The key insight is that each road can be crossed exactly once if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, crossing that road is necessary.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the values of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs, indicating that the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n   - Count the number of such roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n4. **Complexity**: The solution efficiently processes each road in constant time, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Calculate the function value for home and university\n    f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Processing Each Road**: For each road, compute the function values at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the road, necessitating a crossing.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The total number of such roads where a crossing is needed is counted and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of steps required to travel from home to university by crossing the necessary roads.",
