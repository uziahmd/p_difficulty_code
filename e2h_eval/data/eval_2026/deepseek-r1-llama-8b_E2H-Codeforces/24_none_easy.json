She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

The `solve` function takes four parameters: the number of tabs `n`, the current position of the cursor `pos`, and the start and end indices of the segment `l` and `r`. It returns the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`.\n\nThe logic of the `solve` function is as follows:\n\n* If all tabs outside the segment are to be closed, return the total number of tabs minus the number of tabs in the segment.\n* If the cursor is to the left of the start of the segment, return the maximum of the position minus one and zero.\n* If the cursor is to the right of the end of the segment, return the total number of tabs minus the end index of the segment.\n* Otherwise, return the maximum of twice the position minus the start index minus one, the position minus one, and the total number of tabs minus the end index of the segment.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large inputs.",
