            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and she needs to find the minimum number of extra tiles she must draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu. A mentsu is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is 1 in suit s. The output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each possible scenario. Wait, no—wait, the problem says to output the minimal number of extra tiles needed such that she can have a mentsu. So it's not per tile but overall. Oh wait, no, looking back: the output is three integers? Or is it one integer? Wait, the sample input shows an output of three numbers. Wait, in the sample input, the output is ['0', '0', '1'], which is three numbers. Oh right, because for each of the three scenarios (each initial tile set), we compute the minimal draws required.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three tiles, each being a string. But the output is a single line with three numbers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three possible cases? Or perhaps, the problem is to consider all possible ways to add tiles and find the minimal total for any of them. Or maybe, for each tile in the input, evaluate what's the minimal draws needed if that tile were part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three strings, which are the current tiles. The output is a single integer—the minimal number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can win. So the output is a single integer, not three. But in the sample input, the output is three numbers. Wait, no, in the sample input, the output is shown as ['0', '0', '1'], but perhaps that's a formatting issue. Wait, the problem says, \"print a single integer\"—so the output is one integer. But in the sample, the output is presented as three numbers. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nProblem statement says: \"Print a single integer—the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\nSo the output is a single integer. So why does the sample show three numbers? Oh, maybe that's a typo in the description. Or perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nWait, that's an array of three strings. But the problem says to print a single integer. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement, and the sample is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the output is three separate lines, each being the minimal draws for each possible mentsu formed by adding tiles. Or perhaps the output is three values, each for each of the three initial tiles, indicating the minimal draws needed if that tile is used in a mentsu.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal draws for each of the three possible mentsu possibilities based on the initial three tiles. Like, considering each of the three tiles as the start of a potential mentsu.\n\nNo, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the minimal draws needed when considering each of the three initial tiles as part of a mentsu. But that might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial three tiles can form a mentsu in some way, and we need to find the minimal draws required. But the output is a single integer, the minimal across all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three possible mentsu options, and then take the minimum of those. Or perhaps the output is the minimal for each possible case where a mentsu is formed.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem Statement:\nShe has three tiles in her hand. She can draw any number of tiles, including duplicates. She needs to have at least one mentsu. Find the minimal number of extra tiles she needs to draw.\n\nAh, so the output is a single integer—the minimal number of draws required so that after drawing, she has at least one mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows an output of three numbers. That suggests that perhaps the problem is to output three separate values, one for each of the three possible mentsu options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the sample explanation.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Generate All Possible Combinations**: For each tile in Tokitsukaze's hand, consider it as the start of a potential sequence and check if adding the necessary tiles can form a valid sequence.\n3. **Check for Triplet**: If any three tiles are the same, that forms a triplet.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Draws**: For each possible way to form a mentsu, calculate how many additional tiles are needed and keep track of the minimum number required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    tiles = input[:3]\n    min_draws = 10**9\n\n    # Helper function to check if a given list has a mentsu\n    def has_mentsu(tiles):\n        count = {}\n        for t in tiles:\n            count[t] = count.get(t, 0) + 1\n        for v in count.values():\n            if v >= 3:\n                return True\n        # Check for sequences\n        suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n        for suit in suits:\n            nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit])\n            for i in range(len(nums) - 2):\n                if nums[i+2] - nums[i] == 2:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    # Now, compute for all possible mentsu possibilities\n    current_tiles = tiles.copy()\n    for i in range(3):\n        # Try to form a mentsu using the ith tile as part of it\n        temp = current_tiles.copy()\n        # Remove the ith tile and see what's needed\n        temp.pop(i)\n        # Now, add as many tiles as needed to form a mentsu\n        # Try all possibilities for the missing tile\n        # Case 1: try to form a triplet\n        tile = current_tiles[i]\n        count = temp.count(tile)\n        if count < 2:\n            # Need two more of this tile\n            total = 2 - count\n        else:\n            total = 0\n        if total == 0:\n            if has_mentsu(temp + [tile]):\n                min_draws = max(min_draws, 0)\n            continue\n        # Case 2: try to form a sequence\n        # Extract the suit and number\n        suit = tile[1]\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        new_tiles = []\n        for t in temp:\n            if t[1] != suit:\n                continue\n            new_num = int(t[0])\n            new_tiles.append(new_num)\n        # Sort the numbers\n        new_tiles.sort()\n        # Find the longest possible sequence\n        max_len = 0\n        for j in range(len(new_tiles)):\n            if new_tiles[j] <= num:\n                current_len = 1\n                k = j + 1\n                while k < len(new_tiles) and new_tiles[k] == num + current_len:\n                    current_len += 1\n                    k += 1\n                if current_len > max_len:\n                    max_len = current_len\n            # Check if a sequence ending at num + 2 is possible\n            if new_tiles[j] == num - 2 and j > 0:\n                current_len = 1\n                k = j - 1\n                while k >= 0 and new_tiles[k] == num - current_len:\n                    current_len += 1\n                    k -= 1\n                if current_len > max_len:\n                    max_len = current_len\n        if max_len >= 3:\n            needed = 3 - max_len\n            total = needed\n        else:\n            total = float('inf')\n        # The minimal between the two cases\n        total = min(total, 2 - count)\n        # Update the minimal draws\n        if total < min_draws:\n            min_draws = total\n        # Also check the original tiles without adding anything\n        if has_mentsu(current_tiles):\n            min_draws = 0\n    print(min_draws)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves checking each tile as a potential starting point for forming a triplet or a sequence. For each tile, we evaluate the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a triplet or a sequence. We then determine the overall minimum number of draws required across all possibilities to form a valid mentsu. This approach ensures we efficiently find the optimal solution by considering all potential ways to form a mentsu.",
