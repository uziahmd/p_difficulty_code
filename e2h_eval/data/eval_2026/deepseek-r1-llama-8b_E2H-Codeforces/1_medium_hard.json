    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings, and each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outermost edge, the second is two cells in, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring? For each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4 for the next one. Because for each ring, we lose a cell on each side, so two cells on each dimension (left and right, top and bottom) which is 2*2=4 subtracted each time.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle, but making sure that if the rectangle becomes too small, it doesn't contribute anything.\n\nWait, wait. The perimeter formula: for a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells along the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4. Because each corner is counted twice if I just add W and H. So subtracting 4 corrects that.\n\nBut wait, for a 3x3 grid, the perimeter is 8. Let me check: 3+3 gives 6, multiplied by 2 is 12, minus 4 is 8. Yep, that works.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current W is w - 4*(i-1). Similarly for H.\n\nBut wait, what if after some i, the W or H becomes less than 3? Because each ring requires at least a 3x3 rectangle to form a ring. Or does it?\n\nLooking back at the input constraints: k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). Hmm, but perhaps not. Because for example, if w is 7 and h is 9, min is 7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. But when i=2, the rectangle would be 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5, which is valid.\n\nWait, no, 3x5 is still a rectangle that forms a ring. So each ring i as long as W and H are at least 3? Or maybe even less?\n\nWait, the first ring is the outer edge, so the initial rectangle is w x h. Then for the second ring, it's (w-4) x (h-4), but only if that's possible. So for each i, we need to ensure that the current W and H are at least 1, but probably the problem ensures that the given k is such that all rings up to k are possible.\n\nSo perhaps I don't have to worry about cases where W or H drop below 1, because the input constraints make sure that k is within the allowed range.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current W_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current H_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. If either W_i < 3 or H_i < 3, then this ring contributes nothing?\n   d. Otherwise, compute the perimeter: 2*(W_i + H_i) -4\n   e. Sum all these perimeters across all i.\n\nWait, no, because the initial condition might allow for a ring even if W or H is less than 3, but actually, a ring requires a perimeter of at least 3x3.\n\nWait, let's think: the smallest possible ring is 3x3. Because a 3x3 has a perimeter of 8. If any ring's W_i or H_i is less than 3, then that ring cannot exist. So for each i, if W_i >=3 and H_i >=3, then add the perimeter; else, skip.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So perhaps for all i up to k, W_i and H_i are at least 3.\n\nWait, the input constraints say that k is <= floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). Let's see: for example, if w=3 and h=3, min is 3. (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. That's correct, as the first ring is 3x3, and the next would be (3-4)= -1, which is invalid. So in that case, the code should handle it correctly.\n\nWait, but for i=1, W=3, H=3: perimeter is 8.\n\nIf i=2, W=3-4= -1, H=3-4=-1: perimeter is zero.\n\nSo in that case, the sum is 8.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nLoop for i from 1 to k:\n\nCalculate current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nif current_w >=3 and current_h >=3:\n\nsum += 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nelse:\n\nbreak, since for higher i, current_w and current_h will be even smaller.\n\nWait, but no, because perhaps for some i, current_w is 3 and current_h is 5, but for i+1, current_w is 3-4= -1. So for i=1, it's valid, but i=2 is invalid.\n\nSo in that case, we should process i=1, then stop for i=2 onwards.\n\nSo the loop should run for each i from 1 to k, but inside the loop, check if current_w and current_h are >=3. If not, break the loop, as further rings won't contribute.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w <3 or current_h <3:\n\n        break\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nreturn total\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each ring, as long as the rectangle is valid, add its perimeter. Else, stop.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3 1\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3.\n\nperimeter = 2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. total=8.\n\nSince k=1, loop ends. Output is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n7 9 1.\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nperimeter=2*(16) -4=32-4=28. So output is 28.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7 and 9 → perimeter 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Both >=3.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(10)-4=16.\n\ni=2:5-4=1, which is <3. So only first ring counts. Total is 16.\n\nWait, but min(w,h) is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can be up to 1. So the above scenario where k=2 is invalid as per input constraints. So our code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nWe read the input as a single line, split into three integers.\n\nThen loop i from 1 to k, inclusive.\n\nIn each iteration, compute current_w and current_h.\n\nCheck if they are >=3.\n\nIf yes, compute perimeter and add to total.\n\nElse, break.\n\nFinally, print the total.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    if cw <3 or ch <3:\n\n        break\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2 →28+12=40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1:7,7 → 2*(14)-4=24.\n\ni=2:7-4=3, same for h. 2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nWhat's the expected output? It depends on the constraints, but assuming k=2 is allowed.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nTotal is 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side). The perimeter of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` is calculated as `2*(W + H) - 4`, accounting for the four corners being counted twice if we simply sum the width and height.\n\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle. If either dimension is less than 3, stop processing further rings as they cannot form a valid border.\n\n3. **Sum Perimeters**: For each valid ring, compute its perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if current_w < 3 or current_h < 3:\n        break\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Each Ring**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current width and height of the rectangle.\n- **Check Validity**: If the current width or height is less than 3, the ring cannot be formed, so we break out of the loop.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For valid rings, compute the perimeter and add it to the total count.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and checking its validity, ensuring that only valid perimeters are added to the total.",
