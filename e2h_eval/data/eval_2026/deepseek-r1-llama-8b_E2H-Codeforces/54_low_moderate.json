Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at v2 is as close as possible to a given value a. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, all the central angles are equal. So each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. That might be useful.\n\nThe problem is about finding an angle formed by three points in the polygon. Wait, but how is the angle calculated? Oh right, the angle is at one of the vertices, say v2, and the other two points v1 and v3 are on the sides connected to v2. Wait no, wait: the angle is formed by the lines v2-v1 and v2-v3, where v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the polygon. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the polygon is regular, so it's convex. So for any vertex v2, the sides connected to it are v2-v1 and v2-v3 (assuming the polygon is ordered). But when choosing three vertices, perhaps v1 and v3 can be anywhere else, not just adjacent. But wait, the way the problem is described, v1 and v3 lie on the sides connected to v2. Or does it mean that the lines from v2 to v1 and v3 form the angle, regardless of their position?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the polygon. So for a given v2, v1 must be on one side (say, the next vertex after v2) and v3 must be on the other side (the previous vertex). Or maybe not—maybe they can be any points on the two sides connected to v2. But since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices are fixed. So perhaps the maximum and minimum possible angles that can be formed by choosing any two other vertices as v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the internal angle at each vertex is known. For a regular n-gon, each internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But the angle we're looking for is not the internal angle, but the angle formed by two chords from v2 to two other vertices. So what are the possible angles that can be formed at v2?\n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to, for each vertex v2, compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting two other vertices, and find the one closest to a.\n\nBut considering all possibilities for each v2 could be time-consuming, but for n up to 105, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine the possible angles without checking every pair.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the regular polygon. Each vertex is spaced at 360/(n) degrees apart around the circle. So, the central angle between consecutive vertices is theta = 360/n.\n\nFor a given v2, the other vertices can be arranged in order. So, for example, if v2 is vertex k, then the vertices are numbered as ... k-2, k-1, k, k+1, k+2, ..., modulo n.\n\nWhen forming an angle at v2, the two other vertices (v1 and v3) must be on different sides of v2. So, for each v2, the possible angles are determined by the number of steps between v2 and v1, and v2 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be calculated based on the arcs between v2, v1, and v3. Since in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but which direction?\n\nWait, no. Because the angle at v2 is determined by the two points v1 and v3. So, the angle depends on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Let me think about how to calculate this.\n\nSuppose v2 is at some point on the circle. Then, for any two other points, v1 and v3, the angle at v2 is the angle between the two chords v2v1 and v2v3.\n\nIn a circle, the measure of the angle formed by two chords at a point is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no. Actually, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let me recall: if two points A and B are on a circle, and C is another point, then the angle ACB is half the measure of the arc AB that doesn't contain C. So, in our case, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and calculating angles efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For any vertex `v2`, the angle formed by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` can be determined using the arcs they subtend on the circumscribed circle. The inscribed angle at `v2` is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n3. **Efficient Search for Optimal Angle**: Instead of checking all possible triplets of vertices, which would be computationally expensive, we can leverage the symmetry and structure of the polygon to limit our search. For each vertex `v2`, we consider pairs of vertices symmetrically placed around `v2` to form the smallest possible angles.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each vertex `v2`, calculate the possible angles formed with pairs of vertices symmetrically placed at distances `k` and `n-k-2` steps away from `v2`, where `k` ranges from 1 to `floor((n-1)/2)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_closest_angle(n):\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triplet = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        max_step = (n - 1) // 2\n        for step in range(1, max_step + 1):\n            v1 = v2 + step\n            if v1 > n:\n                v1 -= n\n            v3 = v2 - step\n            if v3 < 1:\n                v3 += n\n            \n            # Calculate the angle at v2 formed by v1 and v3\n            arc = 2 * step * (360 / n)\n            angle = arc\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            \n            if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and (best_triplet == [] or v1 < best_triplet[0])):\n                min_diff = current_diff\n                best_triplet = [v1, v2, v3]\n        \n        # Also check the same for step beyond halfway?
