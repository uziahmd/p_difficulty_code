You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. We need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (with more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do that.\n\nHmm. So the graph is undirected, has n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. It's not necessarily connected. The task is to compute t and w, where t is the minimal edges needed, and w is the count of ways to achieve that.\n\nWait, the cycle must be simple, meaning each vertex appears at most once. So the cycle is a closed path with no repeated nodes except the starting/ending node.\n\nAnd the cycle's length must be odd and consist of more than one vertex. So the minimal possible cycle is of length 3 (triangle).\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the components of the graph. Because if the graph is disconnected, maybe each component contributes to forming such a cycle.\n\nBut wait, a cycle requires at least three vertices. So if any connected component already has a cycle, but perhaps not of odd length, we need to consider adding edges to make it an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just to find cycles in the graph; it's to find the minimal number of edges to add to create a new cycle. So perhaps the existing structure can be leveraged.\n\nLet me think about the conditions:\n\n1. For the graph, if there exists a cycle of odd length (like a triangle), then t would be zero because no edges need to be added. But wait, the original graph may not have any such cycle. So first, we need to check whether the graph already has an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because even if the graph has an odd-length cycle, it might require adding edges elsewhere. Or perhaps the question is to find the minimal edges to add to create a new cycle, regardless of existing structures.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"form a simple cycle\", which implies that the cycle can be created by adding edges. So existing cycles are not considered unless they are already present and meet the criteria.\n\nSo first, for each connected component, determine if it has a cycle that can be extended to an odd-length cycle with minimal edge additions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component needs to be analyzed to see what's the minimal way to form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but the overall graph may consist of multiple components, and we can choose any one of them to form the required cycle. So the minimal t across all components is what we need.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component, find the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle, and the number of ways to do that. Then, among all components, select the minimal t, and sum the ways across all components that contribute to that minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is to find the minimal t over the entire graph. So, for each component, we can find its own t_i and w_i. Then, the overall t is the minimum of all t_i, and the overall w is the sum of w_i for those components whose t_i equals the overall t.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find all connected components in the graph.\n\n2. For each component, determine two things:\n   a) The minimal number of edges needed to form an odd-length cycle (t_i)\n   b) The number of ways to do this (w_i)\n\n3. Among all t_i, find the smallest one as t. Sum all w_i where t_i == t.\n\nSo, the main challenge is, for each connected component, compute t_i and w_i.\n\nNow, how to compute t_i and w_i for a single component.\n\nLet me think about a connected component. What properties does it have?\n\nCase 1: The component is a tree. Then, it has no cycles. So to form a cycle, we need to add at least one edge. But since it's a tree, any added edge creates exactly one cycle. However, the cycle's length depends on the structure.\n\nIn a tree, when you add an edge between u and v, the cycle formed includes the path from u to v in the tree plus the new edge. The length is the number of edges in that path plus one.\n\nWait, the length of the cycle is the number of nodes in the path plus one? Or the number of edges plus one?\n\nNo, the cycle length is the number of edges in the cycle. So, the path from u to v has k edges, so adding the new edge creates a cycle of length k+1.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal way to create a cycle is to find the diameter (the longest path in the tree) and add an edge that connects two nodes at the ends of this path. Wait, but any added edge will create a cycle, but the length depends on the path.\n\nWait, no. Adding any edge in a tree creates a unique cycle, whose length is equal to the number of edges in the path between the two nodes plus one (since the new edge forms a loop). So the minimal cycle length is achieved when the path is as short as possible.\n\nWait, no. To get the minimal cycle, perhaps we need the shortest possible cycle. But in a tree, the minimal cycle is 3.\n\nWait, in a tree, all cycles formed by adding an edge have lengths greater than or equal to 3. So the minimal possible t_i for a tree is 1, but only if there exists a pair of nodes at distance 2, because adding an edge between them would create a triangle, which is a 3-length cycle.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: in a tree, any two nodes u and v have a unique path between them. If the path length is d (number of edges), then adding an edge between u and v creates a cycle of length d+1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf u and v are adjacent (d=1), adding the edge u-v doesn't change anything—it's already connected. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, the initial graph is a tree, so any added edge must connect two non-adjacent nodes.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal cycle length is 3, which requires that there exists a pair of nodes at distance exactly 2. Because adding an edge between them creates a triangle (cycle of 3 edges).\n\nSo, for a tree component, the minimal t_i is 1 if the component has a pair of nodes at distance 2. Otherwise, adding an edge won't form a cycle of length 3.\n\nWait, no. If the component is a tree and has a pair of nodes at distance 2, then adding the edge between them forms a cycle of length 3. So yes, t_i is 1 for such a component.\n\nBut if the component is a tree and no two nodes are at distance 2, then adding any edge won't form a cycle of length 3. So in that case, perhaps the minimal t_i is higher.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in a tree, the maximum distance between any two nodes is the diameter. Suppose the diameter is D. When you add an edge between two nodes u and v, the cycle length is (distance between u and v) + 1.\n\nSo the minimal cycle length is 3, which requires that the distance between u and v is 2.\n\nSo, if the tree has a pair of nodes at distance 2, then t_i is 1. Otherwise, the minimal cycle length is longer.\n\nWait, but wait—what if the tree has a component that's a star with 4 leaves. So each leaf is connected to the center. Then, any two leaves are at distance 2. So adding an edge between any two leaves forms a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo in that case, t_i is 1, and the number of ways is the number of such pairs.\n\nSo, for a tree, the minimal t_i is 1 if the component has at least one pair of nodes at distance 2. Otherwise, perhaps it's impossible to form a cycle of length 3, but maybe adding more edges can form a longer cycle of odd length.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the cycle must be of an odd length and consist of more than one vertex. So if the component is a tree, and adding one edge creates a cycle of length 3, that's acceptable. If adding one edge creates a cycle of length 5, that's also acceptable, but it's a larger t_i.\n\nBut since we're looking for the minimal t, we should look for the smallest possible t_i across all components.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we need to compute t_i as the minimal number of edges to add to form a cycle of odd length >=3.\n\nSo, let's consider the possibilities for a connected component:\n\nCase 1: The component is a cycle of even length.\n\nThen, if the cycle is even, we can't form an odd cycle by adding edges within it. Because adding edges would create even or possibly longer cycles.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the component is a cycle of even length. For example, a square (4 nodes). Adding an edge between two non-consecutive nodes can create a smaller cycle, but the length could vary.\n\nWait, but any cycle in the component is even. So perhaps the minimal t_i for such a component is 0 if the component itself contains an odd-length cycle. Wait, no—if the component is a cycle of even length, then it doesn't have any odd-length cycles.\n\nSo, for a connected component that is a cycle of even length, what can we do?\n\nWe can try to break the cycle and add edges to form an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but that's probably not the way. Alternatively, maybe we can add edges to the component to create an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but the component is a cycle. So adding edges would create other cycles, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be modified by adding edges to include another path that makes the cycle odd.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of bipartite graphs.\n\nBecause a cycle is bipartite if and only if it's of even length. So, for a connected component that is a cycle of even length, it's a bipartite graph.\n\nIn a bipartite graph, any cycle is even-length. So, in such a component, to form an odd-length cycle, we need to introduce an odd-length cycle.\n\nHow can that be done? Well, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, because in a bipartition (A, B), all edges go between A and B. If we add an edge within A or within B, it creates a triangle (if connected correctly), which is an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for a bipartite graph (connected), the minimal t_i is 1, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added within a partition.\n\nBut wait, adding such an edge may form a triangle only if the two nodes are connected in a certain way.\n\nWait, let's say the component is a cycle of even length. It's bipartitioned into A and B. Any edge added within A or within B will create a cycle. For example, adding an edge between u and v in A creates a cycle that goes through u, some path in the original cycle, and back via v.\n\nWait, but the length of that cycle depends on the positions of u and v in the original cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding an edge between any two nodes in the same partition will create a cycle of odd length.\n\nYes, because the path between u and v in the bipartition is of even length (as per the original cycle's evenness), adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length even + 1 = odd.\n\nSo for a bipartite connected component, the minimal t_i is 1, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition.\n\nWait, but how many such edges are possible?\n\nWell, for a bipartition (A, B), the edges we can add are those between nodes in A or between nodes in B.\n\nSo, the number of possible edges within A is |A| choose 2, similarly for B.\n\nSo the total number of ways is (C(|A|, 2) + C(|B|, 2)).\n\nBut wait, in the original graph, the bipartition is fixed. So any edge within A or B is not present in the original graph.\n\nSo the number of possible edges to add is (|A|*(|A|-1)/2) + (|B|*(|B|-1)/2).\n\nSo, for a connected bipartite component (even-length cycle), t_i is 1, and w_i is the sum of combinations of choosing two nodes in each partition.\n\nCase 2: The component is a connected, non-bipartite graph.\n\nIn this case, it already contains an odd-length cycle. So t_i is 0, and w_i is 1 because we don't need to add any edges.\n\nWait, but what if the component is a tree with an additional edge, creating a cycle. But if that cycle is of even length, then the component is bipartite.\n\nWait, no. If the component is not bipartite, then it has an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, for any connected component that is not bipartite, t_i is 0, and w_i is 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- If the component is bipartite:\n   - Check if the component is a tree (i.e., has no cycles). Because a tree is bipartite.\n      - If it's a tree and has at least one pair of nodes at distance 2 (so adding an edge between them forms a 3-length cycle), then t_i is 1, and w_i is the number of such pairs.\n      - Else, if it's a tree and no such pairs exist (meaning all pairs are at distance 1 or 3?), wait no—distance in a tree is determined by the path. So if the component is a tree, then for any pair of nodes u and v, their distance is the number of edges on the path between them.\n\n      Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's rephrase.\n\n      So for a tree (which is bipartite):\n\n      The minimal cycle length is 3 if and only if there exists at least one pair of nodes at distance 2.\n\n      Because adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length 3.\n\n      So for a tree component, the condition is whether it has any pair of nodes at distance 2.\n\n      So, for a tree component:\n\n         - Compute the minimal t_i as 1 if there exists at least one pair of nodes at distance 2. Else, t_i is 2, because you need to add two edges to form a cycle.\n\n      Wait, but how can a tree component have no pairs at distance 2?\n\n      For example, a straight line of nodes: 1-2-3-4. The distance between 1 and 3 is 2. So in that case, adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates a cycle of length 3.\n\n      Another example: a star graph with 4 leaves. Each leaf is connected to the center. So any two leaves are at distance 2. So adding an edge between any two leaves creates a cycle of length 3.\n\n      So, in a tree, it's always possible to find a pair of nodes at distance 2, except when the tree is a single edge (two nodes). In that case, adding an edge isn't possible because it's already connected.\n\n      Wait, no. For a tree that is a single edge (two nodes), adding an edge between them is prohibited because it's a loop. So in that case, the component cannot form a cycle.\n\n      So, for a tree component with two nodes (edge between them), it's impossible to form a cycle. So the minimal t_i is infinity, meaning it's not possible.\n\n      So, for a tree component, the minimal t_i is 1 if the component has at least three nodes and has at least one pair of nodes at distance 2. Else, it's impossible (t_i is not possible).\n\n      So, for a tree component:\n\n      if (number of nodes >=3) and (exists u, v where distance(u, v) == 2):\n\n          t_i = 1\n\n          w_i is the number of such pairs (u, v) where distance(u, v) == 2.\n\n      else:\n\n          if (number of nodes == 2):\n\n              impossible, so t_i is infinity, but in the problem statement, the graph may not have any way to form a cycle.\n\n          else:\n\n              perhaps for a tree with more than two nodes, but no pairs at distance 2. Is that possible?\n\n              Wait, for a tree with four nodes arranged in a straight line: 1-2-3-4.\n\n              The distances are:\n\n              1-2: 1\n\n              1-3: 2\n\n              1-4: 3\n\n              2-3:1\n\n              2-4:2\n\n              3-4:1\n\n              So, in this case, there are pairs at distance 2 (like 1-3, 2-4).\n\n              So, any tree with more than two nodes must have at least one pair at distance 2.\n\n              Because, if it's a tree, the maximum distance is the diameter, and for any node, it's connected through a unique path. So, in a tree with more than two nodes, there's always a pair of nodes at distance 2.\n\n              So, for a tree component with more than two nodes, t_i is 1.\n\n              For a tree component with two nodes, t_i is impossible.\n\n      So, summarizing:\n\n      For a connected component:\n\n      - If the component is bipartite (including trees):\n\n          - If the component is a tree and has more than two nodes:\n\n              t_i = 1\n\n              w_i = number of pairs of nodes at distance 2.\n\n          - Else (tree with two nodes):\n\n              Not possible (t_i is infinity).\n\n      - Else (the component is non-bipartite, i.e., it has an odd cycle):\n\n          t_i = 0\n\n          w_i = 1\n\n      Now, for a connected component that is a cycle of even length (bipartite):\n\n          t_i = 1\n\n          w_i = (C(A,2) + C(B,2)), where A and B are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\n      Wait, but earlier analysis said that adding any edge within a partition will create an odd cycle.\n\n      So, for a cycle of even length, which is a bipartite graph, adding any edge within A or within B will create an odd cycle.\n\n      So, the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added within A or within B.\n\n      Which is (A choose 2) + (B choose 2).\n\n      So, for a cycle component that's even, t_i is 1, and w_i is (A*(A-1)/2) + (B*(B-1)/2).\n\n      Now, for connected components that are trees with more than two nodes: t_i is 1, w_i is the number of pairs at distance 2.\n\n      But how to compute the number of such pairs?\n\n      One approach is to compute for each node, the number of nodes at distance exactly 2, and sum all these. But that would count each pair twice (u and v, and v and u), so we need to divide by 2.\n\n      Alternatively, for each edge, when you remove it, the tree is split into two subtrees. The number of pairs of nodes u and v that are at distance 2 is the sum over all edges of (size of subtree A) * (size of subtree B). Because any u in A and v in B are connected via this edge, and their distance is 2.\n\n      Wait, that's an interesting approach.\n\n      For each edge e in the tree, when removed, the tree is split into two subtrees. Let’s denote the sizes of these two subtrees as s1 and s2. Then, for each such edge, the number of pairs of nodes (u, v) where u is in s1, v is in s2, and the path from u to v goes through e is s1 * s2.\n\n      But in a tree, the distance between u and v is exactly the number of edges on the path.\n\n      So for any edge e, the number of pairs of nodes at distance 2 is s1 * s2.\n\n      So, the total number of pairs is the sum over all edges of s1 * s2.\n\n      So, for a tree component, the number of such pairs is the sum of s1*s2 for each edge, where s1 and s2 are the sizes of the two subtrees formed by removing that edge.\n\n      This seems manageable.\n\n      So, the steps for each connected component:\n\n      1. Determine if the component is bipartite.\n\n         - How? We can perform a BFS-based bipartition check. If during BFS, we find a conflict in coloring, the graph is not bipartite.\n\n      2. If the component is not bipartite:\n\n          - t_i = 0, w_i = 1.\n\n      3. Else (the component is bipartite):\n\n          a. If the component is a tree:\n\n              - Compute the number of pairs at distance 2 using the edge-splitting method.\n\n              - t_i = 1, w_i = sum of s1*s2 for all edges.\n\n          b. Else (the component is a cycle of even length):\n\n              - Compute A and B as the sizes of the two partitions.\n\n              - w_i = (A choose 2) + (B choose 2) = (A*(A-1) + B*(B-1)) / 2.\n\n              - t_i = 1.\n\n      So, now, the plan is to process each connected component, compute t_i and w_i, and then collect the minimal t across all components and sum the w_i where t_i equals the minimal t.\n\n      So, let's outline the steps for the code:\n\n      1. Read n and m.\n\n      2. Build the adjacency list for the graph.\n\n      3. For each node, if not visited, perform a BFS or DFS to find the connected component.\n\n      4. For each connected component:\n\n          a. Check if it is bipartite.\n\n              - Perform BFS, assign colors to nodes. If any conflict, mark as non-bipartite.\n\n              - Also, during BFS, compute the bipartition sizes (A and B).\n\n              - For trees, the component is bipartite.\n\n          b. Based on whether it's bipartite:\n\n              i. If non-bipartite:\n\n                  - t_i = 0, w_i = 1.\n\n              ii. Else (bipartite):\n\n                  - If the component is a tree:\n\n                      - Compute the number of pairs of nodes at distance 2.\n\n                      - t_i = 1, w_i = sum_pairs.\n\n                  - Else (it's a cycle of even length):\n\n                      - t_i = 1.\n\n                      - w_i = (A*(A-1) + B*(B-1)) // 2.\n\n      5. Collect all t_i and w_i.\n\n      6. Find the minimal t among all t_i.\n\n      7. Sum all w_i where t_i == minimal t.\n\n      Now, the next step is to implement this.\n\n      So, first, how to check if a component is bipartite and compute the partitions.\n\n      Implementing Bipartition Check:\n\n      We can perform BFS and color each node, ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If any edge connects two nodes of the same color, the graph is not bipartite.\n\n      While doing this, we can track the size of each partition.\n\n      Next, for a tree component (which is bipartite), we need to compute the number of pairs of nodes at distance 2.\n\n      As discussed, for each edge in the tree, when removed, it splits the tree into two subtrees of size s1 and s2. The number of pairs at distance 2 contributed by this edge is s1 * s2.\n\n      So, for each edge in the tree, we can calculate s1 and s2 by performing a subtree size calculation.\n\n      But how to do this efficiently.\n\n      One approach is to perform a post-order traversal, calculating the size of each subtree, and for each edge, knowing which direction it's being traversed (from parent to child), we can accumulate the product of the sizes of the two resulting subtrees when the edge is removed.\n\n      So, for each edge u-v, where u is the parent of v in the traversal, when the edge is removed, the subtree under v has size s_v, and the rest of the tree (size of component - s_v) is the other part. So the contribution is s_v * (component_size - s_v).\n\n      So, during the traversal, for each edge, we can accumulate this product.\n\n      So, the steps for a tree component:\n\n      - Choose a root (say, node 1).\n\n      - Perform a post-order traversal, computing the size of each subtree.\n\n      - For each edge, which is a parent-child pair, compute s_child * (total_size - s_child).\n\n      - Sum all these to get the total number of pairs at distance 2.\n\n      That's manageable.\n\n      Now, let's think about the data structures.\n\n      The adjacency list will be a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of adjacent nodes.\n\n      For each connected component, during BFS/DFS, we'll track the color of each node.\n\n      For the bipartition check, if any edge leads to a color conflict, the component is not bipartite.\n\n      Once the component is determined to be bipartite, we proceed to handle it accordingly.\n\n      Now, for the tree component:\n\n      After confirming it's a tree (bipartite), we need to compute the sum of s1*s2 for each edge.\n\n      So, in code:\n\n      - For each connected component:\n\n          if not bipartite:\n\n              t_i = 0, w_i = 1\n\n          else:\n\n              if it's a tree:\n\n                  compute sum_pairs as described.\n\n                  t_i = 1, w_i = sum_pairs\n\n              else:\n\n                  it's a cycle of even length.\n\n                  compute A and B.\n\n                  w_i = (A*(A-1) + B*(B-1)) // 2\n\n                  t_i = 1\n\n      So, the code steps:\n\n      Read n and m.\n\n      Read the m edges, build adjacency list.\n\n      For each node from 1 to n:\n\n          if not visited:\n\n              perform BFS to find connected component.\n\n              during BFS, check if bipartite.\n\n              collect all nodes in the component.\n\n              compute the component's size.\n\n              if not bipartite:\n\n                  t_i = 0, w_i = 1\n\n              else:\n\n                  if the component is a tree:\n\n                      compute sum_pairs as sum of s1 * s2 for each edge.\n\n                      t_i = 1, w_i = sum_pairs\n\n                  else:\n\n                      compute A and B.\n\n                      t_i = 1\n\n                      w_i = (A*(A-1) + B*(B-1))//2\n\n              collect t_i and w_i.\n\n      Now, the code needs to:\n\n      - For each component, determine whether it is a tree.\n\n      How? A tree has exactly (number of nodes - 1) edges.\n\n      So, for a component with c nodes and e edges:\n\n          if e == c-1, it's a tree.\n\n      So, during the BFS, after collecting the component's nodes, count the edges in the component.\n\n      How? We can have a set of edges in the component, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, during BFS, for each node, we can track its degree in the component.\n\n      Or, perhaps, for each node in the component, the number of adjacent nodes in the component is its degree in the component. So, the sum of degrees is 2*e (since each edge is counted twice). So, the component's edge count is (sum of degrees) // 2.\n\n      So, for the component:\n\n          e = sum(degrees of nodes in component) // 2\n\n          if e == c-1:\n\n              it's a tree.\n\n          else:\n\n              it's not a tree.\n\n      So, for each component, after finding the nodes, compute e and c.\n\n      Now, for a tree component, we need to compute the sum of s1*s2 for each edge.\n\n      To compute this, we can perform a post-order traversal, keeping track of the size of each subtree.\n\n      Let's take an example:\n\n      Component is a tree with nodes 1-2-3-4.\n\n      The edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.\n\n      Let's perform a traversal from root 1.\n\n      Subtree sizes:\n\n      Node 4: size 1\n\n      Node 3: size 2 (itself + 4)\n\n      Node 2: size 3 (itself + 3 and 4)\n\n      Node 1: size 4.\n\n      Edges:\n\n      1-2: s1=1 (node 1's subtree is size 4, but when edge 1-2 is removed, the subtree is 3 nodes (2,3,4). So s1=3, s2=1.\n\n      Contribution: 3*1=3.\n\n      Edge 2-3: when removed, subtree is 2 (nodes 2,1) and 2 (nodes 3,4). Contribution 2*2=4.\n\n      Edge 3-4: when removed, subtree is 3 (nodes 3,2,1) and 1 (node4). Contribution 3*1=3.\n\n      Total sum_pairs is 3+4+3=10.\n\n      So, the number of ways is 10.\n\n      So, for the code, for a tree component, we can perform a post-order traversal, calculate the size of each subtree, and for each edge, calculate s_child * (total_size - s_child), and sum all these.\n\n      Now, implementing this.\n\n      So, the code outline is:\n\n      Read n, m.\n\n      adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n      for _ in range(m):\n\n          u, v = map(int, input().split())\n\n          adj[u].append(v)\n\n          adj[v].append(u)\n\n      visited = [False]*(n+1)\n\n      components = []\n\n      for u in range(1, n+1):\n\n          if not visited[u]:\n\n              # BFS to find component\n\n              q = deque()\n\n              q.append(u)\n\n              visited[u] = True\n\n              component_nodes = [u]\n\n              is_bipartite = True\n\n              color = [-1]*(n+1)\n\n              color[u] = 0\n\n              while q:\n\n                  current = q.popleft()\n\n                  for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n                      if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n                          visited[neighbor] = True\n\n                          color[neighbor] = 1 -

Because for a tree component, the component is not a cycle, so after determining it's a tree, I need to compute the sum_pairs as the sum of s_child*(c - s_child) for each edge.\n\n      But in the code, after checking if it's a tree, the code proceeds to compute subtree sizes via post-order.\n\n      Hmm, perhaps the code is correct, but I'm not sure about the implementation details.\n\n      Let me test the code logic against the sample input.\n\n      Sample Input:\n\n      The sample input is given as:\n\n      ['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n      So, the input is three lines, each representing a graph.\n\n      So, the graphs are:\n\n      First graph: 4 nodes, 4 edges.\n\n      Second graph: 3 nodes, 3 edges.\n\n      Third graph: 3 nodes, 0 edges.\n\n      So, processing each graph:\n\n      Graph 1: 4 nodes, edges 1-2, 1-3,4-2,4-3.\n\n      So, the component is a single connected component.\n\n      Let's see:\n\n      Nodes 1,2,3,4 are connected.\n\n      The edges form a cycle of length 4 (since 1-2, 2-4,4-3,3-1, and 1-3, 4-2). Wait, no, perhaps it's a complete graph.\n\n      Wait, the edges are 1-2,1-3,4-2,4-3. So it's a complete bipartite graph K_{2,2}, which is a cycle of length 4.\n\n      So, the component is bipartite.\n\n      Since it's a bipartition into two sets of 2 nodes each.\n\n      So, ways is (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n      So, t is 1, w is 2.\n\n      Graph 2: 3 nodes, 3 edges.\n\n      It's a triangle, which is an odd cycle.\n\n      So, the component is non-bipartite.\n\n      So, t_i is 0, w_i is 1.\n\n      Graph 3: 3 nodes, 0 edges.\n\n      So, each node is its own component.\n\n      So, each is a single node.\n\n      Wait, no. Because when m=0, each node is a component of size 1.\n\n      But in the code, for each node, if not visited, perform BFS.\n\n      So, for node 1: component is [1],",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The graph is undirected, has no loops or parallel edges, and may not be connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: We need to analyze each connected component of the graph separately. For each component, we determine if it is bipartite or not.\n2. **Bipartite Check**: A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If a component is bipartite, it cannot contain an odd-length cycle.\n3. **Tree Component Handling**: For a tree (which is a special case of a bipartite graph), we need to check if adding one edge can form a triangle (cycle of length 3). If so, the minimum edges needed (t) is 1, and we count the number of such possible edges.\n4. **Even-Length Cycle Handling**: For components that are cycles of even length, adding one edge within the same partition will create an odd-length cycle. We calculate the number of ways to do this.\n5. **Non-Bipartite Component Handling**: If a component is non-bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so no edges need to be added.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    components = []\n\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[u]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(u)\n            visited[u] = True\n            component_nodes = [u]\n            is_bipartite = True\n            color = [-1] * (n + 1)\n            color[u] = 0\n            while q:\n                current = q.popleft()\n                for neighbor in adj[current]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        color[neighbor] = 1 -
