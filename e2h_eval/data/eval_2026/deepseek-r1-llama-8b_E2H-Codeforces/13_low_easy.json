For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the input is three notes, like 'C E G' or 'C# B F'. The output depends on whether these notes form a major, minor, or neither chord.\n\nWait, the problem says that a triad is major if when ordered X, Y, Z, the distances between X-Y is 4 semitones and Y-Z is 3. For minor, it's the opposite: X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4. So my plan is to take all possible permutations of the three notes, calculate their distances in all possible orders, and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Oh right, because each note has a position in the cycle. So I should assign each note a number from 0 to 11, maybe based on their order in the list provided.\n\nLet me list out the notes in order:\n\nThe notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, the problem says after H comes C again. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Or is it? Wait, no, the standard sequence might be different. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the problem lists the notes as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. So perhaps H is followed by C. So the order is in the way they are listed.\n\nSo, for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is4, F is5, F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11. Then, after H (11) comes C (0). So the distance from H to C is 1 semitone, right? Because from H (11) to C (0), moving forward one step is +1.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is measured as the lowest to the uppermost. So for two notes, the distance is calculated by their positions in the order, wrapping around. But how?\n\nHmm, the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but only considering the positive direction. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So from C to C# is 1 semitone, C to D is 2, etc.\n\nWait, the problem says the distance between two consecutive notes is exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) * 1 semitone, but since we're dealing with integers (each step is a semitone), but in terms of how many steps apart they are.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. The notes are arranged in a circle of 12. So the distance from X to Y is the number of steps you take moving forward from X to reach Y. So for example, the distance between C (0) and E (4) is 4 steps, which is 4 semitones. The distance between E (4) and C (0) would then be 8 semitones because going the other way around is 8 steps.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is always taken from the lower to the upper. So between C and E is 4 semitones, but E to C is 8. So for the purposes of this problem, when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal number of steps moving forward. Or wait, no. The problem says the distance is taken from the lower to the upper, so for X to Y, it's (Y - X) mod 12, but that gives the forward steps. Because if X is higher than Y, then mod 12 will give a negative number, but adding 12 and taking mod again might not work.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. The distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y >= X, that's the direct steps; if Y < X, it's 12 - (X - Y). Because moving from X to Y in the circular manner, the distance is the minimum number of steps you can take to go from X to Y in the positive direction.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the distance is defined as the number of semitones when moving from the lower note to the higher one. So for example, E to C is 8 semitones,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The triad consists of exactly three notes, and the classification is based on the distances between these notes in a specific order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is represented by its position in a 12-note cycle. The notes are ordered as follows: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones when moving forward from the lower note to the higher note. This is done using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the note cycle.\n3. **Triad Classification**:\n   - **Major Triad**: The distance between the first and second note is 4 semitones, and between the second and third note is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Triad**: The distance between the first and second note is 3 semitones, and between the second and third note is 4 semitones.\n4. **Permutation Check**: We need to check all permutations of the three notes to determine if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input as a list of strings\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Assign each note a numerical value based on their position in the 12-note scale\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_values = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Convert each note to its numerical value\nnums = [note_values[note] for note in notes]\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(nums):\n    # Calculate the distances between consecutive notes\n    d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n    d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\n# If none of the permutations satisfy major or minor, it's strange\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of strings, each representing a note.\n2. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into its corresponding numerical value based on its position in the 12-note scale.\n3. **Permutations**: All permutations of the three numerical values are generated to check every possible ordering of the notes.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the note cycle.\n5. **Classification**: The permutation is classified as major, minor, or strange based on the calculated distances. If a valid major or minor triad is found, the result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after all permutations are checked, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are considered, and the correct classification is determined efficiently.",
