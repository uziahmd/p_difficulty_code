On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the resulting array.\n\nHmm. So the task is to find the best interval to reverse such that after reversing, the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nLet me think about what's required here. For each possible interval [l, r], I need to reverse that part of the array and compute the LNDS of the new array. Then, among all these possibilities, I pick the maximum.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So the number of possible intervals is O(n^2), which is 4 million when n=2000. That's manageable because for each interval, I can process it in O(n) time, but if I do that, 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations—way too much. That won't work.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but the original array consists of only 1s and 2s. Oh right, that's given in the problem statement. So the elements are either 1 or 2.\n\nThis is a crucial point. Because the elements are small, maybe we can find a way to model the problem more efficiently.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS in a binary array (only 1s and 2s) is equivalent to finding the longest run where the 1s come before 2s, but since they can be interleaved, it's about the maximum count of 1s up to a certain point followed by 2s.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the LNDS can be found using a simple algorithm. For any binary array, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of \"peaks\" (where a peak is a 2 followed by a 1). Or maybe it's better to model it as the maximum number of 1s before any 2 plus the number of 2s after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS can be computed in O(n) time for each array.\n\nYes, for a binary array, the LNDS can be found in linear time. The standard approach is to iterate through the array and keep track of the current length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. For each element:\n\n- If the element is 1, it can be added to the current LNDS.\n- If it's 2, then the current LNDS is reset to 2, but perhaps there's a way to merge it with previous counts.\n\nWait, maybe another way: the maximum possible LNDS for a binary array is simply the maximum between the count of 1s up to some point and the count of 2s after that point, summed together. Alternatively, the LNDS is the maximum of (number of 1s up to i + number of 2s from j onwards) for all i < j.\n\nNo, that's not exactly correct. Because within the 1s and 2s, their order matters. For example, 1,1,2,2 has LNDS 4. But 1,2,1,2 has LNDS 3.\n\nWait, but for the standard problem of LNDS in a binary array, the optimal solution can be computed by keeping two variables: one for the longest subsequence ending with a 1, and another ending with a 2. When you see a 1, it can only be added to sequences that ended with 1 or 2, whichever is longer. Similarly for a 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For each position, let's say dp[i][0] is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i with a 1, and dp[i][1] is the same for 2.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\n- If a[i] is 1, then dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + 1.\n- If a[i] is 2, then dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + 1.\n\nThe maximum of all dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] is the LNDS of the entire array.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because the subsequence can consist of multiple 1s followed by 2s, but it's non-decreasing. So the DP approach would correctly capture that.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each element, the DP state transitions are straightforward.\n\nNow, considering that, the problem reduces to, for each possible interval [l, r], reverse the subarray, and compute the LNDS of the modified array. Then find the maximum over all such possibilities.\n\nBut with n=2000, trying all possible [l, r] is O(n^2) = 4e6, and for each such case, computing the LNDS is O(n) time. So 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: instead of checking every possible [l, r], perhaps find the best possible reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n\nWhat's the effect of reversing a subarray on the LNDS? Reversing a subarray may change the order of certain elements, potentially allowing for longer runs of 1s or 2s.\n\nWait, but the reversed subarray could be anything. So perhaps the optimal reversal is one that flips a segment of 1s into 2s or vice versa, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS can be found by considering all possible possible reversed segments and how they affect the global structure.\n\nAnother thought: the LNDS for the modified array depends on the arrangement of 1s and 2s. Since the elements are binary, maybe the optimal reversal will turn a certain part of the array into a run of 1s or 2s, thereby increasing the overall LNDS.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial array. What's the current LNDS?\n\nWe can compute it without any reversal. Maybe the best reversal could only improve it.\n\nWait, but sometimes reversing could actually decrease it. So we have to consider all possibilities.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible l, find the best r >= l such that reversing [l, r] gives the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nBut even that is O(n^2), which is 4e6 for n=2000.\n\nWait, but each computation of the LNDS can be done in O(1) time if we precompute some structures.\n\nWait, perhaps precompute for all possible l and r, what the LNDS would be if the subarray l..r is reversed. But even that seems challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: realize that the LNDS can be modeled in terms of the positions of 2s. Because a non-decreasing sequence is a series of 1s followed by 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is determined by the earliest possible 2s and the latest possible 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s before a certain point plus the number of 2s after that point, across all possible points.\n\nWait, let's formalize that. Let's imagine that in the array, the maximum LNDS is determined by the first occurrence of a 2, then all subsequent 2s can be appended. Or perhaps it's the maximum of the number of 1s up to position i plus the number of 2s from position j onwards, for j > i.\n\nWait, no. Because the 1s and 2s can interleave, but the LNDS is the longest non-decreasing sequence, which can be formed by taking all 1s up to a point and then all 2s beyond that point.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. For example, consider the array 1,2,1,2. The LNDS is 3 (1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.), but the maximum number of 1s before any point plus 2s after is 2+2=4, which is larger than the actual LNDS. So that approach would overcount.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way. Maybe the maximum LNDS can be found by looking for the point where the transition from 1 to 2 occurs as early as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum of the count of 1s up to position i plus the count of 2s from position i onwards. Or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\nInitialize a variable current_ones and current_twos. As we traverse the array, for each element:\n\n- If it's 1, increment current_ones.\n- Else, set current_twos to max(current_twos + 1, current_ones + 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a way to compute the LNDS quickly.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the array is binary, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS can be found by tracking the maximum number of 1s up to any point, and then the number of 2s after that.\n\nWait, that's probably the way. Let's precompute for each position i, the number of 1s up to and including i, and for each position j, the number of 2s from j onwards.\n\nThen, for each i < j, the sum of the 1s up to i and 2s from j is a candidate for the LNDS. The maximum of all such sums would be the LNDS.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: [1,2,1,2]\n\nFor each i, count_ones[i] is:\n\ni=0:1\n\ni=1:1 (since a[1]=2)\n\ni=2:2 (a[2]=1)\n\ni=3:2 (a[3]=2)\n\ncount_ones array is [1,1,2,2]\n\ncount_twos[j] is the number of 2s from j onwards.\n\nj=0: 2 (positions 0 and 3 are 2?)\n\nWait, wait the array is [1,2,1,2]. Let's index from 0 to 3.\n\ncount_twos[j] for j=0: 2 (elements at 1 and 3 are 2).\n\nj=1: 1 (element 1 and 3? No, j=1: elements 1,3 are 2? Wait, no. j=1 is the position where we start counting from. So for j=1, the elements are a[1], a[2], a[3]: 2,1,2. So count of 2s is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the count_twos[j] is the number of 2s from j onwards.\n\nSo for j=0, the 2s are at positions 1 and 3 → 2.\n\nj=1: 2 and 2 → 2.\n\nj=2: 1 and 2 → 1.\n\nj=3: 2 →1.\n\nSo for each i, j must be > i. So for each i, find the j>i, and take max(count_ones[i] + count_twos[j]).\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible sum of count_ones[i] + count_twos[j], for i < j.\n\nIn the sample array [1,2,1,2], the count_ones array is [1,1,2,2], and count_twos is [2,2,1,1].\n\nSo for i=0, j can be 1,2,3:\n\nj=1: 1 + 2 =3\n\nj=2:1+1=2\n\nj=3:1+1=2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 1+1=2; j=3:1+1=2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 2+1=3.\n\ni=3, no j>3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3. But the actual LNDS is 4. Hmm, that suggests that this approach isn't capturing the correct maximum.\n\nWait, what's wrong here. Because the LNDS is 4, which comes from 1,1,2,2.\n\nBut according to the approach above, the maximum sum is 3.\n\nAh, so the approach of count_ones[i] + count_twos[j] is not sufficient.\n\nBecause the 1s and 2s can be interleaved in a way that allows for a longer LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the initial idea is wrong, and I need a different method.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach.\n\nEach element can be either 1 or 2.\n\nSo for each position, we can model the DP as follows:\n\ndp[i][0] = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i with a 1.\n\ndp[i][1] = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i with a 2.\n\nAt each step, for the current element a[i]:\n\nIf a[i] is 1:\n\ndp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + 1\n\nElse (a[i] is 2):\n\ndp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + 1\n\nThe maximum of all dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] is the LNDS.\n\nThis makes sense because for a 1, it can extend the previous subsequence (regardless of whether it ended with 1 or 2), and for a 2, it can extend the previous subsequence as well.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample:\n\nSample 1: [1,2,1,2]\n\nCompute dp for each position:\n\ni=0, a=1:\n\ndp[0][0] = 1, dp[0][1]=0.\n\nmax is 1.\n\ni=1, a=2:\n\ndp[1][1] = max(1,0)+1 = 2.\n\ndp[1][0] remains 0.\n\nmax is 2.\n\ni=2, a=1:\n\ndp[2][0] = max(0,2) +1 =3.\n\ndp[2][1] remains 0.\n\nmax is 3.\n\ni=3, a=2:\n\ndp[3][1] = max(3,0) +1=4.\n\nSo the maximum is 4, which matches the sample.\n\nGood.\n\nSo this DP approach works for the sample.\n\nSo for any array, the LNDS can be computed in O(n) time.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible LNDS after reversing any interval [l, r].\n\nBut trying all intervals is O(n^2) and for each, computing the LNDS is O(n), which is 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible interval [l, r], the reversed array will have a certain pattern. Perhaps we can find for each possible [l, r], what the new array looks like, and then compute the DP for it.\n\nBut even that is O(n^2 * n) = 8e9, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is to reverse a segment where all 1s are turned into 2s, or all 2s into 1s. Because that could create longer runs.\n\nWait, but that might not always be the case. For example, in the second sample, the optimal reversal was from 3 to7, which turns the array into [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9.\n\nWait, so the key was to turn a segment of 2s into 1s, creating a long run of 1s.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut how to find which segment reversal would maximize the DP-based LNDS.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each possible l and r, the reversed subarray, and for each possible l and r, compute the maximum DP value.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) * O(n) which is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps we can find a way to represent the effect of reversing [l, r] on the DP.\n\nWait, the DP for the reversed subarray would have its own transitions, but perhaps we can find a way to model the changes.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAlternative Idea: since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversal can be achieved by reversing a segment that starts or ends with certain patterns.\n\nWait, maybe the best way is to try all possible l and r, but for each, compute the LNDS in O(1) time using some precomputed data.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the LNDS after reversing [l, r].\n\nThe LNDS depends on the order of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment.\n\nSuppose the original segment is from l to r. After reversal, the order becomes r, r-1, ..., l.\n\nSo for the reversed segment, the 1s and 2s are now in reverse order.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the LNDS can be found by considering how the reversed segment affects the overall structure.\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Precompute for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment, and the positions of the 1s and 2s in the reversed segment. Then, somehow model the impact on the DP.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find all possible intervals [l, r] where the reversed segment contributes positively to the LNDS. For example, if the reversed segment has a lot of 2s, perhaps it allows for a longer run of 2s, thus increasing the LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- The original array's LNDS.\n\n- The maximum possible after reversing a segment that turns a group of 2s into 1s, thus merging them with the preceding 1s.\n\nOr turning a group of 1s into 2s, allowing them to merge with following 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal interval is a range where all elements are 2s, and by reversing them, they become 1s, which can then be part of a longer 1-run.\n\nSimilarly, if the interval is a run of 1s, reversing them would make them 2s, which can merge with the following 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a contiguous block of 2s and reverse them, turning them into 1s, or a contiguous block of 1s and reverse them to turn into 2s.\n\nBut how to find which such block would give the maximum increase.\n\nWait, let's think about the first sample:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2].\n\nThe LNDS without reversal is 3 (1,2,2). But by reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4.\n\nSo the reversed segment was [2,1], which after reversal becomes [1,2], which adds two 1s at the beginning, allowing for a longer run.\n\nSo in this case, the reversed segment contained a 2 and a 1, and reversing them allowed the 1s to be adjacent to the existing 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is a segment that, when reversed, causes the maximum number of 1s to be in a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible l and r, we can compute how many 1s and 2s are in the reversed segment, and how they fit into the surrounding array.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem as trying all possible l and r, but find a way to compute the LNDS quickly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that the LNDS after reversal is determined by the relative positions of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment compared to the rest of the array.\n\nBut this still doesn't lead me anywhere.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible l and r, the reversed segment will have its 1s and 2s in reverse order. So the number of 1s in the reversed segment is the same as before, but their positions are swapped.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible l and r, we can precompute the number of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment, and then model the impact on the overall LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS is either the original array's LNDS or can be improved by reversing a segment that connects more 1s or 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is such that the reversed segment starts with a 1 and ends with a 2, thus allowing more 1s to precede 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the reversed segment could have a certain structure that allows for a longer run.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Try to find that the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is equal to the maximum number of 1s in any prefix plus the maximum number of 2s in any suffix, but this is just a hypothesis.\n\nWait, let me think about the second sample:\n\nInput array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nAfter reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1].\n\nThe LNDS is 9, which is 5 2s and 4 1s in a row.\n\nSo the maximum LNDS is 9.\n\nIn this case, the maximum number of 1s in the array is 6 (the first two 1s, then two 1s after the reversed segment, and the last two 1s?), but wait, in the reversed array, the 1s are from positions 0-3, and then 2s from 4-8, and then a 1 at 9. So the LNDS is 4 (from the 1s) plus 5 (from the 2s) equals 9.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum over all possible k of (number of 1s in the prefix up to some point) + (number of 2s in the suffix from some point onwards).\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the maximum is 4, which is the sum of 2 1s and 2 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum of (for all possible i < j) (number of 1s up to i) + (number of 2s from j onwards) plus any contribution from the reversed segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal can be found by trying all possible intervals [l, r], and for each, compute the maximum possible contribution from the reversed segment.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2), which is 4e6 for n=2000, which is manageable if each step is O(1).\n\nSo perhaps the solution is:\n\n1. Precompute for each possible [l, r], the reversed array's LNDS using the DP approach in O(1) time.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the reversed segment's impact can be modeled in a way that allows us to compute the new DP values quickly.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother Idea: The DP for the reversed array can be considered as the combination of the prefix before l, the reversed segment, and the suffix after r.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible [l, r], the DP can be computed by combining the DPs of the prefix, the reversed segment, and the suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each [l, r], the reversed segment's DP can be computed as follows:\n\n- The reversed segment is from l to r, so the reversed array is a[1..l-1] + reversed(a[l..r]) + a[r+1..n].\n\nThen, the overall DP for the new array can be computed as the maximum between:\n\n- The prefix up to l-1.\n\n- The suffix from r+1.\n\n- Some combined part that includes the reversed segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each [l, r], the maximum LNDS is the maximum of:\n\na) The LNDS of the prefix up to l-1.\n\nb) The LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\nc) The LNDS of the combination of the prefix, reversed segment, and suffix.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the DP for the reversed segment is independent of the rest of the array, perhaps for each [l, r], the maximum LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- The DP of the prefix up to l-1.\n\n- The DP of the reversed segment alone.\n\n- The DP of the suffix from r+1.\n\n- The combination of the reversed segment with the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] is the sum of the maximum LNDS of the prefix, the reversed segment, and the suffix. But that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversal is the maximum between:\n\n- The LNDS of the entire array without reversal.\n\n- The maximum LNDS of the reversed segment plus the maximum LNDS of the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to accept that for n=2000, O(n^2) is manageable, but for each [l, r], compute the LNDS in O(n) time. But 2000^2 is 4 million, multiplied by 2000 is 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo I need to find a way to compute the LNDS for all possible reversed segments efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea: The LNDS is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s. Reversing a segment can only change the order of certain elements. Perhaps for each possible [l, r], the effect on the LNDS can be determined by considering the 1s and 2s in the reversed segment.\n\nWait, perhaps for each [l, r], the reversed segment's contribution can be computed as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of 1s in the original segment.\n\n- Let y be the number of 2s in the original segment.\n\nAfter reversal, the segment has x 2s and y 1s.\n\nNow, the LNDS of the entire array depends on how these x 2s and y 1s fit into the rest of the array.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Precompute for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment, and also for each position i in [l, r], whether the element is 1 or 2.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversing [l, r] can be computed by considering the reversed segment as a separate entity, and then combining it with the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- The LNDS of the prefix up to l-1.\n\n- The LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\n- The LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n- The LNDS formed by the prefix, the reversed segment, and the suffix.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a way to model the reversed segment's impact on the overall LNDS in a way that can be computed quickly.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each [l, r], the reversed segment's DP can be computed in O(1) time, assuming that we precompute certain prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the reversed segment's LNDS can be determined by the count of 1s and 2s, but I don't think that's sufficient.\n\nWait, let's think about the reversed segment. Suppose the original segment has m 1s and k 2s. After reversal, it has m 2s and k 1s.\n\nThe LNDS of the entire array could be the maximum of:\n\na) The LNDS of the entire array without reversal.\n\nb) The LNDS of the prefix up to l-1 plus the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nc) The LNDS of the reversed segment plus the LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\nd) The LNDS of the prefix, the reversed segment, and the suffix, which would require knowing how the 1s and 2s in the prefix and suffix interact with the reversed segment.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the sum of the maximum 1s in the prefix, the maximum 2s in the suffix, plus the maximum 1s in the reversed segment, but this is vague.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a way to represent the problem differently.\n\nWait, another Idea: The LNDS after reversing [l, r] can be represented as the maximum of:\n\n- The maximum LNDS of the entire array.\n\n- The maximum LNDS of the prefix up to l-1 plus the maximum LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n- The maximum LNDS of the reversed segment plus the maximum LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\n- The maximum LNDS formed by combining the prefix, reversed segment, and suffix.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem is about binary arrays, perhaps the maximum LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s, but their arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the current LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in the entire array plus the maximum number of 2s in the entire array, but that's not correct because you can't have both.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum possible is min(number of 1s, number of 2s) + 1 if they are arranged properly. But not sure.\n\nWait, the maximum possible LNDS is min(total_ones, total_twos) +1 if there exists a way to arrange all 1s before 2s. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nBut the problem is, after reversal, can we arrange all 1s before 2s?\n\nBut this is possible only if the reversed segment allows for that.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is min(total_ones, total_twos) + 1. Because after reversal, we can arrange all 1s before 2s.\n\nBut no, because in the sample input 2, the total_ones is 6, total_twos is 4. So min is 4, plus 1 is 5, but the actual maximum is 9.\n\nSo that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible [l, r], compute the maximum possible LNDS by considering the reversed segment's impact on the surrounding 1s and 2s.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's time to think of an alternative approach.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the reversed segment can be processed as a separate entity, and then merged into the prefix and suffix. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The reversed segment can be treated as a single block. The LNDS could be the maximum of:\n\n- The LNDS of the prefix up to l-1.\n\n- The LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\n- The LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n- The LNDS formed by the prefix, the reversed segment, and the suffix.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, for each [l, r], the reversed segment is a certain sequence of 1s and 2s. The LNDS could be the sum of the LNDS of the prefix, the LNDS of the reversed segment, and the LNDS of the suffix, but that's not necessarily the case because the prefix and suffix may have overlapping contributions.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum of the following four possibilities for each [l, r]:\n\n1. The maximum LNDS of the entire array without any reversal.\n\n2. The maximum LNDS of the prefix up to l-1 plus the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n3. The LNDS of the reversed segment plus the maximum LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\n4. The maximum LNDS of the prefix up to l-1 plus the LNDS of the suffix from r+1, plus the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nWait, but this is not accurate. Because the prefix, reversed segment, and suffix may have overlapping contributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- The original LNDS.\n\n- For each possible [l, r], the maximum between:\n\n   a) The maximum LNDS of the prefix up to l-1 plus the maximum LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n   b) The maximum LNDS of the reversed segment plus the maximum LNDS of the suffix from r+1.\n\n   c) The maximum LNDS of the prefix plus the maximum LNDS of the suffix.\n\n   d) The maximum LNDS of the reversed segment plus the maximum LNDS of the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's time to think of implementing the O(n^2) approach and see if it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but for n=2000, 4 million intervals, each requiring O(n) time to compute the LNDS, that's 8e9 operations. Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second, so this would take about 80 seconds, which is way beyond the time limit.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Realize that the LNDS after reversal can't be worse than the original. So the maximum is at least the original LNDS. So perhaps we can find the best interval that improves upon the original.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible l, find the best r >= l such that the reversed segment [l, r] gives the maximum possible improvement.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, perhaps the optimal reversed segment is one that, when reversed, creates a longer run of 1s or 2s. So perhaps for each possible starting point, we can look for the longest possible run of 1s or 2s to reverse.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the reversed segment can be any [l, r], perhaps the optimal is to find a segment where the number of 1s and 2s are such that after reversal, the segment contributes to a longer run.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversed segment is a single element, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversed segment is the entire array. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or patterns.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input 2 shows that reversing a segment of 2s into 1s can create a longer run of 1s, which in turn allows for a longer LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a contiguous block of 2s and reverse them into 1s, thereby increasing the 1s' count in a contiguous block.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps the optimal reversed segment is a contiguous block of 2s.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible block of 2s, reversing it into 1s would allow for a longer LNDS.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible interval [l, r] where all elements are 2s, reverse them into 1s, and compute the LNDS.\n\n2. Also consider all intervals where all elements are 1s, reverse them into 2s, and compute the LNDS.\n\n3. Take the maximum among all these possibilities and the original LNDS.\n\nBut what if the best reversed segment is a mix of 1s and 2s?\n\nLike in the first sample, the reversed segment was [2,1], which after reversal became [1,2], allowing for a longer run of 1s.\n\nSo this approach would miss such cases.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut perhaps the majority of cases where the maximum LNDS is achieved by reversing a segment of 2s or 1s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the code can first compute the original LNDS, then for all possible blocks of 2s, reverse them to 1s, compute the LNDS, and track the maximum.\n\nSimilarly for blocks of 1s.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps for all possible segments, regardless of content, compute the LNDS after reversal and track the maximum.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2), which is 4 million steps, each needing O(n) time.\n\nWhich is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps, given time constraints, the intended solution is to try all possible [l, r], but find a way to compute the LNDS for each reversed array quickly.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps precompute for all possible [l, r], the reversed segment's impact on the DP.\n\nWait, the DP for the entire array can be broken down into three parts: the prefix up to l-1, the reversed segment, and the suffix from r+1.\n\nSo for each [l, r], the maximum LNDS can be computed as the maximum of the following:\n\n- The prefix's LNDS.\n\n- The suffix's LNDS.\n\n- The LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\n- The LNDS of the prefix, reversed segment, and suffix.\n\nBut how to compute these.\n\nWait, perhaps for each [l, r], the LNDS can be computed as the maximum of",
