She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where we need to calculate the steps required to position the cursor in such a way that closing all unwanted tabs is efficient.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which tabs are outside the range [l, r]. Those are the ones to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nSo, the initial state has all tabs open. We need to close all tabs less than l and greater than r.\n\nWait, but when you close tabs, the a and b (the min and max of unclosed tabs) change. So after each close operation, the available tabs shrink, which affects the movement options.\n\nHmm. So, the strategy would involve:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where you can close either the left or right tabs efficiently.\n2. Close those tabs.\n3. Then, maybe move to another position to close the remaining tabs.\n4. Ensure that the order of operations minimizes the total time.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if there's nothing to do. If l == 1 and r == n, then all tabs are needed, so no action is required. Similarly, if the current state is already correct, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to handle the cases where there are tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r.\n\nLet's consider the two possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: Only left tabs need to be closed (r >= n, but wait no, because l <= r and l <= r <=n. So if l ==1, then r can be up to n, but if l >1, then perhaps left tabs need to be closed.)\n\nWait no, suppose l=2 and r=4, n=6. Then tabs 1 and 5,6 are to be closed. So we have both left and right tabs to close.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into whether we need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nSo, first, determine what needs to be closed. Let's compute:\n\nleft_to_close = tabs < l\nright_to_close = tabs > r\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for each part (left and right), we need to calculate the minimal steps to close them.\n\nBut since closing one might affect the other, we need to find the optimal order.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved.\n\nEach operation is either a movement step or a close step.\n\nMovement steps take 1 second each, as does a close.\n\nSo, the total steps are the sum of movement steps and close steps.\n\nSo, for example, moving from current position to a position where you can close left or right, then closing, then moving again, etc.\n\nWait, but after a close, the available tabs change, so the next movement is constrained.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's model this as a state where we track the current position and which tabs are still open.\n\nBut with n up to 100, the state space is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider all possible orders of closing left and right, and compute the minimal steps for each order, then choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the possible orders are:\n\n1. Close left first, then close right.\n\n2. Close right first, then close left.\n\nWe can compute the steps required for each of these orders, then choose the minimal.\n\nAdditionally, there's the option of not needing to close either, but that's covered in the initial condition.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nLet's take the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst sample input: 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1,5,6.\n\nSo, in this case, both left and right need to be closed.\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nHow?\n\nCurrent position is 3.\n\nTo close left (tabs 1), she needs to be at position 2.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nNow, the available tabs are 2-6.\n\nThen, to close the right (tabs 5,6).\n\nShe is at 2 now. She needs to move to 4, then close right.\n\nMove from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1 (move) +1 (close) + 2 (moves) +1 (close) = 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother option: Close right first, then left.\n\nShe is at 3.\n\nTo close right, she needs to be at 4 or higher.\n\nWait, to close the right, she can be at any position where the right is beyond. So, to close 5,6, she can be at 4, and close right, which will close 5-6.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nNow, she's at 4, and the left needs to be closed (tabs 1). But now, after closing right, the available tabs are 2-4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, after closing right, the new a and b are determined. So, after closing right (tabs 5-6 are gone), the new a is 2, b is 4.\n\nSo, to close the left (tab 1), she needs to be at position 2.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nFrom 4, move to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 1 (move) +1 (close) + 2 (moves) +1 (close) = 5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, same result regardless of order.\n\nBut in other cases, the order may vary.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal steps are the minimal of the two possible orders.\n\nWait, but sometimes, it's impossible to close one side without moving to the other.\n\nWait, perhaps the order is determined based on which side requires more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to always close the closer side first.\n\nBut I'm not sure. So, perhaps the way to proceed is to consider both possible orders and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, let's formalize the steps required for each order.\n\nLet's define:\n\nleft_close: whether we need to close tabs to the left of l.\n\nright_close: whether we need to close tabs to the right of r.\n\nFor each of the four possibilities (none, left only, right only, both), compute the steps.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the simplest way is to precompute for both orders (left first, right first), compute the steps, and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, let's model each possible order.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each order.\n\nOrder 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Compute the movement from the initial position to the position where left can be closed.\n\n   For closing left, the cursor must be at l (since closing left from l will close all to the left, i.e., 1..l-1). Or wait, no: when you close left from position i, it closes all tabs to the left of i, i.e., [a, i-1], where a is the current leftmost open tab.\n\n   So, if you're at position i, closing left will close all tabs to the left of i, but only if they are outside [l, r].\n\n   Wait, no. After initial state, the left to close are tabs less than l.\n\n   So, when you are at position i, the left can be closed if all the tabs to the left of i are outside [l, r]. So, the left to close is everything less than l.\n\n   So, to close all left tabs, the cursor must be at l. Because if you are at l, then closing left will close all tabs before l, which are all outside the desired [l, r].\n\n   So, for left_close, the cursor needs to be at position l.\n\nSimilarly, for right_close, the cursor needs to be at r.\n\nSo, the steps for Order 1 (left then right):\n\n- Move from pos to l: steps are |pos - l|.\n\n   Then, close left: +1 step.\n\n   Now, the available tabs are l to r.\n\n   Then, move from l to r: steps are |r - l|.\n\n   Close right: +1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) +1.\n\nWait, but wait: after closing left, the available tabs are l to r. So, moving from l to r takes (r-l) steps.\n\nBut that may not be the case if during the movement, some tabs are already closed. Wait, no: in the initial steps, the movement is done before any closing. So, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r. So, when moving from l to r, the cursor can move freely between l and r.\n\nSo yes, the steps for moving from l to r is (r-l) steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, the available tabs are l to r, which are already in place.\n\nBut wait, no: after closing right, the tabs beyond r are closed. So, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nSo, after closing right, any movement is limited to l to r.\n\nSo, the movement steps after closing left are within l to r.\n\nSo, the steps for Order 1 are:\n\n|pos - l| (movement to l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (movement to r) + 1 (close right) = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, for Order 2 (right then left):\n\n- Move from pos to r: steps |pos - r|.\n\n- Close right: +1 step.\n\n- Move from r to l: steps |r - l|.\n\n- Close left: +1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait: after closing right, the available tabs are l to r. So, moving from r to l is (r - l) steps.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if l > r? No, because l <= r is given.\n\nWait, but l and r can be equal. Like in the second sample input where l=r=3. So, if l=r, then left_close is whether l >1, and right_close is whether r <n.\n\nIn that case, for order 1: moving to l (which is same as r) is zero steps. Then close left, then move to r (again, same as l), but steps are zero. Close right. So total steps would be 0 +1 + 0 +1 = 2.\n\nBut in the second sample input, the output is 1.\n\nWait, let me look at the second sample:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3.\n\nSo, l=1, r=3. So, she needs to close tabs 4,5,6.\n\nSo, in this case, right_close is true.\n\nSo, for order 1: close left then right.\n\nWait, but since l=1, she doesn't need to close left because tabs 1 is included.\n\nSo, left_close is false.\n\nSo, for order 1:\n\nMove to l=1: |3-1|=2 steps.\n\nClose left: but since l=1, closing left doesn't do anything. So, perhaps in this case, closing left is unnecessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial model.\n\nBecause if l=1, then all tabs to the left are already closed, so closing left is a no-op. So, in that case, we don't need to perform a close left operation.\n\nSimilarly, if r=n, closing right is a no-op.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the model to account for when left_close is needed.\n\nSo, back to the problem.\n\nWe have:\n\nleft_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_close_needed = (r < n)\n\nSo, for each order, we need to add the steps for closing only if needed.\n\nSo, let's re-express the steps.\n\nOrder 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- If left_close_needed: move to l, close left.\n\n- If right_close_needed: move to r, close right.\n\nBut movement steps are calculated considering the current state.\n\nWait, but after closing left, the available tabs change.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nFor each order:\n\nCompute the total steps as:\n\nsum of movements and closes, considering that after each close, the available tabs are updated.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are as follows.\n\nOrder 1: Close left, then close right.\n\nIf left_close_needed:\n\n   movement from current pos to l: steps |current_pos - l|\n\n   close left: +1\n\n   current_pos remains l.\n\nThen, if right_close_needed:\n\n   movement from l to r: steps |l - r| \n\n   close right: +1\n\n   current_pos remains r.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nSo, movement from l to r is (r-l) steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, movement is not needed.\n\nBut if right_close_needed is false, then no movement is needed.\n\nSo, the formula for Order 1 is:\n\nsteps = (if left_close_needed: |pos - l| + 1) + (if right_close_needed: (r - l) + 1).\n\nSimilarly, for Order 2: close right first, then left.\n\nsteps = (if right_close_needed: |pos - r| + 1) + (if left_close_needed: (r - l) + 1).\n\nWait, but after closing right, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nSo, moving from r to l is (r-l) steps.\n\nSo, the formula for Order 2 is:\n\nsteps = (if right_close_needed: |pos - r| + 1) + (if left_close_needed: (r - l) + 1).\n\nWait, but what about if both left and right are needed? Then, for Order 1, you have |pos-l|+1 (for left) + (r-l)+1 (for right). For Order 2, |pos - r|+1 + (r-l)+1.\n\nWait, but wait: in Order 1, after closing left, the available tabs are l to r, so moving from l to r is (r-l) steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, the available tabs are l to r, but movement is not needed because we are done.\n\nSo, the steps for both orders are as follows:\n\nOrder 1:\n\nIf left_close_needed:\n\n   move from pos to l: steps |pos - l|\n\n   close left: +1\n\nIf right_close_needed:\n\n   move from l to r: steps (r-l)\n\n   close right: +1\n\nTotal steps: |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\nBut only if both left and right are needed.\n\nWait, no. Because if only one is needed, the steps are adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, generalizing:\n\nFor Order 1:\n\nsteps_order1 = 0\n\nif left_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order1 += |pos - l|\n\n   steps_order1 += 1\n\nif right_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order1 += (r - l)\n\n   steps_order1 += 1\n\nSimilarly, for Order 2:\n\nsteps_order2 = 0\n\nif right_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order2 += |pos - r|\n\n   steps_order2 += 1\n\nif left_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order2 += (r - l)\n\n   steps_order2 += 1\n\nWait, but wait. In Order 2, after closing right, the available tabs are l to r. So, moving from r to l is (r-l) steps.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the initial position? For example, if pos is already at l, then moving is zero.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, for each order, the steps are computed as the sum of movement steps and close steps, depending on whether each close is needed.\n\nThus, the minimal steps are the minimum of steps_order1 and steps_order2.\n\nAdditionally, we can also consider other possibilities, like if one of the closes is unnecessary, but I think the above covers all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when both left and right are needed but the order is different.\n\nBut according to the formulas, the minimal is the minimal of the two orders.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine whether left_close is needed: left_close_needed = (l > 1).\n\n2. Determine whether right_close is needed: right_close_needed = (r < n).\n\n3. If neither is needed, output 0.\n\n4. Else, compute steps_order1 and steps_order2 as per the above.\n\n5. The minimal of the two is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if one of the steps_order1 or steps_order2 is not possible? For example, if after closing left, you can't move to r because some tabs are closed.\n\nNo, because after closing left, the available tabs are l to r, so movement is possible.\n\nSo, the steps are always possible.\n\nWait, but let's test the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nleft_close_needed: l>1? No, so no.\n\nright_close_needed: r<6? Yes.\n\nSo, steps_order1: since left_close is not needed, it's 0 + (r-l=2) steps + 1 (close right) => 3 steps.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 1.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my model is incorrect.\n\nWait, in sample input 2, the output is 1.\n\nSo, what's happening?\n\nIn that case, since l=1 and r=3, the tabs to the left (nothing) and to the right (4,5,6) need to be closed.\n\nSo, she can just close the right while at position 3.\n\nBecause, to close the right, she can be at 3 and close right, which will close 4,5,6.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nAt position 3, close right: 1 step.\n\nSo, why is the sample output 1.\n\nSo, according to the model, steps_order2 would be:\n\nright_close_needed: yes.\n\nSo, steps_order2 = |pos - r| (3 to 3 is 0) +1 (close right) + (if left_close_needed: ... but left is not needed).\n\nSo, steps_order2 is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to my previous model, steps_order1 would be 0 (left not needed) + (3-1=2) steps to move to r, plus 1 to close.\n\nWait, that's 3 steps, which is more than the optimal.\n\nSo, the model as described earlier is wrong.\n\nAh, I see. Because for right_close_needed, the steps are |pos - r| +1.\n\nBut in this case, pos is 3, r is 3: movement steps are 0.\n\nSo, steps_order2 is 1.\n\nSo, the initial model was correct, but I had an error in thinking about the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps_order1 is computed as:\n\nif left_close_needed: steps += |pos - l| +1.\n\nif right_close_needed: steps += |r - l| +1.\n\nBut in this case, l is 1, r is 3.\n\nAfter closing right, the steps are 0 movement and 1 close.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, when right_close_needed is true, the movement is from r to l, which is 3 to 1? No, because after closing right, the available tabs are l to r.\n\nWait, no, after closing right, the available tabs are l to r, so movement is allowed between l and r.\n\nSo, for Order 1: steps are |pos - l| (0) +1 (close left, which is not needed) + (r - l) (2) +1 (close right). But wait, since left_close is not needed, steps_order1 is |pos-l| (0) + (r-l) (2) +1 (close right).\n\nBut that's 3 steps, but the correct answer is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the model is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nI think the model assumes that you have to move from l to r after closing left, but in reality, if you don't need to close left, you can avoid that movement.\n\nSo, the model is adding unnecessary steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model it is to consider whether each close is needed, and only include the movement steps for the necessary parts.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps_order1 should be:\n\nif left_close_needed:\n\n   movement to l: |pos - l|.\n\n   close left: 1.\n\nif right_close_needed:\n\n   movement to r: |l - r| (since after closing left, you are at l).\n\n   close right: 1.\n\nSo, the movement is from l to r.\n\nBut in the sample input 2, right_close_needed is true, but left_close_needed is false.\n\nSo, movement steps are |3 -3| (0) +1.\n\nSo, steps_order2 is 0+1=1.\n\nSo, the model is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nSo, perhaps the model is correct, but I made a miscalculation.\n\nSo, let's re-examine the model.\n\nFor Order 1:\n\nsteps_order1 = 0\n\nif left_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order1 += |pos - l|\n\n   steps_order1 += 1\n\nif right_close_needed:\n\n   steps_order1 += (r - l)\n\n   steps_order1 += 1\n\nSo, in sample input 2:\n\nleft_close_needed is false, so no movement.\n\nright_close_needed is true, so steps_order1 += (3-1) +1 = 2+1=3.\n\nWait, that's 3 steps. But the sample output is 1.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the model is not correctly capturing the scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement steps.\n\nWhen you close right, you can do it from your current position.\n\nIn sample input 2, you are at 3, which is the end of the desired segment. Closing right from 3 will close tabs 4,5,6.\n\nSo, movement steps: 0, then close right: 1 step.\n\nThus, steps_order2 is 1.\n\nSo, according to the model, steps_order2 is |pos - r| (0) +1.\n\nBut according to the model, steps_order2 is:\n\nif right_close_needed: |pos - r| +1.\n\nif left_close_needed: (r-l) +1.\n\nSo, in this case, right_close_needed is true, left_close_needed is false.\n\nThus, steps_order2 is 0+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the model for steps_order1, when right_close_needed is true, it adds (r-l) steps for moving from l to r, plus 1.\n\nBut in this case, since left_close_needed is false, we don't have to go through l.\n\nSo, perhaps the model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the movement steps after closing left is not (r-l), but something else.\n\nBecause, if you don't close left, you don't move to l.\n\nSo, perhaps the model should be:\n\nFor each order:\n\nOrder 1: Close left, then right.\n\n- If left is needed: move to l, close.\n\n   movement steps: |pos - l|.\n\n   steps += 1.\n\n   Now, at l.\n\n- If right is needed: move to r, close.\n\n   movement steps: |l - r|.\n\n   steps +=1.\n\n   So, total steps: |pos-l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut if left is not needed, then you don't move to l, so movement steps are |pos - r|, but wait, that's only if you have to close right.\n\nWait, perhaps the model should be:\n\nFor Order 1:\n\nIf left is needed:\n\n   steps += |pos - l|.\n\n   steps += 1 (close left).\n\n   current_pos = l.\n\nIf right is needed:\n\n   steps += |current_pos - r|.\n\n   steps += 1 (close right).\n\nSo, for sample input 2:\n\ncurrent_pos is 3.\n\nright is needed.\n\nso, steps += |3 -3| +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the model should be:\n\nFor Order 1:\n\nstart at pos.\n\nif left is needed:\n\n   move to l, steps |pos - l|.\n\n   close, step +1.\n\ncurrent_pos is l.\n\nif right is needed:\n\n   move to r, steps |l - r|.\n\n   close, step +1.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 if both are needed.\n\nBut in sample input 2, only right is needed.\n\nSo, steps: |3-3| + (3-3) + 1 = 1.\n\nWait, no: in this case, right is needed, so after the initial position, we move 0 steps, close right: 1 step.\n\nSo, the model for order1 is:\n\nif left is needed:\n\n   steps += |pos - l|.\n\n   steps +=1.\n\ncurrent_pos = l.\n\nif right is needed:\n\n   steps += |current_pos - r|.\n\n   steps +=1.\n\nSo, for sample input 2:\n\norder1: 0 (no left) + 0 (no right, because right is needed but current_pos is 3, which is r.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is:\n\nFor each order, the movement steps are calculated based on the current position after each close.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nInitialize steps =0.\n\ncurrent_pos = pos.\n\nif order is left then right:\n\n   if left is needed:\n\n      steps += abs(current_pos - l)\n\n      current_pos = l\n\n      steps +=1\n\n   if right is needed:\n\n      steps += abs(current_pos - r)\n\n      current_pos = r\n\n      steps +=1\n\nSimilarly for order right then left.\n\nSo, for sample input 2:\n\norder1: left not needed, so steps +=0.\n\nright needed:\n\nsteps += |3-3|=0, steps +=1. So total 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, order2: right then left.\n\nIn sample input 2, right is needed, so:\n\nsteps += |3-3|=0, steps +=1.\n\nthen, since left is not needed, no further steps.\n\nTotal steps: 1.\n\nThus, the model works.\n\nSo, the correct way is to model the movement steps based on the current position after each close.\n\nSo, the steps for each order are:\n\nOrder 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\ncurrent_pos = pos\n\nif left is needed:\n\n   move to l: steps += |current_pos - l|\n\n   close: steps +=1\n\n   current_pos = l\n\nif right is needed:\n\n   move to r: steps += |current_pos - r|\n\n   close: steps +=1\n\ntotal steps = steps.\n\nSimilarly for order2: Close right first, then left.\n\ncurrent_pos = pos\n\nif right is needed:\n\n   move to r: steps += |current_pos - r|\n\n   close: steps +=1\n\n   current_pos = r\n\nif left is needed:\n\n   move to l: steps += |current_pos - l|\n\n   close: steps +=1\n\ntotal steps = steps.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nCompute left_close_needed and right_close_needed.\n\nif neither, return 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute steps_order1 and steps_order2 as per the above.\n\nreturn min(steps_order1, steps_order2).\n\nSo, let's write code for this.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_close_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_close_needed and not right_close_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # Compute order1: left then right.\n\n    order1_steps = 0\n\n    current_pos = pos\n\n    if left_close_needed:\n\n        order1_steps += abs(current_pos - l)\n\n        current_pos = l\n\n        order1_steps +=1\n\n    if right_close_needed:\n\n        order1_steps += abs(current_pos - r)\n\n        current_pos = r\n\n        order1_steps +=1\n\n    # Compute order2: right then left.\n\n    order2_steps = 0\n\n    current_pos = pos\n\n    if right_close_needed:\n\n        order2_steps += abs(current_pos - r)\n\n        current_pos = r\n\n        order2_steps +=1\n\n    if left_close_needed:\n\n        order2_steps += abs(current_pos - l)\n\n        current_pos = l\n\n        order2_steps +=1\n\n    print(min(order1_steps, order2_steps))\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input 2, the code gives order1_steps as 1 (since right is needed, and current_pos is 3, so moving 0 steps, closing 1 step). order2_steps is also 1.
