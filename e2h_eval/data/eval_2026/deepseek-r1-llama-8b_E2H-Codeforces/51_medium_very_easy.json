Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined. So basically, the count of each letter in the pile should match exactly what's needed by combining the two names.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into one string.\n2. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n3. Do the same for the pile string.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they're exactly the same, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but in Python, how do I efficiently count the characters? Oh right, I can use the collections.Counter class. That makes it easy.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the three lines from input.\n- Combine the first two lines (guest and host) into one string.\n- Check that the length of this combined string plus the third line equals twice the sum of the lengths of guest and host, but wait no—because the pile is supposed to be exactly the combination of guest and host. So the total number of letters in the pile must equal the sum of the letters in guest and host. Otherwise, it's automatically 'NO'.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because if the total letters don't match, we can immediately return 'NO'. So I should first check that len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, return 'NO' right away.\n\nBut wait, the third line is the pile. So guest and host combined will have a certain length, and the pile must have the same length. So yes, checking the lengths is the first step.\n\nThen, after that, we proceed to count the letters.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now, check the counts\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the guest or host is empty? The problem statement says that all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWhat about cases where the pile has all the required letters but in different order? But since we're using Counter, which counts each occurrence, the order doesn't matter.\n\nYes, this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting against the examples:\n\nFirst example:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined length: len(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") = let's see: SANTACLAUS is 9 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8, so total 17. Pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"—counting letters... Wait, SANTACLAUS is 9, DEDMOROZ is 8, so combined is 17 letters. Pile's length must be 17 as well.\n\nThe counts should match.\n\nSecond example:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABBONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER — wait, the sample output says 'NO' because 'P' is missing and 'L' is extra. So the length of combined guest+host is 12 + 10 = 22. Pile's length is, well, let's see the sample input for the second case:\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n['PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', ...]\n\nWait, wait no—the actual sample input is the second case where the output is 'NO' because the pile has an extra L and missing P. So when we combine guest and host, their combined length is len('PAPAINOEL')=8 + len('JOULUPUKKI')=10 =18. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' which is longer than 18, hence len check fails. Or wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait no, the second sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the second line is the host's name, the third line is the pile. So for the second test case, the guest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', and the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nWait, let's calculate the length:\n\nguest: 'PAPAINOEL' → 8 letters.\n\nhost: 'JOULUPUKKI' → 10 letters.\n\nCombined: 18 letters.\n\nPile: 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → Let's count the letters. Let me write it down: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. That's 19 letters? Or wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, J is 1, O is 2, U is 3, L is 4, N is5, A6, P7, A8, O9, I10, L11, E12, L13, U14, P15, U16, K17, K18, I19. Oh wait, that's 19 letters. So combined is 18, pile is 19. So the code will immediately say 'NO' because 18 !=19.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample output 'NO' for the second case.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra 'L' so the length is same, but counts don't match.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All letters same, like guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → 'YES'.\n\nEdge case 2: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ACBD' → 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'BC', pile is 'ABCB' → 'NO' because counts differ.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nI think this approach is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** If the total length of the combined names does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts:** If the letter counts from the combined names match those from the pile, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact permutation of letters using counters, which simplifies the comparison process.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total number of letters matches\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counts\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input consists of three lines which are read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string representing all letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Length Check:** A quick check ensures the total number of letters in the combined names matches the pile's length, avoiding unnecessary further checks if lengths differ.\n- **Counting Letters:** Using `collections.Counter`, we count each letter's occurrences in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The counts from both sources are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of letters, ensuring it works well even for the maximum input size.",
