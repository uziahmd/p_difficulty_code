Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first bar shows the percentage of a specific file being copied, and the second shows the overall progress across all files. Both are updated after each byte is copied. We need to find all the percentages (from 0 to 100) where both bars show the same number at the same time during the copying process.\n\nHmm. So for each moment in time when a byte is copied, I need to calculate both percentages and see if they match. Then collect all such percentages and output them in order.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with an example. The sample input has four cases, and the outputs vary accordingly.\n\nWait, the first test case is when n=1 and a=[6]. Since there's only one file, both progress bars always show the same value. So all 0-100 are possible? No, wait, no. Because as you copy each byte, the percentages change. But since both are based on the same file, the percentages will always be equal. So the output includes all 0-100, but looking at the sample, the first output line is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'—wait, that's seven numbers. Oh right, because the progress changes incrementally. For example, when x is 6, the percentage is 100%, but after that, the copying is done. So for each byte, the percentages are calculated.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the output is all the percentages that are shown simultaneously by both bars at any point. So for each possible percentage p (0-100), we need to check if there exists some x (number of bytes copied) where the current progress of the first file and the overall progress both equal p.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Simulate the copying process step by step.\n2. For each step, compute the current p1 (progress of file i) and p2 (overall progress).\n3. If p1 == p2, add this p to a set.\n4. After all steps, collect all such p's, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, simulating each byte could be time-consuming if the total size is large. However, the constraints say that each a_i is up to 1000, and n is up to 100. So the maximum total bytes is 100*1000=1e5. So simulating each byte is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Keep track of the total bytes copied so far (total_copied). For each file, we also track how many bytes have been copied from it (for each file i, current_copied[i]).\n- For each byte x that's copied:\n   - Increment the current_copied[i] for the corresponding file.\n   - Compute p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   - Compute p2 = floor(100 * (total_copied) / total_size)\n   - If p1 == p2, add to the result set.\n\nWait, but x is per byte. So for the first file, when x=1, p1 is (100*1)/a1, floored. Then x=2: (200/a1), etc., until x reaches a1.\n\nSo the simulation can be done in a loop, for each byte being copied. Wait, but each file may have a different size, so for each file i, we can precompute all the steps where x increases, and for each step, calculate p1 and p2.\n\nAlternatively, for each file, iterate through each byte (from 1 to a_i) and for each, compute p1 and p2 at that point, and if they are equal, add p to the set.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo here's the algorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- current_copied = [0] * n\n- total_copied = 0\n- total_size = sum(a)\n- result = empty set\n\nFor each file i in 0..n-1:\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n       current_copied[i] = x\n       total_copied += x  # wait, no. Because for the next file, x starts from 1 again. Wait no, no: the files are processed in order, and for each file, you copy all its bytes one by one. So for the first file, you have to process each byte sequentially. Then the second file, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the progress is updated after each byte. So the process is: for each file in order, copy each byte one by one, updating the progress bars after each byte.\n\nSo for the first file, you process each byte x from 1 to a[0], and after each x, calculate p1 and p2.\n\nThen, for the second file, you process each byte x from 1 to a[1], and after each x, calculate p1 and p2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncurrent_copied = [0] * n\ntotal_copied = 0\nresult = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_i = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, a_i + 1):\n        current_copied[i] = x\n        total_copied += x  # Wait no! Because the total_copied is the sum of all previous files plus the current x for this file. So in each iteration of x, it's the cumulative sum up to that point.\n\nWait, wait. For example, the first file has a_0 bytes. As each byte is copied, the total_copied is just x, because it's the first file. Then, when moving to the second file, for each x in 1..a_1, the total_copied is the sum of all a's before plus x.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as for each file i, we are processing each of its x bytes. So for each x in 1..a_i:\n\n- For file i, the current_copied[i] is x.\n- The total_copied is the sum of all current_copied[j] for j < i, plus x.\n\nSo, for each x, compute p1 and p2 as follows:\n\np1 = (x * 100) // a_i\np2 = (total_copied * 100) // total_size\n\nIf p1 == p2, add p to the result.\n\nWait, but the way to compute total_copied is not just adding x each time, because each file is processed in order.\n\nSo perhaps, for each i, the current_copied[i] is x, and the total_copied is the sum of all current_copied[j] for j from 0 to i.\n\nNo, because for each x in file i, the total_copied is the sum of all the x's from previous files plus this x.\n\nWait, no. Because for each x in file i, the total_copied is the sum of all x's from files 0 to i. But since in each iteration of x, we're processing each byte in the current file, the total_copied is actually the sum of all x's from all previous files plus the x in the current file up to this point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute for each file, the prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps an example will help.\n\nSuppose n=2, a=[3,4].\n\nProcessing file 0:\n\nx=1: current_copied[0]=1, total_copied=1.\n\nx=2: current_copied[0]=2, total_copied=2.\n\nx=3: current_copied[0]=3, total_copied=3.\n\nProcessing file 1:\n\nx=1: current_copied[1]=1, total_copied=3+1=4.\n\nx=2: current_copied[1]=2, total_copied=5.\n\nx=3: current_copied[1]=3, total_copied=6.\n\nx=4: current_copied[1]=4, total_copied=7.\n\nSo, for each x in file 0, the total_copied is the sum up to x.\n\nFor each x in file 1, the total_copied is the sum of all previous x's plus the x in file 1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe need to track the cumulative sum up to the current file.\n\nSo, for each file i, when processing x in 1..a_i:\n\ncurrent_total = sum(current_copied[:i]) + x\n\nSo, for each x, compute p1 and p2 as:\n\np1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n\np2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\nif p1 == p2, add to the result.\n\nBut calculating current_total each time could be computationally expensive if done naively. So perhaps, for each file i, keep a running sum.\n\nLike:\n\nsum_so_far = sum(current_copied[:i])\n\nthen for each x in file i:\n\ncurrent_total = sum_so_far + x\n\nSo, perhaps during processing, for each file i, we can compute sum_so_far as the sum of all current_copied[j] for j < i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncurrent_copied = [0] * n\nsum_so_far = 0\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nresult = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_i = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, a_i + 1):\n        current_copied[i] = x\n        current_total = sum_so_far + x\n        p1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n        p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n        if p1 == p2:\n            result.add(p1)\n        sum_so_far += x\n    # After processing all x in file i, update sum_so_far to include this file's contribution\n    # But wait, no. Because sum_so_far is the sum up to file i-1. For file i, during processing x, sum_so_far is added to x. But after processing all x in file i, sum_so_far should be updated to sum_so_far + sum(a_i).\n\nWait, no. Because in the next iteration, when processing file i+1, sum_so_far should be the sum of all previous files, including file i.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, sum_so_far is 0.\n\nAfter processing file i=0, sum_so_far becomes sum(a[0]).\n\nBecause during each x in file 0, sum_so_far is 0 + x, and after processing all x, sum_so_far is updated to sum(a[0]).\n\nYes, because for each x in file 0, sum_so_far was 0, then after x is processed, sum_so_far += x.\n\nSo after processing all x in file 0, sum_so_far is sum(a[0]).\n\nThen, when i=1, for each x in file 1:\n\ncurrent_total is sum_so_far (which is a[0]) + x.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the code logic is:\n\nsum_so_far starts at 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a_i = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_copied[i] = x\n\n       current_total = sum_so_far + x\n\n       p1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 == p2, add to result.\n\n       sum_so_far += x\n\nSo this way, after processing file i, sum_so_far is sum_so_far_prev + a_i.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and the list a.\n\n- Compute the total_size = sum(a).\n\n- Initialize sum_so_far = 0.\n\n- current_copied = [0]*n.\n\n- result = empty set.\n\n- Iterate over each file i:\n\n   for each x in 1..a_i:\n\n       compute current_total = sum_so_far + x\n\n       p1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 == p2, add p1 to result.\n\n       sum_so_far += x\n\n- Finally, collect all elements in result, sort them, and output each in their own line.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial state is 0,0. Because before any copying, both progress bars are 0. So at x=0 (before any copying), both are 0. So that's included.\n\nBut in the code above, do we account for that?\n\nWait, in the code, the initial sum_so_far is 0. Then for i=0, x runs from 1 to a[0]. So for the first file, x=1 is the first step. But what about the initial state before any copying?\n\nIn the problem statement, both progress bars start at 0. So that's a moment when p=0 is present. So the code as written doesn't capture that.\n\nAh, right. So the code misses the initial 0,0 state.\n\nSo to fix this, before the loop, we should add 0 to the result.\n\nBecause, before any copying, both are 0.\n\nYes. So in the code:\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nOtherwise, in the sample input where n=1, a=6, the code would miss 0 as a possible p because the initial state isn't captured.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize sum_so_far = 0.\n\n2. Add 0 to the result.\n\n3. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a_i = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_total = sum_so_far + x\n\n       p1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 == p2, add to result.\n\n       sum_so_far += x\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput is 1\\n6.\n\nSo n=1, a=[6].\n\nInitial result: {0}.\n\nThen i=0:\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_total = 0+1=1.\n\np1 = 100//6 = 16 (since 1*100//6=16).\n\np2= (1*100)//6=16.\n\nSo p=16 is added.\n\nsum_so_far becomes 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total = 1+2=3.\n\np1=200//6=33.\n\np2=3*100//6=50.\n\n33 !=50.\n\nNo addition.\n\nx=3: current_total=4, p1=50, p2= (4*100)/6=66. 50 !=66.\n\nx=4: current_total=5 → 500/6=83.333 → 83. p1=400/6=66.666→66. Not equal.\n\nx=5: current_total=6 → 600/6=100. p1=500/6=83.333→83. Not equal.\n\nx=6: current_total=6+6=12? Wait, no.\n\nWait, wait. For the first file, after x=6, current_total is sum_so_far (initially 0) + x=6 → 6.\n\np1 = 600//6=100.\n\np2 = 600//6=100.\n\nSo p=100 is added.\n\nWait, but in the sample output for the first case, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'.\n\nWait, the code as described would collect 0,16,100.\n\nBut the sample output for the first case is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWait, that suggests that my logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the progress calculation.\n\nWait, the progress bars are updated after each byte is copied.\n\nSo the initial state is 0,0.\n\nThen, after copying the first byte, the first bar is 100*1/6=16.333... → 16.\n\nThe second bar is 1/6 → 16.666... →16.\n\nSo p=16 is added.\n\nThen, after the second byte, the first bar is 200/6=33.333 →33.\n\nThe second bar is 2/6=33.333 →33. So p=33 is added.\n\nSimilarly, after third byte: 300/6=50; 3/6=50 → p=50.\n\nAfter fourth byte: 400/6=66.666 →66; 4/6=66.666 →66 → added.\n\nAfter fifth byte: 500/6=83.333 →83; 5/6=83.333 →83 → added.\n\nAfter sixth byte: 600/6=100; 6/6=100 → added.\n\nSo the result set includes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich is seven numbers.\n\nBut according to the sample input's first case, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', which is exactly these numbers.\n\nSo why in the code earlier did I get only 0,16,100?\n\nAh, because the code adds 0, and for each x in 1..6, it processes the steps and adds the p1 and p2 when they are equal.\n\nSo for each x in 1..6:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_total=0+1=1.\n\np1= (1*100)//6=16.\n\np2=(1*100)//6=16.\n\nSo 16 is added.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total=1+2=3.\n\np1=200//6=33.\n\np2=3*100//6=50.\n\n33 !=50 → not added.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait.\n\nWait, in the code, for x=2, current_total is 0+2=2? Or 1+2=3?\n\nWait, in the code, for i=0, the sum_so_far is 0 initially.\n\nFor x=1, current_total = 0 +1=1.\n\nsum_so_far +=1 → sum_so_far is 1.\n\nx=2: current_total = sum_so_far (1) +2=3.\n\np1= 200//6=33.\n\np2=3*100//6=50.\n\n33 !=50 → no addition.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after x=2 is copied, the second bar is 2/6=33.333% →33. So why in the code is p2 computed as 3*100//6=50?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in how current_total is computed.\n\nWait, in the code, current_total is sum_so_far + x.\n\nsum_so_far is the sum of all bytes processed before the current file.\n\nSo for the first file, sum_so_far starts at 0.\n\nWhen x=1, current_total = 0+1=1.\n\nAfter processing x=1, sum_so_far becomes 1.\n\nThen x=2:\n\ncurrent_total = 1 + 2 =3.\n\nWhich represents the sum of the first two bytes (but wait, no, it's the first file, so the sum is 1+2=3, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first file, the sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes processed in previous files, which is 0. Then for x=1, sum_so_far becomes 1, and x=2, sum_so_far is 1, so current_total is 1 + 2 =3.\n\nBut that's not correct, because for the first file, the sum_so_far after x=2 should be 2, not 3.\n\nWait, no. Because sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in files before the current one. For the first file, all bytes are in it. So when processing x in 1..a_i (for i=0), sum_so_far is 0. So current_total is 0 + x, which is the total bytes copied so far.\n\nWait, but after processing x=1, sum_so_far is incremented by x=1. So for x=2, sum_so_far is 1. So current_total is 1 +2=3. Which is wrong because the total bytes after x=2 is 2, not 3.\n\nWait, that's a bug.\n\nSo I think the code logic is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake.\n\nIn the code, for each x in the current file, current_total is sum_so_far +x.\n\nBut sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in previous files. So, when processing x in the current file, the current_total should be sum_so_far + x.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because sum_so_far is the sum of bytes in all previous files, and x is the current byte in this file.\n\nSo for the first file:\n\nsum_so_far starts at 0.\n\nx=1: current_total =0+1=1 → correct.\n\nsum_so_far becomes 1.\n\nx=2: current_total=1+2=3. But the total bytes after two steps is 2.\n\nWait, that's the mistake.\n\nNo, no. Because for the first file, a_i=6. So after x=2, the first file has 2 bytes copied. The sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in previous files (none) plus x (2). So current_total is 2, not 3.\n\nWait, no. Because sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in files before i=0. Since i=0 is the first file, sum_so_far is 0.\n\nSo for x=1 in i=0:\n\ncurrent_total = 0 +1=1.\n\nsum_so_far +=1 → sum_so_far is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total = sum_so_far (1) +2=3.\n\nBut that's wrong. Because the total bytes after two steps in the first file is 2, not 3.\n\nWait, no. The sum_so_far is the sum of bytes in all files before the current one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what sum_so_far represents.\n\nsum_so_far should represent the sum of bytes in all files processed before the current file i.\n\nBecause when processing file i, the sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in files 0..i-1.\n\nSo, for i=0, sum_so_far is 0.\n\nFor i=1, sum_so_far is a[0].\n\nFor i=2, sum_so_far is a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nSo, during processing x in file i, current_total is sum_so_far (bytes in previous files) + x (bytes in current file up to this point).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the first file, a[0]=6:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_total=0+1=1.\n\nsum_so_far +=1 → becomes 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total=1 +2=3.\n\nBut the actual total bytes is 2, because x is 2 for the first file.\n\nSo the code is computing current_total incorrectly as 3 instead of 2.\n\nAh, that's the bug.\n\nSo the code's logic is wrong.\n\nWhat's the correct way to compute current_total?\n\ncurrent_total should be the sum of all bytes processed so far, including the current x.\n\nSo, for each x in file i:\n\ncurrent_total = sum_so_far + x.\n\nBut sum_so_far is the sum of all previous files. So yes.\n\nWait, for the first file, when x=2, sum_so_far is 1, so current_total is 3, but the actual total is 2.\n\nThat's wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct way to compute current_total?\n\nIt's the sum of all bytes processed so far, including the current x.\n\nBut sum_so_far is the sum of all previous files.\n\nSo, current_total = sum_so_far + x.\n\nBut that's not correct because, for the first file, sum_so_far is 0, and x is 1, so current_total is 1. That's correct.\n\nBut for x=2, sum_so_far is 1, so current_total is 3, but the actual total is 2.\n\nSo something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have sum_so_far as the sum of previous files, but instead, track the sum of all files processed so far, including the current file.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum_so_far should be the sum of all bytes processed in all files before the current file. So, for file i, sum_so_far is sum of a[0] ... a[i-1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, during processing file i, the sum_so_far is the sum of a[0] to a[i-1], and x is the number of bytes processed in a[i] up to the current x.\n\nSo current_total is sum_so_far + x.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, for the first file, i=0:\n\nsum_so_far is 0.\n\nx=1: current_total=0+1=1.\n\nsum_so_far +=1 → sum_so_far becomes 1.\n\nx=2: current_total=1+2=3.\n\nWhich is incorrect, because the sum of bytes processed is 3, but in reality, the first file has only 2 bytes processed.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first file, a[0] is 6. When x=2, the current_copied[0] is 2. So the total bytes processed is 2, but sum_so_far is 1, which is the sum of all previous files (none) plus x=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after processing x=2, the sum_so_far is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nBut the sum of bytes in all files is a[0] + a[1] + ... but in this case, only a[0] is processed up to x=2.\n\nSo the sum_so_far after x=2 is 3, but that's not the actual total bytes.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first file, the sum_so_far is the sum of all previous files, which is 0. Then x=1: current_total=1. sum_so_far becomes 1.\n\nx=2: current_total=1+2=3. So sum_so_far is 3.\n\nBut the actual bytes processed in all files is 2 (only the first file has been processed up to x=2).\n\nSo the code is incorrectly adding x to sum_so_far for each x, regardless of whether it's the same file.\n\nWait, no, because sum_so_far is the sum of all previous files. So when processing x in file i, sum_so_far is sum of a[0] ... a[i-1].\n\nThen, current_total is sum_so_far + x.\n\nWhich is correct because it's the sum of all bytes processed before file i, plus the bytes processed in file i up to x.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut in the first sample, the code would compute for x=2, current_total=1+2=3.\n\np1 = 200//6=33.\n\np2=3*100//6=50.\n\nSo p1=33, p2=50. Not equal, so 33 is not added.\n\nBut according to the sample, p=33 is present.\n\nSo what's wrong.\n\nWait, in the sample, after x=2, the second bar is 2/6=33.333 →33.\n\nSo the code must have p1=33, p2=33.333 →33.\n\nBut according to the code, p2 is (3*100)//6=50.\n\nWait, that's not matching.\n\nWait, because current_total is 3, and total_size is 6.\n\nSo (3 *100)/6 =50.\n\nSo p2=50.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, p2 is the floor of (total_copied * 100)/total_size.\n\nSo for x=2, total_copied is 3, so 3*100=300. 300/6=50 → p2=50.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when x=2, the second bar is 33.333 →33.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the current_total.\n\nBecause, in the first file, after x=2, the sum_so_far is 3. But the sum of all bytes is 3? No, the sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in previous files (0) plus x=2, so current_total is 2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because in the first file, sum_so_far is the sum of all bytes in files before i=0, which is 0.\n\nSo, for x=2, current_total is 0+2=2.\n\nBut in the code, after x=1, sum_so_far is 1. So for x=2, current_total is 1+2=3.\n\nWhich is wrong.\n\nSo the code is incorrectly adding x to sum_so_far, which causes current_total to be higher than it should be.\n\nAh, I see. So the code's logic is wrong.\n\nThe root cause is that in the code, sum_so_far is being incremented for each x in the current file, which is incorrect.\n\nBecause sum_so_far is supposed to be the sum of all bytes in previous files, not including the current file.\n\nSo, for each x in the current file, we should not add x to sum_so_far. Only after processing all x's in the current file, we should add a_i to sum_so_far.\n\nAh, that's the mistake.\n\nSo, in the code, after processing all x in file i, sum_so_far += a_i.\n\nBecause the sum_so_far represents the sum of all bytes in files before i.\n\nSo during processing x in file i, the sum_so_far remains the same as before processing file i.\n\nSo, the code should be modified:\n\nInitialize sum_so_far =0.\n\nAdd 0 to result.\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a_i = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1..a_i:\n\n       current_total = sum_so_far + x\n\n       p1 = (x*100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 == p2:\n\n           add to result.\n\n   sum_so_far += a_i\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the first file:\n\ni=0, a_i=6.\n\nsum_so_far is 0.\n\nx runs from 1 to6.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_total=0+1=1.\n\np1=100//6=16.\n\np2=1*100//6=16.\n\nSo p=16 added.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total=0+2=2.\n\np1=200//6=33.\n\np2=2*100//6=33.\n\n33 added.\n\nx=3:\n\ncurrent_total=0+3=3 → p1=50, p2=50 → added.\n\nx=4: current_total=4 → p1=66, p2=66.\n\nx=5: current_total=5 → p1=83, p2=83.\n\nx=6: current_total=6 → p1=100, p2=100.\n\nSo all those p's are added.\n\nThus, the result set includes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted to not add x to sum_so_far during processing x, but only after processing all x in the current file.\n\nSo the revised code logic is:\n\nsum_so_far =0.\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a_i = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1..a_i:\n\n       current_total = sum_so_far +x\n\n       p1 = (x *100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total *100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 ==p2:\n\n           add to result.\n\n   sum_so_far += a_i\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nInitialize sum_so_far =0.\n\nresult = {0}.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a_i = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_total = sum_so_far + x\n\n       p1 = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n\n       if p1 == p2:\n\n           add to result.\n\n   sum_so_far += a_i\n\nFinally, sort the result, and for each element, print it followed by a newline.\n\nTesting this logic on the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=1\n\na=[6]\n\nsum_so_far starts at 0.\n\nresult={0}\n\ni=0:\n\nx runs from 1 to6.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_total=0+1=1.\n\np1=16.\n\np2=16 → added.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_total=0+2=2 → p1=33, p2=33 → added.\n\nand so on.\n\nSo the result is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sample 2.\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nSo a = [100,500]\n\ntotal_size=600.\n\nsum_so_far starts at 0.\n\nresult = {0}.\n\ni=0:\n\na_i=100.\n\nx runs 1 to 100.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_total=0+1=1.\n\np1=1 →1.\n\np2=1*100/600=0 →1 !=0 → not added.\n\nWait, but in the note, the second test case says that the first progress bar immediately jumps ahead, then resets.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAfter x=100, sum_so_far remains 0, and current_total for each x is 0+x.\n\nWait, for i=0, a_i=100.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_total=1 → p1=1, p2=1 → p=1.\n\nSo added.\n\nx=2: current_total=2 → p1=2, p2=2 → added.\n\n...\n\nx=100: current_total=100 → p1=100, p2=100 → added.\n\nSo for i=0, all x from 1 to100, p1 and p2 are equal.\n\nSo the result will include all 0-100.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the second line is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, sample input 2:\n\nn=2\n\na = [100,500]\n\nsum_so_far starts at 0.\n\ni=0:\n\na_i=100.\n\nx from 1 to100:\n\ncurrent_total =0 +x.\n\np1 = (x *100)/100 →x%.\n\np2 = (x *100)/600 → x*100/600 = x/6 → integer division.\n\nSo for x=1: p1=1, p2=0 → not added.\n\nx=6: p1=6, p2=1 →6 !=1.\n\nx=10: p1=10, p2=1 (since 10/6=1.666→1).\n\nOnly when x is a multiple of 6, p2 would be >=1.\n\nWait, no, because p2 is (x *100) // 600.\n\nx=6: 600/600=1 →1.\n\nSo p1=6, p2=1 →6 !=1.\n\nSo no.\n\nx=100: current_total=100 →100*100//600=16.666→16.\n\np1=100.\n\nSo p1 !=p2.\n\nSo for i=0, none of the x's (except x=0) will have p1=p2 except when x=0.\n\nSo the only addition from i=0 is x=0.\n\nBut during processing i=0, the x runs from 1 to100, so no new additions except 0.\n\nThen, sum_so_far +=100 → sum_so_far=100.\n\nNow, i=1:\n\na_i=500.\n\nx runs 1 to500.\n\ncurrent_total =100 +x.\n\np1 = (x *100)/500 →20x.\n\np2 = (100 +x)*100 /600 → (100 +x)*100//600.\n\nWe need to find x where 20x equals (100 +x)*100//600.\n\nWe can model this equation.\n\n20x = (100 +x)*100//600.\n\nMultiply both sides by 600:\n\n12000x = 100*(100 +x).\n\n12000x = 10000 +100x.\n\n12000x -100x = 10000 →11000x =10000 →x=10000/11000 →0.909 →x=0.\n\nBut x starts from 1.\n\nSo no solution.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nAt i=1, x=95:\n\ncurrent_total=100+95=195.\n\np1= (95 *100)/500=19.\n\np2= (195*100)/600= 1950/600=3.25 →3.\n\n19 !=3.\n\nx=96:\n\ncurrent_total=196.\n\np2= 196*100/600=32.666→32.\n\np1= (96*100)/500=19.2 →19.\n\n19 !=32.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, for the second test case, when i=1, after x=95, the sum_so_far is 100 +95=195.\n\np2=195*100//600=32.666→32.\n\np1=95*100//500",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages where both progress bars (one for each file and one for the overall progress) show the same value simultaneously during the copying process.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input values and initializing necessary variables. This includes the number of files, their sizes, the total size of all files combined, and a set to store the resulting percentages.\n2. **Simulate Copying Process**: For each file, simulate the copying process byte by byte. Track the cumulative bytes copied so far and update the progress bars accordingly.\n3. **Update Progress Bars**: After each byte is copied, compute the current percentage for both progress bars. The first bar shows the progress for the current file, while the second bar shows the overall progress across all files.\n4. **Check for Matching Percentages**: If both progress bars show the same percentage at any point, add this percentage to the result set.\n5. **Output Results**: After processing all files, sort the resulting percentages and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_size = sum(a)\nsum_so_far = 0\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    ai = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, ai + 1):\n        current_total = sum_so_far + x\n        p1 = (x * 100) // ai\n        p2 = (current_total * 100) // total_size\n        if p1 == p2:\n            result.add(p1)\n    sum_so_far += ai\n\n# Convert the sorted list to strings with newlines\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(f\"{num}\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes. These values are read and stored appropriately.\n- **Tracking Cumulative Bytes**: A variable `sum_so_far` keeps track of the total bytes copied from all previous files.\n- **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied from a file, the current progress of both bars is calculated. The first bar's progress is relative to the current file, while the second bar's progress is relative to the total size of all files.\n- **Matching Check**: Each time the progress bars show the same percentage, this value is added to the result set.\n- **Output**: The results are sorted and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently track and check each byte's contribution to the progress bars, allowing us to determine all matching percentages accurately.",
