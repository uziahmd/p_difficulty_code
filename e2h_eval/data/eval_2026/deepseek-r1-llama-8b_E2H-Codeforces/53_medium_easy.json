    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3 for that case.\n\nSo, what's a substring here? Oh right, a substring is any continuous sequence of characters within the string. And we're looking for the longest one that appears at least twice.\n\nThe input is a single string, and the output is the length of the longest such substring. If no such substring exists, like in 'abcd', which has all unique substrings except those of length 1, but wait, no—each character appears once, but as substrings of length 1, they appear only once. So in that case, the output is 0.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the output for 'abcd' is 0. So perhaps when there are no duplicates, the answer is 0. But wait, wait. Let me recheck the examples:\n\nSample Input:\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nSo for 'abcd', the output is 0. Because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the longest is 3. For 'zzz', the entire string is length 3 and it appears twice (since it's three 'z's, the substring from position 0-2 is 'zzz' and also from 1-3). So the output is 2? Wait, no, wait: 'zzz' has a substring of length 3 appearing twice. So the output is 3? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait, the third sample input is 'zzz', output is 2. Oh, why?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: 'zzz' has substrings of length 3 appearing twice. So the maximum length is 3. But according to the sample output, it's 2. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nWait, the third sample input is 'zzz', and the output is 2. So the maximum substring that appears at least twice is of length 2. That suggests that the entire string 'zzz' is considered, but it appears only once because it's the whole string. Oh, wait no, because the substring can be anywhere. Wait, in 'zzz', the substring 'zz' appears starting at index 0, and at index 1. So 'zz' is a substring of length 2 that appears twice. Also, the substring 'z' appears three times. So the maximum is 2, which is correct.\n\nAh, okay, so the output is 2 for 'zzz'.\n\nSo, the approach needs to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears more than once in the string.\n\nHow can I approach this?\n\nOne straightforward way is to check all possible substring lengths in descending order, and for each length, check if any substring of that length appears more than once. As soon as we find the maximum L where this condition holds, we can return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible down to 1.\n2. For each L, generate all possible substrings of length L in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once.\n4. The first L for which this is true is our answer.\n\nIf no such L >=1 is found, return 0.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut since the input string is up to 100 characters, the maximum possible L is 99 (for a string of length 100), and for each L, the number of substrings is (n-L+1). For n=100, L=50, that's 51 substrings. So even in the worst case, for each L, checking all possible substrings is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from the minimum of (string length - 1) down to 1:\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1? No, because for L to appear at least twice, the total length required is 2*L <= len(s). Because the first occurrence can be at position i, the second at position j, with j >= i + L.\n\nWait, no, because for overlapping substrings, j can be as close as i+1. Like in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaa' appears at positions 0, 1, 2, etc.\n\nSo for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is such that 2*L <= N. Because for L to have at least two occurrences, the first starts at 0, the second at L.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, in 'ababa', L=3, and the first occurrence is at 0, the second at 2, which is overlapping. So 2*3 =6 >5, but it's allowed.\n\nSo, the maximum possible L can be up to len(s)-1, but only if len(s) >=2.\n\nWait, but for example, in a string of length 2, the maximum L is 2, but then you can't have two occurrences unless it's the same string. So perhaps the maximum possible L is min(len(s)-1, len(s)-1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. Because for n=2, the substring of length 1 can appear twice, but a substring of length 2 can appear only once.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible L is len(s)-1.\n\nSo for the algorithm:\n\nFor L in range from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   collect all substrings of length L.\n\n   check if any substring occurs more than once.\n\n   if yes, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none satisfy, return 0.\n\nSo, the key is for each L, we need to collect all substrings of length L, and see if any occurs more than once.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can create a set of all substrings of length L. As we iterate through each substring, if we find a duplicate, we can immediately return L.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring, we can keep track of all occurrences. Once any substring is found in the set, we can stop processing and return L.\n\nWait, but for each L, the code would process all substrings of that length until a duplicate is found. So for each L, the code would process all substrings until a duplicate is found, and then proceed.\n\nThis is efficient enough for n=100.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nIf the length of s is less than 2, the output is 0.\n\nElse, for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to store the substrings of length L.\n\n   for each i in 0 to (len(s) - L):\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring is already in the set:\n\n           return L\n\n       else:\n\n           add substring to the set.\n\nOnce all L are checked and no duplicates found, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for example, in 'ababa' (length 5), when L=3, the substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So when i=0, add 'aba' to the set. i=1, add 'bab'. i=2, substring is 'aba', which is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'zzz' (length 3). L=3: the substrings are 'zzz' (i=0) and i=1 (but 1+3=4>3, so only one substring. So no duplicates, so move to L=2.\n\nFor L=2: the substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=0, add 'zz' to the set. Then i=1, substring is 'zz', which is in the set, so return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcd' (length 4). For L=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd' — no duplicates. For L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. For L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — all unique. So return 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the string slicing is s[i:i+L], but the end index is exclusive. So for i in 0..(n-L), inclusive, because i+L must be <=n.\n\nSo the loop for i should run from 0 to len(s) - L, inclusive.\n\nWait, no, because len(s) - L is the maximum i where i + L <= len(s). For example, if len(s)=5, L=3: i can be 0, 1, 2 (0+3=3<=5, 1+3=4<=5, 2+3=5<=5). So the loop runs for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1).\n\nWait, because len(s) - L +1 is the number of possible starting indices. So in code:\n\nfor i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\n   substring = s[i:i+L]\n\nSo, for each L, the code will generate all possible substrings of that length.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) < 2:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   max_len = 0\n\n   for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n       seen = set()\n\n       for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\n           substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n           if substr in seen:\n\n               print(L)\n\n               exit()\n\n           seen.add(substr)\n\n   print(0)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each L, we check all substrings of length L. If any substring is found more than once, we print L and exit.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nlen is 4.\n\nCheck L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc' (i=0), 'bcd' (i=1). No duplicates.\n\nThen L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=1:\n\nsubstrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So after all L's, print 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (len 5)\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'abab', 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nL=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When i=0: add 'aba'. i=1: add 'bab'. i=2: substring is 'aba' → already in set. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' (len 3)\n\nCheck L=2:\n\nsubstrings 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, substring 'zz' is in set, so return 2.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string is the same character, like 'aaaaa' (len 5). The maximum L is 4, but wait, wait:\n\nWait, when L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So duplicates. So the code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ababab' (len 6). The longest substring is 'abab' (appearing twice: starting at 0 and 2). So for L=4, the code would find 'abab' again at i=2, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcabc' (len 6). The entire string is 6, but L=6 would have only one substring. So the code moves to L=5: substrings 'abcab' and 'bcabc' → no duplicates. Then L=4: 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabc' → no. L=3: 'abc', 'bca', 'cab', 'abc' → at i=0, add 'abc'; i=3, substring is 'abc' → duplicate. So returns 3.\n\nWait, but the substring 'abc' occurs at 0 and 3, which is non-overlapping. So the maximum L is 3.\n\nWait, but the entire string is 'abcabc', which is 6. But that's a single occurrence. So the code correctly returns 3.\n\nWait, but what about a longer substring that appears more than once? Like in 'abcabcabc' (len 9). The maximum L would be 6, because 'abcabc' appears at 0 and 3.\n\nYes, the code would find that.\n\nAnother edge case: when the string is of length 2, say 'aa'. The maximum L is 1, but since L is 1, the code would return 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns = 'aa'\n\nlen(s) is 2.\n\nLoop L from 1 down to 1.\n\nFor L=1:\n\nsubstrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). So the code adds 'a' to the set. Then, when i=1, substring is 'a' which is already in the set. So returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (len 6). The maximum L is 3, because 'aab' and 'baa' may not be duplicated, but 'aba' appears once, wait no. Let's see.\n\nWait, 'aabbaa' → substrings of length 3:\n\ni=0: 'aab'\n\ni=1: 'abb'\n\ni=2: 'bba'\n\ni=3: 'baa'\n\nNo duplicates. Then L=2:\n\ni=0: 'aa'\n\ni=1: 'ab'\n\ni=2: 'bb'\n\ni=3: 'ba'\n\ni=4: 'aa' → found duplicate. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input from stdin, which is a single string. So in Python, reading via input().strip() is correct.\n\nSo the complete code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\nif len(s) < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, 'exit()' can be done via 'sys.exit()', but in the code above, it's just using 'exit()', which may not work as intended. So to make it work, we need to import sys.\n\nWait, no: in the code, after printing L and calling exit(), the script stops. But in Python, without importing sys, the built-in function exit() may not be available. Wait, no. In Python, exit() is a function in the sys module. So to call it, you need to import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nSo the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nSo modified code:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nif len(s) < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                sys.exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → 3.\n\nSample3: 'zzz' → 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to find the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice in the string. If no such substring exists, the result should be 0.\n2. **Intuition**: We can approach this by checking substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a brute-force approach where we iterate over possible substring lengths from the largest possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, we immediately return the current length as it meets the condition of appearing at least twice.\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the constraints (string length up to 100), this approach is efficient enough as it involves checking each possible substring length and using a set for quick lookups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nif len(s) < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                sys.exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is less than 2, it's impossible to have a repeating substring, so we immediately return 0.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: We start from the longest possible substring length and decrement down to 1.\n4. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track which substrings have been seen.\n5. **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, we print the current length and exit. If no duplicates are found for any length, we print 0 after all iterations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups and iterating from the longest possible substrings down to the shortest.",
