He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in three steps. First, A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, but the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nSo, the string must satisfy certain conditions:\n\n1. The order of the characters is first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends new characters, so the string can't have any interleaving.\n2. The counts of each part must satisfy:\n   - There's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n   - The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nWait, wait. Wait no: the problem says that when C appends, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's. So c_count = a_count or c_count = b_count.\n\nBut also, the initial string after A and B has at least one 'a' and 'b', so a_count >=1 and b_count >=1.\n\nSo, for the given string S, I need to check these conditions:\n\n- The string must consist of a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n- The count of a's is at least 1.\n- The count of b's is at least 1.\n- The count of c's is equal to either the a_count or the b_count.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I'll process the string into its components: count the number of a's, b's, c's, and also check the order.\n\nLet me think about how to split the string into the a's, b's, and c's parts.\n\nFor example, for 'aaabccc', the a's are the first three, then b's are next two, then c's are three.\n\nBut for 'bbacc', it starts with 'b's, which is invalid because the a's must come first. So that's why in the sample input, the second case is invalid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-empty. Well, the input is guaranteed to have length at least 1, but according to the problem statement, after B appends, there's at least one 'a' and 'b', so the total string after B has at least 2 characters. So the final string after C appends will have at least 3 characters? No, because after B, the string is \"aab\", then C appends 3 'c's, making \"aabccc\"? Wait, no, let's see: no, wait, the count of 'c's is equal to a or b. So if after B, the string is 'aab', then a_count=2, b_count=1. So c_count can be 2 or 1. So for example, C could add 2 'c's, making 'aabcc'.\n\nBut in any case, the minimal possible string after C is 3 letters only if a_count and b_count are both 1, but that's not possible because after B, the a_count is at least 1, b_count is at least 1. So the total string is a's + b's + c's.\n\nSo, first, I need to ensure that the string is in the form of all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's.\n\nHow to check that? We can iterate through the string and see if the characters transition from a to b, then to c, without any other transitions.\n\nFor example, the string should start with a's, then switch to b's, then to c's, and after that, no more changes. So the sequence is a -> b -> c, and only once each.\n\nSo the steps to validate:\n\n- Split the string into a group, then b group, then c group.\n\n- Ensure that all a's come before any b's, all b's before any c's.\n\nSo, how to implement this:\n\nWe can loop through the string, keeping track of the current segment (a, b, c). Once a segment changes, it can't go back.\n\nFor example, let's say the string is 'abc':\n\nIt's a, then b, then c. That's valid.\n\nBut 'aabbc' would be a, then bb, then c. So that's okay.\n\nBut 'abacb' is invalid because after a, it goes",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations. The string must start with some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, and end with some 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must transition from 'a' to 'b' to 'c' without any other transitions. This means the string should consist of a contiguous block of 'a's, followed by a contiguous block of 'b's, and ending with a contiguous block of 'c's.\n2. **Count Each Character**: After verifying the order, count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the correct order\ncurrent = None\nfor c in s:\n    if current == 'a':\n        if c != 'a':\n            current = 'b'\n    elif current == 'b':\n        if c != 'b':\n            current = 'c'\n    elif current == 'c':\n        if c != 'c':\n            # Invalid character after c\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    else:\n        if c == 'a':\n            current = 'a'\n        elif c == 'b':\n            current = 'b'\n        elif c == 'c':\n            current = 'c'\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\n# Now check the counts\ncount_a = 0\ncount_b = 0\ncount_c = 0\n\nhas_a = False\nhas_b = False\nhas_c = False\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        has_a = True\n    elif c == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        has_b = True\n    elif c == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        has_c = True\n\nif not (has_a and has_b):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code iterates through each character in the string to ensure it transitions correctly from 'a' to 'b' to 'c'. If any invalid transition is detected, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order, the code counts the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. It then checks if there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' and if the number of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n3. **Final Check**: If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".",
