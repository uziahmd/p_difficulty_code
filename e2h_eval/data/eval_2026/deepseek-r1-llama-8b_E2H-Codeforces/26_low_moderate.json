Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is between A and B, y is between B and C (so at least B), and z is at least C, which is ≥ y. So z is definitely the largest side. So the triangle condition reduces to x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through all possible x, y, z that satisfy the ranges and count those where x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the constraints, A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, so iterating through each x, y, z is impossible as it would be O(N^3), which is way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ranges for x, y, z:\n\nx: [A, B]\ny: [B, C]\nz: [C, D]\n\nBut since y starts from B, and x is up to B, the minimal possible x is A, and maximal is B.\n\nSimilarly, for y, minimal is B, maximal is C.\n\nFor z, minimal is C, maximal is D.\n\nSo the total possible combinations are (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1). But even that could be up to (5e5)^3, which is way too big.\n\nSo we need an approach that avoids checking each triplet.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions.\n\nWe need x + y > z.\n\nGiven that x ≤ B, y ≤ C, z ≥ C.\n\nWait, but z can be as large as D, which is up to 5e5.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible z, we can compute how many pairs (x, y) satisfy x + y > z, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nWait, that might be manageable. Because for each z, the condition is x + y > z. So for a fixed z, the number of (x, y) pairs is equal to the number of (x, y) where x >= A, y >= B, x <= B, y <= C, and x + y > z.\n\nBut z is in [C, D], so perhaps we can process each z in this range and calculate the count.\n\nBut processing each z individually might not be efficient either, unless we can find a way to compute the count quickly for a given z.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the possible x and y ranges and then find for each z, how many (x, y) satisfy x + y > z.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nThe variables x and y are bounded as follows:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\n\nSo x can vary from A to B, and for each x, y can vary from B to min(C, (some upper limit based on z)).\n\nWait, no. For a fixed z, the condition is x + y > z. So for each x, the minimal y needed is max(B, z - x + 1). Because y must be ≥ B, but also y must be > z - x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x + y > z → y > z - x → since y is integer, y ≥ (z - x) + 1.\n\nBut y also has to be ≥ B and ≤ C.\n\nSo for a given x, the lower bound for y is max(B, z - x + 1), and the upper bound is C.\n\nIf this lower bound is ≤ upper bound, then the number of y's is C - lower_bound + 1. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo for a given z, the count is the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1) if max(...) ≤ C.\n\nHmm. That seems manageable, but even that would take O(B) time per z, which for z up to 5e5 would result in O(5e5 * 5e5) operations, which is way",
