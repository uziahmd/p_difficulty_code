The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward. So, the first ring is the outermost edge, the second is two cells in from there, and so on until we've added k rings.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring? For each i-th ring (starting from 1), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side. So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated based on these reduced dimensions.\n\nWait, no. Because for each ring, it's the perimeter of a rectangle. The number of cells in a ring is the perimeter minus 4 because the four corners would be counted twice if I just multiply 2*(width + height). Or wait, maybe not. Let me think: for a rectangle with W columns and H rows, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each corner is counted once when you add the top and bottom rows, but without subtracting the four corners which are each counted twice.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Like a 3x3 square. The perimeter is 8 cells. According to the formula: 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8, which matches. Another example: 7x9. The perimeter is 2*(7+9)-4= 32-4=28, which is the second sample input's output for k=1. And when k=2, the total is 28 plus the next ring's cells.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 2*(i-1)*2? Wait, no. Because each ring is two cells inward on each side. So after the first ring, each subsequent ring reduces the width and height by 4 each? Because the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells in on all sides, so width becomes w - 4, height becomes h -4.\n\nWait, maybe. Because each ring adds a border that is two cells away. So for ring 1, it's the original. For ring 2, the width is w - 2*2 (because 2 cells on each side, left and right). Similarly for height, subtract 2*2 for each ring.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, for ring i, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and height is h -4*(i-1). Because each ring removes 2 cells from each side. So for i=1, it's w, h. For i=2, it's w-4, h-4, and so on.\n\nBut wait, if w or h is less than 4*i, then the ring can't exist. But according to the problem statement, k is given such that it's possible. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, and sum them all up.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst sample input: '3 3 1'\n\nRing 1: current_w =3, current_h=3 → perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 8 → total is 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond sample input: '7 9 1' → 7+9=16, 2*16=32-4=28 → correct.\n\nThird sample input: '7 9 2'\n\nFirst ring: 28.\n\nSecond ring: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12.\n\nTotal is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if k=3?\n\nThen third ring: current_w=7-8= -1? No, wait, wait. Wait, for i=3, it's 4*(3-1)=8, so 7-8= -1. That's impossible. But according to the problem statement, k is such that it's within the constraints, so perhaps the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is formed by reducing both the width and height of the plate by 4 cells (2 cells on each side). The first ring is the outermost border, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is calculated as the perimeter of the rectangle formed by that ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4` because each corner is counted once in the perimeter.\n3. **Summing Up**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter of the current ring and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the dimensions of the plate (`w` and `h`) and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, it calculates the current width and height of the ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, the perimeter is computed using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: The perimeters of all rings are summed up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the constraints provided.",
