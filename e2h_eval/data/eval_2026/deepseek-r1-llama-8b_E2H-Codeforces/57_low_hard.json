His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine the best and worst possible rankings he could have.\n\nWait, but how? Because the participants are in a sorted list based on their total points. And if multiple people have the same total, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects their ranking.\n\nSo the approach is to compute all possible pairs of a and b for Vasya, ensuring that the sum is >=x. Then, for each possible pair (a_i + b_j), we need to see how many participants could have a higher sum, or equal, to determine his rank.\n\nBut wait, since the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\n1. For each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the pairing isn't known. So the problem becomes finding all possible pairings where one participant is Vasya with a certain a and b, and others have their own a and b.\n\nBut that seems complicated because n can be up to 105, which makes checking all possible pairings computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this by considering that for each possible sum s >=x, we can find the maximum number of participants who have a sum greater than s, which would give the best possible rank (if s is as high as possible). Similarly, the worst rank would be when s is as low as possible, but still >=x.\n\nWait, but it's more nuanced than that because the way the sums are arranged affects the number of people above or below.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each possible a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, we can consider that as Vasya's score. Then, for each such possible score, compute how many participants have a sum strictly greater than this score. That would give the minimum number of people ahead of him. Similarly, for the maximum number of people that could be ahead (but that's probably when the sum is as small as possible).\n\nWait, no. For the best possible rank, we want Vasya to have the highest possible sum, thus minimizing the number of people ahead of him. For the worst possible rank, we want Vasya to have the smallest possible sum (but still >=x), which would maximize the number of people ahead of him.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find all possible s = a_i + b_j where s >=x. For each s, compute the number of participants whose sum is > s, plus the number of participants with sum ==s but who could be placed after Vasya. Because for the best case, Vasya's sum is as large as possible, so as few as possible participants have a sum larger than his.\n\nWait, but in reality, any participant can have a sum less than, equal to, or greater than s. So for each possible s, the maximum possible rank is determined by how many participants have a sum > s, and how many have sum equal to s but could be placed after him.\n\nWait, no. Because when s is fixed, the number of participants with sum > s is fixed. Those are definitely above him. For those with sum equal to s, they can either be above or below, depending on the jury's decision. So, for the best rank, we can assume that all participants with sum s are placed after him, thus his rank is the number of participants with sum > s + 1. For the worst rank, the participants with sum s are placed before him, so his rank is the number of participants with sum > s + the number of participants with sum equal to s.\n\nWait, yes! So for each possible s, which is a_i + b_j >=x, we can calculate the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible s = a_i + b_j where s >=x. Each s corresponds to a possible total for Vasya.\n\n2. For each s:\n\n   a. Compute how many participants have a sum > s. Let's call this count_gt.\n\n   b. Compute how many participants have sum == s. Let's call this count_eq.\n\n3. The best possible rank for s is count_gt + 1. Because all those with sum > s are definitely above him, and the rest can be ordered after him.\n\n4. The worst possible rank for s is count_gt + count_eq",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given as two separate lists, but without the names of the participants, making it necessary to consider all possible pairings of the scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate All Possible Sums**: For each participant, compute all possible sums of their scores from the two tours. Each sum represents a potential total score for Vasya.\n2. **Filter Valid Sums**: Consider only those sums that are at least `x`, as given by the problem statement.\n3. **Determine Ranks**:\n   - **Best Rank**: For each valid sum, calculate how many participants have a higher score. This gives the best rank when Vasya's score is as high as possible.\n   - **Worst Rank**: For each valid sum, calculate how many participants have a higher score or the same score. This gives the worst rank when Vasya's score is as low as possible but still valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n, x = int(data[0]), int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:n+2]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[n+2:2*n+2]))\n    \n    participants = []\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s = ai + bi\n            if s >= x:\n                participants.append(s)\n    \n    # To find all possible s, we need to consider all possible pairs where ai + bj >=x\n    # So, generate all possible s for any (ai, bj) where ai is from a and bj is from b\n    possible_s = set()\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            if ai + bi >= x:\n                possible_s.add(ai + bi)\n    possible_s = sorted(possible_s)\n    \n    # Now, for each s in possible_s, calculate count_gt and count_eq\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for ai in a:\n        for bi in b:\n            s_total = ai + bi\n            freq[s_total] += 1\n    \n    best_rank = n + 1\n    worst_rank = n + 1\n    for s in possible_s:\n        count_gt = 0\n        count_eq = 0\n        for key in freq:\n            if key > s:\n                count_gt += freq[key]\n            elif key == s:\n                count_eq += freq[key]\n        best_rank = min(best_rank, count_gt + 1)\n        worst_rank = max(worst_rank, count_gt + count_eq)\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants, the minimum score, and the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Generating Sums**: All possible sums of the scores from the two tours are computed. Only sums that are at least `x` are considered.\n3. **Frequency Calculation**: A frequency dictionary is used to count how many times each total score appears.\n4. **Rank Calculation**:\n   - For each valid sum, the number of participants with a higher score (`count_gt`) and the same score (`count_eq`) are determined.\n   - The best rank is the smallest number of participants who could have a higher score plus one.\n   - The worst rank is the largest number of participants who could have a higher score or the same score.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks by considering all valid total scores and their implications on the ranking.",
