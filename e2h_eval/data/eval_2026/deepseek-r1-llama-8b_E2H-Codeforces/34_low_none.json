And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week is considered as k consecutive days. So, we need to compute the average over all possible weeks of size k in the given sequence.\n\nHmm, let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, the input: two integers n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing the sleep times each day.\n\nThe output is the average of all the weeks. Each week is a consecutive k-day window, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate the sum of all these windows and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, and k is up to that, how can I efficiently compute the sum of all k-length windows without exceeding time constraints?\n\nCalculating each window naively would be O(nk), which would be too slow for n=2e5. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right! This is a classic sliding window problem. We can use a prefix sum array to compute the sum for each window quickly.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array S where S[0] = 0, S[1] = a1, S[2] = a1+a2, etc.\n2. For each window starting at i (0-based), the sum is S[i + k] - S[i]. Summing all these will give the total sum of all windows.\n3. Then, the average is this total divided by (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but wait: the indices might be a bit tricky here. Let me think about zero-based vs one-based.\n\nWait, suppose the array is 0-based. The first window is from index 0 to k-1. The sum is S[k] - S[0]. The next window starts at 1: sum is S[k+1] - S[1], and so on until i = n - k.\n\nSo the total number of windows is (n - k + 1). So for each i from 0 to (n - k), the sum is S[i + k] - S[i].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n, k.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the prefix sums S.\n- Iterate through each window, summing their values into total_sum.\n- Compute average as total_sum / (number of windows).\n- Print the average with enough decimal precision.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the prefix sum correctly.\n\nIn Python, it's easy to create the prefix sum. For example, for a list a, S[0] = 0, S[1] = a[0], S[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc., up to S[n], which is the sum of all a.\n\nThen, for each window starting at i (from 0 to n -k), the sum is S[i +k] - S[i].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nRead n, k from input. Then read the a array.\n\nCompute S as follows:\n\ns = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor num in a:\n    current_sum += num\n    s.append(current_sum)\n\nThen, for each i in 0 ... (n -k):\n    window_sum = s[i +k] - s[i]\n    total += window_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint this average with 10 decimal digits? Or more, as the required precision is high.\n\nWait, the problem says the output should have at least 6 digits after decimal point. But the sample outputs show 10 digits. So perhaps, to avoid issues, print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nIn Python, formatting can be done using something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average), but wait, that rounds to 10 digits, but what if the actual number has more than that? Because the note says that any answer with absolute or relative error not exceeding 1e-6 is acceptable. So perhaps, printing up to 10 digits is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe printing with more digits could help, but for the problem, 10 digits is enough as per the samples.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but looking at the sample outputs:\n\nFor example, the third case output is '28964.2857142857' which has 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo yes, the code should format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, considering the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n =k. So only one window, sum is total of a, average is total.\n\nCase 2: k=1. So each day is a window, average",

Each week is considered as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the integers n and k, followed by the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of each possible window of size k. This allows us to avoid the O(nk) complexity of calculating each window individually.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output Formatting**: Print the result with at least 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_windows):\n        end = i + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[i]\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers n, k, and a list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array. This allows for quick calculation of any subarray sum.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, each window of size k is summed in constant time by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums. This reduces the overall complexity from O(nk) to O(n).\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average while handling large input sizes within acceptable time limits.",
