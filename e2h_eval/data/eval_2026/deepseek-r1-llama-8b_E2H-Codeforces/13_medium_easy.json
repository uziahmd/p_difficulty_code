For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the input is three notes, like 'C E G' or 'C# B F'. The output depends on whether these notes form a major, minor, or neither chord.\n\nWait, the problem says that a triad is major if when ordered X, Y, Z, the distances between X-Y is 4 semitones and Y-Z is 3. For minor, it's the opposite: X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4. So my plan is to take all possible permutations of the three notes, calculate their distances in a circular way, and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Oh right, each note can be assigned a number based on its position in the list. Let me think: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, wait—wait, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So let me count them:\n\nC is 0,\nC# is 1,\nD is 2,\nD# is 3,\nE is 4,\nF is 5,\nF# is 6,\nG is 7,\nG# is 8,\nA is 9,\nB is 10,\nH is 11.\n\nSo each note has a unique index from 0 to 11.\n\nNow, for any two notes, the distance from lower to higher is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, since the scale is cyclic, after H comes C again. So for example, the distance from H (11) to C (0) is 1 semitone, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower tone to the upper. So the distance between C and E is 4 semitones because E is 4 steps ahead. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones.\n\nWait, but when calculating the distance between two notes, say x and y, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but if that's larger than 6, perhaps we subtract it from 12? Or maybe not—wait, the problem says the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if x is higher than y, then the distance is (x - y + 12) % 12? Or wait, maybe it's better to always arrange x and y such that x is before y, and compute the distance as (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). Because the distance is from lower to higher.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). So for example, C (0) to E (4): 4-0=4. E (4) to C (0): 0+12-4=8.\n\nSo, for a triad with notes X, Y, Z, I need to check all possible orderings of these three notes to see if any of them satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut considering all permutations might be manageable since there are only 6 permutations for three distinct notes. Wait, but what if there are duplicate notes? Oh, the problem states that the triad consists of exactly three notes, but doesn't specify if they are distinct. Hmm, but in music, a triad typically consists of three distinct notes. So probably, all three are different. So I can assume that the input has three distinct notes.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Convert each note into its numerical value (like C=0, etc.).\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three numbers.\n3. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distances between x and y, and y and z.\n   a. If the distance x-y is 4 and y-z is 3, it's a major triad.\n   b. If the distance x-y is 3 and y-z is 4, it's a minor triad.\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'.\n5. Else, if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'.\n6. Else, return 'strange'.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of exactly three notes. So the order in which we consider x, y, z doesn't matter. Therefore, for each permutation, we can check if the current ordering forms a major or minor triad.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we calculate the distances as per the major and minor definitions.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices.\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\nThen, read the input as a list of three strings, split by spaces.\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nConvert each note into its index using the mapping.\n\nnote_indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nThen, generate all possible permutations of these three indices.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(note_indices)\n\nFor each perm in perms:\n\nCompute the distances between x and y, and y and z.\n\nWait, but for a permutation (a, b, c), the first distance is b - a, but if a > b, then we add 12 and subtract a? No, wait, the distance is (b - a) if b >= a, else (b + 12 - a).\n\nSo for a permutation (x, y, z):\n\nd1 = (y - x) if y >= x else (y + 12 - x)\nd2 = (z - y) if z >= y else (z + 12 - y)\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if x, y, z are arranged in order, but if any of the next note is lower, then it wraps around.\n\nWait, no: for any pair, the distance is the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher one. So for x and y, the distance is (y - x) if y > x, else (12 - (x - y)).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each permutation of (a, b, c):\n\nCompute d_xy = (b - a) % 12\nd_yz = (c - b) % 12\nWait, no. Because modulo 12 would give negative results as positive. Wait, (b - a) can be negative, so taking modulo 12 gives the correct distance. For example, (0 - 4) is -4, mod 12 is 8, which is the distance from E to C as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones, which is (C is 0, E is4; 0 -4 is -4, but adding 12 gives 8). So yes, computing (b - a) % 12 would give the correct distance.\n\nWait, let's test some examples:\n\nCase 1: C (0) to E (4): (4-0) =4 → correct.\nE (4) to C (0): (0-4)=-4 → mod 12 is 8 → correct.\nC (0) to H (11): (11-0) =11 → mod 12 is 11 → correct.\nH (11) to C (0): (0-11)=-11 → mod 12 is 1 → correct.\n\nYes, so the distance can be calculated as (y - x) % 12.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y, moving upwards. So, for any two notes, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. So, regardless of the order, this calculation gives the correct distance from X to Y.\n\nWait, no: for example, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. But (0-4) mod 12 is (-4) mod 12 is 8. So yes, (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance from X to Y when moving upwards.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Let me re-express:\n\nThe distance from X to Y is the minimal number of semitones needed to go upwards from X to reach Y. Since the scale is cyclic, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is after X, it's Y - X. If Y is before X, you wrap around, so the distance is 12 - (X - Y).\n\nSo yes, the formula (Y - X) mod 12 gives the correct distance.\n\nSo, in code, for a permutation (x, y, z), the distances are:\n\nd_xy = (y - x) % 12\nd_yz = (z - y) % 12\n\nThen, the sum d_xy + d_yz should be 7 semitones because the major triad has 4 + 3 =7, and minor has 3+4=7.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the total distance between X and Z is 7 semitones for both major and minor triads. So, for a valid major or minor triad, the sum of the two distances must be 7.\n\nBut that's a necessary condition, but not sufficient. Because for a major triad, the individual distances are 4 and 3. For minor, 3 and 4.\n\nSo, for each permutation, calculate d_xy and d_yz. Then, if d_xy is 4 and d_yz is 3 → major. If d_xy is 3 and d_yz is 4 → minor.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes:\n\n- compute d_xy = (y - x) %12\n- compute d_yz = (z - y) %12\n- if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3 → major → return 'major'\n- elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4 → minor → return 'minor'\n\nIf none of the permutations meet these conditions, then it's 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's take the second input: 'C# B F'.\n\nNotes: C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nWe need to check all permutations.\n\nLet's consider permutation (B, C#, F): \n\nx=10, y=1, z=5.\n\nd_xy = (1 -10) mod12 → ( -9 ) mod12 → 3.\n\nd_yz = (5-1) mod12 →4.\n\nSo d_xy=3, d_yz=4 → this is a minor triad.\n\nThus, the output is 'minor'.\n\nAnother sample: 'A B H' → A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations:\n\nFor (A,B,H): d_AB = 1, d_BH=1 → no.\n\n(A, H, B): d_AH = (11-9) mod12=2; d_HB=(10-11) mod12=11 → 2+11=13. Not 7.\n\nWait, wait, no. For the permutation (A, H, B):\n\nx=9, y=11, z=10.\n\nd_xy = (11-9) mod12=2.\n\nd_yz = (10-11) mod12= ( -1 ) mod12=11.\n\nSo 2 +11 =13. Doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, other permutations:\n\n(B, A, H): x=10, y=9, z=11.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12= 11.\n\nd_yz= (11-9) mod12=2.\n\nSo 11+2=13.\n\nNo.\n\n(B, H, A): x=10, y=11, z=9.\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz= (9-11)= -2 mod12=10 → 1+10=11.\n\nNo.\n\n(H, A, B): x=11, y=9, z=10.\n\nd_xy= (9-11) mod12=10.\n\nd_yz= (10-9) mod12=1.\n\nSum 11.\n\nNo.\n\nSo none of the permutations satisfy the conditions, thus 'strange'.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this:\n\nRead the input notes, map to indices.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation, calculate d_xy and d_yz as (y-x) mod12 and (z-y) mod12.\n\nCheck if any permutation meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nIf any permutation is major, output 'major' and exit.\n\nElse, if any permutation is minor, output 'minor' and exit.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the permutations? Because in Python, the permutations function returns tuples, so for each perm in permutations, it's (x, y, z).\n\nSo, for each perm in permutations:\n\nx, y, z = perm\n\nd_xy = (y - x) %12\n\nd_yz = (z - y) %12\n\nif d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3 → major.\n\nelif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4 → minor.\n\nOnce any of these is found, we can immediately decide and break.\n\nSo, the code will loop through all permutations until it finds the first occurrence.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous (no chords can be both major and minor), once a major is found, return; else, check for minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about the order? Are we considering all possible orderings, including ones where x, y, z are not in order?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the correct ordering is x, z, y. Then, our permutation would have x, z, y, and the code would calculate d_xy as (z -x) mod12, and d_yz as (y - z) mod12. Which may not match the required 4 and 3.\n\nWait, no. Because in the permutation (x, z, y), the code would compute d_xy as (z - x) mod12, and d_yz as (y - z) mod12.\n\nWhich may not give 4 and 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is incorrect because the order of the notes in the permutation matters, but the actual triad can have the notes in any order.\n\nWait, no. Because the triad is an unordered set, so any permutation is possible.\n\nWait, but the problem defines a major triad as a set where, when ordered X, Y, Z, X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So any permutation that satisfies this condition would make it a major triad.\n\nBut in the code, the permutation could be (X, Y, Z), (X, Z, Y), etc. So, for each possible permutation, the code checks all possible orderings.\n\nFor example, let's say the correct order is X, Y, Z (major triad). Then, the permutation (X,Y,Z) would be processed, and d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major detected.\n\nWhat if the correct order is X, Z, Y. Then, d_xy is (Z - X) mod12, which may not be 4. But in that case, the permutation (X, Z, Y) may not trigger the condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps another permutation would. For instance, the permutation (Y, X, Z) would process as Y, X, Z → d_xy is (X - Y) mod12, which may not be 4.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the approach of checking all permutations may miss some cases.\n\nWait, no. Because the triad is unordered, so any permutation that, when ordered as X, Y, Z, has X-Y =4 and Y-Z=3 is considered.\n\nBut the code is checking all possible orderings, so it's possible that the correct order is in some permutation.\n\nWait, for example, consider the triad C, E, G. The correct order is C, E, G → d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nBut if the permutation is (E, C, G), then d_xy is (C-E) mod12 = (0-4) mod12=8. d_yz is (G - C) mod12=7. So 8 and7 → no.\n\nBut in the permutation (C, G, E), d_xy is (G-C) mod12=7, d_yz is (E - G) mod12= (4 -7) mod12= ( -3) mod12=9 → 7+9=16.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would not find the major triad unless the permutation is (C, E, G).\n\nWait, but that's a problem because the code only checks the permutations of the original note order. Wait no, the code is generating all possible permutations of the three note indices, regardless of their order in the input.\n\nSo, for the input 'C E G', the note_indices are [0,4,7]. The permutations would include (0,4,7), (0,7,4), (4,0,7), etc.\n\nIn the permutation (0,4,7), d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo the code would correctly detect it.\n\nBut in the permutation (4,0,7), x=4, y=0, z=7.\n\nd_xy = (0-4) mod12 = 8.\n\nd_yz = (7-0) mod12=7.\n\nSo 8 +7=15, not 7.\n\nSo that permutation does not satisfy.\n\nBut in another permutation, like (7,4,0):\n\nx=7, y=4, z=0.\n\nd_xy = (4-7) mod12= ( -3 ) mod12=9.\n\nd_yz = (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nSum is 17.\n\nSo, this permutation doesn't satisfy.\n\nBut the permutation (0,4,7) is present and will be checked.\n\nSo, the code is correct because it iterates through all possible permutations, so at least one permutation will have the correct order.\n\nWait, but why? Because for a valid major or minor triad, there exists an ordering where the distances are correct. So, one of the permutations will be that correct ordering.\n\nYes, because the triad is a set, and any permutation of the three notes can be considered as the X, Y, Z.\n\nSo, the code will find the correct permutation.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All notes are same. But the problem says it's a triad, which requires exactly three notes, but in the problem statement, it's specified that the triad is a set of three notes, so duplicates are allowed? Or not? Well, the problem statement says \"exactly three notes\" but doesn't say they have to be distinct. So perhaps, the input can have duplicate notes, like ['C C E', ...].\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as three space-separated notes. So, for example, the input could be 'C C E', which would be converted to indices [0,0,4].\n\nIn that case, the code would generate permutations like (0,0,4), (0,4,0), etc.\n\nWhen processing (0,0,4):\n\nd_xy = (0-0) mod12=0.\n\nd_yz = (4-0) mod12=4.\n\nSo 0 and4. Sum is4, not 7. So no.\n\nSimilarly, for (0,4,0):\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nSum is12. No.\n\nSo, the code would correctly mark this as 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, in reality, a triad can't have duplicate notes because that wouldn't form a triad. But the problem statement says that the input is a valid triad, but Vasya needs to classify it. So the code doesn't need to handle invalid inputs, just process whatever is given.\n\nSo, the code should work regardless of duplicate notes.\n\nAnother Edge Case: All three notes are consecutive, but not forming a major or minor triad.\n\nLike C, D, E.\n\nNote indices: 0,2,4.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the distances are 4 and3.\n\nPossible permutations:\n\n0,2,4 → d_xy=2, d_yz=2 → sum 4. No.\n\n0,4,2 → d_xy=4, d_yz= (2-4)= -2 mod12=10. Sum 14. No.\n\n2,0,4 → d_xy= (0-2) mod12=10, d_yz=4 → sum 14.\n\n2,4,0 → d_xy=2, d_yz= (0-4)=8 → sum 10.\n\n4,0,2 → d_xy= (0-4)=8, d_yz= (2-0)=2 → sum 10.\n\n4,2,0 → d_xy= (2-4)= -2 mod12=10, d_yz= (0-2)=10 → sum20.\n\nSo, no permutation satisfies the conditions. So, the output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother Edge Case: Triad that is major but in a different permutation.\n\nFor example, E, G, C.\n\nIndices:4,7,0.\n\nPermutation (4,7,0):\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz= (0-7) mod12=5. Sum 8.\n\nNo.\n\nBut permutation (4,0,7):\n\nd_xy= (0-4) mod12=8, d_yz= (7-0)=7 → sum 15.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but wait: The correct order is C, E, G: 0,4,7.\n\nWhich gives d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo, in the code, when the permutation is (4,7,0), the d_xy is (7-4) mod12=3, d_yz is (0-7) mod12=5. Sum 8.\n\nBut the code isn't finding it because the permutation is (4,7,0), which is a different order.\n\nWait, no: the permutation (4,7,0) is x=4, y=7, z=0.\n\nd_xy = (7-4) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz = (0-7) mod12=5.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, the code won't find the major condition here.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. Because the correct permutation is (0,4,7), which is present in the permutations, so the code will find it.\n\nAh right, because in the permutations, (0,4,7) is one of them, so the code will detect it as major.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother Edge Case: Minor triad in a permutation that's not the correct order.\n\nFor example, the minor triad is B, D#, F.\n\nIndices:10, 3, 5.\n\nIn the correct order: B (10), D# (3), F (5).\n\nWait, no: in a minor triad, the order is X, Y, Z where X-Y is 3, Y-Z is4.\n\nWait, B to D# is 3 semitones? Let's see: B is10, C is11, D is12 mod12=0, D# is1, E is2, F is3, etc. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the notes are in the order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, so B is10, C is0, C# is1, D is2, D# is3, E is4, F is5, F# is6, G is7, G# is8, A is9, B is10, H is11.\n\nSo, the distance from B (10) to D# (3) is (3-10) mod12= ( -7 ) mod12=5.\n\nWait, that's not 3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the minor triad.\n\nWait, a minor triad is defined as X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 3 semitones, and Y and Z is4.\n\nSo, for example, the minor triad is C, D#, G.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sample input includes 'C# B F' as a minor triad.\n\nIn that case, the correct order is B, C#, F.\n\nWhich is indices 10,1,5.\n\nd_xy = (1-10) mod12= ( -9 ) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz = (5-1) mod12=4.\n\nSo, 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo, in the code, the permutation (10,1,5) is processed, and the code detects it.\n\nBut what about a permutation like (10,5,1)?\n\nd_xy = (5-10) mod12= ( -5 ) mod12=7.\n\nd_yz= (1-5) mod12= ( -4 ) mod12=8.\n\nSum is15.\n\nNo.\n\nBut the code will process all permutations, including (10,1,5), which is correct.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'E G C'.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nIn the correct order: E, G, C.\n\nd_xy= (7-4) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz= (0-7) mod12=5.\n\nSum 8.\n\nNot a major or minor.\n\nWait, but E, G, C is not a major or minor triad?\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the major triad, the order is X, Y, Z where X-Y is4, Y-Z is3.\n\nIn the minor, X-Y is3, Y-Z is4.\n\nSo, E, G, C: X is E, Y is G, Z is C.\n\nd_xy is 3, d_yz is5. So not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation is correct.\n\nLike, G, C, E.\n\nd_xy = (C - G) mod12= (0-7) mod12=5.\n\nd_yz= (E - C) mod12=4.\n\nSum 9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, no major or minor.\n\nThus, the code would output 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nThen, read the input as a list.\n\nConvert each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, compute d_xy and d_yz.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major' and exit.\n\nElse, if any permutation meets the minor condition, output 'minor' and exit.\n\nElse, after checking all permutations, output 'strange'.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G'] → [0,4,7].\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7):\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo, code outputs 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: ['C# B F'] → [1,10,5].\n\nCheck permutation (10,1,5):\n\nd_xy= (1-10) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz= (5-1) mod12=4.\n\nSo, minor.\n\nSample Input 3: ['A B H'] → [9,10,11].\n\nCheck all permutations:\n\n(9,10,11): d_xy=1, d_yz=1 → sum 2.\n\n(9,11,10): d_xy= (11-9) mod12=2, d_yz= (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nSum 13.\n\n(10,9,11): d_xy= (9-10) mod12=11, d_yz=2 → sum13.\n\n(10,11,9): d_xy=1, d_yz= (9-11) mod12=10 → sum11.\n\n(11,9,10): d_xy= (9-11) mod12=10, d_yz=1 → sum11.\n\n(11,10,9): d_xy= (10-11) mod12=11, d_yz= (9-10) mod12=11 → sum22.\n\nSo, none meet major or minor conditions. Output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the sum of d_xy and d_yz is 7, but the individual distances are not 4 and3 or 3 and4?\n\nFor example, suppose d_xy=5 and d_yz=2. Sum is7, but not a major or minor.\n\nSo, the code correctly ignores it.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nImport permutations from itertools.\n\nRead the input, split into three notes.\n\nCreate the note_to_index mapping.\n\nConvert to indices.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nCompute d_xy and d_yz.\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nIf any, print and exit.\n\nElse, print 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnote_indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. A major chord is defined by specific distances between its notes, as is a minor chord. We will check all possible permutations of the given notes to identify the correct chord type.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned a numerical index based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to calculate distances between notes using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. If these distances match the criteria for a major (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or minor (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) chord, we classify the triad accordingly.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid major or minor chord is found, we output the result and terminate the program. If no valid chord is found after checking all permutations, we classify the triad as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnote_indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(note_indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Representation**: Each note is mapped to an index from 0 to 11 based on its position in the musical scale.\n- **Permutations Check**: Using permutations from the itertools module, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n- **Major and Minor Chords Check**: We check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If a match is found, we print the result and exit. If no match is found after all permutations are checked, we print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the type of chord by leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic, providing a robust solution to the problem.",
