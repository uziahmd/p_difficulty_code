There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. The tournament is a knockout style, which means each game results in one player being eliminated. The winner continues until they lose. But there's a specific rule here: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, for example, if a player has played 2 games, they can only face someone who has played 1 or 2 games.\n\nOur goal is to determine the maximum number of games the winner (let's say player 1) can play, given n players.\n\nHmm. So, what's the strategy here? I think it's about structuring the tournament so that player 1 can play as many games as possible by strategically choosing opponents in a way that satisfies the rule.\n\nLet me think about small examples to get a pattern.\n\nFor n=2: Only one game. So the answer is 1.\n\nFor n=3: Player 1 can play against two players. How? In the first round, player 1 plays against someone (say player 2). Then player 1 wins and goes to the next round. Now, the opponent could be player 3. Wait, but after playing one game, can player 1 play another game when their count is 1 and the opponent's count is 0? No, because the difference is 1, which is allowed. Wait, the rule says the numbers must differ by no more than one. So after one game, if the opponent has zero, that's a difference of one, so it's allowed. So yes, player 1 can play two games.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the initial rounds. For n=3, the first game is between two players, then the winner plays the third. So player 1 can play two games.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nWhat about n=4? The sample says the output is 2. Hmm, why?\n\nIn the case of four players, if player 1 plays two games, but perhaps not three. Because in the first round, you have two matches: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4. Then in the second round, 1 plays 3. That's two games for player 1. But could he play more? Suppose we structure the tournament differently. Maybe have 1 play 2, then 1 plays 3, but wait, after two games, the opponent would have to have either one or two games. If 1 has two, the opponent can't have less than one, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the maximum possible number of games the winner can play. It's probably related to the Fibonacci sequence or something similar, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as a binary tree where each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial players. Each internal node represents a match between two players. The root is the final match, whose winner is the tournament winner.\n\nBut the key is that for any two players to meet in a match, the number of games they've played before must differ by at most one.\n\nWait, but the number of games each has played depends on their path to the final. So, for the winner to have as many games as possible, we need to arrange the tournament such that the winner's path is as long as possible, while ensuring that each opponent in their path is compatible with the game rule.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by finding the largest k such that the sum of certain terms equals n.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because in each step, the number of new players added is based on the sum of the previous two steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\nFor k=1, f(1)=2 (needs 2 players).\n\nFor k=2, how many players? We need the winner to play two games. The first game is against someone (player A), then the second game is against someone else (player B). But for the second game, player B must have played either 0 or 1 games. Since the winner already has 1, the opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nWait, in the second game, the winner has played 1 game, and the opponent has played 0 or 1. So the opponent could be a player who hasn't played yet (so 0), or someone who has played once.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's see.\n\nIf the winner has played 1 game, then the next game can be against",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the structure of the tournament can be thought of in terms of Fibonacci numbers. This is because each additional game the winner plays requires adding a new player in a way that follows the Fibonacci sequence. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The tournament is a knockout style, meaning each loss eliminates a player. The rule that two players can only face each other if their previous game counts differ by at most one leads us to consider a recursive structure.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The number of players needed for the winner to play k games follows the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players required for k games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n3. **Algorithm**: We compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the required number of players exceeds the given n. The largest k for which the Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n gives the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    k = len(fib) - 2\n    while k > 0 and fib[k] > n:\n        k -= 1\n    return k\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the next value exceeds the given number of players `n`.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: The length of the Fibonacci sequence minus 2 gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. If the Fibonacci number exceeds `n`, we adjust `k` accordingly to ensure it does not exceed `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
