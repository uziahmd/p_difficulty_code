    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The first thing that comes to mind is that for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the resulting array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities. But wait, the problem constraints say n can be up to 1e5, which is 100,000. If I try to do this naively, like checking each element by creating a new array each time, that's going to be O(n^2) time, which won't work because 1e10 operations are way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let me see. The key here is to find for each element, what happens when I remove it. What affects the max and min? Well, if the element I'm removing is either the current max or the current min, then removing it might change the overall max or min of the array.\n\nWait, but for other elements, their presence doesn't affect the max or min. So perhaps the optimal choice is to look for the element whose removal reduces the max as much as possible, or increases the min as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal instability after removing an element is determined by the next highest or lowest elements after removing it. So, for each element a[i], I need to consider the array without a[i] and compute its max and min.\n\nBut computing max and min each time for n-1 elements is O(n) per operation, which again is O(n^2). That's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so I need a way to precompute some information so that for any element, I can quickly determine the max and min of the array excluding that element.\n\nOne idea is to find the global max and see if there are multiple occurrences. Similarly for the min. Because if the max occurs more than once, then removing one occurrence won't change the max. Same for the min.\n\nSo, let's think about it:\n\nCompute the global min (min_val) and the count of how many times it appears (min_count).\nCompute the global max (max_val) and the count of how many times it appears (max_count).\n\nNow, for each element a[i], if a[i] is the global min, then when we remove it, the new min will be the next smallest value in the array. Similarly, if a[i] is the global max, the new max will be the next largest value.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because when we remove a[i], it's possible that the new max is less than the global max if a[i] was the only one with that value. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the global min and its count.\n2. Find the global max and its count.\n3. For each element, check if it's the current min or max.\n   a. If it's the min, then the new min would be the second smallest value in the array.\n   b. If it's the max, the new max would be the second largest value.\n4. Compute the potential instability for each case and track the minimum.\n\nBut how do I find the second smallest and second largest efficiently?\n\nHmm, another idea: sort the array. Then, for each element, determine what would happen if I remove it.\n\nWait, but sorting the array for n=1e5 is manageable, since it's O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nOnce sorted, I can precompute prefix and suffix minima and maxima.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nAfter sorting the array, for each i, the new array is the sorted array without a[i]. The instability is the max minus min of this new array. Since the array is already sorted, the min is the first element (unless i=0), and the max is the last element (unless i =n-1).\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because when you remove an element from a sorted array, the min and max of the remaining elements are simply the first and last elements of the original sorted array, except when the removed element is the first or last.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I have a sorted array, and I remove any element, the min is the first element, and the max is the last. Because all elements are in order. So for the new array, the min is the same as the original min, unless the removed element was the only occurrence of the min. Similarly, the max remains the same unless the removed element was the only max.\n\nWait, wait! No, that's not right. Because when you remove an element, the min could change only if that element was the only min. Otherwise, the min remains the same.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nSuppose the array is sorted",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is the difference between its maximum and minimum values. When we remove an element, the instability can either decrease or increase depending on whether the removed element was contributing to the current max or min.\n2. **Global Min and Max**: Compute the global minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) of the array, along with their counts.\n3. **Sorted Array Insight**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the impact of removing each element. The sorted array helps us quickly identify the second smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability when an element is removed.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each element, if it is the global min or max, the new min or max will be the next smallest or largest value in the sorted array. This allows us to compute the potential instability without repeatedly recalculating max and min for each possible removal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Sort the array\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    \n    # Precompute prefix and suffix min and max\n    prefix_min = [a_sorted[0]] * n\n    prefix_max = [a_sorted[0]] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a_sorted[i])\n        prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a_sorted[i])\n    \n    suffix_min = [a_sorted[-1]] * n\n    suffix_max = [a_sorted[-1]] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a_sorted[i])\n        suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a_sorted[i])\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Now, check for each element: what happens when it's removed\n    for i in range(n):\n        current = a_sorted[i]\n        \n        # If current is not min or max, then new min is prefix_min[i-1] and new max is suffix_max[i+1]\n        if current != a_sorted[0] and current != a_sorted[-1]:\n            new_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n            new_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n            instability = new_max - new_min\n            if instability < min_instability:\n                min_instability = instability\n        else:\n            # If current is min, find the next min (prefix_min[i-1] if i>0)\n            if current == a_sorted[0]:\n                if i == 0:\n                    next_min = a_sorted[1]\n                else:\n                    next_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n                \n                # If current is max, find next max (suffix_max[i+1] if i <n-1)\n                if current == a_sorted[-1]:\n                    if i == n-1:\n                        next_max = a_sorted[n-2]\n                    else:\n                        next_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n                \n                # Compute new instability based on whether it's min or max being removed\n                if current == a_sorted[0]:\n                    new_min = next_min\n                    new_max = a_sorted[-1]\n                elif current == a_sorted[-1]:\n                    new_min = a_sorted[0]\n                    new_max = next_max\n                else:\n                    continue  # This shouldn't happen since current is either min or max\n                \n                instability = new_max - new_min\n                if instability < min_instability:\n                    min_instability = instability\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves sorting the array and precomputing prefix and suffix minima and maxima to efficiently determine the impact of removing each element. By leveraging these precomputed values, we can quickly evaluate the new min and max when each element is removed, allowing us to compute the instability in constant time for each element.
