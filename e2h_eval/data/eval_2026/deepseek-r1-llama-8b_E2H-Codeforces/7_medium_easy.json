The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a snowflake graph with n vertices can exist. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, and I need to check for each test case if such a graph is possible.\n\nLet's break down the snowflake structure. The initial graph has one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to this initial one. So after the first step, there are 1 + k = k+1 vertices. But wait, the initial step is when you connect the initial vertex to k new ones, which means each of those k has one edge (to the initial), so they are leaves. \n\nThen, each vertex that has only one edge (i.e., a leaf) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So after the first expansion, each of those k leaves will spawn another k leaves, making each of them have degree k+1. Wait no: each leaf has one edge, so each such vertex will add k new edges, making their degree 1 + k = k+1. But this process must happen for all leaves after the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a tree. Because each node that is a leaf (degree 1) must branch into k children. So the structure is a kind of rooted tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k+1 children, but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial node is connected to k nodes. So after the first step, the initial node has degree k, and each of the k nodes has degree 1. Now, each of these k nodes must each create k new children. So each of them adds k nodes, so the next level has k * k = k² nodes. So after this second step, the initial node has degree k, the next layer has k nodes each with degree k, and the third layer has k² nodes each with degree 1.\n\nSo the total number of vertices would be 1 (initial) + k (first layer) + k² (second layer). But wait, in the problem statement, the initial step is connecting the initial to k new nodes. Then, each vertex with only one edge (so the initial node isn't considered because it has k edges) must be connected to k new nodes. So the initial node is not a leaf anymore after the first step because its degree is k>1. So the leaves are only the nodes added in the first step and any subsequent steps.\n\nWait, no. After the first step, the initial node is connected to k leaves. Then, each of those leaves must be connected to k new nodes. So each of those k leaves becomes a parent of k new nodes. So after the second step, the leaves are the k² nodes. Then, each of those k² nodes must be connected to k new nodes, but the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do just the first expansion (k nodes) and then perform the step on each of those, adding another k per node, resulting in k² leaves. But wait, no. Because the initial step is the first step. Then, the second step is expanding all the leaves (the k nodes from the first step) into k² nodes. So the minimal snowflake has 1 + k + k² vertices.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step where each leaf is expanded by k nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do the initial step (connecting to k nodes) and then perform the expansion step once. So yes, the minimal total nodes is 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, but what if k=2? Then the minimal snowflake would have 1 + 2 + 4 =7 nodes. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes after m steps is something else. Or perhaps each step is a layer of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, the tree can be thought of as having the initial node as the root, and each node in the tree has exactly k children except for the root, which has k children. Then, every node except the root has exactly k children. Wait, no, because the root is connected to k nodes, which are leaves. Then, each of those k leaves must add k more, making each of them have k children. So the root has k children, each of those has k children, etc. So the tree is a perfect k-ary tree of depth d, but wait, how?\n\nWait, the root has k children. Each of those has k children. So the tree is a full k-ary tree with some depth.\n\nWait, the total number of nodes in such a tree is given by the sum of a geometric series. For example, a perfect k-ary tree of depth h has (k^(h+1) - 1)/(k-1) nodes.\n\nBut in our case, the tree doesn't have to be perfect. Because the expansion step is done at least once. So the minimal tree is when the root has k children, each of those has k children, etc., but perhaps the expansion stops after some steps.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nEach vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., a leaf) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process starts with the initial node connected to k leaves. Then, each of those k leaves must be expanded into k new nodes. So after this expansion, each of the k leaves becomes a node of degree k, and each adds k new leaves. So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nThen, the expansion step is done again on all the new leaves, which are k² in number. Each of them adds k leaves, leading to 1 + k + k² + k³ nodes. And so on.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the step of expanding each leaf into k nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when the initial node is connected to k nodes, and then each of those k nodes is connected to k new nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, is that the case? Because the initial step is when the initial node is connected to k nodes. Then, the second step is expanding each of those k nodes into k new nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nYes. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k². But for some k, like k=2, that gives 7, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as 1 + k*(m), where m is a sum of k^i for i=0 to s, and s >=1 (since the expansion is done at least once). Wait, no. Wait, the expansion is done on all leaves after each step. So the structure is a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + k³ + ... + k^d, where d >= 2 (since the expansion is done at least once, which requires that the initial leaves have been expanded once, meaning that the depth is at least two levels).\n\nWait, let's think about the layers:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root)\nLayer 1: k nodes\nLayer 2: k² nodes\nLayer 3: k³ nodes\n...\nAfter d layers, the total is sum_{i=0}^{d} k^i.\n\nBut the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the expansion is done once. That is, the tree has layers 0,1,2. So sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut wait, if the expansion is done multiple times, then the tree has more layers. For example, if expansion is done twice, then layers 0,1,2,3. So the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut the problem allows for any number of expansions as long as it's at least once. So for a given n, we need to find if n can be represented as 1 +k*(something), where something is a sum of k^i for i>=0 and the sum has at least two terms beyond the first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model n as follows:\n\nn = 1 + k*(s), where s is a sum of a geometric series with ratio k, and the number of terms in s is at least 2.\n\nBecause the initial node is 1, then each expansion adds k^i for i starting from 1.\n\nWait, let's compute the total nodes:\n\nAfter the initial step (layer 1): 1 + k nodes.\n\nThen, each expansion step adds a new layer. So the total after m layers is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i.\n\nBut since the expansion must be done at least once, m must be at least 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is layer 1, which is required. Then, the expansion step is done on each of the layer 1 nodes, which adds layer 2. So the minimal is m=2 layers.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but perhaps the expansion can be done multiple times. Like, after layer 2, each of the layer 2 nodes can be expanded again, adding layer 3, and so on.\n\nSo for a general case, the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}) ), where m is the number of expansion steps, m >=1.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nWhen we do the first expansion step, each of the k nodes in layer 1 adds k children, leading to layer 2: k² nodes.\n\nSo the total becomes 1 +k +k².\n\nIf we do another expansion step on each of the layer 2 nodes, each adds k children, leading to layer 3: k³ nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the total is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d is the maximum depth, which is 1 + the number of expansion steps. Because the initial step is layer 1, and each expansion step adds a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the total number of nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers beyond the initial. Because for a full k-ary tree of depth m, the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But in our case, the tree is a full k-ary tree with depth m, where m is at least 2 (since the expansion is done at least once).\n\nWait, let's see: for k=2, the minimal is 1+2+4=7. Which is (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. So yes, that matches.\n\nSo, for a snowflake, n must be equal to (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) where m >=3, because the minimal is m=3 (sum up to k^2, which is (k^3-1)/(k-1)).\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate:\n\nsum_{i=0}^2 k^i = 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Yes.\n\nSo, for a snowflake, n must be equal to (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m >=3, and k>1.\n\nSo, for each n, we need to determine if there exists k>1 and m>=3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, n can be written as (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m >=3.\n\nSo, the task is to, for each n, check if it can be expressed in such a form.\n\nNow, how to find this efficiently for n up to 1e18?\n\nWe need to iterate over possible m values and see if (n*(k-1) +1) is a perfect power of k for some k>1.\n\nWait, rearranging the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nWhich is same as (k^m -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo, n(k-1) +1 = k^m.\n\nSo for each possible m, we can try to compute if there exists a k>1 such that k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut trying all possible m up to log2(1e18) is feasible, because 1e18 is about 60 bits, so log2 is 60, so m can be up to 60.\n\nSo, for each test case n:\n\nFor m from 3 to max possible (like up to 60), do the following:\n\nCheck if there exists an integer k>1 such that k^m = n*(k-1) +1.\n\nRearranged: k^m - n*k + (n -1) =0.\n\nBut solving this for k is difficult, but perhaps we can fix m and try to find k via binary search or trial.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, compute k as the solution to the equation and check if it's integer.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each m, starting from 3 up to the maximum possible (since k^m can't exceed n, as (k^m -1)/(k-1) is n), compute what k could be.\n\nWait, for a given m, the minimal k is 2. Let's see what the maximum m can be.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible m for a given n? Since for m=3, the minimal n is 7 (for k=2), and for larger m, n increases.\n\nBut for very large n, m can't be too big. For example, for n=1e18, m can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each m from 3 to 60, we can try to find a k.\n\nBut for each m, how?\n\nLet me think: For a fixed m, we can express the equation as:\n\nk^m = n*(k-1) +1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nk^m -n*k + (n-1) =0\n\nThis is a polynomial equation in k of degree m. Solving this directly is not feasible for large m.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's try to find k for each m.\n\nWe can treat this as a function f(k) =k^m -n*k + (n-1). We want to find k>1 such that f(k)=0.\n\nWe can try to find k by binary search for each m.\n\nBut how to determine the search range for k?\n\nFor each m, the function f(k) is increasing for k>1. Because for k>1, the term k^m grows faster than linear terms.\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search in the range [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is such that k^m <= n*k -1 +1 (wait, no. Let me think differently.)\n\nWait, for fixed m, the function f(k) =k^m -n*k + (n-1).\n\nWe can find the possible k's where f(k) =0.\n\nLet me consider that for a fixed m, the value of k must be such that k^m <= n*k + (n-1). But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed m, let's see for k=2: f(2) =2^m -2n +n-1= 2^m -n -1.\n\nIf this is positive, then the function increases as k increases, so maybe k is larger. If negative, then perhaps k is smaller.\n\nBut binary search seems tricky because the function may not cross zero.\n\nWait, but for each m, is there a possible k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, we can compute k such that k^m is approximately n*(k-1) +1.\n\nBut even so, finding k is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps we can take logarithms.\n\nWe have k^m = n*(k-1) +1.\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nm ln k = ln(n(k-1)+1)\n\nBut this doesn't directly help because it's hard to solve for k.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible m (from 3 to 60), compute the minimal k such that k^m exceeds n*(k-1)+1, and see if any k in that m satisfies.\n\nWait, perhaps for each m, we can compute the approximate k using iterative methods.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can compute the possible k in a certain range and check if f(k) is zero.\n\nBut considering that t is up to 1e4 and m is up to 60, this might be manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nLoop over m from 3 to log_max (like up to 60):\n\n   Try to find an integer k>1 such that k^m = n*(k-1) +1.\n\n   To find k, perform a binary search between low=2 and high=n (since for k> n, k^m is way bigger than n(k-1)+1).\n\nWait, for example, when m=3:\n\nWe have k^3 = n*(k-1) +1.\n\nWe can try to find k in [2, ... , some upper limit].\n\nWait, but for each m, the function f(k) is monotonically increasing for k>1. Because the derivative of k^m is m k^{m-1}, which is positive for k>0. So for fixed m, f(k) increases with k.\n\nThus, for each m, the equation f(k)=0 has at most one real root. So if such a root exists, it's unique.\n\nSo for each m, we can binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if f(k) is zero.\n\nBut how to set the high for the binary search?\n\nWell, for k=2, f(k) =2^m - 2n +n-1 =2^m -n -1.\n\nIf 2^m >n+1, then f(2) is positive. For higher k, f(k) increases, so the root, if exists, is larger than 2.\n\nIf f(2) <=0, then perhaps the root is less than 2, but since k>1, it's not valid.\n\nWait, for example, n=7, m=3:\n\nf(2) =8 -14 +6 =0 → so k=2 is a solution.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=13, m=3:\n\nk^3 =13*(k-1) +1 → k^3 =13k -12 → k^3 -13k +12=0.\n\nTesting k=2: 8 -26 +12= -6 <0.\n\nk=3:27-39 +12=0 → yes. So k=3, m=3.\n\nSo for n=13, it's possible.\n\nSo, for each m, we can:\n\nCompute f(2) = 2^m -n*2 +n-1 = 2^m -n -1.\n\nIf f(2) is positive, then perhaps a higher k exists.\n\nIf f(2) is zero, then k=2 is a solution.\n\nIf f(2) is negative, then no solution for this m.\n\nSo, for each m, the binary search is only needed if f(2) is positive.\n\nWait, but perhaps f(2) is positive but the equation is satisfied for a higher k. So for m, we can proceed as:\n\nFor a given m:\n\nCompute lower=2, upper= ?\n\nWe can set upper as the maximum possible k, such that k^m <= n*k -1 +1 → but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since for k=2, f(k) is 2^m -n-1.\n\nIf 2^m >n+1, then f(k=2) is positive.\n\nBut for larger k, f(k) increases, so the root (if exists) is somewhere above 2.\n\nSo, for each m, the binary search can be done between low=2 and high=...?\n\nWait, but for larger k, say k approaches sqrt(n), perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the maximum possible k is when k^m is roughly n*(k-1) → but this is unclear.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search, we can set the high as min( (n)^(1/(m-1)), ... )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps setting high as 2e9 is sufficient, since for m=3, k can't be larger than cube root of (n* (k-1) +1), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for each m, the maximum possible k is such that k^m <= n*(k-1) +1.\n\nBut since k^m is roughly O(nk), for k^m ~ n*k → k^(m-1) ~n → k ~n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo for m=3, k is up to around cube root of (n *k) → but this is circular.\n\nPerhaps, for binary search, we can set high as n^(1/(m-1)) + 1.\n\nBut for m=3, high is about n^(1/2) +1.\n\nBut for m=60, high is about n^(1/59) +1, which for n=1e18 is about 10^18^(1/59) is about 10^(18/59) ≈ 10^0.305≈ 2.02, so high=3.\n\nSo for m=60, the binary search would have high=3.\n\nWhich is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n<3, output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 3 to log2(n)+1:\n\n          compute f(k) =k^m -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\n          Binary search for k in [2, high], where high is min(2e9, n^(1/(m-1)) +1 )\n\n          if any m has a solution, output YES.\n\n   else, after all m, output NO.\n\nBut wait, how to compute high for each m?\n\nWe can compute high as follows:\n\nWe know that k^m <= n*(k-1) +1.\n\nAssume that k is as large as possible.\n\nWe can approximate k^m ~ n*k.\n\nSo k^(m-1) ~n.\n\nThus, k ~ n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo, for binary search, we can set high to be n^(1/(m-1)) + 1.\n\nBut calculating n^(1/(m-1)) could be expensive for very large m, but in code, perhaps using exponentiation is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can start with high=2, and keep doubling until k^m exceeds the right side, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut perhaps for each m, the maximum possible k is small enough that a binary search is feasible.\n\nSo, in code, for each m from 3 to max_m (say 60):\n\n   Compute low =2.\n\n   Find high such that (high)^m > n*(high-1) +1.\n\n   Once high is found, binary search between low and high.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for each m, we can compute the initial high as 2, and keep increasing it exponentially until (high)^m > n*(high-1) +1.\n\nBut for some m and n, high can be quickly determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, we can compute the maximum possible k as the minimum between some upper bound and a value that makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps in code, it's better to use binary search with a high that's initially 2, and then increase it until (high)^m exceeds the right-hand side.\n\nWait, for example, for m=3 and n=1e18:\n\nWe can compute k^3 =1e18*(k-1)+1.\n\nWe can approximate k^3 ~1e18 *k.\n\nSo k^2 ~1e18 → k~1e9.\n\nSo high can be up to 1e9 for m=3.\n\nBut for m=4, k^4 ~1e18 *k → k^3 ~1e18 → k~1e6.\n\nSo high can be up to 1e6.\n\nThus, for m=60, the high would be up to about 2.\n\nSo in code, for each m, the binary search can be done quickly.\n\nSo, the steps for each n are:\n\nFor each m from 3 to 60:\n\n   Compute the function f(k) =k^m -n*k + (n-1).\n\n   Perform binary search for k in [2, high], where high is determined as the smallest integer such that k^m > n*(k-1)+1.\n\n   If during the binary search, we find a k where f(k) ==0, return YES.\n\nIf after all m, no such k is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nBut for very large exponents, calculating k^m can cause integer overflow. So in Python, this is not a problem because it handles big integers.\n\nBut for each candidate k, computing k^m could be time-consuming for large m and large k. So for m=60, and k=1e9, k^m is 1e540, which is a huge number. But Python can handle it.\n\nBut with t=1e4 and m up to 60, this may be manageable.\n\nWait, but for each m, the binary search could take up to log2(high) steps, each requiring computing k^m.\n\nFor high up to 1e9, log2 is about 30 steps. For m=60, each step is O(1) in terms of operations, but computing k^m is O(1) in Python, because it's handled internally as efficient exponentiation.\n\nThus, for each test case, the maximum number of iterations is 60 * 30 = 1800 steps per test case. With t=1e4, that's 18 million steps, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, no: 1e4 * 60 * 30 = 1.8e5 *1e4= 1.8e9 operations. That's way too much.\n\nWait, 1e4 test cases, each taking 60 m's, each m taking 30 steps (binary search) → 1e4 * 60 *30 = 1.8e6 steps. No, wait 1e4 * 60 *30 is 1.8e6 steps. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nWait, 1e4 is 10,000. 60 is 60. 30 is 30. So 10,000 *60 *30 = 18,000,000 steps. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nSo now, the code outline is:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   If n < 3: print NO.\n\n   Else:\n\n      for m in 3 to 60:\n\n          compute f(k) =k^m -n*k + (n-1).\n\n          Binary search for k in [2, high], where high is determined such that k^m > n*(k-1) +1.\n\n          if during binary search, find k where f(k) ==0: output YES and proceed to next test case.\n\n      After all m, output NO.\n\nSo the key is to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute high for each m.\n\nWe can start with high=2, and while (high^m) <= n*(high-1)+1: multiply high by 2.\n\nOnce (high^m) > n*(high-1)+1, we can stop.\n\nBut computing high^m can be slow for large m and high.\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is optimized, so perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can compute an initial high as 2, and double it until high^m exceeds RHS.\n\nBut for m=60 and high=1e9, high^m is 1e540, which is way beyond 64-bit numbers, but Python can handle it.\n\nBut for m=60 and high=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, which for n=1e18 is manageable.\n\nSo let's write code for this.\n\nImplementing the binary search:\n\ndef check(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60\n    for m in range(3, max_m+1):\n        # Function to compute f(k)\n        def f(k):\n            return (k**m) - n * k + (n-1)\n        # Find high\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            val = high ** m\n            rhs = n * (high -1) +1\n            if val > rhs:\n                break\n            high *=2\n            if high > 2e18:  # Avoid overflow?\n                break\n        # Now perform binary search between low=2 and high\n        low = 2\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n            val_mid = mid ** m\n            rhs_mid = n * (mid -1) +1\n            if val_mid == rhs_mid:\n                return True\n            elif val_mid < rhs_mid:\n                # Need to increase k\n                low = mid +1\n            else:\n                high = mid -1\n    return False\n\nBut wait, this code may have an issue. For example, for m=3 and n=7, the function f(k) for k=2 is 8 -14 +6=0 → returns True.\n\nIn the code, the binary search starts with high=2, but in the loop, high is doubled until high^m > rhs.\n\nBut for m=3 and n=7:\n\nAt high=2: 8 <= 7*1 +1 → 8 <=8 → yes. So high *=2 →4.\n\nCheck 4^3=64> 7*(3)+1=22 → yes. So high is 4.\n\nNow binary search between 2 and4.\n\nMid=3:\n\n3^3=27 → 27 vs 7*2+1=15 → 27>15 → high=2.\n\nMid= (2+2)//2=2 → 8=7*1+1 → yes → return True.\n\nSo it works.\n\nAnother test case: n=13.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nhigh starts at 2.\n\n2^3=8 <=13*(1)+1=14 → yes. high=4.\n\n4^3=64>13*3+1=40 → yes.\n\nBinary search between 2 and4.\n\nmid=3: 27 vs 13*2+1=27 → equal → return True.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother test case: n=255.\n\nLooking for m=3:\n\nCheck if 255 can be written as (k^3 -1)/(k-1) → which is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut 255 =1 +k +k² →k² +k -254=0 → discriminant is 1+1016=1017 → sqrt(1017)=~31.89. So k=( -1 ±32)/2 → k=(31)/2=15.5 → not integer.\n\nSo for m=3, no solution.\n\nWhat about m=4?\n\nWe need to find k such that k^4 =255*(k-1)+1 →k^4=255k -254.\n\nLet's try k=4: 256=1020-254=766 → no.\n\nk=3:81= 255*2-254=510-254=256 → 81 !=256.\n\nk=2:16=255*1-254=1 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps m=4 is not the case.\n\nWait, what is 255? It's 256-1=2^8 -1.\n\nSo for k=2 and m=8, sum is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128= 255.\n\nSo for m=8, k=2.\n\nSo in the code, when m=8:\n\nhigh starts at 2.\n\n2^8=256.\n\nn*(2-1)+1=255*1+1=256.\n\nSo val_mid=256 == rhs_mid=256 → return True.\n\nSo the code would find k=2, m=8, and return YES.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle this.\n\nAnother test case: n=1000000000000000000.\n\nWe need to check if it can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m>=3.\n\nFor example, k=999999999 and m=1: but m must be >=3.\n\nWait, perhaps for k=1e9, m=3: sum is 1 + 1e9 + 1e18 → which is way larger than 1e18.\n\nNo, that's 1e18+1e9+1, which is larger than 1e18.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=3, n=1e18.\n\nWe have k^3 =1e18*(k-1)+1.\n\nWe can approximate k^3 ~1e18 *k → k^2 ~1e18 →k=1e9.\n\nSo compute k=1e9.\n\nCompute 1e9^3=1e27, which is way larger than 1e18*(1e9 -1) +1 → which is about 1e27-1e18+1.\n\nSo 1e27 is larger than that.\n\nSo for m=3, no solution.\n\nBut for m= something else.\n\nWait, perhaps n=1e18 can be expressed as (k^m-1)/(k-1).\n\nLooking for k=999,999,999 and m=3: sum is 1 +999,999,999 + (999,999,999)^2 → which is way larger than 1e18.\n\nWait, 1e18 is 10^18. Let's see:\n\n(999,999,999)^2 is about 1e18.\n\nSo 1 +999,999,999 +999,999,999² → sum is 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps n=1e18 can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for k= 1e9 and m=2: sum is 1 +1e9 +1e18 → which is 1e18+1e9+1. But m must be >=3.\n\nSo perhaps no.\n\nSo in the sample input, the last test case is 1e18, and the output is NO.\n\nWhich is correct according to the sample.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle this.\n\nAnother test case: n=10101.\n\nSample output is YES.\n\nSo, for n=10101.\n\nWe can look for m=3.\n\nEquation: k^3 =10101*(k-1)+1 → k^3 -10101k +10100=0.\n\nLet's try k=21: 9261 - 212121 +10100 → negative.\n\nk=22: 10648 -222222 +10100 → negative.\n\nWait, perhaps m=4.\n\nEquation: k^4=10101*(k-1)+1 →k^4 -10101k +10100=0.\n\nTry k=10: 10000 -101010 +10100 =-91010 → no.\n\nk=100: 100^4=1e8 → 1e8 -10101*100 +10100=1e8-1010100+10100= 1e8-990100 → negative.\n\nWait, perhaps m=5.\n\nEquation: k^5=10101*(k-1)+1 →k^5 -10101k +10100=0.\n\nTrying k=10: 1e5 -101010 +10100= 1e5-90910=9100>0.\n\nk=9: 59049 -90909 +10100=59049-80809= -21760<0.\n\nSo there's a root between 9 and10. So k is not integer.\n\nSo no solution for m=5.\n\nWait, but sample output is YES. So perhaps for another m.\n\nMaybe m=4, k= 100:\n\nBut 100^4=1e8, 10101*99 +1= 10101*99= 999, 999 → +1 is 1,000,000.\n\n1e8 is 100,000,000, which is larger than 1e6.\n\nSo 100^4=1e8>1e6 → equation is 1e8 = 1e6 → no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps n=10101 is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 for some k.\n\nLet me compute 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =10101.\n\nWe can try k=20: 1 +20 +400 +8000= 8021 <10101.\n\nk=22: 1+22+484+10648=11155>10101.\n\nk=21: 1+21+441+9261= 96324 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps m=4: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4.\n\nFor k=10: sum is 1+10+100+1000+10000=11111>10101.\n\nk=9: sum is 1+9",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can exist. The snowflake graph is defined by specific expansion rules, and we need to check for each test case if such a graph is possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding `k` new vertices connected to each leaf node. This expansion must be done at least once. The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series.\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after `m` layers (expansions) can be expressed as `(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)`, where `k > 1` and `m >= 3`.\n3. **Algorithm**: For each test case, we check if `n` can be written in the form `(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)` for some integers `k > 1` and `m >= 3`. We use binary search to efficiently determine if such `k` exists for given `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60  # Since k^60 can be very large, but n is up to 1e18\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        # Function to compute f(k)\n        def f(k):\n            return (k ** m) - n * k + (n - 1)\n        # Find high using exponential search\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            val = high ** m\n            rhs = n * (high - 1) + 1\n            if val > rhs:\n                break\n            if high > 2e18:  # Avoid potential overflow issues\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low=2 and high\n        low = 2\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            val_mid = mid ** m\n            rhs_mid = n * (mid - 1) + 1\n            if val_mid == rhs_mid:\n                return True\n            elif val_mid < rhs_mid:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t+1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Snowflake Structure**: For each test case, we check if `n` can be expressed in the required form using a nested loop over possible values of `m` (from 3 to 60).\n3. **Exponential Search for High**: For each `m`, we determine an upper bound (`high`) for `k` using exponential search to avoid long iterations.\n4. **Binary Search**: For each `m`, we perform a binary search between `low` and `high` to find if there exists an integer `k` such that the equation holds true.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the result of the check, we print \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations that could form a valid snowflake graph, leveraging mathematical insights and efficient search techniques.",
