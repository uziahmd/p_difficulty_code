Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Petya wants to sell souvenirs. The goal is to maximize the total cost without exceeding the weight limit m. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a cost. Hmm, I need to find the best subset that fits within m weight and has the highest possible cost.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. Since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can group them by their weight. Like, keep track of how many of each weight we take, but that's not enough because the order in which we pick items affects the total cost.\n\nWait, perhaps using dynamic programming is the way to go. Because for each item, we decide whether to include it or not, and track the maximum cost up to certain weights.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, a standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, another thought: since each item's weight is either 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can precompute for each weight class the most valuable items, sorted in descending order of value per unit weight. Then, for each possible count of 3s, 2s, and 1s, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight: group1 (weight 1), group2 (weight 2), group3 (weight 3).\n2. Sort each group in descending order of their cost, so that the higher value items come first.\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group. This will allow us to quickly calculate the total cost for taking the top k items from each group.\n4. Then, iterate over all possible numbers of 3-weight items (from 0 to min(k, m//3)), then for each such number, iterate over possible 2-weight items (up to (m - 3*a)/2), and compute the remaining weight for 1-weight items. For each combination, calculate the total cost and keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut wait, even with this approach, the number of possibilities could be large. Let's see: for group3, the max possible is m//3, which is up to 1e5. Similarly for group2, it's (m - 3*a)//2, which could be up to 1.5e5 per a. And group1 could be up to (m -3a -2b) which varies.\n\nThis might not be efficient enough. Maybe there's a smarter way to limit the iterations.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible a (number of 3s), determine the maximum possible b (number of 2s) and c (number of 1s) such that 3a + 2b + c <= m. But even this seems like a lot of combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps we can loop a from 0 to the maximum possible (m//3), and then for each a, loop b from 0 to (m-3a)//2. Then, the remaining weight is m' = m -3a -2b. The maximum number of 1s we can take is min(c_max, m'), where c_max is the prefix sum for group1 up to m'. We can compute this quickly.\n\nThis way, for each a and b, we calculate the maximum possible 1s and get the total cost.\n\nThe question is, what is the time complexity? Let's see:\n\n- Sorting each group: O(n log n) for each group, but since n is 1e5, it's manageable.\n- Precomputing prefix sums: O(n) for each group.\n- Then, looping a from 0 to A_max (where A_max is m//3). For each a, loop b from 0 to B_max (which is (m-3a)//2). So the total iterations are roughly (m/3) * ((m - 3a)/2) / 2 → which for m=3e5, (1e5) * (1.5e5) = 1.5e10 operations. That's way too big.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for each a, the optimal b can be found in a more efficient manner. Or perhaps, considering that the items in group2 are already sorted, for each a, the best b is determined by the maximum prefix sum for 2s that allows the remaining weight to take as much as possible from group1.\n\nWait, maybe for each a, the optimal b is the maximum possible that doesn't exceed (m-3a)//2, and for each such b, the maximum c is min(prefix1[m' - 2b], ...). So perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums and for each a, loop through possible b's, but even that is too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of iterating through all possible a and b, perhaps we can find the best combination using the fact that the groups are independent except for the weight constraints.\n\nWait, another idea: since the 1s are the smallest weight, after choosing a and b, the remaining weight can take as many 1s as possible. But the 1s should be the ones with the highest cost. So for each a, the maximum b is the largest possible such that 2b <= (m - 3a). Then, for each a, the best b is the one that gives the highest possible sum of group2's prefix up to b, plus group1's prefix up to (m-3a-2b).\n\nBut again, trying all a and b is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given a, the optimal b can be found quickly using binary search. Because group2's prefix sum is non-decreasing. So for a fixed a, the maximum possible b is (m -3a)//2, but we can try different values of b and see which combination gives the best total cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given a, the best b is the one that maximizes the sum of group2's prefix[b] plus group1's prefix[r], where r is m -3a -2b.\n\nSo for each a, we can precompute the best possible b, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each a, we can compute the maximum possible b, and then find the best possible r = m -3a -2b. Then, group1's prefix for r is added to group2's prefix for b.\n\nBut how to choose b for maximum? It's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to take as many high-value items as possible, regardless of their weight. So, perhaps it's better to consider all items, sorted by their cost per weight, and select the top items until the weight exceeds m.\n\nBut that's similar to the standard knapsack problem, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nHmm. So maybe I'm stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nEach item has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. Let's precompute for each possible weight the best possible items.\n\nGroup the items into group1, group2, group3.\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\nNow, for any combination of a, b, c, where a is the number of group3 items, b the group2, and c group1, the total cost is prefix3[a] + prefix2[b] + prefix1[c], provided that 3a + 2b + c <= m.\n\nWe need to find a, b, c >=0 integers that maximize this sum under the constraint.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a, b, c such that 3a+2b+c ≤ m, and prefix3[a] + prefix2[b] + prefix1[c] is maximized.\n\nSo the question is, how to efficiently find a, b, c that satisfy the constraint and maximize the sum.\n\nThe variables are a, b, c, but they are interdependent because 3a + 2b +c can't exceed m.\n\nSo, perhaps we can loop a from 0 to max_a (m//3), and for each a, loop b from 0 to (m-3a)//2, then compute c_max = m -3a -2b, and take the maximum prefix1 up to c_max.\n\nBut this is O(A * B) where A is m//3 and B is (m -3a)/2 per a, which is O(m^2/6) in the worst case (since A is up to 1e5, B up to 1.5e5, product is 1.5e10). That's way too big.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each a, the best b is the maximum possible such that 2b is as large as possible, but also allowing for as many 1s as possible. Wait, but that's vague.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, we can find the optimal b by considering that for a given a, the maximum possible b is (m-3a)//2. But for each a, perhaps the optimal b is somewhere around that value, but how do we find it quickly?\n\nAlternatively, since group2's prefix sum is non-decreasing, perhaps for each a, the best b is the one that maximizes (prefix2[b] + prefix1[ (m-3a -2b) ]).\n\nBut how to find this b quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each a, we can compute the maximum possible b, and then see if adding more 1s is better.\n\nWait, another angle: since group1 is sorted, the best c for a given a and b is the maximum possible c, which is min( m-3a-2b, len(group1) ), but in terms of the prefix sum, it's just prefix1[c_max].\n\nSo for each a, the problem becomes: find the best b in group2, such that 2b <= (m-3a), and the sum of group2's b and group1's (m-3a - 2b) is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this b quickly.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each a, we can perform a binary search on b in group2. But since group2's prefix is non-decreasing, the maximum could be anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one that gives the maximum sum for group2's b plus group1's (m-3a - 2b). But how to model this.\n\nWait, for a given a, the weight used is 3a. The remaining weight is rem = m -3a.\n\nIn group2, we can take up to rem//2 items. For each possible b in 0..rem//2, the remaining weight for group1 is rem_b = rem - 2b.\n\nSo the total cost is prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem_b ].\n\nWe need to find the b that maximizes this sum, given that 0 <= b <= rem//2 and rem_b >=0.\n\nBut how to find this b efficiently.\n\nPerhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one that, when you subtract 2 from the weight, you're left with a rem_b that can take as many 1s as possible. So maybe for each a, we can find the b that maximizes prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem_b ].\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the function f(b) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[rem_b] is not necessarily monotonic, but perhaps it's unimodal, which would allow for ternary search. Alternatively, since rem_b = rem - 2b, which decreases as b increases, but the prefix1 may increase as rem_b increases.\n\nWait, no: as b increases, rem_b decreases. So as b increases, prefix1[rem_b] decreases or stays the same because it's a prefix sum.\n\nSo f(b) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem_b ] is equal to prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem - 2b ].\n\nAs b increases, prefix2[b] increases or stays the same, while prefix1[...] decreases. So the function f(b) is a trade-off between increasing and decreasing.\n\nHmm, but it's not clear whether f(b) has a single peak. If it does, then for each a, we can perform a binary or ternary search on b to find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the optimal b can be found quickly by checking a few candidates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, we can compute the best possible b by trying all possible b in group2 up to rem//2, but that's still O(B) per a, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but what's the size of group2? It could be up to 1e5. So for a=1e5 and b=1e5, it's 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nI need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group1 is sorted in descending order, for a given a and b, the best c is min( len(group1), rem_b ). So, perhaps for each a, the maximum possible b is (m - 3a) // 2, but beyond that, we can't take any more 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal b for a given a is (m-3a)//2, but perhaps taking fewer 2s allows for more 1s, which might give a higher total cost.\n\nBut how to find the optimal b quickly.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\n1. Pre-sort each group in descending order and compute their prefix sums.\n\n2. For each a in 0 to max_a (where max_a is m//3):\n\n   a. Compute rem = m - 3*a.\n\n   b. Now, for rem, we can take up to rem//2 2s and up to rem % 2 1s.\n\n   c. We need to find the best combination of b (number of 2s) and c (number of 1s) such that 2*b + c <= rem.\n\n      i. Since group2's prefix is non-decreasing and group1's is also non-decreasing, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one that when you take as many 2s as possible, but perhaps leaving some space for 1s.\n\n      ii. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one that maximizes (prefix2[b] + prefix1[rem - 2*b]).\n\nSo for each a, rem is fixed. Let's denote rem = R.\n\nWe can model this as trying to choose b, where 0 <= b <= R//2.\n\nFor each possible b, compute s = prefix2[b] + prefix1[ R - 2*b ].\n\nWe need to find the maximum s over all valid b.\n\nBut computing this for all b is O(R//2) per a, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each a, the maximum possible b is up to R//2. But R can be up to 3e5, so for a=0, R=3e5, that's 1.5e5 iterations per a, which is too slow.\n\nSo, we need a way to find the optimal b quickly for each a.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find that for each a, the optimal b is either the maximum possible, or the one that leaves some space for 1s.\n\nWait, for example, suppose R is 5:\n\nIf I take b=2, then c can be 1.\n\nIf I take b=1, then c can be 3.\n\nWhich is better depends on the prefix sums.\n\nBut without knowing the prefixes, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one that makes 2b as large as possible without making R-2b less than the number of 1s needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal b is the one where the marginal gain from adding another 2 is offset by the loss from reducing c.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps we can precompute for each a the best possible b by considering that the optimal point is when the next 2's cost is less than the next 1's cost.\n\nWait, but group2 and group1 are sorted, so their individual costs are non-increasing.\n\nSo, for each a, the decision is between taking another 2 (if its cost is higher than the next 1) or taking another 1.\n\nBut this isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the best b is the one that maximizes the sum of the top b 2s plus the top (R-2b) 1s.\n\nSince both group2 and group1 are sorted, the sum is prefix2[b] + prefix1[R - 2b].\n\nWe can precompute this for all a, but it's O(n) per a, which is still too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe for each a, we can find the optimal b quickly by considering that the function is convex or has a single peak.\n\nIf the function f(b) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[R - 2b] is unimodal, then for each a, we can perform a ternary search on b to find the maximum.\n\nIs this function unimodal?\n\nWell, as b increases, the term prefix2[b] increases or stays the same, while prefix1[R - 2b] decreases or stays the same.\n\nSo f(b) is a non-decreasing function up to a point and then starts to decrease. Or maybe it has multiple peaks.\n\nWait, suppose group2's items have very high cost compared to group1. Then, for lower b, adding more 2s would give a higher sum. Once group2's items run out, adding more 1s would help. So the function f(b) could be increasing up to a certain point, then start to decrease.\n\nAlternatively, if group1's items are very expensive, perhaps the function f(b) increases as b decreases.\n\nHmm, it's unclear. But perhaps the function is not strictly unimodal, making ternary search ineffective.\n\nAn alternative approach is needed.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group1 is sorted, for each a, the maximum possible c is R - 2b. So for a given a, the optimal b is the one that allows c to be as large as possible, but also the sum of group2 and group1 is maximized.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the maximum possible such that the next 2 is worth more than the next 1. Or vice versa.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: What if we consider that for each a, the best possible b is the one where the last 2 taken is as good as possible compared to the next 1.\n\nSo, for a given a, we can compute the maximum b where group2[b] > group1[c], where c is the next available 1.\n\nWait, but group1 is sorted, so group1[c] is group1[R - 2b - 1]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, we can compute the maximum b where group2[b] is greater than group1[k], where k is the next possible 1.\n\nBut again, not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is when adding another 2 would not be worth it compared to adding another 1.\n\nSo, find the largest b where group2[b] > group1[ R - 2b - 1 ].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe it's time to look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since the weight is small, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. For example, prioritize items with higher cost per unit weight.\n\nBut that doesn't work for the 0-1 knapsack problem, but maybe in this case, because the weights are small, it's possible.\n\nWait, but the problem requires selecting a subset, and the greedy approach may not yield the optimal solution. For example, sometimes taking a slightly cheaper item with a higher weight could allow taking more items overall, leading to a higher total cost.\n\nSo, I can't rely on a greedy approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem as a multi-dimensional problem. The state is the maximum cost for a given weight. But with m up to 3e5, the DP approach is O(m) time.\n\nWait, here's an idea: since the weight can be up to 3e5, and each item has a small weight, perhaps we can model the problem with a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum cost achievable with total weight w.\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0, and for each item, update the dp array.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, this is O(n*m), which is 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weights are small, perhaps we can use a sliding window or other techniques to optimize the DP.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since group1, group2, group3 are sorted, perhaps for each a (number of 3s), the optimal b is determined by the group2 and group1 prefix sums.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, we can compute the maximum possible b by considering that group2 and group1 are sorted, and find the best b via some mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think: For a given a, rem = m -3a.\n\nWe can take up to b_max = rem//2 2s, and up to c_max = rem % 2 1s.\n\nWait, but rem could be even or odd.\n\nSo, for each a:\n\nmax_b = rem // 2\n\nThen, the possible b ranges from 0 to max_b.\n\nWe need to find the b that maximizes prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem - 2*b ].\n\nSo, the problem is, for each a, find the b in 0..max_b that maximizes this sum.\n\nHow can this be done efficiently?\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each a the best b.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the maximum sum occurs at either b=0, b=max_b, or somewhere in between.\n\nBut that's not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is concave, and ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nSo, for each a, perform a ternary search on b in [0, max_b], compute the sum, and keep track of the maximum.\n\nThis would bring the time complexity down to O(A * log B), which is manageable.\n\nBecause A is up to 1e5, and log B is about 20, so 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For each a in 0 to max_a:\n\n   a. Compute rem = m - 3*a.\n\n   b. If rem <0, skip.\n\n   c. Compute max_b = rem // 2.\n\n   d. Perform a ternary search on b in [0, max_b], to find the b that maximizes prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem - 2*b ].\n\n   e. Update the global maximum cost.\n\nBut wait, is the function unimodal? Because ternary search requires that.\n\nAssuming that the function is unimodal, then yes.\n\nBut is it?\n\nAs b increases, prefix2[b] increases, while prefix1[ rem - 2b ] decreases.\n\nSo, the function could have a single peak where increasing b further would result in a decrease in the sum.\n\nYes, I think it's unimodal. So, ternary search is applicable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess the groups.\n\n- Iterate a from 0 to max_a.\n\n- For each a, compute rem and max_b.\n\n- Perform ternary search on b in [0, max_b] to find the b that maximizes the sum.\n\n- Keep track of the maximum sum.\n\nAdditionally, for each a, also check the endpoints (b=0 and b=max_b) in case the function isn't unimodal.\n\nWait, perhaps during the ternary search, it's possible that the maximum is at the edges, so we need to compare all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, the ternary search will find the maximum.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, grouping:\n\nWe'll read each item and add it to group1, group2, group3 based on weight.\n\nThen, sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example:\n\ngroup1_prefix[i] = sum of first i items in group1.\n\nSimilarly for group2 and group3.\n\nNow, for each a, 0 <= a <= min(max_a, len(group3)).\n\nCompute rem = m -3a.\n\nIf rem <0, continue.\n\nElse:\n\nmax_b = rem //2.\n\nWe need to find b in 0..max_b that maximizes group2's prefix[b] + group1's prefix[ rem - 2b ].\n\nBut rem-2b can't be negative. So, for each b, rem_b = rem - 2b must be >=0.\n\nWait, rem_b can be zero or positive.\n\nSo, group1's prefix is up to rem_b, but rem_b can't exceed the length of group1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor a in 0 to max_a:\n\n    rem = m -3*a\n\n    if rem <0: continue\n\n    max_b = rem // 2\n\n    # Now, find the best b in 0..max_b.\n\n    # Compute the best sum for this a.\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = max_b\n\n    best_sum = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) //3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n        s1 = prefix2[mid1] + min( prefix1[ rem - 2*mid1 ], len(group1) )\n\n        s2 = prefix2[mid2] + min( prefix1[ rem - 2*mid2 ], len(group1) )\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n\n            low = mid1 +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid2 -1\n\n    # After finding the peak, check all possible b's in the vicinity.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps it's better to perform the ternary search correctly.\n\n    # But perhaps a better way is to perform a loop from low to high and find the maximum.\n\n    # However, that's O(B) per a, which is too slow.\n\n    # So, perhaps for each a, try several candidate b's, including the endpoints and the ones around the peak.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the function is unimodal, the ternary search should find the maximum.\n\nSo, let's implement the ternary search.\n\nWait, but in practice, implementing ternary search can be tricky because of the integer nature of b.\n\nBut perhaps for each a, after finding the peak via ternary search, we can check a few points around the peak to ensure we find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of a full ternary search, for each a, we can compute the best possible b by trying a few candidates.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the best b is either 0, max_b, or the point where group2[b] is just larger than group1[ rem - 2b -1 ].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the optimal b is the one where group2[b] is as large as possible relative to group1's available slots.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea: To limit the number of b's checked per a, perhaps for each a, we can try a few possible b's, like the ones near the current best, and see which gives a better sum.\n\nBut that's heuristic and may not always find the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the best b is the one that makes the next 2's value as high as possible, and the remaining 1's as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, we can compute the optimal b as follows:\n\nThe sum is prefix2[b] + prefix1[ rem - 2b ].\n\nLet's think of it as a function of b. For each possible b, the sum is S(b) = p2[b] + p1[r], where r = rem - 2b.\n\nWe can represent this as S(b) = p2[b] + p1[ rem - 2b ].\n\nTo find the maximum S(b), perhaps for each a, we can find the b where p2[b] is as large as possible, and p1[r] is as large as possible.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I'm stuck, and I should look for similar problems or known approaches.\n\nUpon searching my mind, I recall that when dealing with items of different weights, especially small ones, a common approach is to split the items into groups based on their weights and then handle each group optimally, considering their contributions.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I think the best way forward is to proceed with the initial approach, using a ternary search for each a.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Pre-sort the groups and compute the prefix sums.\n\n- For each a from 0 to max_a:\n\n   a. Compute rem = m - 3*a.\n\n   b. If rem <0, continue.\n\n   c. Compute max_b = rem // 2.\n\n   d. Perform a ternary search on b in [0, max_b] to find the b that maximizes S = p2[b] + p1[ rem - 2*b ].\n\n   e. Also, make sure to check the boundaries, in case the function isn't strictly unimodal.\n\n   f. Compute the sum and update the global maximum.\n\nBut in code, how to implement this?\n\nImplementing ternary search for integers is manageable.\n\nWait, here's an outline:\n\ndef find_max_b(rem, p2, p1, max_b):\n    low = 0\n    high = max_b\n    best = 0\n    best_b = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        if high - low < 5:\n            for b in range(low, high+1):\n                current = p2[b] + (p1[ rem - 2*b ] if (rem - 2*b) >=0 else 0)\n                if current > best:\n                    best = current\n                    best_b = b\n            break\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) //3\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n        s1 = p2[mid1] + (p1[ rem - 2*mid1 ] if (rem - 2*mid1) >=0 else 0)\n        s2 = p2[mid2] + (p1[ rem - 2*mid2 ] if (rem - 2*mid2) >=0 else 0)\n        if s1 < s2:\n            low = mid1 + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid2 -1\n    return best\n\nWait, but this function tries a few points near the end of the ternary search to avoid missing the maximum due to integer rounding.\n\nThis way, even if the function isn't perfectly unimodal, it catches the maximum.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, this approach works.\n\nNow, in the code, for each a, call this function, and track the maximum sum.\n\nBut what about the cases where rem is negative?\n\nWe need to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nn=3, m=4.\n\nItems:\n\nItem 1: weight 1, cost 1.\n\nItem 2: weight 2, cost 2.\n\nItem3: weight 3, cost 3.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nAfter looking at the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, but perhaps the actual items are:\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['1 1', '2 2', '4 3'] etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct items are:\n\nWait, the first line after n and m is '1 1', meaning weight 1, cost 1.\n\nSecond line '2 2': weight 2, cost 2.\n\nThird line '4 3': weight 4, cost 3.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because 4> m=4, but perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, the sample input seems to be a list of lines, each representing a souvenir.\n\nBut perhaps the actual sample is:\n\nWait, the input is:\n\n3 4\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n4 3\n\nWait, but that's probably not. Because 4 is more than m=4, but perhaps it's allowed as the weight can be exactly m.\n\nWait, no, because in the sample output, the maximum cost is 3.\n\nWait, but let's not get bogged down now.\n\nIn any case, the approach remains the same.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each with wi and ci.\n\nSplit into group1, group2, group3 based on wi.\n\nSort each group in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nInitialize max_total =0.\n\nFor a in 0 to len(group3):\n\n   if 3*a > m: continue.\n\n   rem = m -3*a.\n\n   if rem <0: continue.\n\n   max_b = rem //2.\n\n   best_sum = 0.\n\n   best_b =0.\n\n   # Perform ternary search.\n\n   low =0\n\n   high = max_b\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       if high - low <5:\n\n           for b in range(low, high+1):\n\n               current_rem_b = rem -2*b\n\n               if current_rem_b <0:\n\n                   current = prefix2[b]\n\n               else:\n\n                   current = prefix2[b] + prefix1[current_rem_b]\n\n               if current > best_sum:\n\n                   best_sum = current\n\n                   best_b = b\n\n           break\n\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) //3\n\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n       s1 = prefix2[mid1] + (prefix1[ rem - 2*mid1 ] if (rem - 2*mid1)>=0 else 0)\n\n       s2 = prefix2[mid2] + (prefix1[ rem - 2*mid2 ] if (rem - 2*mid2)>=0 else 0)\n\n       if s1 < s2:\n\n           low = mid1 +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid2 -1\n\n   # Now, compute the sum for best_b.\n\n   current_rem_b = rem - 2*best_b\n\n   if current_rem_b <0:\n\n       current = prefix2[best_b]\n\n   else:\n\n       current = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[current_rem_b]\n\n   if current > max_total:\n\n       max_total = current\n\nPrint max_total.\n\nWait, but in code, group1's prefix is 0-based, right?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this logic on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=3, m=4.\n\nThe items are:\n\n1 1 → group1.\n\n2 2 → group2.\n\n4 3 → group3.\n\nWait, group1: [ (1,1) ]\n\ngroup2: [ (2,2) ]\n\ngroup3: [ (4,3) ]\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\ngroup1_prefix: [0, 1]\n\ngroup2_prefix: [0, 2]\n\ngroup3_prefix: [0,3]\n\nNow, for a=0:\n\nrem=4.\n\nmax_b=4//2=2.\n\nSo, rem=4.\n\nWe need to find the best b in 0..2.\n\nCompute for b=0: rem_b=4. prefix1[4] is beyond group1's length (only 1 item). So c=1. Sum is 0 +1=1.\n\nb=1: rem_b=4-2=2. prefix2[1]=2. prefix1[2] is beyond, so c=1. Sum is 2+1=3.\n\nb=2: rem_b=4-4=0. Sum is 2+0=2.\n\nSo the best is 3.\n\nSo for a=0, sum is 3.\n\nFor a=1:\n\n3*1=3 ≤4.\n\nrem=4-3=1.\n\nmax_b=0.\n\nSo b can only be 0.\n\nrem_b=1.\n\nsum is 0 + prefix1[1] = 1.\n\nWhich is worse than 3.\n\nFor a=2:\n\n3*2=6>4.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a cost. The goal is to select a subset of these souvenirs such that their total weight does not exceed the limit while achieving the highest possible total cost.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, or 3). This helps in efficiently managing and processing each group separately.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Sort each group in descending order of their cost. Compute prefix sums for each sorted group to quickly calculate the maximum cost for any number of items taken from each group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible 3-Weight Items**: For each possible number of 3-weight items (from 0 to the maximum possible), compute the remaining weight capacity. Use a ternary search to find the optimal number of 2-weight items that maximizes the total cost when combined with the remaining capacity for 1-weight items.\n4. **Ternary Search for Efficiency**: For each possible number of 3-weight items, use ternary search on the number of 2-weight items to find the combination that yields the highest total cost, considering the remaining weight capacity for 1-weight items.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        w, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    \n    max_a = min(len(group3), m // 3)\n    \n    for a in range(0, max_a + 1):\n        current_weight = 3 * a\n        if current_weight > m:\n            continue\n        rem = m - current_weight\n        if rem < 0:\n            continue\n        max_b = rem // 2\n        \n        low = 0\n        high = max_b\n        best_sum = 0\n        best_b = 0\n        \n        while low <= high:\n            if high - low < 5:\n                for b in range(low, high + 1):\n                    current_rem_b = rem - 2 * b\n                    if current_rem_b < 0:\n                        current = prefix2[b]\n                    else:\n                        current = prefix2[b] + prefix1[min(current_rem_b, len(prefix1) - 1)]\n                    if current > best_sum:\n                        best_sum = current\n                        best_b = b\n                break\n            mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n            mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n            s1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[min(rem - 2 * mid1, len(prefix1) - 1)] if (rem - 2 * mid1) >= 0 else prefix2[mid1]\n            s2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[min(rem - 2 * mid2, len(prefix1) - 1)] if (rem - 2 * mid2) >= 0 else prefix2[mid2]\n            if s1 < s2:\n                low = mid1 + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid2 - 1\n        \n        current_rem_b = rem - 2 * best_b\n        if current_rem_b < 0:\n            current = prefix2[best_b]\n        else:\n            current = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[min(current_rem_b, len(prefix1) - 1)]\n        if current > max_total:\n            max_total = current\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: Souvenirs are grouped by their weights and sorted by cost in descending order to prioritize higher value items.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums are computed for each group to quickly evaluate the total cost for any number of items taken from each group.\n3. **Iterating Over 3-Weight Items**: For each possible count of 3-weight items, the remaining weight capacity is calculated.
