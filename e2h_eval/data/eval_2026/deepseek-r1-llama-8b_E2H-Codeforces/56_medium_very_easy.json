Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one spaceship and vice versa. Also, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in 2D space. So, the assignment needs to form a perfect matching where all the connecting lines are non-intersecting.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to do is model this problem. It sounds like we're looking for a bipartite matching between the two sets: Rebels (R ships) and Bases (B points). But with an additional constraint on the geometric aspect—no two lines should cross.\n\nWait, but how do the lines being non-crossing affect the matching? Because each base is connected to exactly one ship, and each ship to exactly one base. So, the arrangement of the connections must be such that when you draw all these lines from ships to bases, none of them cross each other.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in the bipartite graph where the edges don't cause any intersections. How can I model this?\n\nI remember that in computational geometry, there's a concept called a \"non-crossing matching.\" But how do I apply that here?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each ship is connected to a base. The condition is that no two lines (ship-base pairs) should intersect. So, the order in which the ships are placed around the bases must be such that the connections don't cross.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the problem of matching points in such a way that the connecting segments form a planar structure, like a tree or something. Or maybe it's similar to arranging the points in a certain order and then matching them in that order.\n\nAnother idea: since the ships and bases are points in a plane, perhaps we can sort them in a particular way and then match them in that sorted order. For example, if both ships and bases are sorted by their x-coordinates (or y), then connecting the i-th ship to the i-th base would ensure no crossings because the lines would follow a monotonic path.\n\nBut wait, that might not always work. What if the bases are not ordered in a way that allows such a matching? Like, maybe some ships are arranged in a way that their optimal connections require a different order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by checking all possible perfect matchings and seeing if any of them satisfy the non-crossing condition.\n\nSince R and B are up to 10 each, the maximum number of possible perfect matchings is manageable. For example, if R and B are 10 each, the number of possible perfect matchings is 10! = 3,628,800. Which is acceptable for a brute-force approach.\n\nSo the plan could be:\n\n1. Read all the ships and bases into two separate lists.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the ships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two lines in that matching cross.\n4. If any matching satisfies the condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nThat makes sense. Now, the challenge is implementing this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line gives R and B. Then R lines give the coordinates of the ships, followed by B lines giving the bases.\n\nWait, the input format says: for 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i+1-th line contains two integers xi and yi. Wait, that might be a typo. Or perhaps, for the first part, the input is R lines, each with xi and yi for the ships, and then B lines for the bases. So, yes.\n\nSo, I'll read R lines for ships and B lines for bases.\n\nOnce I have all the points, I need to find a perfect bipartite matching where no two edges cross.\n\nNow, the main task is to generate all possible perfect matchings between the two sets and check for each whether the lines are non-crossing.\n\nHow to represent the matchings? Well, since R and B are up to 10, it's feasible to represent each matching as a permutation.\n\nFor example, a perfect matching can be represented by a list where index i (for ships) is matched to the base at position p[i] in the list of bases.\n\nSo, for each possible permutation of length B (since each ship is matched to a base), we need to ensure that it's a bijection (each base is used exactly once).\n\nWait, but for the case where R != B, but according to the problem statement, R and B can be anything up to 10, but for a perfect matching, they must be equal. Oh, right, because each base must have exactly one ship and vice versa. So the first step is to check if R equals B. If not, output No immediately.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says 'the assignment is a perfect matching'. So if R != B, then it's impossible. So the first thing I should do is check if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nSo that's the first condition.\n\nIn the sample input, the first case has R=3 and B=3, which is allowed. The second case has R=2 and B=1, which is not allowed, hence output No.\n\nSo, step 0: if R != B, output No.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext, generate all possible permutations of B elements (since each ship is assigned to a unique base). For each permutation, check if it's a valid matching (i.e., each base is used exactly once) and then check if the connecting lines are non-crossing.\n\nBut wait, generating all possible permutations of size B is going to be O(B! * (R^2 B)), but for B=10, 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, we need to check for any pair of edges (ship1 -> base1 and ship2 -> base2) whether the lines connecting them cross.\n\nSo, for each permutation, I need to check all possible pairs of edges to see if any pair crosses.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n- Read R ship positions into a list, say ships.\n- Read B base positions into a list, bases.\n- Generate all possible permutations of B elements (which represent the indices of the bases). Because each ship is matched to a base, and each base is matched to exactly one ship.\n- For each permutation:\n   - Create a mapping from each ship index to the base index as per the permutation.\n   - Check if any two edges (from the permutation) cross each other.\n   - If the permutation is such that no edges cross, output Yes.\n- After checking all permutations, if none satisfy, output No.\n\nSo, the key parts are generating the permutations and checking for crossing edges.\n\nNow, how to check if two line segments cross.\n\nEach edge is a line segment between a ship and a base. Two line segments AB and CD cross if the points are interleaved in such a way that the segments' endpoints are on opposite sides of each other.\n\nWait, but wait: the line segments are from a ship to a base. So for two edges e1 (s1 to b1) and e2 (s2 to b2), they cross if s1 is on one side of the line formed by s2 and b2, and b1 is on the other side. Or something like that.\n\nWait, more accurately, two line segments AB and CD cross if the points A and B are on opposite sides of the line CD, and C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB. Or alternatively, using the cross product method.\n\nI recall that the standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is to compute the orientation of the four points. Orientation can determine whether three points are collinear, clockwise, or counter-clockwise.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can avoid dealing with that case.\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if and only if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the correct condition.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to compute the cross products for the segments to determine if they intersect.\n\nLet me think: given two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if the points are arranged in a way that one is inside the other's segment, but I think that's not quite right. Alternatively, the segments cross each other.\n\nI think the proper way is to compute whether the segments AB and CD intersect properly, i.e., not just touch at an endpoint.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nDefine a function ccw(A, B, C) that returns:\n\n- -1 if the points are clockwise (B is to the left of A when looking from C)\n- 1 if counterclockwise\n- 0 if colinear (but the problem states that no three points are colinear, so we can ignore 0)\n\nThen, for two line segments AB and CD:\n\nThey intersect if and only if:\n\nccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0 and ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0.\n\nSo, if both of those products are less than zero, then the segments cross.\n\nWait, but wait: the condition is that the points are on opposite sides of each other's lines. So, for AB and CD, if point C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD, then the segments cross.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, I'll implement this function.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n- Assign each ship to a base based on the permutation.\n\n- For each pair of ships (s1, s2), get their assigned bases (b1, b2).\n\n- Compute the line segments s1-b1 and s2-b2.\n\n- Check if any such pair of segments cross.\n\nIf any pair crosses, this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, if no pairs cross, the permutation is valid, and we can output Yes.\n\nSo, now the steps in code:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nRead R ships into a list.\n\nRead B bases into another list.\n\nCheck if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nElse, for each possible permutation of the bases (all possible ways to assign each base to a ship):\n\n   - For this permutation, create a mapping from ship index to base index.\n\n   - For all i < j, check if the segments from ship i to base_i and ship j to base_j cross.\n\n   - If any pair (i, j) has crossing segments, reject this permutation.\n\n   - Else, this permutation is acceptable. Output Yes.\n\nIf after checking all permutations none are acceptable, output No.\n\nNow, how to generate all possible permutations of the B bases.\n\nWait, no. Since the permutation represents the assignment of ships to bases, each permutation is a list where the i-th element is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each permutation, it's a list of size R, where the k-th element is the index of the base assigned to the k-th ship. Since R == B, each base is assigned exactly once.\n\nSo, for example, if R=3 and B=3, a permutation could be [1, 2, 0], meaning ship 0 is assigned to base 1, ship 1 to base 2, and ship 2 to base 0.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we need to process all possible pairs of ships and their assigned bases.\n\nSo, the code will loop through all permutations of B elements, considering each as a possible assignment.\n\nWait, but for B=3, the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So, for each of these 6 permutations, we check if any pair of edges cross.\n\nSo, the code will use itertools.permutations in Python to generate all possible permutations of the bases indices.\n\nBut wait, in Python, itertools.permutations(range(B)) will give us all possible orderings.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the bases\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        # For each ship, assign the corresponding base\n        # So, for ship i, base is perm[i]\n        # Now, check for any pair of edges (i,j) where i<j, whether their segments cross\n        ok = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Ship i is assigned to base_p[i]\n                # Ship j is assigned to base_p[j]\n                s1, b1 = ships[i], bases[perm[i]]\n                s2, b2 = ships[j], bases[perm[j]]\n                # Check if the two segments s1-b1 and s2-b2 cross\n                # Implement the CCW function\n                def ccw(a, b, c):\n                    # Returns -1, 0, 1\n                    # (a, b, c) → orientation\n                    ax, ay = a\n                    bx, by = b\n                    cx, cy = c\n                    # Compute (b - a) × (c - a)\n                    # Which is (bx - ax)*(cy - ay) - (by - ay)*(cx - ax)\n                    val = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n                    if val > 0:\n                        return 1\n                    elif val < 0:\n                        return -1\n                    else:\n                        return 0\n                o1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n                o2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n                o3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n                o4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n                if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                    # Segments cross\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            if not ok:\n                break\n        if ok:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each permutation, for every pair of ships i and j, where i < j, we check if the segments between i and j's assigned bases cross.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each permutation, the code is checking for any pair (i,j) whether their segments cross. If any such pair exists, the permutation is rejected.\n\nSo, the code correctly identifies if the entire permutation is a non-crossing matching.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no. Wait the sample input shows the input as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is 3 3.\n\nThen 3 lines for ships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen 3 lines for bases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the ships are at (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\nThe bases are at (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nIn this case, the code should find a permutation that doesn't have any crossing edges.\n\nLet me see: the sample output is 'Yes'.\n\nIn the code, when it iterates over all permutations, it will find a permutation where no two edges cross.\n\nFor example, the permutation [1, 2, 0], which assigns:\n\nShip 0 → base 1 (0,3)\n\nShip 1 → base 2 (2,2)\n\nShip 2 → base 0 (-2,1)\n\nWait, let me see what the segments look like.\n\nShip 0 (0,0) → base 1 (0,3): the line is vertical, x=0, from (0,0) to (0,3).\n\nShip 1 (2,0) → base 2 (2,2): vertical line x=2, from (2,0) to (2,2).\n\nShip 2 (3,1) → base 0 (-2,1): the line is horizontal, y=1, from (3,1) to (-2,1).\n\nThese three lines don't cross each other.\n\nHence, the code would find this permutation as valid.\n\nAnother test case is when R=2, B=1. Then R != B, so output is No.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,0) and (0,1).\n\nPossible permutations:\n\n[0,1]: ship 0 to base 0, ship 1 to base 1.\n\nSegments: (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(0,1). Do they cross?\n\nLine 1: from (0,0) to (1,0) is along x-axis.\n\nLine 2: from (2,2) to (0,1). Does it cross the first line?\n\nWell, the first line is from (0,0) to (1,0). The second line is from (2,2) to (0,1). The two lines may cross.\n\nWait, let's compute the orientations.\n\nCompute ccw for the points:\n\nFor line 1: (0,0) → (1,0), point (2,2). The direction is right along x-axis.\n\nPoint (2,2) is above the line.\n\nFor line 2: (2,2) → (0,1), point (0,0). The line goes from (2,2) down-left to (0,1). Point (0,0) is below the line.\n\nSo, for line 1 and line 2, the segments cross.\n\nSo this permutation is invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: [1,0]. Ship 0 → base 1 (0,1). Ship 1 → base 0 (1,0).\n\nSo, segment 1: (0,0) → (0,1) (vertical line x=0).\n\nSegment 2: (2,2) → (1,0). Does this cross the first segment?\n\nPoint (2,2) is to the right of x=0. The line from (2,2) to (1,0) goes towards the left. So, it passes through x=0 at (0, something). Wait, let's compute.\n\nWait, the line from (2,2) to (1,0) has a slope of (0-2)/(1-2) = (-2)/(-1) = 2. So equation is y = 2x + b.\n\nAt x=0: y = 2*0 + b. But when x=2, y=2, so 2 = 4 + b → b = -2.\n\nSo the equation is y = 2x - 2.\n\nAt x=0, y = -2. So the line crosses the y-axis at (0,-2), which is below the segment (0,0) to (0,1). So the segment from (2,2) to (1,0) does cross the line x=0, but does it cross the segment from (0,0) to (0,1)? Well, the segment is from (0,0) to (0,1). The line from (2,2) to (1,0) passes through (0,-2), which is way below. So the two segments do not cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the orientations.\n\nCompute ccw for (0,0), (0,1), (2,2):\n\nPoint (2,2) is to the right of (0,0) → (bx - ax) is positive, (cy - ay) is positive. So (bx-ax)(cy-ay) is positive. (by - ay) is 1-0=1, (cx - ax)=2-0=2. So the value is (2-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the function ccw is defined as:\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    ax, ay = a\n    bx, by = b\n    cx, cy = c\n    val = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n    ...\n\nSo for a=(0,0), b=(0,1), c=(2,2):\n\nval = (0-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) → 0 * 2 - 1 * 2 → -2.\n\nSo the orientation is -1.\n\nSimilarly, compute ccw(a,b,d) for a=(0,0), b=(0,1), d=(1,0):\n\nd is (1,0). So:\n\nval = (0-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → 0*0 -1*1 = -1. So orientation is -1.\n\nSo o1 * o2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, which is positive. So the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is false. So the two segments do not cross.\n\nSimilarly, for the other pair of segments.\n\nSo in this permutation, the two segments do not cross, so the code would accept it, and output Yes.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle this.\n\nNow, what about the time constraints? For R=B=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we have to check C(10,2) =45 pairs. So total operations are about 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million operations. That's acceptable for Python.\n\nWait, but wait: 162 million operations might be tight for Python, which is slower than compiled languages. But given that the problem constraints are small (R and B up to 10), it's manageable.\n\nAlternative optimizations: memoization or pruning.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, brute-force is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the function for checking the orientation.\n\nWait, the function is written inside the loop for each permutation, which is not efficient. So perhaps, it's better to precompute it.\n\nBut in Python, functions defined inside loops can be slow. So, perhaps, define the function outside.\n\nYes, moving the ccw function outside the loop.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    ax, ay = a\n    bx, by = b\n    cx, cy = c\n    val = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        ok = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                s1 = ships[i]\n                b1 = bases[perm[i]]\n                s2 = ships[j]\n                b2 = bases[perm[j]]\n                \n                o1 = ccw(s1, b1, s2)\n                o2 = ccw(s1, b1, b2)\n                o3 = ccw(s2, b2, s1)\n                o4 = ccw(s2, b2, b1)\n                \n                if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            if not ok:\n                break\n        if ok:\n            found = True\n            break\n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each permutation, the code is checking all pairs of ships (i, j), but for each pair, it's considering the segments from s_i to b_i and s_j to b_j.\n\nBut in the code, for the pair (i, j), it's checking whether the segments s_i-b_i and s_j-b_j cross. So for each permutation, all possible pairs are checked, which is correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nShips:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nIn the code, for the permutation [1,2,0], which is a possible permutation, let's see:\n\ni=0, j=1: s0 is (0,0) → base 1 (0,3). s1 is (2,0) → base 2 (2,2). The segments are from (0,0)-(0,3) and (2,0)-(2,2). These are parallel and don't cross.\n\ni=0, j=2: s0 is (0,0) → base 1 (0,3). s2 is (3,1) → base 0 (-2,1). The segments are (0,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(-2,1). Do they cross?\n\nCompute the orientations.\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (0,3). Line 2: (3,1) to (-2,1).\n\nCheck if (3,1) is on one side of the first line and (-2,1) is on the other.\n\nWait, the first line is vertical at x=0. The second line is horizontal at y=1, from x=-2 to x=3.\n\nSo, the line from (3,1) to (-2,1) is a horizontal line. The first line is vertical.\n\nDo they cross? Yes, at (0,1). So the segments cross.\n\nWait, but in the code, for the permutation [1,2,0], i=0 and j=2: s_i is 0, assigned to base 1 (0,3), and s_j is 2, assigned to base 0 (-2,1). So the segments are from (0,0) to (0,3) and from (3,1) to (-2,1). These two lines cross at (0,1), right?\n\nSo the code should detect that and mark this permutation as invalid.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the code is supposed to output Yes. So perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation's assignment.\n\nWait, in the permutation [1,2,0], the assignment is:\n\nship 0 → base 1 (0,3)\n\nship 1 → base 2 (2,2)\n\nship 2 → base 0 (-2,1)\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\n0→1: (0,0) to (0,3)\n\n1→2: (2,0) to (2,2)\n\n2→0: (3,1) to (-2,1)\n\nNow, check segment 0→1 and segment 2→0.\n\nCompute ccw for s0, b0, s2.\n\ns0 is (0,0), b0 is (0,3), s2 is (3,1).\n\nccw(s0, b0, s2) = (0-0)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-0) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the function is:\n\nax, ay = a → (0,0)\n\nbx, by = b → (0,3)\n\ncx, cy = c → (3,1)\n\nval = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n\nbx - ax is 0-0=0.\n\ncy - ay is 1-0=1.\n\nby - ay is 3-0=3.\n\ncx - ax is 3-0=3.\n\nval = 0 * 1 - 3 * 3 = 0 -9 = -9 <0 → returns -1.\n\nSimilarly, ccw(s0, b0, s2) is -1.\n\nccw(s0, b0, b2) is the same as s2, which is (3,1). So same as above, it's -1.\n\nSo o1 is -1, o2 is -1. Product is positive, so condition is not met.\n\nWait, but also, for the other orientation: o3 is ccw(s2, b2, s0). s2 is (3,1), b2 is (-2,1), s0 is (0,0).\n\nCompute:\n\nval = (-2 -3) * (0 - 1) - (1 - 1) * (0 -3) → (-5)*(-1) - 0*(-3) →5 -0=5>0 → returns 1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, s2 is (3,1), b2 is (-2,1). So the function is:\n\na is s2: (3,1), b is b2: (-2,1), c is s0: (0,0).\n\nval = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n\nbx - ax = (-2) -3 = -5.\n\ncy - ay = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nby - ay = 1 -1 = 0.\n\ncx - ax = 0-3 = -3.\n\nval = (-5)*(-1) - 0*(-3) = 5 -0 =5>0 → returns 1.\n\nSimilarly, ccw(s2, b2, b1) is the same as ccw(s2, b2, (0,3)).\n\nWait, no: b1 is (0,3). So:\n\na is s2: (3,1), b is b2: (-2,1), c is (0,3).\n\nval = (-2 -3)*(3-1) - (1-1)*(0-3) → (-5)*2 - 0*(-3) → -10 -0 =-10 <0 → returns -1.\n\nSo o3 is 1, o4 is -1.\n\nSo o3 * o4 is 1 * (-1) = -1 <0.\n\nSo for the pair (i=0, j=2):\n\n(o1 * o2) is (-1)*(-1) =1 >=0 → condition not met.\n\nBut (o3 * o4) is (-1) <0.\n\nSo overall, the condition is (o1 * o2 <0) AND (o3 * o4 <0). In this case, the first condition is false, so the segments do not cross for this pair.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the lines cross at (0,1). So why isn't the code detecting that?\n\nAh, because the code is checking segments s_i-b_i and s_j-b_j for each i < j.\n\nIn this case, i=0 and j=2: the segments are from (0,0) to (0,3) and from (3,1) to (-2,1).\n\nDo these two segments cross?\n\nYes, they cross at (0,1). So why is the code not detecting it?\n\nBecause in the code's condition, for segments s_i-b_i and s_j-b_j, it's checking whether they cross.\n\nBut in this case, the two segments are s_i-b_i (0,0)-(0,3) and s_j-b_j (3,1)-(-2,1).\n\nDo these segments cross?\n\nYes, because the segment (3,1)-(-2,1) is a horizontal line at y=1, which crosses the vertical segment at (0,1).\n\nSo, the code should detect this and mark the permutation as invalid.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier computation, for i=0, j=2, the condition is (o1 * o2 <0) and (o3 * o4 <0).\n\nWait, o1 is ccw(s_i, b_i, s_j) → ccw((0,0), (0,3), (3,1)) → as computed, it was -1.\n\no2 is ccw(s_i, b_i, b_j) → same as o1, which is -1.\n\no3 is ccw(s_j, b_j, s_i) → as computed, 1.\n\no4 is ccw(s_j, b_j, b_i) → as computed, -1.\n\nSo, o1 * o2 is (-1)*(-1)=1>0 → condition not met.\n\nBut o3 * o4 is (1)*(-1)=-1<0 → condition met.\n\nSo, the code's condition is (o1 * o2 <0) AND (o3 * o4 <0). So in this case, o1*o2 is positive, so condition is false. Hence, the code doesn't consider this pair as crossing.\n\nBut in reality, the segments do cross.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, perhaps I have the function's parameters reversed.\n\nWait, the function is checking for the pair (s_i, b_i) and (s_j, b_j). But perhaps the condition is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the function is computing the orientations is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition should be that the two segments cross when the points are ordered in a certain way.\n\nWait, the standard condition for two segments AB and CD to cross is:\n\n- The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nWhich can be checked by:\n\nccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) < 0.\n\nAND\n\nccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) < 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is incorrectly computing o3 and o4.\n\nWait, in the code, for the pair (i,j):\n\no1 = ccw(s_i, b_i, s_j) → which is the same as ccw(s_i, b_i, s_j).\n\no2 = ccw(s_i, b_i, b_j) → which is ccw(s_i, b_i, b_j).\n\no3 = ccw(s_j, b_j, s_i) → which is ccw(s_j, b_j, s_i).\n\no4 = ccw(s_j, b_j, b_i) → which is ccw(s_j, b_j, b_i).\n\nWait, but the standard condition is:\n\n(ccw(C,D,A) * ccw(C,D,B) <0) AND (ccw(A,B,C) * ccw(A,B,D) <0).\n\nSo, in our case, C is s_i, D is b_i, A is s_j, B is b_j.\n\nSo, the first condition is:\n\nccw(s_i, b_i, s_j) * ccw(s_i, b_i, b_j) <0 → o1 * o2 <0.\n\nThe second condition is:\n\nccw(s_j, b_j, s_i) * ccw(s_j, b_j, b_i) <0 → o3 * o4 <0.\n\nWhich is exactly what the code is checking.\n\nSo, in the case where the two segments cross, both conditions should be true.\n\nBut in our example, the code's condition is:\n\no1 * o2 = (-1)*(-1) =1 ≥0 → condition not met.\n\nSo, the code thinks the segments do not cross.\n\nBut in reality, they do.\n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the function.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the condition.\n\nWait, the function computes ccw(a, b, c) as the orientation.\n\nFor two segments AB and CD, the condition to cross is:\n\nccw(A,B,C) * ccw(A,B,D) <0 AND ccw(C,D,A) * ccw(C,D,B) <0.\n\nSo, in the code, for the pair (i,j):\n\nA = s_i, B = b_i, C = s_j, D = b_j.\n\nThus, the code's condition is correct.\n\nBut in the example, why is it returning that the segments do not cross?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recompute for the pair (i=0, j=2):\n\ns_i is (0,0), b_i is (0,3), s_j is (3,1), b_j is (-2,1).\n\nCompute o1 = ccw(s_i, b_i, s_j):\n\nPoints A=(0,0), B=(0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in 2D space.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to finding a perfect matching between two sets of points (ships and bases) where no two connecting line segments intersect. This is a geometric problem that can be approached using combinatorial methods combined with geometric checks.\n\n2. **Brute-force with Permutations**: Since the number of ships (R) and bases (B) are both up to 10, we can use a brute-force approach by generating all possible permutations of B elements (each permutation representing a potential assignment of ships to bases).\n\n3. **Geometric Check for Intersection**: For each permutation, check if any two line segments (from ship to base) intersect. This is done using the concept of orientation in computational geometry, which helps determine if three points are collinear or form a clockwise or counter-clockwise angle.\n\n4. **Orientation Check**: The orientation of three points (a, b, c) is determined using the cross product. If the orientations of the segments indicate that they cross, the permutation is invalid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    ax, ay = a\n    bx, by = b\n    cx, cy = c\n    val = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n    if val > 0:\n        return 1\n    elif val < 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append((x, y))\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append((x, y))\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        ok = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                s_i = ships[i]\n                b_i = bases[perm[i]]\n                s_j = ships[j]\n                b_j = bases[perm[j]]\n                \n                o1 = ccw(s_i, b_i, s_j)\n                o2 = ccw(s_i, b_i, b_j)\n                o3 = ccw(s_j, b_j, s_i)\n                o4 = ccw(s_j, b_j, b_i)\n                \n                if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            if not ok:\n                break\n        if ok:\n            found = True\n            break\n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for ships and bases.\n- **Check for Perfect Matching**: If the number of ships (R) does not equal the number of bases (B), output \"No\" immediately.\n- **Generate Permutations**: Use permutations to generate all possible ways to assign ships to bases.\n- **Check for Non-crossing Segments**: For each permutation, check if any two line segments intersect using the orientation method.
