Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards and their values, and I have to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find (from an infinite supply) to make the total sum zero. All these additional cards must have numbers with absolute value not exceeding x.\n\nLet's break down the problem. \n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The first line has two integers, n and x. The second line has n space-separated integers representing the found cards' values. My goal is to compute how many more cards Vanya needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nSo, let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this S.\n2. The target is to have the total sum be zero. So, the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n3. We need to find the minimal number of cards such that their sum is exactly -S, and each card's absolute value is at most x.\n\nWait, but the sum of the additional cards can be achieved by adding some combination of numbers from -x to x. But since we want the minimal number of cards, what's the optimal way?\n\nHmm, the minimal number of cards would be when each card contributes as much as possible towards the required sum. So, each additional card should contribute as much as possible towards making the sum reach the desired value.\n\nThe maximum contribution per card is x (when positive) or -x (when negative). So, for the required sum T = -S, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. For example, if T is 5 and x is 3, then 5/3 is 1.666..., so we need 2 cards (3 + 2).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no additional cards are needed. That's a base case.\n\nWait, let's test some examples.\n\nIn the sample input 1:\nFound cards are [-1, 1, 2]. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The minimal cards would be 1, because we can add -2 (since x is 2). So the output is 1.\n\nSample input 2:\nCards are [-2, -2], sum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. So each card can contribute up to 3. 4/3 is 1.333..., so we need 2 cards: 3 +1, but wait, but the sum is 4. So 3+1=4, but 1 is within x. Wait, but the available cards can have any number between -3 and 3. So for T=4, the maximum each card can contribute is 3. So 3 +1 is the sum, but 1 is allowed. So two cards. So the output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: if T is 0, no cards needed.\n\nWhat about T is 5, x is 3. So 5/3 is ~1.666, so 2 cards: 3 + 2 =5. Each card is <=3 in absolute value.\n\nAnother case: T is 6, x is 3. 6/3=2, so 2 cards.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Like T=6, x=3 → 2 cards. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n- Compute T = -S.\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute the minimal k = ceil(|T| / x).\n- Output k.\n\nSo now, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and x from the first line.\n\nRead the list of n integers, compute their sum.\n\nCompute T = -sum_found.\n\nIf T is zero: print 0.\n\nElse: compute absolute value of T, divide by x. Take ceiling.\n\nNow, how to compute the ceiling of a division in Python.\n\nWell, in Python, you can compute it as (a + b -1) // b, where a is the numerator and b the denominator.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nceil(5/3) = (5+3-1)//3 =7//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nt_abs = abs(T)\n\nk = (t_abs + x -1) // x\n\nSo, that's the formula.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\nt = -sum_found\n\nif t",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum needed to make the total sum zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of additional cards required. Each card can contribute at most x towards the target sum. The minimum number of cards is given by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(cards)\nt = -sum_found\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t_abs = abs(t)\n    k = (t_abs + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the values of the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed is calculated as the negative of the found sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the result is immediately zero.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target sum, the minimum number of cards required is determined using the formula `(t_abs + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the target sum by x.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of additional cards needed, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and integer division properties.",
