He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but with a twist. The third part of each door's lock has a number c in base a, and depending on whether the second part is R (meaning it's using the Roman numeral system) or another number, I have to write c in base b, but considering that if b is R, then it's using Roman numerals.\n\nHmm, wait, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe input is two lines: the first line gives a and b, but b can be 'R' which indicates that the second part is using the Roman numeral system. Then the next line is the number c in base a, possibly with leading zeros. My task is to output c in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 10 and b is 2, then c is '1' in base 10. Converting 1 to base 2 would be '1', so output is '1'. Another example: when a is 16 and b is 'R', then c is '5' in base 16, which in Roman numerals is 'V'.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read the inputs correctly.\n2. Parse a and b. Note that b could be 'R', which means we need to treat it as the Roman numeral system.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Convert this decimal integer into the target base b, which could be either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n5. Output the result without leading zeros.\n\nLet me think about how to handle each step.\n\nFirst, parsing a and b. Since the first line is like \"10 2\\n1\", a is 10, b is 2. But if the second part is 'R', then b is treated as the Roman numeral system, which uses different rules.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that the second part is either an integer or R. So in the input, the second number is either a digit or 'R'. So, for example, in the sample input, one of the cases is '16 R', meaning that the target base is the Roman numeral system.\n\nSo, in code, I'll need to check if the second part is 'R'; if so, then the target base is treated as Roman numerals. Else, it's a regular base.\n\nNext, converting c from base a to a decimal integer. c is given as a string, perhaps with leading zeros. So I'll process each character, multiply by a^position, sum all.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I need to convert it into base b, but if b is 'R', then it's the Roman numeral representation.\n\nSo the core is two functions: one to convert a base a number to decimal, and another to convert decimal to base b, which could be a normal base or Roman numerals.\n\nWait, but for the conversion to base b, if it's a normal base, it's straightforward—divide and mod, etc. But for Roman numerals, I need to construct the correct Roman string.\n\nLet's break down the steps.\n\nStep 1: Read the inputs.\n\nThe first line is a and b. So, for each test case, the first line will have a and b. For example, '10 2' becomes a=10, b=2. If the line is '5 R', then a=5, b is treated as Roman numerals.\n\nThe second line is the number c in base a. So, for each case, I need to parse c as a base a number.\n\nStep 2: Convert c to a decimal integer.\n\nThis function needs to take a string representing a number in base a and return its decimal equivalent. For example, '16' in base 16 is 22 in decimal.\n\nBut wait, since the length can be up to 103, and a is up to 25, the decimal could be up to 25^103, which is a very large number. However, Python can handle big integers, so that's manageable.\n\nSo, the function to convert from base a to decimal is straightforward: iterate over each character in c, for each, calculate digit * (a ** power), add to total.\n\nBut I have to make sure that each character is a valid digit in base a. For example, if a is 16, the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (case-insensitive?), but the input may have uppercase letters. Wait, the problem says the input is a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. So, the c string consists of digits that are valid in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, the digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase? Or maybe lowercase? Well, the sample input shows 'A' as part of the input, but in the output, it's also 'A'. So perhaps the input c can have letters, but the problem statement isn't clear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\nWait, the 'c' is given in base a, which could be a digit or letters? Because in the sample input, there's 'A' as part of the input. So yes, c can have letters, but only in certain cases.\n\nSo, for a base higher than 10, the digits beyond 9 are represented by letters. But how? For example, in base 16, the digits are 0-9, then A, B, C, D, E, F for 10-15. But the case (uppercase vs lowercase) is not specified. So probably, in the input, the letters are uppercase.\n\nBut in our code, when processing the input, we should treat them as uppercase.\n\nSo, for the conversion function, for each character in c, we need to get its value. For digits, it's their numeric value. For letters, they represent 10 and above. So, for a character in c, its value is determined as follows:\n\nif c_char is between '0' and '9': value is int(c_char)\nelse: value is ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nWait, but what if the base a is less than the value of the character? For example, if a is 10, then a character 'A' is invalid. But the problem states that the input is such that c is a valid number in base a. So the code can assume that each character is a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c, we can safely compute its value.\n\nSo, the function to convert c from base a to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(c_str, a):\n    decimal = 0\n    for char in c_str:\n        val = int(char) if char.isdigit() else (ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n        # Or wait: no, because for a base less than 11, letters don't exist. But according to the problem, the input is correct.\n        # So, for bases less than 10, letters are not present in c_str.\n        # So, in code, for each char in c_str:\n        # if it's a digit, its value is the integer.\n        # else, it's a letter (uppercase?), so value is ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n        # But since a can be up to 25, and the letters allowed are A (10), B(11), up to F (15).\n        # So, for example, if a is 10, the letters in c_str must be only 0-9, so no letters.\n\n        # So, in code:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            val = int(char)\n        else:\n            val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        # Now, check if val is >= a? No, because the input is valid, so val < a.\n        decimal = decimal * a + val\n    return decimal\n\nWait, but what if a is 16 and the character is 'G'? Then 'G' is 16, but a is 16, which is invalid. But the problem says the input is correct, so no need to handle that.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to base b, which could be a regular base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for the base conversion, there are two cases: b is a number, or b is 'R'.\n\nCase 1: b is a number.\n\nWe need to convert the decimal number to base b, using standard division and modulus method. But for bases larger than 10, letters are used for digits 10 and above.\n\nFor example, 10 in base 11 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nCase 2: b is 'R' (Roman numerals).\n\nWe need to convert the decimal number into Roman numerals, using the rules provided.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the input.\n\n- For each case, determine whether b is a number or 'R'.\n\n- Convert c to decimal.\n\n- Then, based on b, convert the decimal to base b, which could be a string using standard digits or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, now, the question is: How to implement the Roman numeral conversion.\n\nI remember that Roman numerals are made up of symbols where each has a specific value. The key points are:\n\n- The symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, M, with values 1,5,10,50,100,500,1000 respectively.\n\n- The subtractive notation is used for 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD), 900 (CM). \n\n- For numbers beyond 1000, like 4000, it's MMMM, but the problem says that the converted number is within certain limits.\n\nWait, but the note says that in the case where the target is Roman numerals, the number is less than or equal to 300010, but in other cases, it's up to 101510.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIt is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\nSo, for Roman numerals, the maximum is 300010.\n\nSo, when converting to Roman numerals, the number can be up to 300010. So, the Roman numeral converter needs to handle numbers up to that.\n\nSo, how to create a function to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nI think the standard approach is to use a list of tuples, each containing the value and the corresponding symbol. These tuples should be in descending order of value, so that we can process the highest possible values first.\n\nBut the subtractive forms complicate things. So, the approach is:\n\n- Create a list of pairs (value, symbol), ordered from largest to smallest.\n\n- For each pair, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\n- Once the number is zero, return the accumulated string.\n\nBut the list must include both the standard symbols and the subtractive ones.\n\nWait, the standard subtractive pairs are:\n\nIV 4\n\nIX 9\n\nXL 40\n\nXC 90\n\nCD 400\n\nCM 900\n\nSo, in the list, these should come before the individual symbols so that they are considered first.\n\nSo, the list would be:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nWait, but wait: for 900, the subtractive form is CM, which is 900. So, the list should be ordered from highest to lowest, and each subtractive pair comes before the individual components.\n\nSo, for example, when the number is 900, the function will pick the 900 tuple, add 'CM', and stop.\n\nSimilarly, for 400, it adds 'CD'.\n\nSo, the function is something like:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is a number, say 2, 13, etc.\n\nIn that case, we need to convert the decimal number into base b, using digits 0-9 and then letters A-Z for 10 and above, as per usual.\n\nSo, for example, 10 in base 13 is 'A', 15 is 'F', etc.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, there's a case where a is 12, b is 13, and c is 'A' in base 12. So, 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal. Then, converting to base 13, 10 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSo, the function to convert decimal to base b is needed.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10 to base-1, so map to A, B, etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # The digits are collected in reverse order.\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but wait: for example, n=5, base=2, returns '101', which is correct.\n\nTesting with n=10, base=13: 10 /13 is 0, rem 10. So, rem is 10, which is 'A'.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps for each test case:\n\nRead a and b from the first line. If the second part is 'R', then the target is Roman numerals; else, it's a base.\n\nRead the next line as c_str.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal: decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert decimal_val to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert decimal_val to base b as a string.\n\nBut wait, the second part of the input is a single line, not multiple test cases. So, the program reads a and b from the first line, then c from the second line, processes them, and outputs a single line.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead the first line: split into a_str and b_str.\n\nThen read the second line: c_str.\n\nParse a and b:\n\na = int(a_str)\n\nb = b_str.strip()\n\nif b == 'R':\n    target_base_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    target_base_is_roman = False\n    b = int(b)\n\nThen, process c_str:\n\ndecimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif target_base_is_roman:\n    roman_str = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\nelse:\n    # convert decimal_val to base b\n    # but b could be 1? No, because the constraints say 2 <= a, b <=25, except that b can be R.\n\n    # So, no problem with base 2 to 25.\n\n    # Also, note that if the converted number is zero, but the problem says c is non-zero.\n\n    # So, proceed.\n\n    # But wait, what if the decimal_val is zero? According to the problem, it's guaranteed that c is non-zero, so decimal_val is at least 1.\n\n    # So, no problem.\n\n    # So, call the function.\n\n    base_b_str = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b)\n\nthen, output base_b_str.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of the cases is '2 2\\n1111001' which is a=2, b=2, c is '1111001' in base 2.\n\nSo, '1111001' in binary is 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63.\n\nConverting to base 2, which is 63 is 111111, but the output is '1111001'?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the sample input says:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, the fourth case is a=2, b=2, c='1111001' in base 2.\n\nWait, '1111001' in base 2 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 +1*2^0.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n64 +32 +16 +8 +0 +0 +1 = 121.\n\nWait, but 64+32=96, +16=112, +8=120, +1=121.\n\nSo decimal is 121.\n\nThen, converting 121 to base 2: 121 divided by 2 is 60 rem 1.\n\n60/2=30 rem 0.\n\n30/2=15 rem 0.\n\n15/2=7 rem 1.\n\n7/2=3 rem 1.\n\n3/2=1 rem 1.\n\n1/2=0 rem 1.\n\nSo writing the remainders in reverse: 1111001.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo, the function works.\n\nAnother sample: when a is 12, b is 13, c is 'A' in base 12.\n\n'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nConverting to base 13: 10 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSo the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, the function works.\n\nAnother test case: when a is 5, b is 'R', c is '4' in base5, which is 4 in decimal.\n\nConvert to Roman: IV.\n\nSo output 'IV'.\n\nSo, the functions seem to handle these.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat about when the decimal is zero? But the problem says c is not zero.\n\nWhat about when converting to a base where the number is zero? But decimal_val is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the base is 1? No, because the constraints say 2<=a,b<=25, except that b can be R.\n\nWait, no. The problem says a and b are between 2 and 25, but b can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals.\n\nSo, when b is 'R', it's treated as the Roman numeral system, regardless of a.\n\nNow, implementing the functions.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase letters in the input c_str.\n\nBut in the code, when processing c_str, we convert each character to uppercase before checking if it's a letter.\n\nWait, in the to_decimal function, for each char in c_str:\n\nif char is a digit, use its value.\n\nelse, it's a letter: so ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut in the sample input, there's 'A' which is in the output. So, the function correctly handles uppercase letters.\n\nWhat about lowercase letters in the input? The problem statement says c may contain leading zeros but does not specify case for letters. So, perhaps the code should handle both cases.\n\nBut in the function, I've used .upper(), so it's okay.\n\nNow, testing the to_decimal function.\n\nTest case 1: c_str is '1' in base 10: decimal is 1.\n\nTest case 2: c_str is '5' in base 16: decimal is 5.\n\nTest case 3: c_str is '16' in base 16: 1*16 +6= 22.\n\nAnother test: 'FF' in base 16: 15*16 +15 = 255.\n\nAnother test: 'A' in base 16: 10.\n\nAnother test: 'Z' in base 25: 25 + 24 = 49.\n\nWait, but in base 25, letters beyond Y (24) are Z (25). So, for a=25, 'Z' represents 25, which is invalid because in base 25, digits go up to 24. Wait, no, wait: in base a, the digits are 0 to a-1.\n\nSo, for a=25, the valid digits are 0-9 and A-T (10-24).\n\nWait, 'Z' is 26, which is more than 25, so it's invalid. But the problem states that the input is valid, so in the code, the function can assume that each character is a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo, the function can proceed without checking.\n\nSo, the code is solid.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead the first line: split into a_str and b_str.\n\na = int(a_str)\n\nif b_str is 'R':\n\n    target_roman = True\n\nelse:\n\n    target_roman = False\n\n    b = int(b_str)\n\nRead the second line: c_str.\n\nCompute decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif target_roman:\n\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b))\n\nBut wait, for the case where b is 1, but according to the problem statement, b is >=2.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25. Only b may be replaced by R.\n\nSo, when b is not R, it's a number between 2 and 25.\n\nSo, no need to handle base 1.\n\nAnother point: when the target base is 1, but the problem says it's not possible.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nNow, handling leading zeros: the output must omit leading zeros. For example, if the target base is 2 and the number is 5 (101 in binary), then output is '101'.\n\nBut if the number is 0, but the problem says it's not possible.\n\nSo, the code for decimal_to_base ensures that leading zeros are omitted because the initial condition checks if n is zero, but in our case, decimal_val is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the number is zero, but according to the problem, c is non-zero, so decimal_val is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nNow, let's see the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nProcessing each case:\n\nCase 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1'\n\ndecimal_val = 1.\n\ntarget is base 2: 1 in base 2 is '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nCase 2:\n\na=16, b='R', c_str='5' (base 16 is 5 decimal).\n\nConvert to Roman: V.\n\nOutput 'V'.\n\nCase3:\n\na=5, b='R', c_str='4' (base5 is 4).\n\nConvert to Roman: IV.\n\nOutput 'IV'.\n\nCase4:\n\na=2, b=2, c_str='1111001' (binary 121).\n\nDecimal is 121.\n\nConvert to base2: 1111001.\n\nOutput '1111001'.\n\nCase5:\n\na=12, b=13, c_str='A' (base12 is 10 decimal).\n\nConvert to base13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nOutput 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When the target base is larger than the number, e.g., c_str is 'A' in base 12 (10 decimal), target base 13: output is 'A'.\n\n- When the number is zero, but the problem says it's not allowed.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is 'M' in base 1000? But the problem says the length is up to 103, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but in code, the function to_decimal would process each character, including 'M' as 1000. But if a is 1000, then 'M' is allowed.\n\nWait, but the function would have to parse 'M' correctly.\n\nWait, in the to_decimal function, for a character in c_str, if it's a letter, it's treated as 10 plus (ord(char.upper()) - ord('A')).\n\nSo, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, ..., 'Z' is 35.\n\nBut in a base a, the letters must be valid digits. So, for a=16, 'G' is 16, which is invalid because in base 16, the maximum digit is 15. But the problem says the input is correct, so such cases won't happen.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is 'III' in base 5.\n\nEach 'I' is 1, so 1+5+25 = 31.\n\nIf b is 10: output is '31'.\n\nIf b is 'R': output is 'XXXI' (since 31 is 30 +1 → XXXI).\n\nWait, no: 31 is 30 + 1, which is XXXI in Roman numerals.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nSo, the code is now written.\n\nNow, let me write the code.\n\nFirst, the helper functions.\n\nBut wait, in Python, functions inside functions can be used, but for code submission, it's better to have everything in the same script.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nRead the first line as a and b.\n\nRead the second line as c_str.\n\nImplement to_decimal function.\n\nImplement decimal_to_roman function.\n\nImplement decimal_to_base function.\n\nProcess accordingly.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as ['10 2\\n1', ...], but in the actual code, the inputs are read via stdin.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is shown as an array of strings, but in practice, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code will read from stdin, line by line.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    decimal = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            val = int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        decimal = decimal * base + val\n    return decimal\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            res.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(res))\n\n# Read input\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\na_b_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_line[1]\n\nc_line = lines[1]\nc_str = c_line.strip()\n\nif b_str == 'R':\n    target_roman = True\nelse:\n    target_roman = False\n    b = int(b_str)\n\ndecimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif target_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\nelse:\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is split into ['10', '2'] and then the second part is '1'.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nProcessing:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1'.\n\ndecimal_val=1.\n\ntarget is base 2: output '1'.\n\nSample output is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=16, b='R', c_str='5' (decimal 5). target_roman is True: output 'V'.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b='R', c_str='4' → 4 in decimal. output 'IV'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=2, c_str='1111001' → 121 in decimal. output '1111001'.\n\nAnother test case: a=12, b=13, c_str='A' → 10 decimal → output 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nEdge case: a=2, b=2, c_str='0' → but the problem says c is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: c_str is empty? No, the problem says it's a non-negative integer.\n\nAnother case: c_str is '0' → but the problem says it's non-zero.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either a regular base `b` or Roman numerals.
