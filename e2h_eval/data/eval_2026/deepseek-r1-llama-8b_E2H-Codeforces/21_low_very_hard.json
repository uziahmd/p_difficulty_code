The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that a key can unlock a chest only if their numbers add up to an odd number. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about the problem step by step. So each chest has an a_i value, and each key has a b_j value. To unlock the i-th chest with a key j, a_i + b_j must be odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is categorize the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys, separate them into even and odd counts.\n\nWait, because a key can only be used once, and each chest can be unlocked once. So the maximum number of chests we can open depends on how well the keys match the chests in terms of parity.\n\nLet's say:\n- We have K1 keys that are odd.\n- We have K2 keys that are even.\nSimilarly, for chests:\n- C1 chests with odd a_i.\n- C2 chests with even a_i.\n\nEach key can only pair with a chest of opposite parity. So, an odd key can only open even a_i chests, and an even key can only open odd a_i chests.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the minimum between the available keys and chests for each pairing.\n\nWait, but wait: for example, suppose we have a lot of odd keys. They can only open even chests. So the maximum possible for that pairing is the minimum of the number of odd keys (K1) and the number of even chests (C2). Similarly, the other pairing is the minimum of even keys (K2) and odd chests (C1). Then the total would be the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, that might not always be the case. Because maybe after taking some from K1, there are some keys left that could help in another way, but no, no, because each key can only be used once.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible from both pairings. So the maximum chests is the sum of the two minima: min(K1, C2) + min(K2, C1).\n\nWait, but let me test this with the example given.\n\nIn the first example:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11 → which are [9,14,6,2,11]. So odd a_i's are 9,11 → count is 2. Even a_i's are 14,6,2 → count is 3.\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20 → 8,4,20 are even (count 3), 7 is odd (count 1).\n\nSo K1 is 1, K2 is 3.\n\nC1 is 2, C2 is 3.\n\nSo min(K1, C2) is 1, min(K2, C1) is 2 (since K2=3, C1=2). So total is 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the second input is n=5, m=1. Keys have one even (5 is odd?), wait wait, wait the second example's input is:\n\nWait, looking back, the second input line is '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5'. So the keys are 5, which is odd. The chests are 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So K1 is 1 (since the key is odd), K2 is 0. C1 is 0 (all chests even), C2 is 5.\n\nSo min(K1, C2) is min(1,5)=1. min(K2, C1)=min(0,0)=0. So total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. Chests have a_1=10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So K1 is 0 (no odd keys), K2 is 4. C1 is 0, C2 is 1.\n\nSo min(K1, C2)=0, min(K2, C1)=0. Total 0.\n\nWhich also matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (C1 and C2).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (K1 and K2).\n3. The maximum chests is min(K1, C2) + min(K2, C1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, no: K1 is the number of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers add up to an odd number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize by Parity**: First, categorize the chests and keys into even and odd counts. This is because a key can only unlock a chest if they have opposite parity (one even, one odd).\n2. **Count Even and Odd**: For both chests and keys, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Open Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the available keys and chests for each parity pair:\n   - Use odd keys to open even chests.\n   - Use even keys to open odd chests.\n   Sum these two minima to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Function to count even and odd in a list\ndef count_even_odd(lst):\n    even = 0\n    odd = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even += 1\n        else:\n            odd += 1\n    return even, odd\n\nc_even, c_odd = count_even_odd(a)\nk_even, k_odd = count_even_odd(b)\n\nmax_c = min(k_odd, c_even) + min(k_even, c_odd)\nprint(max_c)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Categorization**: We categorize the chests and keys into even and odd to determine which keys can unlock which chests.\n- **Counting**: By counting the number of even and odd chests and keys, we can efficiently determine how many pairs will result in an odd sum.\n- **Maximization**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum possible pairs from each category (odd keys with even chests and even keys with odd chests).\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the optimal use of keys to maximize the number of chests opened, leveraging simple arithmetic checks and counting operations.",
