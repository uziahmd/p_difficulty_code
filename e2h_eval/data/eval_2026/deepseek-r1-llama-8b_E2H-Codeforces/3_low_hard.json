Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Maybe it's similar to interval covering problems. But since d is a variable, I need to find the minimal d that satisfies certain conditions based on the lantern positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the gaps between the coverage of consecutive lanterns. Because if two lanterns are too far apart, their coverage areas don't overlap enough, and thus we need a larger d to bridge the gap.\n\nSo maybe I should sort the lanterns based on their positions and then check the gaps between consecutive ones. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them, because otherwise their coverage won't meet in the middle.\n\nLet me think: suppose two lanterns are at positions x and y, with x < y. The distance between them is y - x. The maximum coverage without overlapping is when the right end of the first lantern's coverage meets the left end of the second. So, for the two intervals [x-d, x+d] and [y-d, y+d], they might not cover the entire [x, y] unless x+d >= y -d. Wait, no. Because if x and y are two lanterns, then to cover the area between them, the sum of their coverage must reach from x to y. So the maximum of (y - x) / 2 would be the required d, because (x + d) must be >= (y - d). So solving x + d >= y -d gives d >= (y -x)/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the minimal d needed is at least (distance between them)/2. The overall minimal d is the maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs, including the start (0) and end (l) as virtual lanterns.\n\nWait, but what about the edges of the street? Like, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, and the last lantern's coverage must reach l. So for the first lantern, the left edge is 0, so its position a1 must be <= d. Similarly, the last lantern's right edge is l, so a_n must be >= l -d. So those constraints also affect d.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Add the endpoints 0 and l as \"virtual\" lanterns. Or wait, maybe just consider the first and last elements in the sorted list, and their positions relative to 0 and l.\n3. Compute the required d based on the gaps between consecutive lanterns, as well as the edges.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's sort the lanterns in increasing order. Then, before the first lantern, the coverage must reach 0, so the first lantern's position a1 must be <= d. So d must be at least a1. Because if a1 is at 5, then to cover 0, d needs to be at least 5, since the coverage is 5 -d to 5 +d. Wait, no: 5 -d <=0 implies d >=5. So yes, d must be >=a1.\n\nSimilarly, after the last lantern, to cover up to l, the last lantern's position a_n must be >= l -d. So d must be >= l - a_n. Because if a_n is at 7 and l is 10, then 7 +d >=10 → d>=3.\n\nAdditionally, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, i and i+1, the distance between them is (a_{i+1} - a_i). To cover the entire street between them, d must be at least (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2. Because their coverage areas must overlap at the midpoint.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a1 (since it's the first point)\n- (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for each consecutive pair\n- (l - a_n)\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array of a_i.\n- Compute the initial d as the maximum of a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n- Then, iterate through each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute (a[i+",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light up the entire street. Each lantern lights up a segment of the street from its position \\( a_i - d \\) to \\( a_i + d \\). The goal is to find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures every point on the street is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order.\n2. **Check Edge Cases**: The first lantern must cover from 0, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l - \\) the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them determines the required \\( d \\). The minimal \\( d \\) needed for these two lanterns to cover the entire gap between them is half the distance between them.\n4. **Compute Maximum Requirement**: The minimal \\( d \\) is the maximum of the values computed from the edge cases and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        required_d = gap / 2\n        if required_d > max_d:\n            max_d = required_d\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to handle them in order from left to right.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The first lantern's position sets a lower bound for \\( d \\) because it must cover from 0. Similarly, the last lantern's position sets another lower bound because it must cover up to \\( l \\).\n3. **Gap Analysis**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the distance between them is checked. The minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover this gap without leaving any part uncovered is half the distance between the pair.\n4. **Determine Maximum \\( d \\)**: The maximum value from the edge cases and gap analysis gives the minimal \\( d \\) required to ensure the entire street is lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required \\( d \\) by considering both the coverage from the edges and the necessary overlaps between consecutive lanterns.",
