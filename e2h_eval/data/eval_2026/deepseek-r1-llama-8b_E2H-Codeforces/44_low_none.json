He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve where Polycarp is trying to maximize his total profit by solving problems over k days. Hmm. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with given difficulties. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day, he must solve at least one problem, and each day's problems are a contiguous segment from the list. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days.\n\nThe goal is to split the list into k contiguous segments such that the sum of the maxima of each segment is as large as possible. And then, output that maximum sum along with the lengths of each segment.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let me think about dynamic programming since it's an optimization problem involving sequences.\n\nWait, what's the state here? Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems, divided into j days. Then, for each dp[i][j], we can look back to some m < i, and take the maximum between dp[m][j-1] + max(a_{m+1..i}).\n\nBut wait, the constraints are up to 2000 for both n and k. So, the DP table will be size 2001 x 2001, which is manageable.\n\nYes, let's structure the DP this way.\n\nSo, the initial state would be dp[0][0] = 0, meaning zero problems solved in zero days. But for other states, I need to compute them.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n   for each j from 1 to min(i, k):\n       for m from j-1 to i-1:\n           current_max = max(a[m+1 ... i])\n           dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nBut wait, calculating current_max for every possible m and i could be expensive. Because for each i and j, checking all m from j-1 to i-1 and computing the max each time would lead to O(n^3) time, which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nSo, that's not feasible. I need a way to compute the max quickly for any range [m+1, i].\n\nHmm, perhaps precomputing a 2D array where max_up_to[i][j] is the maximum from a[0..i], but that's not enough because the ranges are arbitrary. Alternatively, for each position i, keep track of the maximums ending at i for various starting points.\n\nWait, another idea: for each i, and for each possible j (number of days), we can consider all possible previous positions m and find the best m that gives the maximum when adding the current segment.\n\nBut again, the issue is the max function. How can we compute the max from m+1 to i quickly?\n\nAnother thought: for each i, keep track of the maximum from position 0 to i, and then use that in some way. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe for each i, we can precompute for all possible m (from 0 to i-1), the maximum of a[m+1..i]. How can we do that efficiently?\n\nWait, maybe for each i, we can iterate m from i down to 0, keeping track of the current maximum as we go. For example:\n\nmax_val = a[i]\nfor m in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n    if a[m] > max_val:\n        max_val = a[m]\n    # Now, for m, the max from m to i is max_val\n    # We can store this somewhere.\n\nYes! So, for each i, we can create an array max_from_m where max_from_m[m] is the maximum from a[m] to a[i]. This way, for any i and m, the max in the range m+1 to i is the same as max_from_m[m], but wait no—because m is the starting point. Wait, no. If I'm considering a segment that starts at m+1 and ends at i, then the maximum is the maximum from m+1 to i.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute for each m (0-based or 1-based?) the max from m+1 to i.\n\nWait, perhaps the indices are easier if they start at 0. So, for 0-based:\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array 'max_range' where max_range[i][j] is the maximum from j to i. Then, for any m and i, the max from m+1 to i is max_range[m+1][i].\n\nHow to compute max_range:\n\nmax_range[i][i] = a[i]\n\nfor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving problems over k days. Each day, he must solve a contiguous segment of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that segment. The goal is to distribute the problems into k segments such that the sum of these maxima is maximized.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). We define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` problems divided into `j` days. \n\n1. **State Transition**: For each `i` (number of problems solved so far) and `j` (number of days used), we consider all possible previous positions `m` where the last segment starts. The profit for the current segment is the maximum value from `m+1` to `i`, and we add this to the profit up to `m` problems with `j-1` days.\n\n2. **Efficient Maximum Calculation**: To quickly find the maximum value in any segment, we precompute a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value from index `j` to `i`. This allows us to compute the maximum for any segment in constant time.\n\n3. **Initialization and Transition**: We initialize the DP table and fill it by considering all possible previous positions and computing the maximum values for each segment efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute max from m to i for all m <= i\nmax_range = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    max_range[i][i] = a[i]\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        if a[j] > a[i]:\n            max_range[i][j] = a[j]\n        else:\n            max_range[i][j] = max_range[i][j-1]\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[-1 for _ in range(k+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\ndp[0][0] = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    for j in range(1, min(i, k)+1):\n        for m in range(j-1, i):\n            current_max = max_range[m][i-1]\n            if dp[m][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n\n# Reconstruct the solution\nt = [0] * k\ncurrent = n\nfor j in range(k, 0, -1):\n    for m in range(current-1, 0, -1):\n        if dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][current-1] == dp[current][j]:\n            t[j-1] = current - m\n            current = m\n            break\n\nprint(dp[n][k])\nprint(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The `max_range` array is precomputed to store the maximum value in any subarray ending at each position. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum value for any segment during the DP transitions.\n\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with `-1` to indicate invalid states, except `dp[0][0]` which is `0` since no problems solved yield zero profit.\n\n3. **State Transition**: For each state `(i, j)`, we consider all possible previous positions `m` and compute the maximum value for the current segment. This ensures that we explore all possible ways to split the problems into `j` days and keep track of the maximum profit.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the solution by backtracking from `dp[n][k]` to determine the lengths of each segment.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum total profit and the optimal distribution of problems into days using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values.",
