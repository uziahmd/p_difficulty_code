And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days. So there are (n - k + 1) possible weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times of those k days and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\nHmm, right. The input gives n and k, followed by a list of a1 to an. We need to output the average with at least six decimal places.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum of its elements, add all these sums together, and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, what's the efficient way to compute the sums of all windows? Because a naive approach would be O(nk), which for 2e5 would be 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient method. Oh right! The sliding window technique can help here. But even that, for k up to 2e5, would still be O(n) time, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but the sliding window approach is O(n) because for each new window, you just subtract the element that's leaving and add the new one entering. That's O(1) per step, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this to a total sum variable.\n3. Slide the window by one day each time, subtracting the element that's no longer in the window and adding the next element.\n4. For each new window sum, add it to the total.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nWait, but wait: the number of windows is (n - k + 1). So after computing all the window sums, I sum them all, then divide by (n - k + 1).\n\nBut wait again—no, no. Each window contributes exactly once to the total. So yes, summing all window sums and then dividing by the count.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the list a.\n- If k == n, then there's only one window, so average is sum(a)/1.\n- Else:\n   - Initialize current_sum as sum of first k elements.\n   - total_sum += current_sum\n   - For i from k to n-1:\n      - current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n      - total_sum += current_sum\n   - average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n- Output the average with enough decimal precision.\n\nWait, but when n is large, like 2e5, using integers could cause issues with size. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so it's not a problem.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nSo the two windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Sums are 7 and 11. Total sum is 18. Number of windows is 2. Average is 9.0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n1 1\n10 → only one window, average is 10.\n\nThird sample input:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nNumber of windows: 8-2+1=7.\n\nCompute each window sum:\n\n[1,2] → 3\n[2,4] →6\n[4,100000] →100004\n[100000,123] →100123\n[123,456] →579\n[456,789] →1245\n[789,1] →790\n\nAdding all these: 3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nTotal sum is 202750. Divided by 7, it's 28964.2857142857... Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- k = n: only one window. So sum(a) /1.\n- k=1: each element is a window. Sum all elements and divide by n.\n- All a_i are 1 or some other value.\n\nAlso, for the output, we need to print it with at least 6 decimal digits. So, for example, 9.0000000000, 10.0000000000, etc.\n\nIn Python, when printing, we can format the number with 10 decimal places, which ensures that trailing zeros are shown.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead n, k from input.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nIf k > n: but according to the constraints, k <=n, so no.\n\nCompute the initial sum as sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n\n   total_sum += current_sum\n\nnumber_of_windows = n - k +1\n\naverage = total_sum / number_of_windows\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but in Python, when you do integer division, you get integer, but we need to represent it as a float. So perhaps better to cast to float before dividing.\n\nWait, but in Python 3, dividing two integers with / gives a float. So for example, 3/2 is 1.5.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857. Let me see what the code would output.\n\nCalculating 202750 /7 = 28964.28571428571428...\n\nSo the code would format it as 28964.28571428571428... with 10 decimal places, so 28964.2857142857.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing to note: when the sum is zero, but that's impossible since a_i is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting edge case where k=1 and n=1: sum is a[0], average is a[0].\n\nAnother edge case: when all a_i are same, e.g., n=5, k=3, a=[2,2,2,2,2]. Then each window sum is 6, and there are 3 windows. So average is 6.\n\nSo code will compute 6*3=18 /3 =6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",

Each week consists of k consecutive days, and we need to consider all possible k-day windows in the given list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to compute the average sleep time over all possible k-day windows in a list of sleep times. Given the constraints, an efficient solution is necessary to handle large inputs.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each k-day window, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute the sum of each window in constant time after the initial sum.\n3. **Initial Setup**: Compute the sum of the first k elements as the initial window sum.\n4. **Iterate Through Windows**: Slide the window across the list, updating the current window sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n5. **Compute Total and Average**: Keep a running total of all window sums and then compute the average by dividing this total by the number of windows.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of n and k, followed by the list of sleep times.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent element, the window is slid one day forward, updating the current sum by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element.\n- **Total and Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is accumulated, and the average is computed by dividing this total by the number of windows.\n- **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, providing the correct average sleep time with high precision.",
