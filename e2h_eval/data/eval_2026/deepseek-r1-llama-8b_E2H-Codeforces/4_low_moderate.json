The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character is 'R', 'S', or 'P'. For each of the n rounds, we determine who wins based on their current choices. Then, increment the respective counters.\n\nWait, but how do we get their choices for each round? Because the sequences are cycled. So for each i-th round, the choice for Nikephoros is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], with k being the length of B.\n\nSo for each round from 0 to n-1, we can compute their moves by taking the i-th modulo of their sequence lengths.\n\nThen, for each round, determine who wins:\n\nRock beats scissors.\nScissors beat paper.\nPaper beats rock.\n\nIf both choose the same, it's a draw. No red spots.\n\nElse, the winner is the one whose move beats the other's, and the loser gets a red spot.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n- Initialize two counters: nike = 0, poly = 0.\n- For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   - Get a = A[i % m]\n   - Get b = B[j % k] (where j starts at 0, same as i)\n   - Determine if a beats b, or vice versa.\n   - If a beats b: poly +=1\n   - Else if b beats a: nike +=1\n   - Else: do nothing.\n- After all rounds, output the counts.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each round, the player who loses gets a red spot. So if a beats b, then Poly lost, so Poly gets a spot. Or wait, no: when a beats b, Poly's move is b, which loses. So Poly gets a red spot. Yes.\n\nSo for each round, if a beats b, Poly gets a spot. Else, if b beats a, then Nike gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nif a == b: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is a winning pair for a: Poly's spot increases.\n\nelse: Nike's spot increases.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the rules again.\n\nRock beats scissors: so if a is R and b is S, a beats b. So Poly (who played S) loses. So Poly gets a spot.\n\nIf a is S and b is R: b beats a. So a (Nike) loses, so Nike's spot increases.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nCheck if a beats b:\n\nHow to represent this? Maybe create a function that returns whether a beats b.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair, determine who wins.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nEach move can be represented as follows:\n\nR beats S\n\nS beats P\n\nP beats R.\n\nSo, for a given a and b, check if a beats b.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → a wins.\n\nelif (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → a wins.\n\nelif (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → a wins.\n\nElse, check if b beats a.\n\nBecause if a doesn't beat b, then either b beats a, or it's a draw.\n\nSo, in code, for each a and b:\n\nif a == b: no action.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a beats b. If yes, Poly gets a spot.\n\nElse, since b must beat a, Nike gets a spot.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nWe can write a helper function, maybe, that returns True if a beats b.\n\nLike:\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that a beats b only in those cases. So, for each round:\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b → Poly's spot +=1\n\nelse → Nike's spot +=1\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now the steps are clear.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nn can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because even for each round, it's O(1) operations",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round is played according to their respective sequences, which are cycled through repeatedly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The game is played between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow a cyclic sequence of moves. In each round, they show their moves based on their current position in their respective sequences. The loser of each round gets a red spot.\n2. **Cyclic Sequence Handling**: For each round, the move of each player is determined by their sequence, cycling back to the start when the end is reached.\n3. **Winning Conditions**: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same move, it results in a draw with no red spots.\n4. **Round-by-Round Processing**: For each round, determine the winner and update the red spot count accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n    return (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    \n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    \n    if beats(a, b):\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by two strings representing the sequences of moves for each player.\n2. **Helper Function**: The `beats` function checks if one move beats another based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n3. **Cycling Through Sequences**: For each round, the current move of each player is determined by cycling through their respective sequences using modulo operations.\n4. **Determine Winner**: For each round, if the moves are the same, no red spot is awarded. Otherwise, the function checks if the first player's move beats the second player's move, awarding a red spot to the loser if true.\n5. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, the total number of red spots for each player is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to the maximum constraints by ensuring each round is processed in constant time, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
