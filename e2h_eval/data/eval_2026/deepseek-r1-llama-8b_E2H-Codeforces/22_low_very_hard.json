After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nFor each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark among all students. Then, for each student, I'll check if their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum. If yes, then the student is a candidate for being the best in that subject.\n\nWait, but how do I track which student is the best in each subject? Because for each subject, only one student can be the best. So for each subject, I'll find the student(s) who have the maximum mark. But since it's possible to have multiple students with the same max, but only one of them can be considered as the best, right? Or wait, no. The definition says a student is the best in a subject if no one else has a higher mark. So if multiple students have the same max, they are all considered the best in that subject.\n\nWait, the note in the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if multiple students have the maximum mark, they are all the best in that subject. So for each subject, the set of students who have the maximum in that subject are the ones considered bests.\n\nSo, for each student, if they are in any of these sets for any subject, they are successful.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. For each subject, find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n2. For each student, check if they are present in any of these sets for any subject.\n3. Count the number of such students.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- For each of the next n lines, process into a list of strings (each string represents a student's marks).\n- For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   - Collect all the marks from each student in this subject.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this subject across all students.\n   - Collect all students whose mark in j is equal to this maximum.\n- Once all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are in any of the 'best' lists (for any subject). If yes, count them.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently represent each student's marks? Maybe for each student, store their marks as a list of integers, or as a string of digits.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j, iterate through all students and collect their j-th character as an integer.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines. For each line, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and for each character in the line, convert to integer. Store each student's marks as a list.\n\nThen, for each subject j (0-based index from 0 to m-1):\n\n   max_mark = the maximum value in the j-th position across all students.\n   collect all students where their j-th mark equals max_mark.\n\nStore these lists: for each subject, a list of student indices (or the actual student objects) who are best in that subject.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are in any of the best lists. Count how many students are in at least one best list.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures.\n\nEach student can be represented as a list of integers, one for each subject.\n\nWe can create a list called students, where each element is a list of integers, each integer being the mark for the corresponding subject.\n\nThen, for each subject j, we can loop through all students, get their j-th mark, and track the maximum.\n\nOnce we have the maximum, collect all students who have that mark in j.\n\nStore these in another list, say, best_in_subjects, where each element is a list of student indices (like 0-based) who are best in that subject.\n\nWait, but for each subject, the best students are those who have the maximum in that subject. So for each subject, the best students are all the ones with the highest mark.\n\nSo, for example, for subject 0, if the max is 5, then all",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Data Storage**: Store each student's marks in a list of lists, where each sublist represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Subject Analysis**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark achieved by any student. Identify all students who have this maximum mark for the subject.\n4. **Student Success Check**: For each student, check if they are among the top performers in any subject. Count such students as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subjects = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    best_students = [i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_mark]\n    best_in_subjects.append(best_students)\n\nsuccessful = set()\nfor student_idx in range(n):\n    for subject_best in best_in_subjects:\n        if student_idx in subject_best:\n            successful.add(student_idx)\n            break\n\nprint(len(successful))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of students `n` and subjects `m`. Each student's marks are stored as a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Best in Subject**: For each subject, we find the maximum mark and identify all students who achieved this mark. These students are recorded as the best in that subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: Each student is checked against the list of top performers in each subject. If a student is found in any of these lists, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine which students are successful by leveraging list comprehensions and set operations for quick lookups.",
