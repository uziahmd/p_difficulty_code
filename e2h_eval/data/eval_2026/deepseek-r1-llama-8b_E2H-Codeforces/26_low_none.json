Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C up to D. So the condition simplifies to x + y > z. Because for a triangle, each side must be less than the sum of the other two. But when z is the largest, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the plan is: iterate through all possible x, y, z that satisfy the ranges, and count those where x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, considering the constraints, the ranges could be very large (up to 5e5), so we can't iterate through each possible triplet. That would be way too slow. So we need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nHmm, let's think about the variables:\n\nx is from A to B.\ny is from B to C.\nz is from C to D.\n\nBut for a given x and y, what's the range of z that allows x + y > z?\n\nSince z can vary from C to D, but also needs to be less than x + y. So the maximum allowed z is min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, no: because z has to be ≥ C. So the lower bound for z is C, and the upper bound is the minimum between D and (x + y - 1).\n\nWait, let me rephrase: For a fixed x and y, the valid z's are those where z >= C and z <= D and z < x + y. So the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, but only if x + y > C. Because if x + y is less than or equal to C, then z can't be >= C and also < x + y, which is impossible. So in that case, there are zero valid z's.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the count is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C, else 0.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each possible x and y, the number of z's, and sum them all.\n\nBut again, the ranges are big, so doing this naively for each x and y is not feasible.\n\nWe need a mathematical way to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible x and y ranges.\n\nx can be from A to B.\ny can be from B to C.\n\nBut wait, y must be at least B and at most C. So for each x in [A, B], y can be in [B, C].\n\nBut how do we handle all possible x and y without iterating each pair?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a double loop, but optimize it by precomputing some sums.\n\nLet me see: for each x in [A, B], the possible y's are in [max(B, x), C]. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B, and y is from B to C. So for x <= B, y starts at B. Because the original condition is x ≤ y.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], y ranges from B to C.\n\nWait, no. Because x can be anything up to B, and y has to be >= x? Or wait, the original condition says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So y is always >= B and >= x (since x ≤ B and y >= B). So for any x, y starts from B, but wait, no: the initial condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So y is at least B, but x can be less than or equal to B. So for example, if x is 2 and B is 3, then y starts at 3.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], y ranges from B to C.\n\nSo the total possible (x, y) pairs are (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1).\n\nBut even so, for large",

A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
