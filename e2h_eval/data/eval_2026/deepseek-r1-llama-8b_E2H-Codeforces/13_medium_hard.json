For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. So together, they form a perfect fifth (7 semitones in total). For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, adding up to 7 as well, but in a different order.\n\nThe input is three notes, like 'C E G', and I need to process them. The output is either 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad.\n4. Once a permutation is found that fits either major or minor, decide which one it is based on the order.\n5. If none fit, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Because then I can calculate the distances between them.\n\nI think I should assign each note a numerical value based on their position in the scale. Let me list them:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, is that correct? Or is H perhaps a typo? Because normally, in music theory, after B comes C again. But here, H is the last note. Wait, no, maybe that's a mistake. Or perhaps the user made a typo. Oh, right, the problem says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again.\" So the list is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then back to C.\n\nWait, but wait, the standard musical notes are usually C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. But in this problem, perhaps H is equivalent to B. Because in some notations, H is used for B. Or maybe the problem just lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but the order is important because the distance is calculated along the scale.\n\nWait, perhaps H is actually B. Because the next note after H is C again. So perhaps H is the same as B. So the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H— but H is B. So the order is 12 notes, each 0.5 tone apart.\n\nWait, but the problem defines the order as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note, and comes after B. So the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then wraps around.\n\nSo I'll create a list of the notes in order, with their index. Each note can be mapped to a number from 0 to 11.\n\nSo for example:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, each note has an index. So 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc., up to 'H' being 11.\n\nSo first step is to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. That way, given a note, I can get its numerical value quickly.\n\nOnce I have the numerical values for the three notes, I can compute all possible orderings of them and check for the conditions.\n\nWait, but the triad is an unordered set, so any permutation could potentially form a major or minor triad. So for each permutation of the three notes, I need to compute the distances between consecutive notes in the order, considering the circular nature of the scale.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is computed as the minimal path along the scale. But wait, according to the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X upwards to Y. So if X is higher than Y, you wrap around.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"The distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nAh! So the distance is always the positive direction. So for any two notes, X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, multiplied by 0.5, but in terms of semitones, each step is 0.5.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's see:\n\nC is 0, C# 1, D 2, D#3, E4. So E is 4 semitones above C.\n\nE to C is (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. So the distance is 8 * 0.5 = 4 tones? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the distance is measured as semitones. So from X to Y, it's the count of steps upwards, each step being 0.5 tone. So for C to E, it's 4 semitones, and from E to C, it's 8 semitones (since you have to go up from E to F, F#... up to C).\n\nWait, that makes sense because the distance is the number of steps moving upwards, regardless of whether Y is higher or lower than X.\n\nSo the formula for the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (12 - (X - Y)).\n\nWait, no. Because in modular arithmetic, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but when considering the direction, it's the minimal path in the forward direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but each step is 0.5 tone. So for example, C to E is 4 steps, which is 2 tones (each step is 0.5, so 4*0.5=2 tones). Wait, but the problem says the distance is 4 semitones between C and E. Oh right, because semitones are individual half steps. So C to C# is 1 semitone. So the distance between C and E is 4 semitones.\n\nSo, the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y - X) % 12, but in semitones. So if X is 0 (C), Y is 4 (E): 4-0 =4 semitones. If X is 4 (E), Y is 0 (C): (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is 8 semitones.\n\nSo yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) % 12 semitones.\n\nSo, given three notes, we can generate all permutations of the three, and for each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distances x->y and y->z. Then, check if either:\n\n- d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major\nOR\n- d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either condition, then it's major or minor. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note name to its index.\n2. Read the three input notes into a list, say 'notes'.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes, resulting in 6 permutations.\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n   a. Get their indices: ix, iy, iz.\n   b. Compute d1 = (iy - ix) %12\n      d2 = (iz - iy) %12\n   c. Check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major\n      OR d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor\n   d. If either condition is met, record the type and break out of loop.\n5. If any permutation matches, output accordingly. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous; no chords are both major and minor. So we can return as soon as we find a match.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n- How to handle the notes: create a list of the note names in order, assign each an index.\n\nImplementing that in code.\n\nIn Python, I can define the note_order as a list:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, create a dictionary: note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nSo when given a note, say 'C', we can get 0, etc.\n\nNow, reading the input: the input is a single line with 3 space-separated notes. So for example, 'C E G' becomes a list ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nThen, for each note in notes, get their index.\n\nBut what if the input note is not in the note_order? According to the problem statement, the input will consist of valid notes, so I don't need to handle that.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, check the conditions.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nSo, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   ix = note_to_index[x]\n\n   iy = note_to_index[y]\n\n   iz = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n\n   d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print('major')\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print('minor')\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none satisfy, print 'strange'.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says the triad is an unordered set. So any permutation is considered. So the code above checks all possible orderings.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, wait no. The actual input is three space-separated strings, each representing a triad. For example, the first example input is 'C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'. So each of those is a triad to evaluate.\n\nWait, no, the problem says: the input is a single line containing three space-separated notes, not triads. So each note is a single string, like 'C', 'C#', etc. So the input is three note names, e.g., 'C E G' is three separate notes.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: the input is 3 space-separated notes in the notation. So each note is a single word, like 'C', 'E', 'G'. So the input line is something like 'C E G', which is split into three elements: ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo for the first sample input, the output is 'major' for the first triad, 'minor' for the second, and 'strange' for the third.\n\nSo, for each of the three triads, process as follows.\n\nWait, no. No, the problem says that the input is three notes, and each is part of a single triad. So for each test case, we have three notes, and we have to determine whether the triad formed by these three is major, minor, or strange.\n\nSo in code, for each test case, process the three notes.\n\nSo, for the first test case: ['C', 'E', 'G'], the code would find a permutation where the distances are 4 and 3, so major.\n\nFor the second test case: ['C#', 'B', 'F'], we need to find a permutation that satisfies the minor condition.\n\nFor the third test case: ['A', 'B', 'H'], none of the permutations will satisfy, so it's strange.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the triad is ['C', 'D#', 'E']. Let's see:\n\nPermutations:\n\nC, D#, E:\n\nd1 = (3-0) =3 → mod12 is 3.\n\nd2 = (4-3)=1 → mod12 is 1. Not 3,4.\n\nC, E, D#:\n\nd1 =4-0=4.\n\nd2= (3-4) mod12= 11? Wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, for permutation (C, E, D#):\n\nd1 is (E - C) mod12 =4.\n\nd2 is (D# - E) mod12 = (3-4) mod12= -1 mod12=11.\n\nSo d1=4, d2=11. Not matching any condition.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, C, E.\n\nix=3, iy=0, iz=4.\n\nd1= (0-3) mod12=9.\n\nd2=4-0=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=9, d2=4 → doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps another permutation.\n\nWhat about E, C, D#:\n\nd1 = (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nd2 = (3-0) mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=8, d2=3 → not matching.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think about the major condition.\n\nFor a major triad, the first two notes must be 4 semitones apart, and the next two 3 semitones apart.\n\nSo in the triad C, E, G:\n\nE is 4 from C.\n\nG is 3 from E (because E is 4, G is 7 → 7-4=3).\n\nSo in permutation C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo the code correctly identifies that.\n\nAnother example: C# minor chord is C#, E, G.\n\nC# is 1, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nSo permutation C#, E, G:\n\nd1=4-1=3 → 3 semitones.\n\nd2=7-4=3 →3 semitones. So that's not minor.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor triad requires the first distance to be 3, then 4.\n\nWait, wait, no. The minor triad is defined as the distance between X and Y is 3, then Y and Z is 4.\n\nSo for C#, E, G:\n\nC# to E is 3 semitones (E is 4, C# is 1: 4-1=3).\n\nE to G is 3 semitones (7-4=3). So that doesn't fit minor.\n\nWait, but wait: C# minor triad is C#, E, G.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me check.\n\nThe triad C# minor would be C#, D#, G. Or perhaps C#, E, G is a major triad.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm just misunderstanding the problem.\n\nSo, the code will correctly process all permutations, so perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All three notes are the same. Like C, C, C.\n\nBut according to the problem, the triad is a set of three notes, so perhaps the input won't have duplicates. But the problem says \"no less than three notes\", but perhaps the code still needs to handle it.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid triad, so perhaps the code doesn't need to worry about duplicates.\n\nAnother edge case: the three notes are all adjacent, like C, C#, C## (but wait, in the note_order, the next after C# is D, not C##. So the maximum distance between any two is 11 semitones.\n\nWait, but let's say the notes are C, D, E.\n\nSo, for permutation C, D, E:\n\nd1=1, d2=2 → no.\n\nFor C, E, D: d1=4, d2=(3-4) mod12=11 → no.\n\nOther permutations may not fit.\n\nThus, the code will correctly mark this as strange.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is 0, D# is 3, G is 7.\n\nSo permutation C, D#, G:\n\nd1=3, d2=4 → this fits minor. So the triad is minor.\n\nSo the code will output 'minor'.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Correctly handling the note order and their indices.\n\n- Correctly computing the distance as (Y - X) mod12.\n\n- Generating all permutations and checking each.\n\nSo in code, I can proceed as:\n\nImport itertools.\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nCreate the note_order list and note_to_index dict.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = perm.\n\n   ix = note_to_index[x]\n\n   iy = note_to_index[y]\n\n   iz = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n\n   d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print 'major'\n\n       exit\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print 'minor'\n\n       exit\n\nAfter all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the triad is an unordered set. So any permutation is a possible ordering.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G.\n\nNotes are C (0), E(4), G(7).\n\nPermutation C, E, G:\n\nd1=4-0=4.\n\nd2=7-4=3 → major.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: C#, B, F.\n\nWait, what are their indices?\n\nNote_order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo:\n\nC# is 1.\n\nB is 10.\n\nF is 5.\n\nLooking for a permutation that satisfies minor.\n\nWhich permutation?\n\nPossible permutation: B, C#, F.\n\nB is 10.\n\nC# is 1.\n\nF is 5.\n\nSo d1 = (1-10) mod12 = ( -9 ) mod12=3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThus, output 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: A, B, H.\n\nIndices: A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nFor example, A, B, H:\n\nd1=1, d2=1 → no.\n\nB, A, H:\n\nd1= (9-10) mod12=11 → no.\n\nWait, no permutation would give 4 and 3 or 3 and4.\n\nBecause the maximum distance between any two is 2 semitones (from B to H: H is 11, B is 10. So 11-10=1. So no permutation can have a distance of 4 or 3.\n\nSo output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: ['C', 'D#', 'G'].\n\nC is 0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=4, d2=3.\n\nWait, in permutation C, D#, G:\n\nd1=3-0=3.\n\nd2=7-3=4 → d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nSo the code would output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: ['E', 'G', 'C'].\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nPermutation E, G, C:\n\nd1=7-4=3.\n\nd2=0-7=5 mod12 → 5.\n\nNo.\n\nPermutation E, C, G:\n\nd1= (0-4) mod12=8.\n\nd2=7-0=7.\n\nNot matching.\n\nPermutation G, E, C:\n\nd1=4-7 mod12= ( -3 ) mod12=9.\n\nd2=0-4=8.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, E.\n\nd1=0-7=5 mod12=5.\n\nd2=4-0=4.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: C, G, E.\n\nd1=7-0=7.\n\nd2=4-7= -3 mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not finding a permutation. Let me think: the notes are E, G, C.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is C, E, G. But in this case, the permutation is E, G, C is not the same.\n\nWait, but in the test case, the notes are E, G, C. So the permutation would be C, E, G: in that case, C is 0, E is4, G is7.\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → major. So the code would output 'major'.\n\nYes, because that's a major triad.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, I think the code is solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Import necessary modules: itertools for permutations.\n\n2. Read the three notes.\n\n3. Create the note_order and note_to_index.\n\n4. For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   a. Get their indices.\n\n   b. Compute d1 and d2.\n\n   c. Check for major/minor.\n\n   d. If found, print and exit.\n\n5. After all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the input is given as strings like 'C E G', which are split into individual notes. So the code correctly reads them.\n\nPotential issues: case sensitivity. But the problem says the input uses the notation as given, so no issue.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    ix = note_to_index[x]\n    iy = note_to_index[y]\n    iz = note_to_index[z]\n    \n    d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n    d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → outputs 'major'\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → outputs 'minor'\n\nSample Input 3: A B H → outputs 'strange'\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['C', 'D#', 'G'] → outputs 'minor' because in permutation C, D#, G: d1=3, d2=4.\n\nWait, no: d1 is (D# index - C index) =3-0=3 mod12=3.\n\nd2 is (G index - D# index) =7-3=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThus, the code returns 'minor' for that triad.\n\nAnother test case: ['E', 'G', 'C'] → in permutation E, G, C: d1=7-4=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is E, G, C.\n\nSo ix=4, iy=7, iz=0.\n\nd1 =7-4=3.\n\nd2=0-7= -7 mod12=5.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut in permutation C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo the code will find that and output 'major'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or is neither (strange). A major chord is defined by specific distances between its notes, as is a minor chord. Our task is to check all possible orderings of the given notes to classify the triad correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as a position in a 12-note sequence, where each note is assigned an index from 0 to 11. This allows us to calculate distances between notes using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Permutations**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes to consider every possible ordering.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes in the order. The distance is calculated as the positive difference modulo 12.\n4. **Chord Classification**: Check each permutation to see if it matches the criteria for a major or minor chord. Specifically:\n   - A major chord has distances of 4 and 3 semitones respectively.\n   - A minor chord has distances of 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    ix = note_to_index[x]\n    iy = note_to_index[y]\n    iz = note_to_index[z]\n    \n    d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n    d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Representation**: The notes are mapped to indices based on their position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distance between any two notes.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to ensure we check every potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are computed using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If a permutation matches either criterion, the corresponding classification is printed and the program exits.\n5. **Efficiency**: By generating permutations and checking each one, we efficiently determine the classification without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately classify the triad by considering all possible orderings and leveraging modular arithmetic for distance calculation.",
