On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after this reversal.\n\nHmm, the input is a sequence where each element is either 1 or 2. The output is the maximum LNDS possible after reversing any possible subarray.\n\nWait, but what's the goal here? We need to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each case, and find the maximum among all possibilities.\n\nBut n can be up to 2000, which is manageable but not trivial. Reversing every possible subarray would be O(n^2) operations. For each reversed array, computing the LNDS could take O(n^2) time as well if done naively. So for n=2000, n^4 would be 16e12 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the sequence. Since each element is either 1 or 2, the LNDS is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, in a normal sequence without any reversals, the LNDS is essentially the count of how many 1s come before 2s. Because 1 ≤ 2, so the longest non-decreasing sequence would be all the 1s followed by all the 2s.\n\nWait no, that's only true if the 1s are contiguous and the 2s are contiguous. But actually, any arrangement of 1s and 2s will have their LNDS equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or wait, perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nWait, another approach: since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is just the number of 1s before the first 2 in some consecutive manner. Hmm, maybe not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be computed as follows: the maximum number of elements you can pick such that they are non-decreasing. Since 1 is less than 2, any 1 can be followed by any number of 2s. So the maximum LNDS would be the count of all 1s plus the maximum number of 2s that can follow the last 1 in the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS without any reversal is the minimum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s plus the number of 2s beyond the point where 1s end. No, that might not hold.\n\nWait, let's think of examples:\n\nExample 1: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 4 because we can take 1,2,1,2. Wait, no, because 1 comes before 2, then 1 comes before 2 again, but that's not non-decreasing. Oh right, the LNDS is the longest sequence where each next element is >= previous. So in this case, 1,2,2 is a subsequence of length 3, but if we reverse [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has a LNDS of 4.\n\nSo, when the interval is reversed, it can create a longer run of 1s or 2s, which can affect the LNDS.\n\nSo, the key idea is that by reversing a subarray, we can arrange the 1s and 2s in a way that maximizes the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal scenario is to have as many 1s as possible before as many 2s as possible. Because that would give the maximum LNDS.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to find the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the maximum number of 2s, possibly by reversing some subarray.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: the LNDS is maximized when the number of 1s before 2s is as large as possible. So, for each position i, imagine that all elements before i are 1s, and all elements after are 2s. The maximum LNDS would be the maximum over all such i of (number of 1s up to i) + (number of 2s from i onwards). But wait, that's the standard way to compute the LNDS without any reverses.\n\nBut with the possibility of reversing a subarray, perhaps we can get more 1s before a certain point, or more 2s after.\n\nWait, but after a reversal, the structure of the array changes. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence. Each element in the sequence is either 1 or 2, and our goal is to find the optimal subarray to reverse such that the LNDS is maximized.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the LNDS can be maximized by considering how many 1s can be placed before 2s. The optimal scenario is when all 1s come before all 2s. To achieve this, we need to evaluate all possible subarrays that, when reversed, can create such a configuration.\n\n1. **Precompute Prefix Sums**: Calculate prefix sums for the counts of 1s and 2s up to each index. This helps in quickly determining the number of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Evaluate All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray [l, r], compute the potential LNDS if this subarray is reversed. The potential LNDS is determined by the number of 1s before the start of the subarray and the number of 2s after the end of the subarray.\n3. **Maximize LNDS**: Track the maximum LNDS across all considered subarrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\nprefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n    prefix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 2)\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor l in range(1, n+1):\n    for r in range(l, n+1):\n        # Number of ones before l and twos after r\n        ones_before = prefix_ones[l-1]\n        twos_after = prefix_twos[n+1] - prefix_twos[r]\n        current_max = ones_before + twos_after\n        if current_max > max_len:\n            max_len = current_max\nprint(max_len)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sum Arrays**: The `prefix_ones` and `prefix_twos` arrays store the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s up to each index. This allows us to quickly compute the number of 1s before a given index and the number of 2s after a given index.\n2. **Subarray Evaluation**: For each subarray [l, r], we calculate the number of 1s before l and the number of 2s after r. The sum of these values gives the potential LNDS if the subarray [l, r] is reversed.\n3. **Maximization**: By iterating over all possible subarrays, we determine the maximum possible LNDS and print it as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible subarrays and uses prefix sums to quickly compute the necessary values, ensuring the solution is optimal and runs in a reasonable time for the given constraints.",
