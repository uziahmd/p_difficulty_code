They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all the given roads' GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied. And if it's possible, I have to output any valid assignment.\n\nHmm, let's think about the problem. Each edge between two lawns u and v gives us a pair (g, l), which is the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on u and v. So, for each such edge, the numbers mu and mv must satisfy g = gcd(mu, mv) and l = lcm(mu, mv).\n\nWait, but wait a minute—what's the relationship between GCD and LCM? Oh right, for any two numbers a and b, the product of their GCD and LCM is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, g * l = mu * mv.\n\nSo, for each edge, we have mu * mv = g * l. But also, the GCD of mu and mv must be exactly g, and the LCM must be exactly l.\n\nBut how do I model this for all edges? It seems like a system of equations with constraints on the relationships between variables.\n\nThis looks like a graph problem where each node has a variable (the number of mushrooms), and each edge imposes certain constraints on these variables.\n\nI remember that in problems involving constraints between variables, like in Sudoku or other puzzles, sometimes a constraint satisfaction approach is used. Alternatively, since the constraints here involve GCD and LCM, perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to its neighbors.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this using a Union-Find data structure with some additional information. Because each connected component will have variables that are related through the constraints. But since each edge's GCD and LCM are given, perhaps each connected component can be represented as a tree where each node's value is a multiple of a base value, but with certain factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be thought of as a set of variables that are linked via multiplicative constraints. For example, each variable can be expressed as a multiple of a common base, and the edges dictate how these multiples relate.\n\nLet me think: suppose I have a connected component with nodes A, B, C. Edge AB has GCD g_AB and LCM l_AB, which implies that A and B are such that A = g_AB * x, B = g_AB * y, and gcd(x,y) = 1, and lcm(x,y) = l_AB / g_AB. Wait, because the GCD of A and B is g_AB, so when you factor out g_AB, the remaining parts x and y must be coprime. Similarly, the LCM of A and B is (g_AB * x * y) / gcd(x,y) = g_AB * x * y since x and y are coprime. So, l_AB must be equal to g_AB * x * y. Therefore, x * y = l_AB / g_AB.\n\nSo, for each edge, once the GCD is known, the LCM divided by the GCD gives the product of the two co-prime factors.\n\nBut how does this help in building a system?\n\nPerhaps each variable can be represented as a product of primes, and the constraints can be checked for consistency across the graph.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: for each connected component, we can assign a base value (like a variable) and express all other variables in terms of this base, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, let's consider that each connected component can be represented by a tree where each node's value is a multiple of the root's value, multiplied by some factors that are determined by the edges.\n\nSo, for each node, we can represent its value as the product of the base value and some factors specific to its position in the graph.\n\nBut how to handle multiple paths between nodes? Because any two nodes in a connected component can be connected through multiple paths, and all those paths must agree on the value assignments.\n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a root and then assign values to each node relative to the root. Then, during this process, we check for any inconsistencies.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph:\n   a. Choose a root node.\n   b. Assign an initial value to the root (could be 1, or maybe something else).\n   c. Perform a BFS or DFS, assigning values to each node based on the edges.\n   d. For each edge, calculate what the value of the other node should be according to the current node's value and the edge's GCD and LCM.\n   e. If any inconsistency is found (i.e., the other node already has a value that doesn't match what's expected), mark the entire configuration as impossible.\n\n2. If all components are processed without conflicts,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all given road constraints (GCD and LCM) are satisfied. If possible, we should output any valid assignment; otherwise, we should output that it's not possible.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by modeling the constraints using a graph where each node represents a lawn and each edge represents a road with given GCD and LCM constraints. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Treat the problem as a graph where nodes represent lawns and edges represent roads with their respective GCD and LCM constraints.\n2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use this to manage connected components of the graph. Each component will be processed separately.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For each connected component, perform BFS to explore the constraints. Assign values to each node based on the root's value and check for consistency with the given constraints.\n4. **Check Consistency**: For each edge, ensure that the values assigned to the connected nodes satisfy both the GCD and LCM constraints. If any inconsistency is found, mark the configuration as impossible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    \n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])-1\n        v = int(input[idx+1])-1\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        l = int(input[idx+3])\n        edges.append( (u, v, g, l) )\n        idx +=4\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        adj[u].append( (v, g, l) )\n        adj[v].append( (u, g, l) )\n    \n    # For each node, track its parent and the value relative to the parent\n    parent = [ -1 for _ in range(n) ]\n    rel_value = [1] * n  # Relative value from parent to child\n    \n    # Process each connected component\n    possible = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        if parent[i] == -1:\n            # Start BFS from i\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(i)\n            parent[i] = -1\n            rel_value[i] = 1\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v, g, l in adj[u]:\n                    if parent[v] == -1:\n                        parent[v] = u\n                        rel_value[v] = l // g  # Because u_val * rel_v = g * (l/g) ?

But since R is part of the global factor, perhaps this needs to be considered differently.\n\n                        # Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let's think again.\n\n                        # Let's denote the absolute value of node u as x, and node v as y.
