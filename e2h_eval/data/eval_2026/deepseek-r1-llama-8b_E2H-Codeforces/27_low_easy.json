On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after this reversal.\n\nHmm, the input is a sequence where each element is either 1 or 2. The output is the maximum LNDS possible after reversing any possible subarray.\n\nWait, but what's the goal here? We need to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each case, and find the maximum among all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So trying all possible [l, r] would be O(n^2), which is 4 million operations. For each such reversed array, computing the LNDS is another O(n log n) step. But 4e6 * 2e3 log n is way too big—like 8e9 operations, which is way beyond what can be handled in time.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. Maybe there's some pattern or property we can exploit.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible LNDS? Well, if the entire array is already non-decreasing, then the LNDS is n. Otherwise, the maximum possible could be when all 1s come first, followed by all 2s. Or maybe the optimal is to arrange as many 1s as possible followed by 2s.\n\nSo perhaps, the optimal reversal will create a longer run of 1s or 2s, thus increasing the LNDS.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each element is either 1 or 2, the LNDS can be thought of as the count of the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after a certain point, minus any overlaps.\n\nWait, no. Because the subsequence must be non-decreasing, meaning that all 1s can come before any 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is min(count_1 + count_2, something). Wait, actually, no. Because if the original array has a lot of 1s followed by 2s, the LNDS is just n. But if it's mixed, like 1,2,1,2, etc., then the LNDS is smaller.\n\nWait, but after reversing a subarray, how does it affect the structure?\n\nLet me think about what happens when we reverse a subarray. Suppose the original array is a. When we reverse [l, r], the elements from l to r are reversed. So, for example, if the original subarray is [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r], after reversal it becomes [a_r, ..., a_{l+1}, a_l].\n\nNow, the idea is that by reversing a certain part, we can arrange the 1s and 2s in such a way that the LNDS is maximized.\n\nBut since the elements are only 1 and 2, maybe the optimal scenario is to have all 1s as far to the left as possible and all 2s as far to the right as possible. Because then the LNDS would be the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but wait, that's equal to n, because each element is either 1 or 2.\n\nWait, no. Because if the array is all 1s followed by all 2s, the LNDS is indeed n. But if the array isn't arranged that way, the LNDS is less than n.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is either n (if possible after some reversal) or some other value.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to: can we make the entire array non-decreasing by reversing some subarray? If yes, the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but even if the array isn't entirely non-decreasing, perhaps the reversal can make a larger block of 1s or 2s, thereby allowing a longer LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to maximize the number of 1s before a certain point and the number of 2s after, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the maximum possible number of 1s that can appear before a certain position, plus the number of 2s that come after that position.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the beginning, followed by 2s. So, the maximum possible is the maximum over all positions i of (number of 1s in prefix up to i) + (number of 2s in suffix starting",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s, which simplifies our approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reverse a subarray such that the LNDS is maximized. The LNDS can be maximized by arranging as many 1s as possible before 2s in the sequence.\n2. **Key Insight**: Since each element is either 1 or 2, the optimal arrangement for the LNDS is a sequence where all 1s come first followed by all 2s. This gives the maximum possible LNDS equal to the total number of elements if they can be arranged in this order.\n3. **Optimization Strategy**: For each possible position `i` in the array, compute the maximum number of 1s that can be found from the start up to `i` and the number of 2s from `i` to the end. The sum of these two values gives the potential LNDS for that position. The maximum value across all positions is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n\nsuffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\nmax_length = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    current = prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i+1]\n    if current > max_length:\n        max_length = current\n\nprint(max_length)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Array**: `prefix_ones[i]` stores the count of 1s from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.\n2. **Suffix Array**: `suffix_twos[i]` stores the count of 2s from index `i` to the end of the array.\n3. **Maximize LNDS**: For each position `i`, calculate the sum of 1s before `i` and 2s after `i`. Track the maximum value of these sums, which represents the maximum possible LNDS after any valid reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in O(n) time, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
