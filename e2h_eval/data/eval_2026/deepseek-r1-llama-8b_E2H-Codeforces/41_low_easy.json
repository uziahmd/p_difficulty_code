There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about maximizing the profit from building houses on a street with certain restrictions. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must not exceed x_i.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where each spot's height is bounded by various constraints from overlapping ranges.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each spot's maximum allowed height is determined by the most restrictive restriction covering it. Because each spot might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, if a spot is in two overlapping restrictions, the maximum height it can take is the minimum of the x_i values of those two restrictions, but also considering the global maximum h.\n\nSo maybe for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j where l_j <= i <= r_j, and also the global h. So for each spot, its maximum possible height is the min of h and the minimum x among all applicable restrictions.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each restriction applies to a range, and for a spot, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of all x_i that cover it, and also h. Because any higher, and at least one restriction is violated.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the smallest x_i among all restrictions that include this spot.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), determine all the restrictions that affect it. These are all the restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n\n2. For each such restriction, take note of x_i, and find the minimum among them. Then, the maximum height for spot i is the minimum between this value and h.\n\nOnce we have the maximum possible height for each spot, the optimal choice is to assign the maximum possible height to each spot because the profit function is the square, which increases as the height increases.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each spot i, compute the minimum x across all applicable restrictions, then cap it at h.\n- Assign that height to spot i.\n- Sum the squares.\n\nWait, does this always work? Let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nFor spot 1: only restriction is 1. So max height is min(1,3) = 1.\nSpot 2: only restriction is 3. So min(3,3) =3.\nSpot3: only restriction is 2. So min(2,3)=2.\nTotal profit: 1 +9+4=14. Which matches the example.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions, so max height is 10.\nSpot2: in both restrictions. So min(8,7) is 7, but wait, wait. Wait, for spot 2, which restrictions apply?\n\nThe first restriction is 2-3, so includes spot2. Its x is 8.\n\nThe second restriction is 3-4, which doesn't include spot2. So for spot2, only the first restriction applies. So x is 8. So max height is min(8,10) =8.\n\nWait no, wait. Spot2 is included in the first restriction (2-3). The second restriction is 3-4, so spot2 is not part of it.\n\nWait, wait. No, the second restriction is from 3 to4. So spot2 is not covered by it. So for spot2, only the first restriction applies, x is 8. So max is 8.\n\nSpot3: covered by both restrictions. So the x values are 8 and7. Min is7. So max is7.\n\nSpot4: covered only by the second restriction, x=7. So max is7.\n\nSo heights are [10,8,7,7]. Profit is 100+64+49+49=262. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach works for the examples.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions with varying x's.\n\nLike, suppose a spot is in three restrictions: x=5, x=3, x=4. The min is 3. So height is 3.\n\nSo, the key",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum value, and each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a specified height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies a range of spots and a maximum height allowed for any house in that range. For each spot, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that includes it.\n2. **Determine Maximum Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, compute the minimum height allowed by all applicable restrictions. The height assigned to each spot will be the minimum of this value and the global maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the optimal heights for all spots are determined, compute the profit as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_heights[i] = min(min_x, h)\n\nprofit = sum(hh * hh for hh in max_heights[1:])\n\nprint(profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots, maximum height, and the list of restrictions.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each spot, we determine the minimum height allowed by any restriction that covers that spot. This ensures we respect all applicable constraints.\n3. **Computing Profit**: The profit is calculated by summing the squares of the optimal heights for each spot.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all restrictions and ensures the maximum possible profit while respecting all zoning constraints.",
