He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' indicating the type of each input string.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The key here is that each string of length k (1 <= k < n) must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. But how do I figure out which ones are which?\n\nWait, but there's exactly two strings for each length, and each of them is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each length k, one of the two will be a prefix candidate and the other a suffix candidate. But how do I decide which is which?\n\nI remember that in such cases, the correct string s can be determined by seeing which possible candidates satisfy all the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe I can reconstruct the possible s. Because for each position k, the first k characters must form a prefix, and the last k characters must form a suffix.\n\nSo perhaps I can find for each possible k, the two candidates, and see which of them can lead to a consistent s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s is the one where for each k, if a string is a prefix, then it must be the same as the corresponding part of s. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut how do I find s? Maybe I can generate all possible s candidates and check which one satisfies the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 100, so the number of possible s candidates is 26^100, which is way too big. That's not feasible.\n\nSo that approach isn't going to work. I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. For each possible k, the two candidates for that length must be compatible with each other and with the overall structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be constructed by considering the overlapping between prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, for each k from 1 to n-1, we have two possible strings of length k: one is a prefix candidate, the other a suffix candidate.\n\nWait, but how do they relate? Because for s, the prefix of length k is the first k characters, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nSo, for any k, the prefix of s of length k must be equal to one of the two candidates, and the suffix of s of length k must be equal to the other.\n\nMoreover, for the next step, the prefix of length k+1 must start with the prefix of length k.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of length k+1 must end with the suffix of length k.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of length k is the last k characters of s. So the suffix of length k+1 is the last k+1 characters. So the suffix of length k must be a substring ending at the end of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is to build s step by step.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nWe can represent the possible s as a string that starts with some prefix and ends with some suffix, ensuring that for each k, the prefix of length k is one of the two candidates, and the suffix of length k is the other.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two candidates for that length are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each k, exactly one of the two is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because the problem states that the input consists of exactly two strings for each k, which are either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes, meaning that for each k, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix of s. Or wait, no—no. Wait, the problem says that Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes, but he didn't tell you which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to n-1, there are two strings provided. Each of these two is either a prefix of s of length k, or a suffix of s of length k.\n\nSo for each k, among the two, one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the problem says that exactly two strings are given for each k, and each is a prefix or a suffix of some existing s.\n\nSo for each k, exactly one of the two is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the plan is: for each k, choose which of the two is the prefix and which is the suffix. Then, using these choices, construct s and verify if it's consistent.\n\nBut how to make the choices correctly.\n\nAnother observation: for the prefixes, the prefix of length k must be a prefix of the prefix of length k+1. Similarly, for the suffixes, the suffix of length k must be a suffix of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nWait, because the suffix of length k is the last k characters of s, which is the same as the last k characters of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nSo, for each k, the suffix of length k must be a suffix of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nSo perhaps we can use this property to determine which of the two strings for each k is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nLet me think in terms of building s step by step.\n\nSuppose for each k, I have two candidates: a and b. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nIf a is the prefix of length k, then the prefix of length k+1 must start with a. Similarly, if b is the suffix of length k, then the suffix of length k+1 must end with b.\n\nSo for each k, the two candidates must have some relationship with the next k+1 level.\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be uniquely determined by considering the maximum possible prefix and suffix overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be built by choosing for each k which of the two candidates is the prefix or suffix, ensuring that the choice for k is consistent with the choice for k+1.\n\nSo for k=1, we have two options: either the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa. We can try both possibilities and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities recursively might be manageable, as the depth is 99, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect the two possible strings.\n\n2. Try all possible assignments for each k, choosing which is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that for each k, the choice is compatible with the choices for k+1.\n\n3. Once a valid assignment is found, construct s and assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\nBut this sounds computationally heavy, but perhaps manageable for n up to 100.\n\nWait, but how to model the constraints across all k's.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that for each k, the correct s must have the prefix of length k equal to one of the two candidates, and the suffix of length k equal to the other.\n\nMoreover, for the prefix of k+1, it must be equal to the prefix of k followed by some character, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo perhaps the process is to build s step by step, starting from k=1.\n\nAt each step, for each possible current state (the current prefix and suffix), try to extend them for the next k.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's define for each k:\n\nprefix_k: the string of length k that is the prefix of s.\n\nsuffix_k: the string of length k that is the suffix of s.\n\nThen, for k+1:\n\nprefix_{k+1} must be equal to prefix_k followed by some character c.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_{k+1} must be equal to some character d followed by suffix_k.\n\nSo for each k, we can determine the possible transitions.\n\nSo the initial step is for k=1.\n\nAt k=1, we have two strings: let's call them a and b.\n\nWe have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: a is the prefix_1, b is the suffix_1.\n\nThen, for k=2, the prefix_2 must start with a, and the suffix_2 must end with b.\n\nSo the possible prefix_2 candidates are those that start with a. Among the given candidates for k=2, there are two options, say x and y.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two given strings are the two possible candidates for that k.\n\nWait, but for k=2, the two strings are either the prefix and suffix for k=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, for each k, the two given strings are either the prefix and suffix for that k.\n\nSo for each k, when we're considering the transition from k to k+1, the previous prefix and suffix must align with the next step.\n\nSo perhaps for k=1, we have two options for which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce chosen, for k=2, the prefix_2 must start with prefix_1, and the suffix_2 must end with suffix_1.\n\nSo the process is as follows:\n\n- For k=1, choose which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n- For each subsequent k, the prefix_{k} must be the same as the prefix of the next k+1, and the suffix_{k} must be the suffix of the next k+1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps more accurately:\n\nWhen moving from k to k+1, the prefix_{k+1} must start with prefix_k.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix_{k+1} must end with suffix_k.\n\nSo for each possible pair (current_prefix, current_suffix) from k, we can check for k+1 whether the next prefix starts with current_prefix and the next suffix ends with current_suffix.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two given strings are the possible prefix and suffix for that k.\n\nSo for each k, the two options are:\n\nOption 1: a is prefix_k, b is suffix_k.\n\nOption 2: b is prefix_k, a is suffix_k.\n\nSo for each k, we can try both options and see which leads to a consistent solution.\n\nBut this could be done using dynamic programming, keeping track of possible (prefix, suffix) pairs at each step.\n\nYes! So here's the plan:\n\nWe can model the problem as a state machine, where each state is a possible (prefix, suffix) pair for a certain k.\n\nWe start at k=1 with the two possible options (a, b) and (b, a).\n\nThen, for each k from 2 to n-1, for each possible state from the previous step, we check which of the two possible (prefix', suffix') pairs for k are compatible.\n\nThat is, for each state (prev_p, prev_s) at k-1, the next state (p, s) must satisfy:\n\np starts with prev_p, and s ends with prev_s.\n\nThen, for each possible pair at k, we check if it can follow the previous state.\n\nIf yes, we add it to the possible states for k.\n\nWe continue this until we reach k = n-1.\n\nThe final state(s) will give us the correct prefix and suffix for that k, and thus allow us to determine s.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, we can then mark each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, grouped by their lengths.\n\n2. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings as a list.\n\n3. For each k, try both possible assignments of the two strings as prefix and suffix.\n\n4. Use a dynamic programming approach to track possible (prefix, suffix) pairs at each step, ensuring that each step is compatible with the previous.\n\n5. Once the correct state is found, construct s and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nFirst, group the input by their lengths.\n\nEach k from 1 to n-1 will have two strings. Let's create a dictionary where the key is k, and the value is a list of two strings.\n\nNext, for each k starting from 1, we'll process the two strings, trying both possible assignments as (prefix, suffix).\n\nWe can represent the DP state as a dictionary where the key is the current k, and the value is a set of possible (current_prefix, current_suffix) tuples.\n\nInitially, for k=1, the possible states are the two possible assignments of the two strings.\n\nFor each subsequent k, for each possible state from k-1, we look at the two possible (p, s) pairs for k and check if p starts with the previous prefix and s ends with the previous suffix.\n\nWait, but for k, the two possible (p, s) pairs are the two given strings for that k. Wait no. Wait, for each k, the two given strings are the possible prefixes and suffixes for that k.\n\nSo for each k, the two strings are the candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\nSo for k, the two possible (prefix, suffix) pairs are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1), assuming s1 and s2 are the two strings for that k.\n\nWait, no. Because for each k, exactly one of the two is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo for each k, the two options are:\n\nOption A: the first string is the prefix, the second is the suffix.\n\nOption B: the second string is the prefix, the first is the suffix.\n\nSo for each k, the two possible (prefix, suffix) pairs are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1).\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each k, the two strings may not necessarily be the two options. They could be any two, but exactly one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo for k, the possible pairs are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1). So in the DP, for each k, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs are these two.\n\nThus, for each k, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs are the two possibilities.\n\nSo, the DP approach is:\n\n- Start with k=1, and the two possible (s1, s2) and (s2, s1) as initial states.\n\n- For each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   - For each possible state (prev_p, prev_s) from k-1:\n\n      - Check each possible (curr_p, curr_s) for k.\n\n         - If curr_p starts with prev_p, and curr_s ends with prev_s, then this state is possible.\n\n   - Collect all possible new states for k.\n\n- After processing all k up to n-1, the remaining states are the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for k=n-1.\n\nFrom these, we can reconstruct s.\n\nBecause the prefix for k=n-1 is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters.\n\nBut how does this help us find s?\n\nWell, s must be such that its prefix of length n-1 is the prefix of k=n-1, and its suffix of length n-1 is the suffix of k=n-1.\n\nBut s has length n, so the entire s can be reconstructed by checking which s starts with the prefix of n-1 and ends with the suffix of n-1.\n\nWait, but the suffix of n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So, s can be written as c + suffix_{n-1}, where c is a single character.\n\nSimilarly, s can be written as prefix_{n-1} + d, where d is a single character.\n\nBut since the suffix of n-1 is the last n-1 characters, which must equal the suffix of k=n-1. Also, the prefix of n-1 must be the first n-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, the full s must be equal to prefix_{n-1} followed by some character, and also equal to some character followed by suffix_{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, the full s is prefix_{n-1} + d, where d is a character such that suffix_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters. So, d must be the first character of s, which is the same as the first character of prefix_{n-1}.\n\nWait, no: the prefix_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters of s. So the full s is prefix_{n-1} plus the nth character. But the suffix_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters of s, which is the same as s[1:].\n\nSo, for the full s, the prefix_{n-1} is s[0:n-1], and the suffix_{n-1} is s[1:n].\n\nThus, the full s can be obtained by:\n\ns = prefix_{n-1} + suffix_{n-1}[-1]\n\nBecause the last character of the suffix_{n-1} is the (n)th character of s.\n\nAlternatively, s can be formed by taking the prefix_{n-1} and appending a character that matches the last character of the suffix_{n-1}.\n\nWait, let's test this with an example.\n\nIn the sample input 1:\n\nn=5\n\nThe output is 'SPPSPSPS'.\n\nThe only possible s is 'ababa'.\n\nFor k=4, the prefix is 'abab', the suffix is 'baba'.\n\nSo, the full s is 'ababa', which is 'abab' + 'a'.\n\nThe suffix for k=4 is 'baba', which is the last four characters of 'ababa'.\n\nSo, yes, s can be constructed by taking the prefix of k=n-1 and adding the last character of the suffix of k=n-1.\n\nWait, but what if the prefix and suffix don't match in that way?\n\nNo, because the way the DP works ensures that for each k, the next step is compatible.\n\nSo, once the DP reaches k=n-1, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs must satisfy that the next character after the prefix is the last character of the suffix.\n\nThus, for each possible state (p, s) at k=n-1, the full s would be p + s[-1].\n\nBut how do we know which state is the correct one?\n\nWait, perhaps all possible states at k=n-1 are valid, but each leads to a different s.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input is consistent with some s.\n\nSo, perhaps all possible states at k=n-1 are valid and produce a correct s.\n\nWait, but that may not be the case. For example, if for some k, the constraints are not satisfied, then the DP would have no states, and the problem would be unsolvable.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is guaranteed to have at least one solution.\n\nSo, after processing all k's, the DP will have at least one possible state.\n\nNow, once we have the possible states at k=n-1, each state gives a possible s, which can be used to determine the correct assignment of 'P' or 'S' for each input string.\n\nWait, but for each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each input string, which is of length k (from 1 to n-1), we need to check whether it is equal to the prefix of s of length k, in which case it's a prefix, else it's a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each k, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each input string of length k, if it equals the prefix of s of length k, then it's a prefix; else, it's a suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which one is which.\n\nWait, for each k, the two strings in the input are either the prefix and suffix. So, for a given s, each of these two strings must be either the prefix or the suffix of s of length k.\n\nThus, for each input string of length k, it is either the prefix or the suffix of s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each possible state at k=n-1, construct s as p + s[-1], where p is the prefix of k=n-1.\n\n- For each s, check for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut since the problem requires that exactly one of the two strings for each k is the prefix, and the other is the suffix, it's sufficient to pick any s that is consistent with the DP.\n\nWait, but since the DP ensures that for each k, the transitions are correct, any state at k=n-1 will lead to a valid s.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Process the input, grouping by k.\n\n2. For each k from 1 to n-1, compute the two possible (prefix, suffix) pairs.\n\n3. Use DP to track possible states, ensuring that each step is compatible.\n\n4. Once the DP for k=n-1 is complete, select any possible state (p, s) to construct s as p + s[-1].\n\n5. For each input string, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\n6. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nWe can represent the DP as a dictionary where the keys are the current k, and the values are sets of tuples (prefix, suffix).\n\nInitially, for k=1, the possible states are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1).\n\nThen, for each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   For each possible state (prev_p, prev_s) in dp[k-1]:\n\n      For each possible (curr_p, curr_s) in the two options for k:\n\n          Check if curr_p starts with prev_p, and curr_s ends with prev_s.\n\n          If so, add (curr_p, curr_s) to dp[k].\n\nFinally, for k=n-1, dp[k] will have all possible states.\n\nOnce we have the states for k=n-1, we can construct s for each possible state.\n\nOnce s is constructed, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut wait, how to map the input strings back to their order.\n\nWait, the input is given as 2n-2 lines, each being a string of varying lengths. So, for each string, we need to note its length k, and whether it is the prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo, during processing, for each string, we can store its length and the string itself.\n\nThus, for each string, we can later compare it against the prefix of s of the same length to determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut wait, for each k, there are two strings in the input. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each string, if it is equal to the prefix of s of length k, it's marked as 'P'; else, it's marked as 'S'.\n\nBut how to get the correct mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the two strings in the input are the two candidates for that k. So, for each k, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix.\n\nThus, for a given s, for each k, the two strings must be either (prefix, suffix) or (suffix, prefix).\n\nBut in the input, the order is arbitrary.\n\nThus, for each string in the input, it's either the prefix or suffix of s for its own length k.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, we can find its length k. Then, in s, extract the first k characters (prefix) and the last k characters (suffix). Then, check if the string matches either of them.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each string in the input is either a prefix or a suffix of s for its own length.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, it must match either the prefix of s of length k or the suffix of s of length k.\n\nThus, for each input string, if it equals the prefix of s of length k, it's 'P'; else, 'S'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each input string:\n\n   k = len(string)\n\n   if string == prefix_k_of_s: mark as 'P'\n\n   else: mark as 'S'\n\nBut how to find the prefix_k_of_s and suffix_k_of_s.\n\nBut wait, when we construct s from the DP state, we have the prefix of length k=n-1, and the suffix of length k=n-1.\n\nBut for lower k's, the prefix and suffix are known from the DP transitions.\n\nWait, no. Because the DP only keeps track of the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for each k.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible state (p, s) at k=n-1, the full s is p + s[-1]. Then, for each k from 1 to n-1, the prefix and suffix can be derived from the DP states.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each state (p, s) at k=n-1, the full s is p + s[-1], and for each k < n-1, the prefix and suffix are known via the DP transitions.\n\nWait, no, because the DP tracks for each k, the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs.\n\nBut perhaps, for each state (p, s) at k=n-1, the s is p + s[-1], and then for each k < n-1, the prefix and suffix can be derived from the transitions.\n\nWait, but how? Because the transitions are only based on the previous state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP for each k stores the possible (prefix, suffix) pairs, and for k=n-1, the possible s's are p + s[-1], where p is the prefix and s is the suffix of k=n-1.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each k, the prefix is the first k characters of s, and the suffix is the last k characters of s.\n\nThus, for each input string, we can check whether it matches the prefix or suffix for its own k.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nAfter constructing s, for each input string, determine if it's the prefix or suffix of s of the same length.\n\nBut the problem is that for each k, the two input strings must be either the prefix or the suffix. So, for each k, one is 'P' and the other is 'S'.\n\nThus, for each input string, regardless of its position in the input, we just need to check whether it's the prefix or suffix of s of its own length.\n\nOnce we have s, this is straightforward.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read 2n-2 strings, each possibly followed by a newline. Note that the input may be read as lines, each stripped of whitespace.\n\n3. Group the strings by their length k into a dictionary, say, by_length. So, by_length[k] is a list of two strings for that k.\n\n4. For each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Get the two strings, s1 and s2.\n\n   b. Create a list of possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for this k: [(s1, s2), (s2, s1)].\n\n5. Initialize the DP:\n\n   dp = {1: set of possible (p, s) pairs}\n\n   For k=1, dp[1] is {(s1, s2), (s2, s1)}.\n\n6. For each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   a. current_possible_pairs = list of (s1, s2), (s2, s1) for this k.\n\n   b. new_dp = empty set.\n\n   c. For each (prev_p, prev_s) in dp[k-1]:\n\n      i. For each (curr_p, curr_s) in current_possible_pairs:\n\n         - Check if curr_p starts with prev_p.\n\n         - Check if curr_s ends with prev_s.\n\n         - If both conditions are met, add (curr_p, curr_s) to new_dp.\n\n   d. Set dp[k] = new_dp.\n\n7. After processing all k up to n-1, for each state in dp[n-1], construct s as curr_p + curr_s[-1].\n\n8. For each state in dp[n-1], construct s. Since the problem guarantees at least one solution, at least one of these s will be valid.\n\n9. Once s is determined, for each input string, determine whether it's the prefix or suffix of s of its own length.\n\n10. Assign 'P' or 'S' to each string accordingly.\n\nBut wait, how to handle multiple possible s's.\n\nBecause for some cases, there may be multiple states in dp[n-1], each leading to a different s.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one s that is consistent with the input.\n\nBut how to ensure that all possible s's are considered.\n\nWait, perhaps all possible s's derived from the states in dp[n-1] are valid, and any of them can be chosen.\n\nThus, for the output, any of them can be used, as long as it's consistent.\n\nThus, for the purpose of generating the output, any of the possible s's can be chosen.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is equal to the prefix of s of its own length. If yes, mark 'P'; else, mark 'S'.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nWe can represent dp as a dictionary where each key is k, and the value is a set of tuples (prefix, suffix).\n\nInitialize dp[1] as the two possible (s1, s2) and (s2, s1).\n\nThen, for each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   current_strings = the two strings for this k.\n\n   possible_pairs = [(current_strings[0], current_strings[1]), (current_strings[1], current_strings[0])]\n\n   new_dp = empty set.\n\n   for each (prev_p, prev_s) in dp[k-1]:\n\n       for (curr_p, curr_s) in possible_pairs:\n\n           if curr_p starts with prev_p and curr_s ends with prev_s:\n\n               add (curr_p, curr_s) to new_dp.\n\n   dp[k] = new_dp.\n\nBut wait, for each k, the two strings are the ones provided in the input for that k.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nWe can create a list for each k, which holds the two strings.\n\nThus, the code steps:\n\nRead all the input strings.\n\nGroup them by their lengths into a dictionary, where each key k has a list of two strings.\n\nThen, for each k from 1 to n-1, the two strings are in by_length[k].\n\nThus, for each k, possible_pairs = [ (s1, s2), (s2, s1) ].\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut in Python, reading the input is a bit tricky because the input may contain newlines.\n\nSo, perhaps read all lines, stripping whitespace, and then group them by their lengths.\n\nOnce we have the grouped strings, proceed.\n\nOnce the DP is complete, for each state in dp[n-1], construct s as p + s[-1].\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nThus, the code outline is:\n\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2*n-2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\nby_length = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    k = len(s)\n    if k not in by_length:\n        by_length[k] = []\n    by_length[k].append(s)\n\n# Now, process the DP\ndp = {1: set()}\nfor k in by_length:\n    if k == 1:\n        # Initial step\n        s1, s2 = by_length[k]\n        dp[1].add( (s1, s2) )\n        dp[1].add( (s2, s1) )\n    else:\n        pass  # Not handled yet\n\nWait, no. The by_length should include all k from 1 to n-1.\n\nWait, the code above reads 2n-2 strings, which are for k=1 to k=n-1, each appearing twice.\n\nThus, by_length will have keys from 1 to n-1, each with two strings.\n\nBut in the code, the way to initialize dp is:\n\ndp = {}\n\nfor k in range(1, n):\n\n   if k not in by_length:\n\n       continue  # shouldn't happen\n\n   s1, s2 = by_length[k]\n\n   possible_pairs = [ (s1, s2), (s2, s1) ]\n\n   if k == 1:\n\n       current_states = set()\n\n       for p, s in possible_pairs:\n\n           current_states.add( (p, s) )\n\n       dp[k] = current_states\n\n   else:\n\n       # Get the previous states\n\n       prev_states = dp.get(k-1, set())\n\n       current_states = set()\n\n       for (prev_p, prev_s) in prev_states:\n\n           for (curr_p, curr_s) in possible_pairs:\n\n               if curr_p.startswith(prev_p) and curr_s.endswith(prev_s):\n\n                   current_states.add( (curr_p, curr_s) )\n\n       dp[k] = current_states\n\nBut wait, the initial code for k=1 may not be correct. Because for k=1, the possible pairs are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1), which are the two options.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ndp = {}\nfor k in range(1, n):\n    s_list = by_length[k]\n    s1, s2 = s_list\n    possible_pairs = [ (s1, s2), (s2, s1) ]\n    if k == 1:\n        current_states = set()\n        for p, s in possible_pairs:\n            current_states.add( (p, s) )\n        dp[k] = current_states\n    else:\n        prev_states = dp[k-1]\n        current_states = set()\n        for (prev_p, prev_s) in prev_states:\n            for (curr_p, curr_s) in possible_pairs:\n                if curr_p.startswith(prev_p) and curr_s.endswith(prev_s):\n                    current_states.add( (curr_p, curr_s) )\n        dp[k] = current_states\n\nOnce the DP is filled, for each state in dp[n-1], construct s as p + s[-1].\n\nBut wait, for k =n-1, the state is (p, s), and the full s is p + s[-1].\n\nThen, for each state in dp[n-1], we can construct s.\n\nBut how to choose which state to use.\n\nIn the sample input 1, the correct s is 'ababa'.\n\nLooking at the states for k=4 (since n=5), the state is ('abab', 'baba').\n\nConstructing s as 'abab' + 'a' gives 'ababa', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nOnce s is constructed, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nThus, for each string in strings:\n\n   k = len(string)\n\n   if string == s[:k]: mark as 'P'\n\n   else: mark as 'S'\n\nBut wait, for k=1, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix.\n\nThus, for each string, regardless of being in the input before or after others, it's either the prefix or suffix of s for its own length.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nresult = ['S'] * len(strings)\n\nfor idx, s_str in enumerate(strings):\n    k = len(s_str)\n    if s_str == s[:k]:\n        result[idx] = 'P'\n    else:\n        result[idx] = 'S'\n\nBut wait, s is of length n. So for a string of length k, the first k characters of s are s[:k], which is the prefix of s of length k.\n\nSimilarly, the last k characters are s[-k:].\n\nThus, for a string s_str of length k, if s_str equals s[:k], it's a prefix; else, it's a suffix.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest Case 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\na\n\nc\n\nPossible s is 'ac' or 'ca'.\n\nIn the first case, for k=1:\n\nprefix is 'a', suffix is 'c'.\n\ns is 'a' + 'c' → 'ac'.\n\nThus, the input strings are 'a' (length 1) and 'c' (length 1).\n\nFor 'a': it's the prefix → 'P'.\n\nFor 'c': it's the suffix → 'S'.\n\nThus, the output is 'PS'.\n\nAlternatively, if the state is (c, a), then s is 'ca'.\n\nThus, 'c' is the prefix, 'a' is the suffix.\n\nThus, 'c' is 'P', 'a' is 'S'.\n\nThus, the output is 'SP'.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nThus, the code needs to correctly capture this.\n\nNow, testing the code for this case.\n\nby_length[1] = ['a', 'c']\n\ndp[1] is {(a,c), (c,a)}.\n\nFor k=2, since n=2, but n-1=1, so no further processing.\n\nThus, for each state in dp[1], construct s.\n\nState (a, c): s = 'ac'.\n\nState (c, a): s = 'ca'.\n\nThus, for each string:\n\nFirst string is 'a' (k=1): if s starts with 'a', it's 'P'.\n\nSecond string is 'c' (k=1): if s starts with 'c', it's 'P'; else 'S'.\n\nThus, for s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves using dynamic programming to track possible states of the string `s` and then constructing `s` from these states.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Grouping**: Read all input strings and group them by their lengths. This helps in efficiently processing each length separately.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) dictionary where each key is a length `k` and the value is a set of tuples representing possible pairs of prefix and suffix of length `k`.\n3. **State Transition Using DP**: For each length from 2 to `n-1`, compute possible pairs of prefix and suffix that are compatible with the previous state. This ensures that each step builds on valid transitions.\n4. **Constructing the String `s`**: From the final states at `n-1`, construct the possible string `s` by appending the last character of the suffix to the prefix.\n5. **Determine Prefix/Suffix for Each Input String**: For each input string, check if it matches the prefix or suffix of the constructed string `s` and mark accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\nby_length = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    k = len(s)\n    if k not in by_length:\n        by_length[k] = []\n    by_length[k].append(s)\n\ndp = {}\n\nfor k in range(1, n):\n    s_list = by_length.get(k, [])\n    if not s_list:\n        continue  # should not happen as per problem statement\n    s1, s2 = s_list\n    possible_pairs = [(s1, s2), (s2, s1)]\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        current_states = set()\n        for p, s in possible_pairs:\n            current_states.add((p, s))\n        dp[k] = current_states\n    else:\n        prev_states = dp.get(k-1, set())\n        current_states = set()\n        for (prev_p, prev_s) in prev_states:\n            for (curr_p, curr_s) in possible_pairs:\n                if curr_p.startswith(prev_p) and curr_s.endswith(prev_s):\n                    current_states.add((curr_p, curr_s))\n        dp[k] = current_states\n\n# Determine s from the states at k = n-1\npossible_s = []\nif n-1 in dp:\n    for (p, s) in dp[n-1]:\n        possible_s.append(p + s[-1])\n\n# Choose the first possible s (any will do as per problem statement)\nif possible_s:\n    s = possible_s[0]\nelse:\n    s = ''\n\nresult = ['S'] * len(strings)\nfor idx, s_str in enumerate(strings):\n    k = len(s_str)\n    if s[:k] == s_str:\n        result[idx] = 'P'\n    else:\n        result[idx] = 'S'\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading and Grouping Input**: The input strings are read and grouped by their lengths to facilitate processing each length separately.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The DP dictionary is initialized with possible prefix and suffix pairs for the smallest length (1).\n3. **State Transition**: For each subsequent length, the DP dictionary is updated with new states that are compatible with the previous states, ensuring that each transition is valid.\n4. **Constructing the String `s`**: The final states at `n-1` are used to construct possible strings `s`. The correct `s` is chosen based on the problem constraints.\n5. **Marking Prefix/Suffix**: Each input string is checked against the constructed string `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is marked accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible strings `s` and ensures that the solution is consistent with the given constraints.",
