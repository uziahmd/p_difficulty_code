    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are only between adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Hmm, that's an interesting constraint.\n\nLet me think about what these swaps allow. So, for example, I can swap '0' and '1' as many times as needed because they are adjacent. But wait, I can't swap '0' and '2' directly because the problem says you can only swap '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, that means '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped. But wait, maybe indirectly through '1's. Like, if I have a sequence like '0', '1', '2', then perhaps I can move the '0' past the '1's and then past the '2's by swapping with the '1's in between. Or is that not possible?\n\nWait, no. Because the '0' can only be swapped with '1's, and the '1's can be swapped with '2's. So, for example, let's say I have '0 1 2'. The '1' can be swapped with '2' to become '0 2 1'. Then, the '2' can't be swapped with '0', but the '0' can't be directly moved past the '2' since they're adjacent. So in this case, the '0' is stuck before the '2'.\n\nWait, but what about longer sequences? For instance, if I have '0 1 1 2'. The '0' can be moved past all the '1's by swapping each time. Similarly, the '2' can be moved left by swapping each '1' with it. So the '0's and '2's can be reordered relative to each other via their interaction with '1's.\n\nSo, perhaps the key here is that '0's can only be moved through '1's, and '2's can only be moved through '1's. So, any '0's can be reordered among themselves without any issues, as well as any '2's can be reordered among themselves. But when it comes to '0's and '2's relative to each other, their order depends on the arrangement of '1's.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So how can we model this?\n\nI think the approach is to consider the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's, and see how they can be rearranged given the swap constraints.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem:\n\n- '0's can be swapped with adjacent '1's. So, all '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, but cannot pass through '2's.\n- '2's can be swapped with adjacent '1's. So, all '2's can be moved to the left past '1's, but cannot pass through '0's.\n- So, within the '0's and '1's, the '0's can be arranged in any order relative to each other, but their position relative to '2's is determined by the '1's in between.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not entirely accurate. Let's think: suppose we have a string like '0 0 1 1 2 2'. What can we do? Well, the two '0's can be swapped with the '1's on their right. So the '0's can be moved to the left past the '1's, but can't go beyond the '1's. The '2's can be moved to the left past the '1's, but can't go beyond the '1's either. So the '0's are on the left of the '1's, which are on the left of the '2's. So in this case, the order of '0's and '2's is fixed relative to each other.\n\nBut what if the string is '0 1 2 1 0'? How does that play out? The '0's can move past the '1's, but the '2' is in between. So the first '0' can be moved to the right past the '1's, but can't cross the '2' unless it's swapped through a '1'. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nIn '0 1 2 1 0', the first '0' can be swapped with the first '1' to get '1 0 2 1 0', then the second '0' can be swapped with the '1' before it. But the '2' is in between the two '0's. So the '2' is stuck between the two '0's because you can't swap '0' and '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can only be swapped with '1's and '1's can be swapped with '2's. This means:\n- '0's can be reordered among themselves relative to each other.\n- '2's can be reordered among themselves relative to each other.\n- However, the relative order of '0's and '2's is determined by their positions relative to '1's.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can process the string in two passes:\n1. **Left to Right Pass**: Move all '0's as far left as possible, swapping them with adjacent '1's.\n2. **Right to Left Pass**: Move all '2's as far left as possible, swapping them with adjacent '1's.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the smallest lexicographical order by first moving '0's to the left and then moving '2's to the left, considering the constraints on swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Convert the string into a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    \n    # First pass: move all '0's as far left as possible\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s_list) - 1:\n        if s_list[i] == '1' and s_list[i + 1] == '0':\n            s_list[i], s_list[i + 1] = s_list[i + 1], s_list[i]\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Second pass: move all '2's as far left as possible\n    j = len(s_list) - 1\n    while j > 0:\n        if s_list[j] == '1' and s_list[j - 1] == '2':\n            s_list[j], s_list[j - 1] = s_list[j - 1], s_list[j]\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Left to Right Pass**: We iterate through the string from left to right. Whenever we encounter a '1' followed by a '0', we swap them. This effectively moves '0's to the left as much as possible.\n2. **Right to Left Pass**: We then iterate from right to left. Whenever we encounter a '1' followed by a '2', we swap them. This moves '2's to the left as much as possible.\n\nBy processing the string in these two passes, we ensure that the resulting string is the smallest possible lexicographically, given the constraints on allowed swaps. This approach efficiently handles the problem within linear time complexity, making it suitable for strings up to the maximum constraint length.",
