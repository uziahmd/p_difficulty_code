Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai - d) and ends at min(l, ai + d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Maybe it's similar to interval covering problems. But since d is a variable, I need to find the minimal d that satisfies certain conditions based on the lantern positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the gaps between the coverage of consecutive lanterns. Because if two lanterns are close enough, their combined coverage will fill the gap. If they're too far apart, then d has to be large enough to cover that gap.\n\nSo, here's an idea: sort the lantern positions. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the required d to cover the gap between them. The maximum of these required d's across all consecutive pairs will be the minimal d needed.\n\nBut wait, that might not capture all cases. Because sometimes, a single lantern's coverage might extend beyond its immediate neighbors. Oh right, because the minimal d could be determined by a triplet of lanterns, not just adjacent ones.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach: the minimal d must be such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern. So, for any position x on the street, there exists a lantern ai such that |x - ai| <= d.\n\nTo find the minimal d, perhaps we can model this as the maximum distance from any point in [0, l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is equal to the minimal value where the maximum of (distance from any point x in [0, l] to the nearest lantern) is less than or equal to d.\n\nThis sounds like a classic problem where we need to find the minimal d such that the entire interval is covered by the union of the intervals around each lantern.\n\nHow to compute this? Well, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximal distance between two consecutive lanterns when sorted, divided by two, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given. In the second sample input, the lanterns are at 2 and 5, and l is 5. When d=2, the first lantern covers 0 to 4, and the second covers 3 to 7 (but since l is 5, it's up to 5). So the union is 0-5, which is the whole street. So the required d is 2.\n\nAnother way to look: the two lanterns are 3 units apart (5-2=3). So each needs to cover half the gap to meet in the middle. So d would be 1.5, but in this case, the required d is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to consider all possible points where coverage must overlap. For example, in the sorted lanterns, the coverage must start before the next lantern and end after the previous one.\n\nSo, after sorting the lanterns, for each i from 1 to n-1, the distance between lantern[i-1] and lantern[i] is delta. The coverage for the first lantern must reach at least up to lantern[i], and the coverage for the second must reach back at least to lantern[i-1]. So for each pair, the required d is at least (delta)/2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each lantern contributes a range of d on either side. So the minimal d must be such that the coverage of lanterns i-1 and i overlaps. The coverage of i-1 is [a_{i-1} - d, a_{i-1} + d], and the coverage of i is [a_i -d, a_i +d]. These must overlap. So the distance between a_{i-1} and a_i must be <= 2d. So d >= (a_i - a_{i-1})/2.\n\nBut wait, that's only for adjacent lanterns. But perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2 for all i, as well as considering the ends of the street.\n\nWait, also, the first lantern's left coverage must be >=0, and the last lantern's right coverage must be <=l.\n\nSo, the steps I should take:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. Check the initial and final coverage:\n   - The first lantern's coverage starts at a[0] - d. This must be <=0?\n   No, wait, the coverage is from max(0, a[0]-d) to min(l, a[0]+d). So for the entire street to be covered, the first lantern's left coverage must be <= the next lantern's left coverage, but perhaps it's better to consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by three factors:\na) The distance from the first lantern to 0. So d must be at least a[0], because a[0] -d >=0 implies d <= a[0]. Wait, no. Because the coverage starts at a[0]-d, which must be <=0. So a[0] -d <=0 => d >= a[0]. Similarly, the last lantern's coverage must end at a[-1]+d >= l. So a[-1] +d >= l => d >= l - a[-1].\n\nb) For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be <= 2d. So for each i from 1 to n-1, a[i] - a[i-1] <= 2d. So d >= (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of all these three factors: a[0], l - a[-1], and the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 over all i.\n\nWait, but is that sufficient?\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15\n\nLanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nWhen sorted: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute the factors:\n\na[0] = 0, so d must be >=0.\n\nl - a[-1] =15-15=0.\n\nFor the consecutive differences:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 →1\n\n7-5=2→1\n\n9-7=2→1\n\n14-9=5→2.5\n\n15-14=1→0.5\n\nMaximum of these is 2.5.\n\nSo d would be 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5.\n\nLanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nSorted: 2,5.\n\na[0]=2, so d must be >=2.\n\nl -a[-1] =5-5=0.\n\nConsecutive difference:5-2=3 →1.5.\n\nMax of 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, yes, this approach seems to work.\n\nWhat about other cases?\n\nCase where a lantern is at 0: For example, n=1, l=10. Then a[0] =0. So d must be >=0 (since a[0] -d <=0) and >=10 (since a[0]+d >=10 → d >=10). So d is 10.\n\nAnother case: two lanterns at 0 and l. Then the consecutive difference is l, so d must be >=l/2. Also, a[0] is 0, so d >=0, and l -a[-1] is 0. So d is l/2.\n\nWait, but what if there are more lanterns that require a larger d? Like, suppose lanterns are at 0, l/2, and l. Then the consecutive differences are l/2 and l/2. So d needs to be at least (l/2)/2 = l/4. But the first lantern must cover up to l/2, which is 0 + l/4 >= l/2? No, because 0 + l/4 is l/4 < l/2. So the first lantern's coverage is 0 to l/4, the next is l/2 -d to l/2 +d, etc. Wait, perhaps this approach misses something.\n\nWait, no, in that case, the minimal d would be determined by the consecutive differences. For example, for 0, l/2, l: the differences are l/2 and l/2. So the required d is (l/2)/2 = l/4. But let's see:\n\nFirst lantern: 0 -d = -d ≤0, 0 +d =d.\n\nSecond: l/2 -d, l/2 +d.\n\nThird: l -d, l +d.\n\nSo, the first and second must overlap: 0 +d >= l/2 -d → d >= l/4.\n\nSimilarly, the second and third must overlap: l/2 +d >= l -d → d >= (l - l/2)/2 = l/4.\n\nSo the minimal d is l/4.\n\nSo the approach holds.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[1,4], l=5.\n\nThe consecutive difference is 3, so required d is 1.5.\n\nAlso, a[0] is 1 → d >=1.\n\nl -a[-1] =5-4=1 →d>=1.\n\nSo d is max(1, 1.5, 1) =1.5.\n\nWhat happens when d=1.5?\n\nFirst lantern covers 1-1.5= -0.5 (so 0) to 1+1.5=2.5.\n\nSecond covers 4-1.5=2.5 to 4+1.5=5.5 (so 5).\n\nSo union is 0-5, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a=[0,5,10], l=10.\n\nDifferences are 5 and 5. So required d is 2.5.\n\nCheck coverage:\n\nFirst covers 0 to 2.5.\n\nSecond covers 2.5 to 7.5.\n\nThird covers 7.5 to 12.5, but l is 10, so 7.5 to 10.\n\nSo union is 0-10.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about if the lanterns are not in order? Oh, right, the first step is to sort them.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the required d as the maximum of:\n\n   a. a[0] (since the first lantern's left coverage must be 0)\n\n   b. l - a[-1] (the last lantern's right coverage must be l)\n\n   c. For each consecutive pair, (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2.\n\n3. The minimal d is the maximum of these values.\n\nWait, but wait: what if there are multiple lanterns beyond a certain point, but their coverage already covers the street without requiring a large d? For example, if the lanterns are spread out, but the minimal d is determined by the first and last lanterns.\n\nYes, that's already considered because a[0] and l -a[-1] are part of the calculation.\n\nSo the steps are clear. Now, the code.\n\nRead the input: first line is n and l, then the next line is n integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the maximum of a[0], l - a[-1], and for each i from 1 to n-1, (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.\n\nTake the maximum of all these.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute the initial d as 0.\n\nSet d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nThen for each i in 1 to len(a)-1:\n\n   diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   required_d = diff / 2\n\n   if required_d > d:\n\n       d = required_d\n\nSo that's the process.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Then, the lantern is at a[0]. So the coverage must be from 0 to l. So the required d is max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nWhich is handled by the code.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a[0]=5, l=5. Then d=0, since 5-0=5, but 5 >=0 and 5 >=5-5=0. So d=0.\n\nWait, no, the coverage is [5,5], but l is 5. So yes, the entire street is covered.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a[0]=0, l=10. Then d must be 10, because the coverage is 0-10, which covers the entire street.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, wait, the input is read as a string, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So, for the first sample, the first line is '7 15' followed by the lanterns, and the second line is '2 5' followed by two lanterns.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the input is given as a single string per test case. So, in the problem statement's example, the input is given as two lines. So the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — but wait, that's probably a formatting issue. Because in reality, the input is two lines: the first line is '7 15', then the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement's input is presented as two separate lines, but in code, it's read as a single string. So, in code, I should read the entire input, split into lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nWait, no, because for the first sample, the input is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'], but that's not how it's read. Wait, perhaps the actual input is two lines, each line containing the necessary data.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement shows the input as two lines, but the sample input is written as two strings, each representing the input. So perhaps the code needs to read two lines, each being the data.\n\nSo, in code, read the first line as n and l, then the second line as the list of a's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce we have a sorted list, compute the required d as described.\n\nThen, output d with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na.sort()\n\nd = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, len(a)):\n\n    diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    required_d = diff / 2\n\n    if required_d > d:\n\n        d = required_d\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but wait: what if n is zero? Oh, but according to the constraints, n is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute:\n\na[0] is 0 → d starts at 0.\n\nl - a[-1] is 15-15=0.\n\nNow, check each consecutive pair:\n\n0 to 3: 3/2=1.5 → d becomes 1.5.\n\n3 to5: 2/2=1 → no change.\n\n5 to7: 2/2=1 → no change.\n\n7 to9: same.\n\n9 to14:5/2=2.5 → d becomes 2.5.\n\n14 to15:1/2=0.5 → no change.\n\nSo d is 2.5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5] → sorted [2,5].\n\na[0]=2 → d=2.\n\nl -a[-1]=0.\n\nCheck 5-2=3 → 1.5. So d becomes 2.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=0, l=10.\n\nd is max(0, 10-0=10) →10.\n\nAnother test: n=3, a=[0,5,10], l=10.\n\nd starts as 0 and 0.\n\nCheck 5-0=5 →2.5.\n\n10-5=5 →2.5. So d is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the solution is to implement this logic.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are covered by lanterns placed at various positions along the street. Each lantern lights a segment of the street from \\( ai - d \\) to \\( ai + d \\), and we need to ensure that the entire street is lit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in non-decreasing order. This helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial Constraints**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) must be such that:\n   - The first lantern covers from 0 to \\( a[0] + d \\).\n   - The last lantern covers from \\( a[-1] - d \\) to \\( l \\).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be covered by their respective light radii. The required \\( d \\) for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum \\( d \\)**: The minimum \\( d \\) needed is the maximum of the initial constraints and the largest required \\( d \\) from any gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    a.sort()\n    \n    # Calculate initial d based on the first and last lanterns\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check each consecutive pair to find the maximum required d\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > d:\n            d = required_d\n    \n    # Print with sufficient precision\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\). The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate gap calculations.\n3. **Initial Constraints**: The initial value of \\( d \\) is set based on the coverage required by the first and last lanterns.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required \\( d \\) is calculated as half the distance between them. The maximum of these values determines the necessary \\( d \\) to ensure coverage.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street using the given lanterns, handling both edge cases and typical scenarios effectively.",
