Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game with string substitutions. The goal is to process a series of substitution queries on a string and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem says that each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For each such query, every occurrence of digit di in the string s is replaced by ti. The order of the queries matters because each one is applied in sequence.\n\nFor example, if the string is '123123' and the first query is \"2→00\", it becomes '10031003'. Then another query \"3→\" replaces all 3s with empty strings, resulting in '1212'.\n\nAfter processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit (like zero), and then find its remainder when divided by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, but wait: the note says that leading zeros should be ignored when representing the number. So for instance, if the string is '000', the numeric value is zero. But if it's '01234', it's treated as 1234. However, the problem also says that after replacement, leading zeros are not removed—wait, no, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string s. Wait, no: the note says, \"Note that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\" So for example, in the third sample, the output is '777', which is 777, but perhaps the intermediate steps had leading zeros that were preserved.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the third sample:\n\nInput:\n222\n2\n2→0\n0→7\n\nSo the initial string is '222'. After the first query, replace '2's with '0's, so the string becomes '000'. Then the second query is '0→7', so each '0' is replaced with '7', giving '777'. So the output is 777, which is correct.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? Like, suppose after some substitution, the string starts with multiple zeros. Those zeros are part of the number, but when you convert to an integer, leading zeros are ignored. But according to the problem statement, the numeric representation ignores leading zeros. So for the final string, any leading zeros should be stripped except when the entire string is zero.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Process each query in order, replacing all occurrences of di with ti in the current string.\n2. After all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, stripping leading zeros, but if the string is empty or consists of all zeros, treat it as zero.\n3. Compute this number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently represent the transformations. Because the string can be up to 105 characters initially, and each substitution can change the string length significantly, especially since substitutions can replace a single character with a longer string or even an empty string.\n\nBut handling this directly for each query might be computationally feasible, given the constraints. Because n is up to 105, and each substitution can have a ti of up to 105 total characters across all queries.\n\nWait, the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. So each individual ti can be up to 105, but n is up to 105, so each ti could be up to 105 / n on average. So, for each substitution, the maximum added per substitution is manageable.\n\nSo, how do we model the string after each substitution?\n\nWe can represent the current state of the string as a list of digits, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the transformation as a function, and compute the result step by step.\n\nBut considering that each substitution is applied in order, and each substitution affects the current string, perhaps the best way is to process each substitution step-by-step, updating the string each time.\n\nYes, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - di is the digit to replace.\n   - ti is the replacement string.\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in s with ti.\n   - So, for each character in s, if it's di, we append ti to a new string. Otherwise, we append the character.\n- After processing all queries, process the final string to compute the number.\n\nNow, the issue is that processing each substitution naively could be O(L) for each substitution, where L is the current length of s. Since each substitution can add or remove characters, but the worst case is that each substitution is O(L), and n is 105, so overall O(105 * 105) = 11,025 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s as a string.\n2. Read n, then read n queries, each as a tuple (di, ti).\n3. For each query, create a new string by replacing all occurrences of di in the current s with ti.\n4. After all queries, process the final string:\n   a. If the string is empty, the number is 0.\n   b. Else, strip leading zeros until the first non-zero character, or leave it as zero if all are zeros.\n5. Convert this processed string to a number, then compute mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but wait: in the third sample, the result after substitution was '777', which is 777. So, the leading zeros are not stripped because the string after substitution is '777'—no leading zeros. But in another case, say the string after substitution is '00123', the numeric value is 123.\n\nSo, in code, after getting the final string, we need to process it into a number by:\n\n- Removing leading zeros.\n- If all characters are zero, leave it as zero.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf the final string is '0', the number is 0.\n\nIf it's '0000', the number is 0.\n\nIf it's '0123', the number is 123.\n\nIf it's '1000000008', the number is 1000000008, but mod 1e9+7 is 1000000008 % 1e9+7. Wait, but 1e9+7 is 1000000007. So 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich is exactly the fourth sample's output.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\nProcess the string through each substitution, then process the final string to extract the numeric value correctly, then compute the mod.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the initial string is s, which is read from the input. Then, for each query, we perform the substitution.\n\nIn Python, strings are immutable, so for each substitution, we'll create a new string.\n\nFor example, for each query, we can loop through each character in the current string and build a new string by replacing di with ti.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nThen, process current_s to get the number.\n\nProcessing current_s:\n\nif current_s is empty, number is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nstrip leading zeros, but if all are zeros, keep at least one zero.\n\nnumber_str = current_s.lstrip('0')\n\nif len(number_str) == 0:\n    number = 0\nelse:\n    number = int(number_str) if number_str else 0\n\nWait, no. Because if current_s is all zeros, lstrip gives empty string, so number is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have the number, compute number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait: current_s may have leading zeros, but when converted to a number, those are ignored.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\nif not current_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # process the string\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped:\n        num = int(stripped)\n    else:\n        num = 0\n    print(num % mod)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for the third case, the string is '777', which is correct. For the fourth sample, the string is '1000000008', which is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7=1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n222\n2\n2→0\n0→7\n\nAfter first substitution, current_s is '000'. Second substitution, replace '0's with '7's: '777'. So the output is 777.\n\nAnother test case: s is '0', n=0. The output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: s is '123', n=1, query '1→0'. So the string becomes '023'. Stripping leading zeros gives '23', which is 23.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut now, what about when the substitution leads to multiple replacements in a single step? For example, in the first substitution, '2's are replaced by '00', so each '2' becomes two '0's. That should be handled correctly.\n\nAnother point to consider: the order of substitution. Queries are processed in the order they are given. So, earlier queries affect the outcome of later ones.\n\nSo, the code correctly processes each substitution in the order given.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if di is a multi-digit string? No, according to the problem statement, each query has di as exactly one digit. So, each substitution only replaces single-digit occurrences.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9)\". So, in each query, di is a single character, and ti is any string.\n\nTherefore, the code correctly loops through each character in current_s, checking if it's equal to di, and appending ti or the character accordingly.\n\nAnother edge case: when ti is empty. For example, a query '3→' will replace all '3's with nothing, effectively removing them.\n\nYes, that's handled correctly.\n\nWhat about when s is empty after substitution? For example, s is '3', and the query is '3→'. Then current_s becomes empty, so the output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: s is '0', and there are multiple substitutions that leave it as '0'. For example, n=2, first substitution is '0→1', making s '1', second substitution is '1→0', making s '0'. So the output is 0.\n\nYes, code handles that.\n\nAnother thing: since the sum of lengths of ti is up to 105, the substitution strings can be up to 105 in total, but each individual substitution's ti can be up to 105.\n\nSo, the code's approach is acceptable in terms of performance.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the initial string, read the queries, process each substitution, then process the final string into a number, then output the mod.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is given as ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', ...], but in reality, the input is provided as lines. So, for the first line, it's the initial string, then the next line is n, then n lines of queries.\n\nSo, in code, the initial s is read via input().strip(), then n is int(input()), then for each of n lines, the query is read.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '123123\\n1\\n2->00' which is probably a typo in the way the sample is presented. So, the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is s.\n\nSecond line is n.\n\nThird to n+2 line are the queries.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    # Split on '->', which is the delimiter between di and ti.\n\n    parts = line.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1]\n\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\nThen process each query.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    di, ti = line.split('->')\n\n    queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n\n    new_s = []\n\n    for c in current_s:\n\n        if c == di:\n\n            new_s.append(ti)\n\n        else:\n\n            new_s.append(c)\n\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now process current_s to get the number.\n\nif not current_s:\n\n    num = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n\n    if stripped:\n\n        num = int(stripped)\n\n    else:\n\n        num = 0\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nprint( num % mod )\n\nWait, but what about the case where the stripped is empty but the original is not empty? Like, current_s is '0000' → stripped is '', so num is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, wait, the sample input is written as a list, but perhaps it's a mistake. In reality, the input is:\n\nLine 1: 123123\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: 2->00\n\nLine 4: 3->\n\nLine 5: 222\n\nLine 6: 2\n\nLine 7: 2->0\n\nLine 8: 0->7\n\nLine 9: 1000000008\n\nLine 10: 0\n\nWait, but the sample output shows four outputs, but perhaps each line is a separate test case. Or maybe the sample is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Print a single integer...\" implying that for each input, the output is one integer.\n\nBut looking back, the sample input is shown as:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich seems like four different test cases. But that's probably a formatting issue in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is a separate test case, but the way it's presented isn't clear.\n\nBut in any case, for each input, the code will process the given s and n queries, and output one number.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample in the problem:\n\nSample Input:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\nSo, the initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter substitution, replace '2's with '00'.\n\nSo, the string becomes '13031003' → because the two '2's are replaced by '00's.\n\nWait, original string is '123123':\n\nIndices 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:1, 4:2, 5:3.\n\nAfter replacing '2's with '00', it becomes '1' followed by '00', then '3', then '1', then '00', then '3' → '1003003003'? Wait, no: the string is '123123', replacing each '2' with '00'.\n\nSo, positions 1 and 4 are '2's. So, the new string is '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, after all queries, the number is 10031003. Modulo 1e9+7 is 10031003.\n\nSo, the code would output 10031003 mod 1e9+7, which is 10031003.\n\nBut wait, in the problem's sample output, the first output is '10031003' but when converted to a number, it's 10031003, which mod 1e9+7 is 10031003.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output is the remainder. So, the code's output matches.\n\nAnother sample in the problem:\n\nThird sample input:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo, after the first substitution, '222' becomes '000'. Then, the second substitution replaces '0's with '7's, so '777' → number is 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nYes.\n\nFourth sample input:\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nNo queries. So the string remains '1000000008'.\n\nStripping leading zeros: '1000000008' → number is 1000000008, mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when s is '0', n=0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: s='3', n=1, query '3→' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: s='10', n=2, first query '1→0', second query '0→5'.\n\nAfter first substitution, '10' becomes '00'. Second substitution, each '0' becomes '5', so '55'. Number is 55.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).

This is done iteratively for each query in sequence.\n3. **Handling Substitutions**: Each substitution is applied by iterating through the current string and building a new string where each occurrence of the target digit is replaced by the given substring.\n4. **Final String Processing**: After processing all queries, convert the final string into a numeric value. Strip any leading zeros unless the result is an empty string, which is treated as zero.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Compute the remainder of the numeric value when divided by \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    di, ti = line.split('->')\n    queries.append((di, ti))\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nif not current_s:\n    num = 0\nelse:\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    num = int(stripped) if stripped else 0\n\nmod = 10**9 + 7\nprint(num % mod)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query is then read and stored as a tuple containing the digit to replace and the replacement substring.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed in order. For each character in the current string, if it matches the digit to replace, it is substituted with the replacement substring; otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n3. **Building the Result String**: After processing all queries, the resulting string is built by concatenating the transformed parts.\n4. **Converting to Number**: The resulting string is converted to a numeric value by stripping leading zeros.
