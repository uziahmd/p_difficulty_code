Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into segments covered by each lantern. But since the lanterns can be placed in any order, perhaps it's better to sort them first. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might cover more, but if they're apart, they might leave gaps.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal d is determined by the maximum distance between consecutive points after sorting. But wait, no, because the street is continuous, and the coverage needs to overlap with adjacent lanterns' areas.\n\nLet me think: if I have the lanterns sorted in increasing order, then the coverage must connect the first lantern's right end to the next lantern's left end without any gap. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them should be <= 2d. Because the first covers up to its right (ai +d), and the next starts at (ai+1) -d. So the gap between them is (ai+1 - ai) - 2d. This must be <=0.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair, the required d is at least (ai+1 - ai)/2. Also, we need to consider the edges: the first lantern's left coverage (ai[0] -d) must be >=0, but that's already taken care of by the way we compute it. Similarly, the last lantern's right coverage must be <=l.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, when you have the first lantern, it covers from max(0, ai[0]-d) to min(l, ai[0]+d). But if the first lantern is at position x, then to cover from 0, x -d must be <=0, which implies d >=x. Because if x is larger than 0, then x -d could be negative, but the coverage would start at 0. So the first lantern must cover from 0 to x +d, but wait, no. Wait, the first lantern's coverage is [max(0, x-d), min(l, x+d)]. So for the entire street to be covered, the union must include [0, l].\n\nSo perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- The distance between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n- The first lantern's position (since it has to cover from 0 to at least x +d. Wait, no. The first lantern's right end is x +d, which must be >= x's right. But wait, maybe not. Wait, for the first lantern, the coverage is from max(0, x-d) to min(l, x+d). So to cover the beginning of the street (0), the left side is handled automatically because max(0, x-d) is 0 if x >=d. Or wait, no. For example, if x is 5, d is 3. Then 5-3=2>0, so the coverage starts at 2. So in that case, the coverage doesn't include 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, so to cover 0, the first lantern's left coverage must be <=0. Which means x -d <=0. So d >=x.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's right coverage must be >=l. So x +d >=l. So d >= l -x.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So the minimal d has to satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the distance between them is <= 2d. So d >= (a_i+1 - a_i)/2 for all i.\n\n2. The first lantern must have a_i -d <=0 => d >= a_0.\n\n3. The last lantern must have a_i +d >= l => d >= l - a_n-1.\n\nAdditionally, the overall d has to be the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, let me test this idea with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5\n\nLantern positions: 2 and 5.\n\nSo sorted positions are 2 and 5.\n\nCompute the maximum between:\n\n- (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n- a_0 = 2\n- l -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are covered by lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern lights a segment of the street from \\( (a_i - d) \\) to \\( (a_i + d) \\), and the goal is to find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures the entire street is lit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the lantern positions in ascending order. This helps us efficiently check the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Required Distances**: The minimal radius \\( d \\) must satisfy three conditions:\n   - Ensure the first lantern covers from 0: \\( d \\geq a_0 \\).\n   - Ensure the last lantern covers up to \\( l \\): \\( d \\geq l - a_{n-1} \\).\n   - Ensure each pair of consecutive lanterns covers the gap between them: \\( d \\geq (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 \\) for all \\( i \\).\n3. **Determine Maximum \\( d \\)**: The minimal \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the above conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = float(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check first lantern's coverage\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    \n    # Check last lantern's coverage\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > max_d:\n            max_d = required_d\n    \n    # Check the edges beyond the sorted array\n    if a[0] - max_d < 0:\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    if a[-1] + max_d < l:\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lanterns**: By sorting the lantern positions, we can efficiently check the coverage between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: We ensure the first lantern covers from 0 and the last lantern covers up to \\( l \\) by checking the necessary radius for these edge cases.\n3. **Consecutive Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, we calculate the required radius to cover the gap between them without any overlap.\n4. **Maximizing \\( d \\)**: The minimal \\( d \\) is determined by the maximum of all required values, ensuring complete coverage of the street.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal radius \\( d \\) while considering all necessary constraints to ensure the entire street is lit.",
