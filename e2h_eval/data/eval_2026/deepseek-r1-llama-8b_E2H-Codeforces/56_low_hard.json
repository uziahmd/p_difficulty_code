Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases in such a way that no two paths between them intersect. Hmm, the paths are straight lines from each spaceship to its assigned base.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand. We have R rebel ships and B bases. We need a perfect matching—each ship to exactly one base and vice versa. But the crucial part is that any two paths (from ship to base) shouldn't intersect. So the arrangement must be such that when you draw all these straight lines, they don't cross each other.\n\nThe input gives coordinates for the ships and the bases. The output is Yes or No based on whether such an assignment exists.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? I think of it as a graph matching problem but with an added geometric constraint.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as finding a non-crossing bipartite matching. Because each ship is connected to some base, and the lines shouldn't cross. So perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there's a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where edges represent non-crossing paths.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute if such a matching exists given the positions of the ships and bases?\n\nI remember something about convex hulls and matching. Oh right! If we arrange the ships and bases in certain orders, their connecting lines won't cross. Like, if both ships and bases are ordered along the convex hull, then matching them in order might work.\n\nWait, but not necessarily. What if the points are arranged in a different way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the problem of finding a non-crossing bipartite matching, which can be solved using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods.\n\nBut considering the small constraints (R and B up to 10), maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. We can generate all possible permutations of assigning ships to bases and check for each permutation if the paths are non-crossing.\n\nWait, but R and B could be up to 10, so the total number of permutations is 10! which is around 3.6 million. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. If not, immediately output No because it's a perfect matching.\n2. Generate all possible bijections (permutations) from ships to bases.\n3. For each permutation, check if the corresponding lines (ship to base) are non-crossing.\n4. If any permutation satisfies this condition, output Yes; otherwise, No.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, how to implement step 3: checking if a set of lines is non-crossing.\n\nHow do I check if any two lines cross in a given assignment?\n\nEach line is from a ship (s_i) to a base (b_j). So for all pairs of lines (s_a to b_j and s_k to b_l), we need to ensure that they do not intersect except possibly at their endpoints.\n\nSo for each permutation P, we have a list of lines L = [(s_0, b_P(0)), (s_1, b_P(1)), ..., (s_{R-1}, b_{R-1})}]. Wait, no—since it's a permutation, each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is used once.\n\nWait, no: the permutation is from the ships to the bases. So each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and since it's a permutation, each base is also used exactly once.\n\nSo for each permutation P, where P[i] is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship, we can create the lines.\n\nNow, to check if any two lines cross: for any two pairs (i,j) and (k,l), the lines from ship i to base P[i], and ship k to base P[k], do not cross.\n\nBut wait, what's the condition for two lines to cross?\n\nTwo lines defined by points A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2) and C(x3,y3), D(x4,y4) cross if the points are in a certain order. Alternatively, we can use the cross product to determine if the lines intersect.\n\nAlternatively, the standard way is to compute the orientation of four points to see if the segments cross.\n\nWait, let me think: for two segments AB and CD, they cross if and only if the points are interleaved in a certain way.\n\nSpecifically, the segments AB and CD cross if the following conditions hold:\n- The points are in the order A, C, B, D when projected onto the plane, or another specific cyclic order that causes the segments to cross.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the cross product to determine if two line segments intersect.\n\nWait, here's a method: for two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if and only if the orientations of (A,C,D) and (B,C,D)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, with the condition that no two paths (straight lines from a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Perfect Matching**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately because a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since R and B can be up to 10, generating all permutations of assigning ships to bases is feasible. This results in 10! (approximately 3.6 million) permutations.\n3. **Check for Non-Crossing Paths**: For each permutation, check if the corresponding paths (from ships to bases) are non-crossing. Two paths cross if their connecting line segments intersect except at their endpoints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, e1, s2, e2):\n    def ccw(A,B,C):\n        return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n    \n    a = ccw(s1, e1, s2)\n    b = ccw(s1, e1, e2)\n    c = ccw(s2, e2, s1)\n    d = ccw(s2, e2, e1)\n    \n    if (a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0 and d == 0):\n        return False  # same line segment\n    \n    if (a * b < 0) and (c * d < 0):\n        return True  # the segments intersect properly\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(data[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    B = int(data[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[ptr])\n        y = int(data[ptr+1])\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr +=2\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[ptr])\n        y = int(data[ptr+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr +=2\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(B), R):\n        match = [None]*R\n        for i in range(R):\n            match[i] = perm[i]\n        \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            s_i = ships[i]\n            b_j = bases[match[i]]\n            \n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                s_j = ships[j]\n                b_k = bases[match[j]]\n                \n                if segments_intersect(s_i, b_j, s_j, b_k):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n    \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for spaceships and bases.\n- **Perfect Matching Check**: If the number of spaceships does not match the number of bases, output \"No\".\n- **Permutations Generation**: All permutations of assigning ships to bases are generated.\n- **Non-Crossing Check**: For each permutation, check if any two paths intersect using the `segments_intersect` function which uses the CCW (Counter Clockwise) method to determine if two line segments intersect.\n- **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-crossing paths, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments using permutations and ensures no paths cross, providing the correct solution within feasible computational limits.",
