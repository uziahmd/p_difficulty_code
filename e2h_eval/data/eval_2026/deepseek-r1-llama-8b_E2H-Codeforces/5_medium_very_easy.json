Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or one is a question mark. Oh right, because the question mark is compatible with any color.\n\nSo, the input gives me two strings, l and r, each of length n. Each character in these strings represents a color for a left or right boot respectively. My goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot such that the pair is compatible, and each boot can be used only once. And I need to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, maybe I should think about counting how many possible pairs there are for each specific color combination and then figure out the optimal way to match them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to each right node if they are compatible. Then the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching in this graph. But wait, n can be up to 150,000, which makes building such a graph impossible because it would have O(n^2) edges. That's way too big.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can group the left and right boots by their colors (and question marks), then compute how many pairs can be formed between each group.\n\nBut how do the groups interact? For example, a left boot with color 'a' can pair with any right boot that is either 'a' or '?'. Similarly, a right boot with color 'b' can pair with any left boot that is 'b' or '?'.\n\nWait, but maybe I can precompute for each left boot, how many right boots are compatible, and then assign in a way that maximizes the total pairs.\n\nAlternatively, since each pair must consist of one left and one right, perhaps the optimal approach is to count all possible compatible pairs, and then greedily assign as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nBut that might not be efficient enough for large n.\n\nAnother thought: Since each left and right boot can be considered as separate sets, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we have two multisets, L and R. We need to match elements from L to R such that each pair is compatible, and each element is used at most once.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach after some sorting and frequency counting.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, for each left boot, determine its color and whether it's a question mark. Similarly for each right boot.\n\nWe can create two dictionaries: one for left and one for right, where the keys are the colors (or a special symbol for '?'), and the values are the counts.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more efficient to process each left and right boot and count how many have each color, including the question mark.\n\nFor example, left_counts[c] is the number of left boots with color c. Similarly, right_counts[c] is the number of right boots with color c.\n\nThen, for each color in the union of left and right colors, plus the '?', calculate the possible pairs.\n\nBut the question is, how do we handle the question marks? Because a left '?' can pair with any right boot, including those that are also '?', and vice versa.\n\nHmm, maybe the optimal approach is to first pair as many non-? pairs as possible, and then use the remaining ? boots to pair with any remaining.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose I have:\n\nLeft: a, a, b, ?\nRight: a, c, ?\n\nWhat's the maximum pairs? Let's see.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\na (left) with a (right): yes, that's one pair.\na (left) with c: no, incompatible.\na (left) with ?: yes, another pair.\nSo that's two pairs from the a's and the ?.\n\nThen, b (left) can't pair with any right except maybe the last ?, but the last ? can be used for that.\n\nSo, b (left) with ?: yes, third pair.\n\nAnd then the ? (left) can pair with the remaining right (c?), but c is not compatible with ?. Wait, no— the right is 'c' which is not compatible with the left '?'. Because the left is ?, which is compatible with any right, but the right is 'c', which is compatible only with 'c' or '?'. So the right 'c' can only pair with left 'c' or left '?'.\n\nSo in this case, the left's ? can pair with the right's c? No, because the right's color is 'c', which is not compatible with the left's '?'. Wait no: the left's ? is compatible with any right. So if a right is 'c', the left's ? can pair with it. Because the condition is that the left's color is compatible with the right's color.\n\nWait, wait! The compatibility is that the left's color is compatible with the right's color. So for a pair (l_i, r_j):\n\nIf l_i is 'a' and r_j is 'a' → compatible.\nIf l_i is 'a' and r_j is '?' → compatible.\nIf l_i is '?' and r_j is 'a' → compatible.\nIf l_i is '?' and r_j is '?' → compatible.\n\nSo in the previous example, the right 'c' can be paired with the left '?'.\n\nSo in the example:\n\nLeft: a, a, b, ?\nRight: a, c, ?\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1. a (left 0) with a (right 0)\n2. a (left 1) with a (right 0) → but wait, can't reuse the same right boot. So right 0 is already used, so left 1 can't pair with right 0 again.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to pair each left and right in a way that maximizes the number of pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: for each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left c and right c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nAdditionally, the number of pairs between left ? and right c is left_q * right_c, but wait, no— because each left ? can pair with any right, but each right can be used only once.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider all possible pairs, including those involving ?.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to model this as a bipartite graph where each left node can connect to right nodes that are compatible, and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut given n is up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp won't work due to time constraints.\n\nSo we need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a flow problem, but that's probably not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nAlternative idea: For each color c, the number of pairs between left c and right c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Let's sum all these.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't find a pair in their own color), we can use the question marks to pair them.\n\nWait, but perhaps some left or right boots are question marks and haven't been paired yet.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Compute for each color c (including '?') the number of left boots and right boots.\n\n   - For example, left_counts[c] = number of left boots with color c.\n   - Similarly for right_counts.\n\n2. For each color c, the number of pairs that can be directly formed without using question marks is the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c]. Sum all these, call this S.\n\n3. Then, subtract S from left_counts and right_counts. Now, left_counts and right_counts represent the remaining boots that couldn't find a direct pair.\n\n4. Now, the remaining left and right boots can be paired via the question mark.\n\n   - The number of remaining left question marks is left_counts['?'].\n\n   - The number of remaining right question marks is right_counts['?'].\n\n   - Additionally, for other colors, the remaining left and right can be paired if one is a question mark.\n\n   Wait, no. Because after step 2, any left or right that was a question mark may still exist, but perhaps they could form pairs with others.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: after step 2, for the remaining boots, any left boot (regardless of color) can pair with any right boot (regardless of color) if either is a question mark.\n\nWait, no. Because the pairing is compatible if both are question marks, or one is a question mark and the other is a specific color.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that the left and right are compatible. So for any left and right, they are compatible if:\n\n(l_color == r_color) OR (l_color is '?' OR r_color is '?').\n\nSo, after step 2, when we have some left and right that couldn't find a direct color match, perhaps we can pair them via question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the way to proceed is:\n\n- For the remaining left and right, count how many are question marks, and how many are specific colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to calculate the maximum possible pairs that can be formed between the remaining left and right.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the total possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each color c, min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nPlus the sum of the minimum between the number of remaining left question marks and remaining right question marks.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because after pairing the same color, the remaining left and right may have some ? that can pair with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total is the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, plus the minimum between the number of left ? and right ?.\n\nBut that's not correct because some left ? may have already been used in pairing with specific right colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the initial sum S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c (including c='?'? Or is c='?' treated differently?).\n\nWait, no. Because for c='?', the min would be min(left_?, right_?), but when considering other colors, a left ? can pair with any right color, and vice versa.\n\nSo perhaps the steps should be:\n\n1. For each color c (including '?'), compute the number of left and right boots with color c.\n\n2. For each color c, add to S the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c]. This represents the direct pairs between same colors.\n\n3. Subtract these pairs from the left and right counts. So, for each c, left_counts[c] -= min(...), right_counts[c] -= min(...).\n\n4. Now, the remaining left and right can form pairs if at least one of them is a question mark.\n\nBut wait, because after step 3, the left and right counts for each c are zero or negative. So any remaining left or right must be ?.\n\nBecause, for example, if left_counts[a] was 3 and right_counts[a] was 5, then after step 3, left_counts[a] becomes 0, right_counts[a] becomes 0. So no more a's left.\n\nSo after step 3, the only remaining left and right are ?.\n\nThus, the remaining left_? and right_? can be paired in min(left_?, right_?) pairs.\n\nSo the total is S + min(left_?_remaining, right_?_remaining).\n\nWait, but is that the case?\n\nYes, because after step 3, any remaining left and right can only be ? because their same-color pairs have been exhausted.\n\nWait, let's test this logic.\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"?a\"\n\nSo left_counts: a=1, ?=1.\n\nright_counts: a=1, ?=1.\n\nStep 2: for each color c, add min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nFor c='a': min(1,1)=1 → S +=1.\n\nFor c='?': min(1,1)=1 → S +=1.\n\nTotal S=2.\n\nNow, subtract these:\n\nleft_counts['a']=0, right_counts['a']=0.\n\nleft_counts['?']=0, right_counts['?']=0.\n\nSo nothing remains. So the answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as both pairs (a with a, ? with ?) can be formed.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\nl = \"abc\"\n\nr = \"cba\"\n\nEach left and right have 3 different colors.\n\nSo for each c in a,b,c: min(1,1) =1. So S=3.\n\nSubtracting, all left and right counts become zero.\n\nNo ? left, so total pairs 3.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\nl = \"???\"\n\nr = \"???\"\n\nSo step 2: for c='?', min(3,3)=3 → S=3.\n\nSubtract, left and right counts for ? are zero.\n\nNo other colors, so total is 3.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=4\n\nl = \"a???\"\n\nr = \"a?ab\"\n\nSo left_counts: a=1, ?=3.\n\nright_counts: a=1, ?=2, b=1.\n\nStep 2: for c=a, min(1,1)=1 → S=1.\n\nFor c='?': min(3,2)=2 → S=3.\n\nSubtract: left_counts['a']=0, right_counts['a']=0.\n\nleft_counts['?']=1, right_counts['?']=0.\n\nNow, check if any remaining can be paired via ?.\n\nWe have left_? =1, right_?=0. So nothing can be done.\n\nSo total pairs 3.\n\nBut wait, what about the remaining left_? and the right 'b'?\n\nBecause after step 2, the right_counts for 'b' is 1.\n\nIn our approach, after step 3, the remaining left is 1 (the ?) and the right is 1 (b). So can they pair?\n\nYes, because the left is ?, which is compatible with the right's 'b'.\n\nSo in this case, our approach would miss this.\n\nWait, so our initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that after step 3, the remaining left and right can include non-? colors, but they can still be paired if one is a ?.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct way to model this?\n\nIdea: After step 3, the remaining left and right can be of any color, but they can only form a pair if at least one of them is a ?.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- After step 3, for each left boot that is not a ?, check if there exists a right boot that is a ? and hasn't been paired yet.\n\n- Also, for each right boot that is not a ?, check if there exists a left boot that is a ? and hasn't been paired yet.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: After step 3, collect all the remaining left and right boots, regardless of color, and then find the maximum number of pairs where at least one is a ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of such pairs is the minimum between the total remaining left and right, but only if among them, at least one is a ?.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because even if all remaining left and right are non-?, but none are ?, they can't form any pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because two non-? can only form a pair if their colors are the same.\n\nBut after step 3, for color c, left_counts[c] and right_counts[c] are either zero or negative, so no.\n\nSo after step 3, any remaining left and right can only be ?.\n\nWait, no. Because in the earlier example, after step 3, the right has a 'b' and the left has a '?'.\n\nSo, in that case, the left can pair with the right, because left is '?'.\n\nBut according to step 3, the left_? is 1 and right_? is 0.\n\nWait, but the right has a 'b' which is non-?. So, after step 3, the right_counts for 'b' is 1, and the left_counts for 'b' is 0.\n\nSo in step 3, the left_? is 1, and the right_? is 0.\n\nSo in the remaining, left has 1 '?', right has 1 'b'.\n\nSo the left can pair with the right, because the left is '?', making the pair compatible.\n\nThus, the initial approach misses this.\n\nSo, my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so what's the correct way to account for this?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\nThen, compute T as the number of pairs where one is a '?', and the other is any color.\n\nWait, but T can't be computed just once. Because the left and right ? can pair with each other, but also with non-?.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter computing S, for the remaining left and right, count the number of left ? and right ?.\n\nThe number of pairs between left ? and right ? is min(left_?, right_?).\n\nThen, the remaining left ? can pair with the remaining right non-? and vice versa.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining left and right, but only if there's at least one ? in either left or right.\n\nBut that's not accurate.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter step 3, the remaining left and right can form pairs if at least one of them is a '?'.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs where left is '?', right is any (but right is not yet paired) plus the number of pairs where right is '?', left is any (but left is not yet paired).\n\nWait, but this would double-count the pairs where both are '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nadditional_pairs = (left_remaining + right_remaining) - max(left_remaining, right_remaining)\n\nBut only if the smaller of the two is non-zero.\n\nWait, no. Because if left_remaining is 3 and right_remaining is 2, then 2 pairs can be formed, using both right_remaining and 2 left_remaining.\n\nBut how does that relate to the presence of ?.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nLet A be the number of remaining left boots (after step 3).\n\nLet B be the number of remaining right boots (after step 3).\n\nLet C be the number of remaining left ? (after step 3).\n\nLet D be the number of remaining right ? (after step 3).\n\nThen, the maximum possible additional pairs is:\n\nadditional = min(C, D) + min(C, (A - C)) + min(D, (B - D)).\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the minimum of A and B, but only if at least one of C or D is positive.\n\nOtherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because if A and B are both positive, but neither has a ?.\n\nWait, no. Because after step 3, for non-? colors, their counts are zero or negative. So in that case, if A and B are positive, it means that there are some ? left.\n\nBecause if all remaining were non-? colors, their counts would be zero.\n\nSo, after step 3, the remaining A and B must include some ?.\n\nThus, the maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum of A and B.\n\nSo, the total is S + min(A, B).\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example:\n\nAfter step 3, S is 1 (from a pairs) and 2 (from ? pairs), but wait, no.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the earlier example.\n\nExample:\n\nn=4\n\nl = \"a???\" → left_counts: a=1, ?=3.\n\nr = \"a?ab\" → right_counts: a=1, ?=2, b=1.\n\nStep 2:\n\nFor c='a': min(1,1)=1 → S +=1.\n\nFor c='?': min(3, 2)=2 → S +=2.\n\nSo S=3.\n\nSubtract: left_counts['a']=0, right_counts['a']=0.\n\nleft_counts['?'] =3-2=1.\n\nright_counts['?']=2-2=0.\n\nSo now, left has 1 ?, and right has 1 'b'.\n\nSo A =1 (left), B=1 (right).\n\nSo min(A,B) =1.\n\nSo total pairs is 3+1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\nSubtract those from left and right counts.\n\nCompute the remaining left (A) and right (B) counts.\n\nThen, the additional pairs is min(A, B).\n\nSo total_pairs = S + min(A, B).\n\nBut wait, what about when A and B are larger than zero, but no ? are left.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nNo, because after step 3, for any c != '?', left_counts[c] and right_counts[c] would be zero or negative. So any remaining left or right must be '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 3, for each c != '?', we subtracted min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]), leaving zero or negative.\n\nThus, the remaining left and right can only be '?'\n\nWait, that's not true. Because, for example, if left_counts[c] is 5 and right_counts[c] is 3, after step 3, left_counts[c] is 2, right_counts[c] is 0.\n\nSo the remaining left has 2 c's, but the right has none.\n\nBut in this case, the c's on left can't form pairs with any right, because the right's c's are gone.\n\nSo, the remaining left has 2 c's, which can't form any pairs.\n\nBut according to the approach, A is the sum of all remaining left (including c's and ?).\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nSo in that case, if after step 3, the remaining A and B are positive, but no ? are present, the additional_pairs would be zero.\n\nBecause min(A,B) is positive, but without any ?.\n\nWait, no, because if there are no ? left, then the remaining A and B can't form any pairs.\n\nBecause a pair requires that at least one is a ?.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\nThen, compute the remaining left and right counts, which includes both ? and other colors.\n\nNow, the additional pairs can only be formed if there is at least one ? in either left or right.\n\nWait, no. Because a pair can be formed if one is a ? and the other is any color.\n\nSo, the additional pairs is the number of pairs (x, y) where x is left, y is right, and (x is ? or y is ? or x equals y).\n\nBut wait, after step 3, x and y can't have same color unless they are both ?.\n\nBecause for any c != '?', left_counts[c] is zero or negative.\n\nSo, after step 3, the only way for x and y to have same color is if both are ?.\n\nSo, the additional pairs are:\n\nnumber of pairs where both are ? → which is min(left_?, right_?).\n\nplus the number of pairs where one is ? and the other is any color.\n\nSo, the total additional_pairs is:\n\nmin(left_?, right_?) + (left_? * (total_right - right_?)) + (right_? * (total_left - left_?)).\n\nBut wait, no, because that would count pairs where both are ? twice.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the additional_pairs as follows:\n\nLet C be the number of remaining left ?.\n\nD be the number of remaining right ?.\n\nE be the number of remaining left non-?.\n\nF be the number of remaining right non-?.\n\nThen, the possible pairs are:\n\n- (C, D): pairs where both are ?, which is min(C, D).\n\n- (C, F): pairs where left is ?, right is non-?.\n\n- (E, D): pairs where right is ?, left is non-?.\n\nBut E and F can't form any pairs among themselves because their colors are non-? and thus can't pair unless they are same color, but after step 3, for any color c != '?', left_counts[c] and right_counts[c] are zero or negative.\n\nThus, E and F can't form any pairs among themselves.\n\nSo, the total additional_pairs is min(C, D) + C * F + D * E.\n\nWait, but wait: C * F is the number of pairs where left is ? and right is non-?.\n\nBut each such pair uses one left ? and one right non-?.\n\nSimilarly, D * E is the number of pairs where right is ? and left is non-?.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because in that case, the left is non-? and the right is ?, which is allowed.\n\nSo the total additional_pairs is:\n\nmin(C, D) + min(C, F) + min(D, E).\n\nBut perhaps a better way to compute this is:\n\nThe maximum possible pairs is the number of left ? plus the number of right ? plus the number of left non-? and right ?.\n\nBut no, that's not correct because each pair can only involve one ?.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum of (C + F, D + E).\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum of (C + F, D + E), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think in terms of the total possible pairs after step 3.\n\nTotal possible pairs is the number of pairs where at least one is a ?.\n\nSo, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of left ? multiplied by the number of right (non-? + ?) plus the number of right ? multiplied by the number of left (non-? + ?), minus the number of pairs where both are ? (because they are counted twice).\n\nSo:\n\nadditional_pairs = C*(D + F) + D*(E + F) - C*D.\n\nWait, no. Because:\n\nC*(D + F) counts all left ? pairs with right ? or F.\n\nD*(E + F) counts all right ? pairs with left E or F.\n\nBut when you add these, the pairs where both are ? are counted once in C*D and once in D*C, leading to double-counting.\n\nThus, the correct formula is:\n\nadditional_pairs = (C * (D + F)) + (D * E) \n\nBecause:\n\n- C*(D + F) is the number of pairs where left is ? and right is anything except non-? (but wait, F is non-? in right).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think:\n\nThe total number of possible pairs is:\n\nsum over all left i, sum over all right j where (i,j) is compatible.\n\nBut after step 3, the left i and right j can only be compatible if at least one is a ?.\n\nThus, the number of compatible pairs is the number of left ? multiplied by (number of right ? + number of right non-?), plus the number of right ? multiplied by (number of left non-?), minus the number of pairs where both are ? (since they are counted in both terms).\n\nSo:\n\nadditional_pairs = C*(D + F) + D*E - C*D.\n\nBut wait, C*(D + F) is the number of pairs where left is ?, right is any.\n\nD*E is the number of pairs where right is ?, left is non-?.\n\nBut in C*(D + F), the D is included, so when you add D*E, you are adding pairs where both are ? again.\n\nSo the correct formula is:\n\nadditional_pairs = (C*(F + D)) + (D*(E)) - (C*D).\n\nBut perhaps an easier way to compute this is:\n\nadditional_pairs = min(C, F + D) + min(D, E + F) - min(C, D).\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as:\n\nThe maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum between the total number of remaining left and right, provided that there's at least one ? in either.\n\nBut that's not correct, as in cases where some are non-?.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum possible additional pairs as the minimum between the total remaining left and right, but only if there's at least one ?.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative idea: After step 3, the remaining left and right can form pairs if at least one is a ?.\n\nSo the maximum number of such pairs is the minimum of (A, B), but only if there's at least one ? in the remaining left or right.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose A=3, B=3, and all are non-?.\n\nThen, the pairs can't be formed because no ? are left.\n\nSo, the additional pairs would be zero.\n\nBut if there's at least one ? in A or B, then the additional pairs can be min(A, B).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps after step 3, the remaining left and right can form pairs if and only if there's at least one ?.\n\nBecause, otherwise, all remaining are non-? colors, but since for any c != '?', left_counts[c] and right_counts[c] are zero or negative, so they can't form pairs.\n\nSo, if after step 3, there are any remaining left or right, then they must include some ?.\n\nThus, the additional_pairs is min(A, B).\n\nSo the total is S + min(A, B).\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example where after step 3, A=1, B=1, and one is ? and the other is non-?.\n\nSo, the min(A, B) is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: after step 3, A=2, B=3, and one of A is ?, and B has 3.\n\nThen, the additional_pairs is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because the ? can pair with 2 of the 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\nThen, compute the remaining left and right counts, including the ?.\n\nCompute A as the sum of all remaining left, B as the sum of all remaining right.\n\nIf there are any remaining left or right, then compute additional_pairs as min(A, B).\n\nBut wait, how do we know if there's any ? left?\n\nBecause after step 3, the remaining left and right can only be ?.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because for example, if left_counts[c] was 5 and right_counts[c] was 3, after step 3, left_counts[c] is 2, right_counts[c] is 0.\n\nSo, the remaining left has 2 c's, which are non-?.\n\nSo, in that case, A=2, B= whatever is left.\n\nBut in this case, the additional_pairs would be min(2, B), but B could be something else.\n\nBut in this case, the c's can't pair with each other because their right_counts are zero.\n\nThus, the additional_pairs would be zero.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct way must be:\n\nCompute S as before.\n\nThen, compute the number of left ? and right ?.\n\nCompute the number of additional_pairs as the minimum between:\n\nleft_? * (right_total - right_?) + right_? * (left_total - left_?) + min(left_?, right_?).\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(left_? + right_?) and (left_non_questionmark + right_non_questionmark).\n\nWait, no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to look for similar problems or standard approaches.\n\nUpon thinking, this problem resembles the bipartite matching problem but with certain constraints. However, with n up to 1.5e5, standard algorithms are not feasible.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching, but given the size, it's impractical.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for multiple matches if the constraints are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the maximum matching in the bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right if their colors are compatible.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, building the adjacency list is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, and then compute the number of additional pairs as the minimum between the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c, including '?'.\n\nThen, subtract these from left_counts and right_counts.\n\nThen, the remaining left and right can be processed as follows:\n\nWe can take the minimum of the total remaining left and right, as each can be paired with any of the other.\n\nBut only if there is at least one ? in either left or right.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the number of pairs as S + the minimum of (left_? + right_?), because any remaining ? can pair with each other and with non-?.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute:\n\nThe number of additional pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(left_? + right_?) and (left_total + right_total - left_? - right_?)).\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as:\n\nAfter computing S, the remaining left and right can form pairs as follows:\n\nEach pair must consist of one left and one right, and at least one of them is a ?.\n\nThe maximum possible is the minimum between the number of remaining left and right, provided that the total number of ? in left and right is at least one.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum additional_pairs is the minimum between the total remaining left and right, and the sum of ? in left and right.\n\nWait, but that's not correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for a solution approach.\n\nUpon thinking, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n1. Count the number of pairs for each color.\n\n2. For the remaining, treat the ? as a wildcard.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\n- For each color c, compute the number of pairs as min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nSum this as S.\n\n- Subtract these pairs from left_counts and right_counts.\n\n- Now, for the remaining, any left ? can pair with any right, and vice versa.\n\nBut the way to compute the maximum is to pair as many as possible, but ensuring that each left and right is used at most once.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can be formed as follows:\n\n- The number of left ? is C.\n\n- The number of right ? is D.\n\n- The number of left non-? is E.\n\n- The number of right non-? is F.\n\nThe maximum additional_pairs is min(C, D) + min(C, F) + min(D, E).\n\nWait, but this may overcount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is min(C + F, D + E) + min(C, D).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum additional_pairs is the minimum between (C + F, D + E) + min(C, D).\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum additional_pairs is the minimum between (C + F, D + E) + min(C, D) - min(C, D), which simplifies to the minimum of (C + F, D + E).\n\nBut that's the same as the first term.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum additional_pairs is the minimum between (C + F, D + E) + min(C, D).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nThe number of additional pairs is the minimum between (C + F) and (D + E), plus the minimum between C and D.\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to:\n\nCompute the number of possible pairs as the minimum of (C + F, D + E) + min(C, D).\n\nWait, but that's unclear.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to look for a solution approach elsewhere.\n\nLooking online, perhaps this problem can be modeled using a greedy algorithm.\n\nWait, the problem seems similar to the maximum bipartite matching, but with a special condition for ?.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible within each color.\n\n2. Pair the remaining ? with any remaining.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the additional_pairs are min(A, B), where A and B are the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the earlier example where after step 3, A=1, B=1, and one is a ? and the other is non-?.\n\nThe additional_pairs would be 1, which is correct.\n\nIn the case where A=2, B=3, and all are non-?.\n\nThen, the additional_pairs would be min(2,3) =2.\n\nBut in reality, no pairs can be formed because all are non-? and can't pair.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct way is to compute:\n\nS = sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nThen, compute the number",
