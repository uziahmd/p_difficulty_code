The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So the problem is about matching keys and chests such that a_i + b_j is odd. Which means one is even and the other is odd. Because an even plus an odd is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out how many chests are even and how many are odd, similarly for the keys. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest once.\n\nWait, right. So for each key, if it's even, it can only open chests with odd a_i. And if the key is odd, then it can open chests with even a_i.\n\nSo maybe the optimal way is to count:\n\n- The number of even chests: let's call it E_c.\n- The number of odd chests: O_c = total chests - E_c.\n- Similarly, count even and odd keys: E_k and O_k.\n\nThen, the maximum possible chests we can open is determined by how we match these.\n\nBecause each even key can pair with an odd chest, but each such pairing uses up one key and one chest. Similarly, each odd key pairs with even chests.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between:\n\n1. The number of even keys and the number of odd chests. Because each even key can open an odd chest, but you can't use more even keys than available, nor more odd chests than available.\n\nPlus,\n\n2. The number of odd keys and the number of even chests. Same logic.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because the total number of chests opened is the sum of the two possibilities. But since each key can only be used once, and each chest can be used once, it's a matter of pairing.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of chests is the minimum of (E_k + O_k) and n, because the total number of usable key-chest pairs is E_k * O_c + O_k * E_c, but wait no, that's not the way to think about it.\n\nWait no. Let me see. Each even key can be used on an odd chest, but each odd key can be used on an even chest. So the total number of chests that can be opened is the minimum between:\n\nmin(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c)\n\nWait, no. Because after using some even keys on odd chests, the remaining even keys can't use more chests beyond the available odd ones. Similarly for the other case.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is to consider that for each key, whether it's even or odd, it can be matched to a specific type of chest. So the maximum possible is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nBut wait, that might not work because if there are more even keys than odd chests, then all those odd chests are used, and the excess even keys can't be used elsewhere. Similarly for the odd keys.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once. So for example:\n\nSuppose E_k is 5, O_k is 3.\n\nO_c is 4, E_c is 2.\n\nSo the even keys can be used on O_c=4, but we have 5 even keys. So we can use 4 even keys on 4 odd chests, leaving 1 even key unused.\n\nThe odd keys can be used on E_c=2, which is less than O_k=3, so all 2 even chests are used, leaving 1 odd key.\n\nSo total chests opened is 4 + 2 =6, but wait, what's the maximum possible? Because the total chests is 4+2=6, but n could be larger than that.\n\nWait, in this case, n is 4+2=6, so yes, all are opened.\n\nWait, but the initial problem is that each key can unlock at most one chest. So the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests. But wait, that can't exceed n because that's the total number of chests.\n\nNo, wait. Let me think again.\n\nEach even key can be used to unlock an odd chest. So the maximum number of even keys used is the minimum between E_k and O_c. Similarly, the maximum number of odd keys used is the minimum between O_k and E_c. So the total is min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c).\n\nBut wait, suppose that E_k is 10 and O_c is 3. Then, you can only use 3 even keys, opening 3 chests. The rest even keys can't be used, since all odd chests are used.\n\nSimilarly, if O_k is 5 and E_c is 2, then you can use 2 odd keys, opening 2 chests.\n\nSo the total is 3+2=5, but what if n is 5? Then, it's correct.\n\nBut if n is larger, like 10, then you can't open more than 5 chests, because that's the maximum possible.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests is the minimum of (E_k + O_k, n). Wait, but E_k + O_k is m, the total number of keys. But since each key can only open one chest, the maximum chests you can open is the minimum between m and n. But that's not considering the parity.\n\nWait, no. Because it's possible that m is larger than n, but not all keys can be used. For example, if all keys are even, and all chests are even, then no chests can be opened. So the actual maximum is not just min(m, n), but depends on the parity.\n\nSo back to the initial idea: the maximum number of chests is the sum of min(E_k, O_c) and min(O_k, E_c).\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] \n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\nCompute E_c and O_c:\n\na is 9 (odd),14 (even),6 (even), 2 (even),11(odd).\n\nSo E_c is 3 (14,6,2), O_c is 2 (9,11).\n\nIn the keys, b is 8 (even),4(even),7(odd),20(even).\n\nSo E_k is 3 (8,4,20), O_k is 1.\n\nNow, min(E_k, O_c) is min(3,2) =2.\n\nmin(O_k, E_c) is min(1,3)=1.\n\nSum is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even.\n\nb = [5] → odd.\n\nSo E_c=5, O_c=0.\n\nE_k=0 (since b=5 is odd), O_k=1.\n\nSo min(E_k, O_c) is 0, min(O_k, E_c) is min(1,5)=1.\n\nTotal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na has 10 → even.\n\nb has 20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo E_c=1, O_c=0.\n\nE_k=4, O_k=0.\n\nmin(E_k, O_c)=0, min(O_k, E_c)=0. Total 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a's (E_c and O_c).\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd b's (E_k and O_k).\n\n3. Compute the sum of min(E_k, O_c) and min(O_k, E_c).\n\n4. That sum is the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nBut wait, why isn't it possible to get a higher number?\n\nBecause each key can be used only once. So for example, if E_k is 100 and O_c is 5, then you can only open 5 chests via even keys. The rest can't be used.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read a array.\n\n- Read b array.\n\n- Compute E_c: number of even numbers in a.\n\n- O_c = n - E_c.\n\n- Compute E_k: number of even numbers in b.\n\n- O_k = m - E_k.\n\n- max_chests = min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c).\n\n- Output max_chests.\n\nWait, but wait: What if the sum is larger than n? Like, for example, when n is 3, E_c=2, O_c=1. E_k=3, O_k=0.\n\nThen min(E_k, O_c) is 1 (because O_c=1), min(O_k, E_c)=0. So total 1. Which is correct because you can only open 1 chest with 3 even keys (using one to open the single odd chest, the others can't be used).\n\nAnother example: n=3, a has 2 even and 1 odd.\n\nm=5, b has 4 even and 1 odd.\n\nSo E_k=4, O_k=1.\n\nmin(E_k, O_c) is min(4,1)=1.\n\nmin(O_k, E_c) is min(1,2)=1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nWhich is correct because you can use 1 even key on the odd chest, and 1 odd key on one even chest. Total 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the plan is to compute E_c, O_c, E_k, O_k, then compute the sum of min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the a array as list of integers.\n\nRead the b array as list of integers.\n\nCompute E_c: for each number in a, check if it's even. Count.\n\nE_c = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nO_c = n - E_c.\n\nSimilarly for E_k: sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 ==0).\n\nO_k = m - E_k.\n\nCompute sum = min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c).\n\nBut wait, the sum could be larger than n. Because for example, if E_k is 3, O_c is 2, O_k is 3, E_c is 2. So sum is 2+2=4, but n is 4. So that's fine.\n\nWait, no, because E_c + O_c =n. So if the sum is min(E_k, O_c)+min(O_k, E_c), it cannot be larger than n.\n\nBecause min(E_k, O_c) ≤ O_c, min(O_k, E_c) ≤ E_c. So sum is ≤ O_c + E_c =n.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nec = 0\n\noc = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        ec +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        oc +=1\n\nek = 0\n\nok = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        ek +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        ok +=1\n\nmax_chests = min(ek, oc) + min(ok, ec)\n\nprint(max_chests)\n\nWait, but looking back at the sample inputs, the outputs are strings, like '3', '1', '0'. So the code should print them as strings, not integers.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample, the output is shown as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the user is supposed to write a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. The output format says to print the desired outputs. Looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the output is ['3','1','0'], but probably, the code is supposed to output each value on its own line.\n\nWait, no, the sample shows that the output is a list of three lines, each being the result for a different test case. Or perhaps, the input is given as three test cases, and the output is three lines.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement, the input is given as three parts, but that's probably a formatting issue in the problem description. Probably, the input is a single test case, but in the sample, it's written as three separate test cases.\n\nWait, in the problem statement's sample input, it's written as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nBut perhaps that's a formatting error. So the actual input is a single test case, with the first line being n and m, then a line with n numbers, then a line with m numbers.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample output, it's printed as three lines: 3, 1, 0. So perhaps the problem has three test cases, each with their own input. But in the problem statement, it's unclear.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\" So it's a single test case.\n\nSo in the sample input, the output is three lines, but perhaps that's a mistake, because the problem expects the output to be a single number, which in the first sample is 3, the second is 1, and the third is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is showing three separate examples, but the problem is a single test case. Or perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nOutput\n\n['3', '1', '0']\n\nBut that seems like three different test cases. So perhaps the problem is multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process each one.\n\nHmm, but the problem statement doesn't say that. It says, \"On a random day, Neko found n treasure chests and m keys.\"\n\nSo it's a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three separate cases. Maybe the sample is wrong, but the actual problem is a single test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a typo, and it's supposed to be three separate test cases in the sample input.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, I'll assume that it's a single test case.\n\nThus, the code should read n and m, then the a array, then the b array.\n\nThen compute ec, oc, ek, ok as described.\n\nCompute the sum of min(ek, oc) + min(ok, ec), and output that number as a string.\n\nWait, in the sample, the first case outputs 3, the second 1, the third 0. So the code's output is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCompute ec, oc.\n\nCompute ek, ok.\n\nsum = min(ek, oc) + min(ok, ec)\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but in the code, I was thinking to print it as a string. Because in the sample, it's printed as '3' etc. But in Python, when you print an integer, it's automatically converted to a string.\n\nSo the code can just print the integer, and it will be output correctly.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have an odd sum. This means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, count how many of the chests and keys have even numbers. The remaining will be odd.\n2. **Match Keys and Chests**: Use each even key to unlock an odd chest and each odd key to unlock an even chest. Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by summing the minimum counts of these matches.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: The result is the sum of the minimum number of even keys that can unlock odd chests and the minimum number of odd keys that can unlock even chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chests = 0\nodd_chests = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chests += 1\n    else:\n        odd_chests += 1\n\neven_keys = 0\nodd_keys = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_keys += 1\n    else:\n        odd_keys += 1\n\nmax_chests = min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Evens and Odds**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Matching Keys and Chests**: We determine how many even keys can unlock odd chests and how many odd keys can unlock even chests, then sum these two values to get the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we print the result as an integer.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
