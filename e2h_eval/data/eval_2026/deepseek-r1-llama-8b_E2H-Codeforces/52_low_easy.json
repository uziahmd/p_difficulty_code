Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vasily wants to maximize the number of hours his candles can burn. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b burned candles, you can make one new candle. So it's a matter of reusing the stubs as much as possible.\n\nLet's take the example given: input 4 2. So initially, there are 4 candles. Each burns for 1 hour, so that's 4 hours. Then, from those 4 stubs, he can make 2 new candles (since 4 / 2 = 2). Those two burn for another 2 hours. Now, after burning, he has 2 stubs again. He can make another candle (2/2=1), which gives 1 more hour. The stubs from that is 1, but since 1 is less than b=2, he can't make more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hours.\n\nSo the process is: start with 'a' candles. Each time, we collect the stubs, convert them into new candles, and repeat until we can't make any more.\n\nHow do I model this in code?\n\nHmm, I think a loop would work. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the total hours to 'a'.\n2. While the number of stubs is enough to make at least one new candle:\n   a. Calculate how many new candles can be made: current_stubs // b.\n   b. Add that number to the total hours.\n   c. Update the stubs: new_candles = current_stubs // b. The remaining stubs after making new candles are current_stubs % b + new_candles (because each new candle gives a stub after burning).\n3. Return the total hours.\n\nWait, let me see. For each iteration, the steps are:\n\n- You have some stubs.\n- Make as many new candles as possible.\n- Each new candle adds 1 hour.\n- The stubs after making new candles are the leftovers plus the new candles' stubs.\n\nSo let's formalize it:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, current_stubs=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2 → new_candles=2, total becomes 6. current_stubs is (4%2=0) +2=2.\n\nNext loop: 2>=2 → new=1, total 7. current_stubs =0+1=1. Now 1<2, loop stops. So correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6, current_stubs=6.\n\n6//3=2, total 8. current_stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2 <3, loop stops. So output is 8. Which matches the example.\n\nWhat about edge cases? Let's say a=1, b=2. Then he can't make any new candles. So total is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. He uses 5, gets 5 stubs. Makes 1 new, which adds 1 hour. Now stubs are 5-5=0 +1=1. Can't make more. So total is 5+1=6.\n\nAnother example: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial: 10.\n\nMake 3, add 3 → total 13. Stubs: (10%3=1) +3=4.\n\nNow 4 >=3 → make 1, add 1 → total 14. Stubs:1 +1=2. Can't make more. So total is 14.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these correctly.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Compute as per the algorithm.\n\nIn Python, I can read the input line as a list of integers.\n\nSo code outline:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's it. Seems straightforward.\n\nI think this should handle all cases, including when a is 0 (but according to the constraints, a is at least 1). Also, when b is 1, but according to the problem statement, b is at least 2. So no division by zero issues.\n\nTesting other cases",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can reuse the stubs from burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each candle burns for exactly one hour, so initially, the total hours of light will be equal to the number of candles `a`.\n3. **Reuse Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs and convert them into new candles. For every `b` stubs, Vasily can create one new candle.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue creating new candles from the stubs until there are not enough stubs left to make another new candle.\n5. **Update Count**: Each time new candles are made, add the number of new candles to the total hours of light and update the count of stubs accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.\n2. **Initialization**: The total hours of light is initialized to `a`, as each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Loop to Reuse Stubs**: A loop runs as long as there are enough stubs (`current`) to make at least one new candle. In each iteration:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of stubs to include both the leftover stubs and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, print the total number of hours the candles can keep the room illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently reuses the stubs, ensuring that no resources are wasted, and it correctly computes the maximum possible hours of illumination.",
