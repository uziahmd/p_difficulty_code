A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d?\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says they cut c limes into d slices each. So each lime contributes d slices. So total slices is c multiplied by d. Because for each lime, you get d slices. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nThen p: grams of salt.\n\nEach toast per friend requires:\n- nl milliliters of drink.\n- One slice of lime.\n- np grams of salt.\n\nSo for one toast, each friend needs these things. But since all friends make the same number of toasts, let's say each makes t toasts. Then total drink used is n * t * nl. Similarly, total lime slices needed is n * t (since each toast needs one slice per friend). And salt used is n * t * np.\n\nWe need to compute the maximum t such that all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total available resources.\n2. For each resource, determine how many toasts it can support.\n3. The minimum of these three will be the answer.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider each resource:\n\nTotal drink: Each bottle has l ml. So total drink is k * l.\nEach toast requires n * t * nl. So t can't be more than (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, total lime slices: c * d. Each toast needs n*t slices. So t <= (c*d)/(n).\n\nSalt: p grams. Each toast uses n*t * np. So t <= p/(n*np).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, what if any of these divisions don't result in an integer? Like, say, total drink allows for 5.9 toasts. Then t can only be 5 because you can't have a fraction of a toast. So we take the floor of each division.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the output is the number of toasts each can make, which must be an integer. So yes, we need to take the integer part, i.e., floor division.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = (c * d) // (n)\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the drink_toast is (k*l) divided by (n * nl), because each toast for all friends needs n * nl. Similarly for the others.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input as integers.\n\nCalculate each of the three possible maximum toasts based on each resource.\n\nTake the minimum of these three, and that's the answer.\n\nSo let's see the example.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. Each toast for all needs 3*3=9ml. So 20//9=2 (because 9*2=18 <=20, 9*3=27>20). So drink_toast is 2.\n\nLimes: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80//3=26 (since 3*26=78 <=80). So lime_toast is 26.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast uses 3*1=3 grams. 100//3=33. So salt_toast is 33.\n\nThe minimum among 2,26,33 is 2. So the output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10. So drink is 1000. Each toast per friend needs 4ml, so for 5 friends, each toast requires 5*4=20ml. 1000/20=50, but wait, no. Wait, no: each friend makes t toasts, so per toast, each needs nl=4ml. So for 5 friends, each toast requires 5 *4 =20ml. So total drink is 1000. So t is 1000/(5 *4) = 50. So drink_toast is 50.\n\nLime: c=1, d=19. Slices=19. Each toast needs 5 slices. So 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15<=19). So lime_toast is 3.\n\nSalt: p=90. Each toast needs 5*3=15g. 90//15=6. So salt_toast is 6.\n\nThe minimum is 3, so the output is 3.\n\nThird sample:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink=1000000. Each toast per friend is 50ml, so per toast for 10 friends: 10*50=500ml. So 1000000 /500 =2000. So drink_toast is 2000.\n\nLimes: 25*23=575 slices. Each toast needs 10 slices. 575//10=57.5 → floor to 57.\n\nSalt: p=1. Each toast uses 10*1=10g. 1//10=0.\n\nSo the salt_toast is 0. So overall min is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nIn Python, read the input line, split into integers.\n\nCompute each of the three constraints.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of the three.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the line, split into list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute drink_total = k * l\n\ndrink_max = (drink_total) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nlime_max = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_max = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\nPrint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: What if n * nl is zero? No, because n is at least 1, and nl is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20 drink.\n\nn * nl = 3*3=9.\n\n20//9=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSample 3: salt is 1, n=10, np=1. 10 *1=10. 1//10=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, think about edge cases.\n\nCase when all resources allow for zero toasts.\n\nLike n=2, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=0, nl=1, np=1.\n\nThen:\n\ndrink_max: (1*1) // (2*1) = 0.\n\nlime_max: 1//2 =0.\n\nsalt_max:0//2=0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when exactly enough for one toast.\n\nE.g., n=1, k=1, l=5, c=1, d=5, p=1, nl=5, np=1.\n\nSo drink:1*5=5. n *nl=1*5=5 →5//5=1.\n\nLime:5 slices. n=1. 5//1=5.\n\nSalt:1//1=1.\n\nSo min is 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, a lime slice, and a specific amount of salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total available quantity.\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum value of the three computed constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink_total = k * l\ntoasts_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\ntoasts_lime = lime_total // n\n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n3. **Drink Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Lime Slices Constraint**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. The maximum number of toasts is then determined by dividing this total by the number of friends.\n5. **Salt Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the salt is calculated by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n6. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three constraints (drink, lime slices, salt) gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts while respecting all constraints, providing an optimal solution.",
