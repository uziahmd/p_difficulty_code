Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a regular convex n-gon, and I need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices in order. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in this polygon, and then find which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nWait, but for a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. So maybe there's a pattern or formula for the possible angles between points.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a regular n-gon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nWhen we choose three vertices, v1, v2, v3, they form an angle at v2. How is this angle determined?\n\nI remember that in a circle, the measure of an angle formed by two chords (like from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3) depends on the arcs they subtend. Specifically, the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's think again. For a point inside a circle, the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Oh right, because if you have an inscribed angle, it's half the measure of its intercepted arc. But when you have a triangle with vertices on the circumference, the angle at a vertex is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me get this straight. Suppose we have three points A, B, C on a circle. Then angle ABC is an inscribed angle, and it's equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nSo in the context of a regular polygon, the arc length between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the arc between any two vertices that are k steps apart is 360*k/n degrees.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the three points are vertices of the polygon. So when forming angle at v2, the two points v1 and v3 are connected through v2. So the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Because the angle is based on the arcs they form.\n\nSo, for example, if v2 is at position i, and v1 is k steps before, and v3 is m steps after, then the angle would depend on the arcs between them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: for each possible triplet of vertices, the angle can be calculated as (k * (180 - (k * (180 / n))) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a regular polygon, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex are determined by the number of sides you skip when choosing the other two points.\n\nLet me think: for a given vertex v2, the other two points can be any two other vertices. The angle at v2 will vary depending on their positions.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible angle? Well, in a regular polygon, the largest angle occurs when the other two points are adjacent, making the angle as large as possible. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Maybe the angle can vary in steps based on the number of steps between the points.\n\nWait, let's take an example. For a square (n=4). Let's say the vertices are arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4 in order. Let's pick v2 as 2. Then, the possible pairs (v1, v3) could be:\n\n- 1 and 3: The angle at 2 would be 90 degrees (since the two sides are 1-2 and 2-3, and the angle is 90).\n- 1 and 4: The angle at 2. Hmm, wait. Let's visualize the square. Points 1,2,3,4 are arranged clockwise. So for v2=2, v1=1 and v3=4. The angle at 2 between 1 and 4: the lines 2-1 and 2-4. Since 1 and 4 are adjacent to 2, but in the square, 1 is next to 2, and 4 is the previous vertex. So the angle between 2-1 and 2-4 is 90 degrees as well? Or is it 270? No, wait, no, because in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. But when considering the angle formed by two chords, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's model the square as being on a unit circle, with each vertex at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, etc. So for vertex 2 at 90°, vertex 1 is at 0°, vertex 3 is at 180°, and vertex 4 is at 270°. So the angle at 2 is formed by the points 1 (0°), 2 (90°), and 4 (270°).\n\nThe angle at 2 is the angle between the vectors 2-1 and 2-4. Vector 2-1 is from 90° to 0°, which is a vector pointing to the left along the x-axis. Vector 2-4 is from 90° to 270°, which is a vector pointing down along the y-axis. So the angle between these two vectors is 90 degrees.\n\nSo for the square, when v2 is 2, the angle can be either 90 degrees (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2) or 45 degrees (if v1 is one step before and v3 is one step after, but wait, no, that's not possible in a square because the steps would be two apart.)\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the possible steps between v1 and v3. For a regular n-gon, when you choose v1 and v3, their positions relative to v2 determine the angle.\n\nSo for a given v2, the angle is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 in either direction around the polygon.\n\nWait, another approach: the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. So for points v1, v2, v3 arranged in a circle, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2.\n\nWait, yes, that makes sense. So the angle is (arc_length)/2, where arc_length is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that is not containing v2.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the arc between two vertices is k*(360/n) degrees, where k is the number of edges between them along the circumference.\n\nSo for v2, to find the angle, we need to compute the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2, and then divide by 2.\n\nWait, but the arc could be the major arc or minor arc, depending on which side of the polygon we're looking. So perhaps the angle is half the measure of the minor arc between v1 and v3.\n\nNo, wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So the angle at v2 is indeed half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that is not containing v2.\n\nWait, no. Because in the inscribed angle theorem, the angle is formed by two chords that meet at a point on the circumference. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, i.e., the arc that doesn't contain the angle's vertex.\n\nSo in this case, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, for example, in a regular triangle (n=3), each angle is 60 degrees. So for any triplet, the angle is fixed.\n\nIn a square (n=4), for v2=2, if v1=1 and v3=3, the arc between 1 and 3 is 180 degrees (they are two steps apart in the square). So the angle is 180/2 = 90 degrees. If v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, the arc between 1 and 4 is 270 degrees (three steps in the square), but wait, no. Because the square has four points, the arc from 1 to 4 is 3 steps, which is 3*90=270 degrees. But the angle at 2 is formed by points 1,2,4. The intercepted arc is between 1 and 4, but the inscribed angle is 1/2 of that arc. Wait, no, wait, because the arc that doesn't contain v2 is the one that is opposite. So for points 1,2,4, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't include 2 is the minor arc, which is 90 degrees (since 1 to 4 is 3 steps, but the other way is 1 step). Wait, no, the minor arc between 1 and 4 is 90 degrees, because in a square, 1 and 4 are adjacent.\n\nWait, that's getting confusing. Let me try to model it.\n\nIn the square, the points are 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order.\n\nFor v2=2, if v1=1 and v3=4, the angle at 2 is formed by the two chords 2-1 and 2-4.\n\nThe intercepted arc between 1 and 4 that does NOT include 2 is the arc going from 1 to 4 via 3, which is 180 degrees (since 1 to 3 is 90, 3 to 4 is another 90; total 180). So the angle at 2 is half of that, which is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the angle was 90 degrees. So in that case, the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nAnother example: v2=2, v1=1, v3=3. The intercepted arc is from 1 to 3 via 4, which is 180 degrees. So angle is 90 degrees again.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, in the second test case, when n=4 and a=67, the output is 45 degrees, which is closer to 67 than 90. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe my understanding is wrong. Let's see the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 67\n\nSample Output:\n2 1 3\n\nWhich implies that the angle formed by 1,2,3 is 45 degrees.\n\nWait, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the angle is calculated.\n\nWait, for the square, the possible angles are 45 and 90 degrees. How?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the intercepted arc calculation.\n\nWait, let's consider the square again.\n\nCase 1: v2=2, v1=1, v3=3.\n\nThe intercepted arc is from 1 to 3, which is two edges apart. So the arc length is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. Angle is 180/2=90 degrees.\n\nCase 2: v2=2, v1=1, v3=4.\n\nThe intercepted arc is from 1 to 4, which is three edges apart. So the arc is 3*(90) = 270 degrees. But since we take the minor arc, the intercepted arc is actually the other way around, which is 1 edge. So the angle is 1*(90)/2 = 45 degrees.\n\nAh! Right. Because the intercepted arc is the minor arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2.\n\nSo in this case, when v1=1 and v3=4, the minor arc is 90 degrees, so the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nSo for each triplet of points, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the minor arc between v1 and v3, not including v2.\n\nSo the key is to find, for each possible triplet, the minor arc between v1 and v3, multiply by 0.5, and see how close it is to 'a'.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all possible triplets and compute the minimal |angle - a|, and then output the triplet that achieves this minimal value.\n\nBut for n up to 105, iterating over all possible triplets would be O(n^3), which for n=105 is about 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nWait, n can be up to 105, so triplets are 105 choose 3, which is about 105*104*103/(6) ≈ 1,000,000. That's acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible triplets of distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3).\n\n2. For each triplet, compute the minor arc between v1 and v3, which is the minimal number of edges between them (either clockwise or counterclockwise). So the minor arc is min(k, n -k) steps, where k is the absolute difference in their indices.\n\nWait, but the indices are arranged in a circle. So for two points, say, 1 and 4 in a square (n=4), the distance clockwise is 3 steps, but counter-clockwise is 1 step. So the minor arc is 1 step.\n\nSo, for two vertices i and j, the minimal number of steps between them is d = min( (j -i) mod n, (i -j) mod n ). But since in a circle, the minimal step count is the minimum of the two possible paths.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the minimal arc in terms of steps. For each pair (v1, v3), the minimal number of steps is s = min( |v3 - v1|, n - |v3 - v1| ). Then, the arc length is s * (360 /n ) degrees.\n\nBut wait, in terms of the angle calculation, the angle is half of this minimal arc.\n\nSo for each triplet, the angle is (s * 180 /n ) degrees.\n\nBecause s steps correspond to s*(360/n) degrees, and the angle is half that, so (s*(360/n))/2 = s*180/n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\nCompute s as the minimal step count between v1 and v3. Then, angle is s*180/n degrees.\n\nThen, compute |angle - a|, and track the triplet(s) with the smallest difference.\n\nOnce all triplets are processed, output any of the triplets with the smallest difference.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently find the minimal angle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute all possible s values for each possible v2.\n\nWait, for a given v2, the possible s values are the minimal step counts between v2 and any other vertex, but that's not exactly accurate. Because for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), s is the minimal step count between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no. s is the minimal step count between v1 and v3, regardless of v2.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because the angle at v2 depends only on v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for each triplet, we need to compute s between v1 and v3, and then the angle is s * 180 /n.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), where v1, v2, v3 are distinct and in the range [1, n].\n\n2. For each triplet, compute the minimal step count s between v1 and v3.\n\n3. Compute the angle: angle = s * 180 / n.\n\n4. Compute the absolute difference between this angle and 'a'.\n\n5. Keep track of the triplet(s) that give the smallest difference.\n\n6. After processing all triplets, output any of the triplets with the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the triplet that gives the minimal possible angle. So we need to find the triplet where the computed angle is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can find the best s for each possible s, and find which s is closest to a * n / 180.\n\nWait, because angle = s * 180 /n → s = (a * n) / 180.\n\nSo for a given 'a', the ideal s is (a *n)/180. But since s must be an integer between 1 and (n//2), perhaps we can iterate over s and find the closest s that minimizes |s*180/n - a|.\n\nBut s must be an integer, and also, for each s, we can find the triplets that have that s.\n\nWait, but for each s, the triplet can be any (v1, v2, v3) where the minimal step count between v1 and v3 is s.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find the s that is closest to the target s0 = (a *n)/180.\n\nBut since s must be an integer, perhaps we can compute s_floor = floor(s0), s_ceil = ceil(s0), and check the minimal differences.\n\nBut also, since s can't be zero, and must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but in some cases, s could be zero, but since v1 and v3 must be distinct, s must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n1. Compute s0 = (a * n) / 180. This is the ideal s that would make the angle exactly equal to 'a'.\n\n2. The possible s values to consider are around s0, i.e., s_floor and s_ceil, but also considering that s can't be larger than n//2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to iterate all possible s in the range 1 to floor(n/2), and for each s, find the minimal difference |s*180/n - a|.\n\nOnce we find the s that gives the minimal difference, then find any triplet that has that s.\n\nBut how do we find any triplet with that s?\n\nWell, for a given s, any pair of points (v1, v3) that are s steps apart (in the minimal way) will do. Then, for any v2 that is not in {v1, v3}.\n\nWait, but in the triplet, v2 can be any other point except v1 and v3. So for a given pair (v1, v3) with s steps apart, any v2 that's different from v1 and v3 can be chosen as the middle vertex.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n- For each possible s (from 1 to n//2), compute the minimal angle difference.\n\n- Find the s with the smallest difference.\n\n- Then, for that s, find any pair of points (v1, v3) that are s steps apart.\n\n- Then, choose any v2 that is not v1 or v3.\n\nOnce we have that, output the triplet (v1, v2, v3).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all possible s values (from 1 to n//2).\n\n2. For each s, compute the angle (s * 180 /n ), then the difference from a.\n\n3. Find the s that gives the minimal difference.\n\n4. Among all s with the same minimal difference, select the one with the earliest occurrence (or any, as per the problem statement).\n\n5. Then, find any pair (v1, v3) that are s steps apart.\n\n6. Choose any v2 that is not v1 or v3.\n\nBut how do we find v1 and v3?\n\nFor a given s, the possible pairs (v1, v3) are those that are exactly s steps apart in the minimal path. So for any v1, v3 is v1 + s, modulo n.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is circular, the steps can wrap around.\n\nSo, for example, for n=4 and s=1, v1=1 and v3=2, or v1=2 and v3=3, etc.\n\nSo for a given s, the possible (v1, v3) pairs are:\n\n(v, v + s) mod n, for v in 1..n.\n\nWait, but in the case where s is larger than n/2, adding s steps could wrap around.\n\nWait, but since we've already considered s up to n//2, the minimal step count is s.\n\nSo for each s in 1..n//2, the possible (v1, v3) pairs are all consecutive s steps.\n\nSo for each s, the number of possible (v1, v3) pairs is n.\n\nBut since the polygon is a circle, each s defines a set of diametrically opposed points if s is n/2.\n\nBut for our purposes, any pair is acceptable.\n\nSo, once we have the desired s, we can choose any pair (v1, v3) that are s steps apart, and then choose any v2 not in {v1, v3}.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute s0 = (a *n)/180.\n\nCompute the minimal s in 1..n//2 that is closest to s0.\n\nOnce s is found, find any (v1, v3) pair that is s steps apart.\n\nThen, choose any v2 not equal to v1 or v3.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute s0 = (a * n) / 180.\n\nFind s in 1..n//2 that is closest to s0.\n\nIf there are multiple s with the same minimal difference, choose any.\n\nOnce s is known, find any pair (v1, v3) that are s steps apart.\n\nThen, choose v2 as any other vertex (not v1 or v3).\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nWait, but for some cases, the minimal difference may not be unique. For example, if s0 is exactly halfway between two s values.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should find all s that have the minimal difference and pick the smallest, or any.\n\nBut in practice, it's easier to find the s that is the closest to s0, and in case of tie, pick the smaller s.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nCompute s0 = a * n / 180.\n\nInitialize best_diff as a very large number, best_s as 0.\n\nLoop s from 1 to n//2:\n\n   current_angle = s * 180 / n\n\n   diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n   if diff < best_diff:\n\n       best_diff = diff\n\n       best_s = s\n\n   elif diff == best_diff:\n\n       if s < best_s:\n\n           best_s = s\n\nOnce best_s is found, find any (v1, v3) pair that are best_s steps apart.\n\nHow to find such a pair?\n\nOne approach is to pick v1=1, then v3 = 1 + best_s.\n\nBut since the polygon is circular, we have to take modulo n.\n\nWait, for example, for n=5, s=3, then 1 +3=4.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if v1= n, s=1: v3= n+1 mod n=1.\n\nSo, to find v3 for a given v1 and s:\n\nv3 = (v1 + s -1) % n +1.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWait, for v1=1, s=1: 1 +1 =2.\n\nYes.\n\nv1=4, s=1: (4+1-1) mod5=4 mod5=4. Add 1: 5? Wait no.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is v3 = (v1 + s) %n.\n\nWait, but for v1=4, s=1, 4+1=5, which mod 5 is 0. But we need to represent vertices as 1-based.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is:\n\nv3 = ((v1 -1) + s) %n +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for v1=4, s=1: (4-1)=3, 3+1=4, mod5=4, +1=5. But 5 is beyond n=5. So wait, perhaps the formula isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nEach step corresponds to moving to the next vertex in the list.\n\nSo for a polygon with n=5, the order is 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nThe steps between 1 and 2 is 1, 1 and 3 is 2 steps, etc.\n\nSo, for any v1, v3 is located s steps ahead in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo, to compute v3 for a given v1 and s:\n\nv3 = v1 + s.\n\nBut since the list wraps around, it's (v1 + s -1) %n +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nv1=5, s=3, n=5.\n\n(5 +3-1) mod5 =7 mod5=2. +1=3.\n\nSo 5 and 3 are 3 steps apart (5→1, 2,3).\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, v1=4, s=1: (4+1-1) mod5=4 mod5=4. +1=5.\n\nSo 4 and 5 are 1 step apart.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nv3 = ((v1 + s -1) %n) +1.\n\nSo, given that, for a given s, we can generate all possible (v1, v3) pairs.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to just pick the first possible pair.\n\nLike, for v1 starting from 1 to n:\n\nv3 = ((v1 + s -1) %n ) +1.\n\nSo, for each v1, compute v3, and then the triplet is (v1, v2, v3), where v2 is any other vertex.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce best_s is found, we can pick the first possible v1 (say, 1), compute v3, and then choose v2 as any other vertex except v1 and v3.\n\nBut wait, what if v3 is 1 again (for s= n//2)?\n\nNo, because for s <=n//2, v3 is always a different vertex.\n\nWait, for s= n//2, for even n, the pair (v1, v3) is diametrically opposite.\n\nSo, for example, in n=4, s=2, v1=1, v3=3.\n\nSo the triplet would be (1, v2, 3), where v2 is 2 or 4.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nOnce best_s is found, pick v1=1.\n\nCompute v3 = ((1 + best_s -1) %n ) +1.\n\nThen, v2 can be any other vertex except v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input 2:\n\nn=4, a=67.\n\nCompute s0= (67 *4)/180 = (268)/180 ≈ 1.4889.\n\nSo s can be 1 or 2.\n\nCompute for s=1: angle= 1*180/4=45.\n\ndiff= 22.\n\ns=2: angle= 2*180/4=90.\n\ndiff=23.\n\nSo the minimal is s=1.\n\nSo, the code would choose s=1.\n\nPick v1=1, v3=2.\n\nv2 can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo the triplet is 1,3,2 → \"1 3 2\" or \"1 4 2\".\n\nBut the sample output is \"2 1 3\".\n\nHmm, so why is that?\n\nWait, in the sample input 2, the output is \"2 1 3\".\n\nSo that suggests that the triplet is (v1=1, v2=2, v3=3), which for s=2 (steps between 1 and 3 is 2 steps).\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, s=2 gives angle=90 degrees, which is further away from a=67 than s=1.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, sample input 2 is 4 67.\n\nSo a=67 degrees.\n\nCompute s0 = 67*4 /180 = 268/180 ≈ 1.4889.\n\nSo s can be 1 or 2.\n\nCompute for s=1: angle= 1*180/4=45. |45-67|=22.\n\ns=2: angle= 2*180/4=90. |90-67|=23.\n\nSo the minimal is s=1, with difference 22.\n\nSo the code would choose s=1.\n\nSo the triplet would be (v1=1, v3=2), and v2 can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo triplet options are (1,3,2) and (1,4,2).\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 3.\n\nWait, what's happening here.\n\nIn the sample output, the triplet is 2,1,3.\n\nSo v2=1, v1=2, v3=3.\n\nWait, but wait: the angle is at v2=1, between v1=2 and v3=3.\n\nWhat is the minimal step count between v1 and v3?\n\nv1=2, v3=3: steps between them is 1.\n\nSo s=1.\n\nSo the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nWhich is indeed 22 away from 67.\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 3.\n\nSo why is this triplet chosen instead of 1 3 2?\n\nBecause the code's approach picks v1=1, but perhaps the code could choose any triplet that has s=1.\n\nSo the code can choose any triplet, as long as it's correct.\n\nIn the sample, the output is 2 1 3, which is another valid triplet.\n\nSo the code's approach of choosing v1=1 is not the only option.\n\nSo in code, perhaps after finding s, we can choose the first possible triplet, but the problem allows any correct triplet.\n\nSo, in the code, to make it simple, we can:\n\n- Once s is found, pick any v1 and v3 that are s steps apart, and any v2 that's not in {v1, v3}.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample case, the code could choose v1=1, v3=2, v2=3 → triplet 1 3 2.\n\nBut the sample expects 2 1 3, which is also correct.\n\nSo the code can choose any of these.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute s as the best_s.\n\nThen, pick v1=1, compute v3 as (1 + s -1) %n +1.\n\nThen, pick any v2 that is not v1 or v3.\n\nSo, in the sample case, v1=1, s=1, v3=2.\n\nv2 can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo, the triplet is (1,3,2) or (1,4,2).\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 3, which is a different triplet.\n\nSo, the code can output any valid triplet.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed with this method.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, read n and a.\n\nCompute s0 = a *n /180.\n\nThen, for s in 1 to n//2:\n\n   compute angle = s*180/n.\n\n   compute difference = |angle - a|.\n\n   keep track of s with minimal difference.\n\nOnce s is found, pick v1=1.\n\nCompute v3 = ((1 + s -1) %n ) +1 → (1 +s-1) is s, mod n.\n\nSo v3 = (s) %n +1? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, the formula is ((v1 + s -1) modn) +1.\n\nv1=1, s=1 → (1 +1-1) modn =1 modn → 1. +1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nv1=1, s=3, n=5 → (1+3-1)=3 mod5=3 → 3+1=4.\n\nYes, 1 and4 are 3 steps apart.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nv3 = (v1 + s -1) %n\n\nv3 = v3 +1.\n\nSo, for v1=1, s=1: (1+1-1) mod4 =1 mod4=1 → v3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce v3 is computed, then v2 can be any other vertex except v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for example, v2 can be 3 or 4 in n=4.\n\nThus, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3).\n\nBut wait, the triplet needs to be ordered as v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut in the sample, the triplet is (2,1,3), which is a different arrangement.\n\nWait, no: in the sample, the triplet is 2 1 3.\n\nWhich represents v2=1, v1=2, v3=3.\n\nWhich is another possible triplet with s=1.\n\nSo, the code could choose any triplet, but to ensure that the output is correct, perhaps the code should arrange the triplet in any order as long as v2 is in the middle.\n\nWait, but the problem requires to print v1, v2, v3, which are three distinct vertices, with v2 being the vertex of the angle.\n\nSo, the triplet must be such that the angle is at v2.\n\nSo, the code must output the triplet in the order (v1, v2, v3), with v2 being the middle vertex.\n\nSo, in the sample case, the triplet is 2 1 3.\n\nWhich means that v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 3.\n\nSo, the angle is at 1.\n\nSo, in the code, the triplet is constructed as (v1, v2, v3), with v2 being any other vertex.\n\nBut in the code's approach, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3) where v2 is any other vertex.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample case, the code could output 1 3 2.\n\nBut the sample shows another triplet.\n\nThus, the code's approach is valid as long as the triplet is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 15\n\nn=3, a=15.\n\ns0 = 15*3/180= 0.25.\n\nSo s can be 1.\n\nangle= 1*180/3=60. Difference is 45.\n\nSo the code chooses s=1.\n\nv1=1, v3=2.\n\nv2 can be 3.\n\nSo triplet is 1 3 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 67.\n\nAs discussed, s=1.\n\nv1=1, v3=2.\n\nv2 can be 3 or 4.\n\nSo triplet could be 1 3 2 or 1 4 2.\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 3, which is another valid triplet.\n\nSo the code's approach is acceptable.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 68.\n\ns0= 68*4/180= 152/180≈ 0.844.\n\nSo s can be 1.\n\nangle=45. difference is 23.\n\ns=2: angle=90. difference is 22.\n\nWait, wait, wait:\n\nWait, for a=68, s=1: 45 → difference 23.\n\ns=2:90 → difference 22.\n\nSo the minimal is s=2, with difference 22.\n\nSo the code would choose s=2.\n\nv1=1, v3=3.\n\nv2 can be 2 or4.\n\nSo the triplet is 1 2 3 or 1 4 3.\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 4.\n\nWait, no: sample output is 2 1 4, which is another triplet.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn that triplet, v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is4.\n\nThe minimal step count between 2 and4 is 2 steps (since n=4, 2 steps is the minimal between 2 and 4).\n\nSo s=2.\n\nAngle is 2*180/4=90.\n\nWhich is 22 away from 68.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code would output any triplet with s=2.\n\nSo, in code, for s=2, v1=1, v3=3.\n\nv2 can be 2 or 4.\n\nSo triplet 1 2 3 or 1 4 3.\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 4.\n\nWhich is another triplet with s=2.\n\nSo, the code could output any of these.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo, now the code can be written.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n1. When a is 0: but according to the problem statement, a >=1.\n\n2. When a is 180: but in a regular polygon, the maximum possible angle is 180 degrees, but that's only possible if the polygon is a digon (n=2), which is not allowed.\n\nWait, n starts from",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves calculating the possible angles and selecting the triplet of vertices that minimizes the difference between the target angle and the computed angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Polygon Structure**: A regular convex polygon has vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For any three vertices `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, the angle at `v2` can be determined by the minimal arc between `v1` and `v3`. The angle is half the measure of this minimal arc.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Steps**: For each possible step count `s` (from 1 to `n//2`), compute the corresponding angle and determine how close it is to the target angle `a`.\n4. **Select Optimal Triplet**: Choose the step count `s` that gives the smallest difference from the target angle. Then, select any valid triplet of vertices that form this angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_s = 0\n\nfor s in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n    angle = s * 180 / n\n    diff = abs(angle - a)\n    if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and s < best_s):\n        best_diff = diff\n        best_s = s\n\nv1 = 1\nv3 = (v1 + best_s - 1) % n + 1\nv2_candidates = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i != v1 and i != v3]\nv2 = v2_candidates[0]\n\nprint(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Finding Best Step Count**: We iterate over possible step counts `s` from 1 to `n//2` to find the one that results in an angle closest to `a`.\n3. **Calculating Angle**: For each `s`, compute the angle and its difference from `a`.\n4. **Selecting Triplet**: Once the optimal `s` is found, select the first valid pair of vertices `v1` and `v3` that are `s` steps apart. Choose any remaining vertex as `v2` to form the triplet.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal triplet by leveraging the properties of regular polygons and ensures the solution is both correct and efficient.",
