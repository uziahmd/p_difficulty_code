Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in these diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call this the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the cells that are not on either of these diagonals should be the same and different from the X character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines each containing n characters. Oh right, but since the input might have quotes or something, I need to make sure I'm reading it correctly. Probably, each line is a string, and I can split them into individual characters.\n\nSo, I'll read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Then, create a 2D array (grid) to represent the letters.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to:\n\n1. Check both diagonals:\n   - The primary diagonal: grid[i][i] for all i.\n   - The secondary diagonal: grid[i][n-1-i] for all i.\n\n2. For both diagonals, all their elements must be the same. So, for the primary, collect all the characters and see if they're all equal. Same for the secondary.\n\n3. Once I know what the diagonal character is (let's say 'x'), then I need to check all the non-diagonal cells. Each of these must be the same and different from 'x'.\n\nWait, but what if the diagonals have different characters? Like, some are 'x' and others are 'y'. Then it's automatically invalid, right?\n\nSo first, check if all the primary diagonal is the same and all the secondary diagonal is the same. If they are not, then return NO.\n\nBut also, the primary and secondary diagonals must be the same character. Because otherwise, the X would have two different characters on the diagonals, which doesn't form a valid X.\n\nWait no, according to the problem statement, the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letter. So, the diagonals must consist of the same letter. So, the primary diagonal's character must equal the secondary diagonal's.\n\nSo, first, check if all the primary and secondary diagonals are the same. Otherwise, it's a NO.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check the primary diagonal: all elements same. Let's call this c1.\n2. Check the secondary diagonal: all elements same. Let's call this c2.\n3. If c1 != c2, output NO.\n4. Else, proceed. Now, the 'X' character is c = c1 (or c2, since they are equal).\n5. Now, check all the other cells (not on either diagonal). They must all be the same and not equal to c.\n6. So, collect all the non-diagonal cells into a set. If the size of the set is 0, then all non-diagonal are same as c, which is invalid. Or if the set has more than one element, it's invalid.\n7. Also, the non-diagonal cells must all be the same, and different from c.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next n lines as a list of strings, then convert into a grid (a list of lists or a list of strings, each string representing a row).\n\nThen, for the primary diagonal:\n- Iterate over each row i, column i.\n- Collect all grid[i][i], check if all are the same.\n\nSimilarly for the secondary diagonal:\n- Iterate over each row i, column (n-1 -i).\n- Collect all grid[i][n-1-i], check if all are same.\n\nIf the primary and secondary diagonals are not all same, output NO.\n\nElse, get c = c1.\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j) not on either diagonal, check if it's equal to c.\n\nCollect all such cells, check if they are all the same and not equal to c.\n\nSo, create a variable 'other_char', initially None.\n\nLoop through all i from 0 to n-1:\n   loop through j from 0 to n-1:\n      if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n          continue\n      else:\n          current_char = grid[i][j]\n          if other_char is None:\n              other_char = current_char\n          elif current_char != other_char:\n              # found differing character, invalid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. The grid must satisfy specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - The primary diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must both consist of the same character.\n   \n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**:\n   - All elements not on the diagonals must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Read the input and construct the grid.\n   - Check if all elements on both diagonals are the same.\n   - If the diagonals are not the same, output \"NO\".\n   - If the diagonals are the same, check all non-diagonal elements to ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in a diagonal are the same\ndef check_diagonal(grid, n, i):\n    c = grid[i][i]\n    for j in range(n):\n        if grid[i][j] != c:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Check primary and secondary diagonals\nprimary_ok = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not check_diagonal(grid, n, i):\n        primary_ok = False\n        break\n\nif not primary_ok:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nsecondary_ok = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][0]:\n        secondary_ok = False\n        break\n\nif not secondary_ok or grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, check the other cells\nx_char = grid[0][0]\n\nother_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if grid[i][j] != x_char:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if all other chars are the same and not equal to x_char\nif len(other_chars) == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) == 1:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The grid is read as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n- **Checking Diagonals**: The function `check_diagonal` verifies if all elements in a diagonal are the same.\n- **Primary and Secondary Diagonals**: Both diagonals are checked separately. If either is not uniform, the result is \"NO\".\n- **Non-Diagonal Elements**: These elements must all be the same and different from the diagonal character. If they meet this condition, the result is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".",
