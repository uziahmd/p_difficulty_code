    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty set), the sum in the original array and the permuted array are different. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. We have an array 'a' with n distinct integers. We need to create a permutation 'b' such that for every non-empty proper subset S of the indices, the sum of elements in 'a' for S is not equal to the sum of elements in 'b' for S. If no such permutation exists, we output -1.\n\nWait, but how can we check all possible subsets? Because for each subset, we have to ensure that the sum in 'b' isn't the same as in 'a'. That sounds computationally heavy, especially since n can be up to 22. The number of subsets is 2^22 - 2, which is around 4 million. But wait, 22 is manageable because 2^22 is about 4 million, which is acceptable for some brute-force approaches, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nBut trying all permutations of 'a' for each case would be impossible because 22! is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let me think about what makes two subsets have the same sum. For example, if in 'a', the sum of some subset equals the sum of another subset in 'b', that's a problem. So our goal is to arrange 'b' such that no subset has the same sum as in 'a'.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to make sure that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a'. How can we achieve that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the concept of a \"subset-sum avoiding\" permutation. Maybe by arranging the elements in a certain way, we can prevent any subset sums from colliding between 'a' and 'b'.\n\nLet me consider small examples. Take the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1000 100 10 1\n\nThe output is 100 1 1000 10. Let's see why this works.\n\nIn 'a', the subsets:\n\nFor example, the subset {1000,10} sums to 1010. In 'b', the subset {100,1} also sums to 101. Wait, no, that's different. So in 'b', does any subset sum match a subset in 'a'? I think not.\n\nSo perhaps the way to construct 'b' is to place elements in such a way that for each element, its position in 'b' doesn't allow any subset sum to coincide.\n\nWait, another thought: what if we construct 'b' such that the prefix sums are all unique? Because if the prefix sums are unique, then for any two different subsets, their sums would be different. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Prefix sums being unique only ensures that all possible sums for prefixes are unique, but subsets can have overlapping sums even if prefix sums are unique.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should arrange 'b' in a way that the multiset of subset sums is completely different from that of 'a'. But that's a bit vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the binary representations. Since n is up to 22, each element can be represented with 22 bits. Maybe if each element is placed such that each bit is unique, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each element in 'a', assign it to 'b' in a way that the new position encodes some information that prevents collisions in subset sums.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to assign each element to a position such that the sum for every non-empty subset is unique in 'b'. But ensuring that seems tough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph problem. Each node represents a possible state of the permutation, and edges represent swaps that don't cause any subset sum collision. Then, we can perform a BFS to find a valid permutation. But with n=22, the state space is way too big.\n\nHmm, that might not be feasible.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem requires that for every subset S (non-empty, proper), the sum in 'a' is not equal to the sum in 'b'. So the sum of any subset in 'a' must differ from the sum of the same subset in 'b'. But wait, the subset S in 'a' is exactly the same as the subset in 'b' in terms of the elements, just ordered differently. So the sum for S in 'a' is fixed, and in 'b' it's the sum of the elements in those positions of 'b'.\n\nSo for example, if in 'a' the subset S is [x1, x2], then in 'b', the sum of the elements at positions x1 and x2 must not be equal to the sum of the elements in 'a' at positions x1 and x2.\n\nWait, but in 'a' and 'b', the subset S is the same set of indices. So the sum in 'a' is sum_a(S) = a[x1] + a[x2], and in 'b' it's sum_b(S) = b[x1] + b[x2]. We need sum_a(S) != sum_b(S) for all non-empty proper S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the subset S is a set of indices, say {i, j, k}. In 'a', the sum is a[i] + a[j] + a[k]. In 'b', the sum is b[i] + b[j] + b[k]. We need these two sums to be different.\n\nSo the problem reduces to permuting the elements of 'a' into 'b' such that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of the elements in 'a' for S is different from the sum in 'b' for S.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find a permutation 'b' where for any subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the properties of 'b'. Perhaps 'b' should be such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is unique across all subsets, including those in 'a'. Or perhaps, more precisely, that for every subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for the same S.\n\nWait, but 'S' is the same in both 'a' and 'b'—it's the same indices. So the sum of 'a' over S is fixed, and the sum of 'b' over S must differ.\n\nSo, for each subset S, sum_b(S) must not equal sum_a(S).\n\nThis is a crucial point.\n\nSo, the task is to find a permutation of 'a' such that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of the elements in 'b' at S is different from the sum in 'a' at S.\n\nNow, how can we achieve this?\n\nPerhaps the easiest way is to ensure that for each element in 'a', when placed in 'b', it doesn't create any subset sum collision.\n\nWait, but considering all subsets is complicated. Maybe there's a way to construct 'b' in a specific order, like sorted order, and then check if it satisfies the condition. If not, try a different order.\n\nBut with n up to 22, trying all permutations is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible permutation, check whether it meets the condition. But 22! is way too big, so that's impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each element in 'b' is assigned a value such that the sum for any subset in 'b' is unique compared to the sum in 'a' for the same subset.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct way to do this.\n\nAnother thought: the problem may require that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from the sum of the same subset in 'a'. So, for each element in 'b', the assignment must not allow any subset to have the same sum as in 'a'.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the simplest case: n=1. Then, the array has one element, and since there are no non-empty proper subsets, the condition is automatically satisfied. So the output is the same as the input.\n\nn=2: the possible non-empty proper subsets are {1}, {2}. So for 'b', we need a[1] != b[1], and a[2] != b[2].\n\nWait, no. Because the subsets are based on the indices, not the values. So for subset {1}, the sum in 'a' is a[1], and in 'b' it's b[1]. Similarly, for subset {2}, sum is a[2] vs b[2]. So for n=2, the permutation must swap the two elements if a[1] == b[1], but wait, that's not possible because all elements are distinct. So for n=2, any permutation will satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but wait: the elements are all distinct, but the indices are the same. So for n=2, the permutation must arrange the elements such that the individual elements at each index are different. Which is always true since all elements are distinct.\n\nSo for n=2, any permutation is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: the non-empty proper subsets are all single-element subsets and the two-element subsets.\n\nSo, for each element in 'b', the element at index i must not equal a[i]. Additionally, for any two elements j and k, the sum b[j] + b[k] must not equal a[j] + a[k].\n\nWait, no. Because the subset {j,k} in 'a' has sum a[j]+a[k], and in 'b' it's b[j]+b[k]. These must be different.\n\nSo, in addition to each element differing individually, the sum of any pair must differ as well.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient either, because triplets could also have the same sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is to find a permutation where the sum of any subset (of size >=1 and <n) in 'b' differs from the sum in 'a' for that same subset.\n\nSo, for all possible k (from 1 to n-1), and all possible subsets S of size k, sum_{s in S} b[s] != sum_{s in S} a[s}.\n\nThat's a lot of constraints.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nMaybe a way to approach this is to assign each element to a position in 'b' such that for each position i, b[i] is not equal to a[i]. Because if any b[i] were equal to a[i], then the subset {i} would have the same sum, which violates the condition.\n\nWait, yes! That's a crucial observation. Because if b[i] = a[i], then the subset {i} would have sum equal in both arrays. So, the first thing is that in 'b', each element must differ from 'a' at the same index. Since all elements in 'a' are distinct, 'b' is a permutation, so each element in 'b' is distinct, but that doesn't necessarily mean that b[i] != a[i] for all i.\n\nSo, the first condition is that for all i, b[i] != a[i]. Because otherwise, the subset {i} would have equal sums.\n\nWait, but what about larger subsets? Even if b[i] != a[i], maybe a subset of two or more elements could have the same sum as in 'a'.\n\nSo, the first step is to ensure that each element in 'b' is different from 'a' at the same index. Then, we can proceed to check for larger subsets.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check if it's possible to find a permutation 'b' where for each i, b[i] != a[i]. If not possible, output -1.\n\nWait, but given that all elements are distinct, is it always possible to permute 'a' such that each element is in a different position than in 'a'? Well, for n=1, it's trivial. For n>1, it depends. For example, if all elements are the same, but in the problem statement, all elements are distinct. So for n>=1, it's always possible to permute 'a' such that each element is in a different position than in the original array.\n\nBecause, since all elements are distinct, for any permutation, it's possible to have b[i] != a[i] for all i. So, condition 1 is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo, that's the first step. Now, beyond that, we need to make sure that for any subset S of size >=2 and <=n-1, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a'.\n\nHmm. How can we ensure that?\n\nLet me think about what happens if we arrange 'b' in a certain way.\n\nOne approach is to arrange 'b' such that each element is as far as possible from its original position. For example, placing the largest element in the second position, the second largest in the third, etc. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of any subset in 'b' must differ from the same subset in 'a'. To achieve this, perhaps each element in 'b' should be arranged such that the sum for any subset in 'b' is unique compared to 'a'.\n\nWait, but ensuring that for every subset is difficult. Maybe a way to approach this is to try to arrange the elements in 'b' in such a way that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for that subset.\n\nSo, perhaps we can greedily assign elements to positions, ensuring that adding the new element doesn't create any conflicting subset sums.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem where each permutation is a variable, and constraints are the subset sum conditions. Solving this with backtracking could be feasible for small n (like up to 12), but n=22 is way too big.\n\nWait, but n is up to 22, which suggests that a brute-force approach is not feasible. So, perhaps the solution is to find a way to construct 'b' in a way that naturally satisfies the condition without checking all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the properties that 'b' must have. One important property is that for any two subsets S and T in 'a', their sums must not equal the sums of the corresponding subsets in 'b'.\n\nWait, but it's possible that some subsets in 'a' have the same sum as some other subsets in 'b', but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum function in 'b' should be injective, meaning that for every subset S, the sum is unique. But that's a very strong condition and may not be necessary, as the problem only requires that the sum in 'b' for S is different from the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: since all elements are distinct, perhaps arranging 'b' such that the elements are in a different order than 'a' in a way that each element is as far as possible from its original position. For example, reversing the array. Let's see if that works.\n\nTake the sample input: a is [1000, 100, 10, 1]. Reversed, it's [1,10,100,1000], which is the output in the sample. And that works.\n\nBut why does reversing work? Let's see:\n\nIn the sample, each element is in a different position than in 'a'. So condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nNow, for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a'.\n\nIs that always the case when you reverse the array? Not necessarily. For example, consider a = [1, 2, 3]. Reversed, it's [3,2,1]. Now, the subset {1,2} in 'a' sums to 3, and in 'b' it sums to 3+2=5, which is different. Subset {1,3} in 'a' sums to 4, in 'b' sums to 3+1=4. Oh, that's a problem. So the reversed array doesn't work here.\n\nSo, the reversed approach may not always work.\n\nHmm, so perhaps reversing is not the right approach.\n\nWait, but maybe another arrangement, like placing elements in a way that the differences between 'b' and 'a' are maximized for all subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by assigning each element to a position such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from 'a' for that subset.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: for each element in 'b', assign it in such a way that the difference between 'b' and 'a' for each element is unique. But I'm not sure how that would help.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to constructing a Latin square or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced by ensuring that for any two elements, their positions in 'b' are arranged such that no combination of them leads to the same subset sum as in 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Suppose I arrange 'b' such that the multiset of subset sums is entirely different from 'a's. Then, the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut how can I arrange 'b' to achieve this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the binary representation of the numbers. For each element in 'b', assign it to a position such that each bit is set uniquely, preventing any overlaps in subset sums.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each element, we can assign it to a position such that the XOR of the elements in 'b' is different from 'a's. But XOR is a bitwise operation, and the problem is about sums, so that's probably not directly applicable.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem can be viewed in terms of linear algebra, where each subset sum is a vector, and we want the vectors in 'b' to be different from those in 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with that approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where each element in 'a' is connected to possible positions in 'b', ensuring that the constraints on subset sums are met.\n\nBut again, with n=22, this seems challenging.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution lies in the fact that the problem is about the difference between 'a' and 'b' for each subset. So, for each subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) must be non-zero. So, perhaps the permutation should be such that for each S, the sum in 'b' is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve this is to assign each element to 'b' in a way that for every possible subset, the sum in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a partial permutation, and edges represent adding an element to a position such that no subset sum conflict arises.\n\nBut for n=22, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is easier than I think. Let's think about the condition again.\n\nWe need that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum for S.\n\nWhat's the minimal condition that 'b' must satisfy?\n\nWell, for single-element subsets, each element in 'b' must differ from 'a' at the same index. Which is already handled because 'b' is a permutation.\n\nFor two-element subsets, the sum of any two elements in 'b' must differ from the sum of the same two elements in 'a'.\n\nWait, but the same two elements are in different positions, so their sum could vary.\n\nWait, no. The subset S is defined by the indices, not the values. So in 'a', for S={i,j}, the sum is a[i]+a[j]. In 'b', it's b[i]+b[j]. So, if in 'a', a[i] and a[j] are different from b[i] and b[j], respectively, but their sum could still be the same.\n\nFor example, suppose a = [1,3], b = [3,1]. Then, the subset {1,2} in 'a' has sum 4, and in 'b' it also has sum 4. So that's a problem.\n\nSo, the permutation must not only have individual elements differing but also have their pairs (and larger subsets) not summing to the same as 'a'.\n\nHmm, that complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible permutations and check each one against the subset sum condition.\n\nBut for n=22, that's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps n=22 is manageable with some optimizations.\n\nWait, no. 22! is about 1e22, which is way beyond computational feasibility.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced by noticing that certain permutations will automatically satisfy the condition.\n\nFor example, if the permutation is such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from the same subset in 'a', perhaps by choosing 'b' to be the reverse of 'a', or in some other order.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, this doesn't always work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can arrange 'b' such that the sum of any subset is unique. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be addressed by using the concept of a \"Sidon sequence\", where all subset sums are unique. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assign the elements in 'b' in a way that for each element, it's placed in a position such that the sum involving that element doesn't collide with any subset sum in 'a'.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for each subset S of size k, the sum in 'b' must not equal the sum in 'a' for S. So, perhaps if we can ensure that for each k, the sums for subsets of size k in 'b' are different from those in 'a', then the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to construct 'b' such that for each i, b[i] = a[σ(i)], where σ is a permutation of indices, and for any subset S, the sum of b over S is different from the sum of a over S.\n\nBut how to choose σ.\n\nWait, perhaps σ is the identity permutation except for certain swaps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires that for all non-empty proper subsets S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the way to achieve this is to assign each element to a position such that for each element, it's as far away as possible from its original position, thus minimizing the chance of any subset sums colliding.\n\nBut again, this is speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the binary representations of the elements. For each element, when it's moved to a new position, the way it affects the subset sums can be controlled.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a permutation 'b' where each element is placed such that for every subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). But how to construct 'b'?\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a permutation where for each element, it's placed in a position such that the sum of any subset including that position in 'b' is different from 'a's sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each subset sum is a linear equation. We need to ensure that for each subset S, the sum in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nBut the variables are the permutation assignments, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find a permutation such that for each subset S, the sum of the elements in 'b' for S is different from the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nWhich is equivalent to: for every subset S (non-empty, proper), sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nBut how to construct 'b' to meet this.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's construct 'b' such that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is equal to the sum of the same subset S in 'a' plus some delta that is unique for each subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to arrange 'b' such that the sum of any subset is unique, but that's not necessary, only that it's different from 'a's.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to assign each element to 'b' in a way that for each element, it's placed in a position such that any subset including it doesn't have a sum that matches 'a's.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to generate all possible permutations and check each one for the condition. But with n=22, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but for small n, it's manageable. However, for n=22, it's not.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mathematical insight that can be applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is solvable by considering the following: for each element in 'a', assign it to a position in 'b' such that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum for S.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for each subset S, the sum in 'a' and 'b' must differ. So, for each subset S, the sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) must be non-zero.\n\nBut how to arrange 'b' such that this holds for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\nAn alternative Idea: The problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S). So, for each subset S, the difference between sum_b(S) and sum_a(S) must not be zero.\n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_b(S) = sum_a(S) + k, where k ≠ 0.\n\nBut how to achieve this.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to assign each element to 'b' such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from 'a's sum for the same subset.\n\nBut again, how.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of equations. For each subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nEach subset S corresponds to an equation that must be satisfied.\n\nBut the variables are the permutation assignments (each element is assigned to exactly one position), which is a combinatorial problem.\n\nThis seems too complex for n=22.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the differences between 'a' and 'b'.\n\nSuppose we define d_i = b_i - a_i for each i. Then, for each subset S, the sum of d_i for i in S must not be zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation σ and a set of d_i such that d_i = b_σ(i) - a_i, and for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of d_i over S is not zero.\n\nBut how to find such d_i.\n\nWait, but since b is a permutation, the d_i's must satisfy that the sum of all d_i is zero (since b is a permutation of a). So, sum(d_i) = 0.\n\nBut for each non-empty proper subset S, sum_{i in S} d_i ≠ 0.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find a set of d_i's such that:\n\n1. sum(d_i) = 0.\n\n2. For every non-empty proper subset S, sum_{i in S} d_i ≠ 0.\n\nAnd d_i's must correspond to a valid permutation, i.e., for each i, b_i = a_σ(i) for some permutation σ.\n\nWait, but d_i = b_i - a_i, and since σ is a permutation, the multiset of d_i's is exactly the differences between the elements of 'a' in some order.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: can we find a multiset D of differences such that:\n\n- D contains each element exactly once (since it's a permutation).\n\n- sum(D) = 0.\n\n- For every non-empty proper subset S of the indices, the sum of elements in D over S is not zero.\n\nIf such a D exists, then the permutation 'b' can be constructed.\n\nBut how to find such a D.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps for small n, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 22. So, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. For each subset S, we have an equation that sum_{i in S} d_i ≠ 0. So, the vector of d_i's must not lie in the subspace spanned by the characteristic vectors of the subsets S.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a derangement of the elements such that for any subset S, the sum of the deranged elements is different.\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is easier than I think. Let's consider that the sum of any subset in 'b' must differ from the sum in 'a' for the same subset. So, for each subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nWhich can be written as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) ≠ 0.\n\nSo, the sum of the differences for any non-empty proper subset S must not be zero.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation σ such that the multiset {d_i = a_σ(i) - a_i} satisfies:\n\n- sum(d_i) = 0.\n\n- For every non-empty proper subset S, sum_{i in S} d_i ≠ 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find a permutation σ such that the multiset of differences D = {d_i} satisfies these conditions.\n\nNow, how can we find such a permutation.\n\nBut with n up to 22, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the permutation in such a way that the differences d_i are all unique and arranged to avoid any subset sum being zero.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's try to construct 'b' by placing each element in a position such that the difference d_i is as large as possible. This way, the sum of any subset will be less likely to cancel out.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying all possible permutations for small n and checking if they satisfy the condition. But for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be solved by checking if a certain type of permutation, like a cyclic shift, satisfies the condition.\n\nBut without knowing, perhaps the only way is to implement a solution that tries permutations until it finds one that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut with n=22, this is impractical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is always solvable except for certain cases. For example, when n=1, it's trivial. For n=2, any permutation works. What about n=3?\n\nHmm, for n=3, it's possible to find a permutation where each d_i is non-zero and no subset sum is zero.\n\nFor example, let's take a = [1,2,3]. Suppose we permute to [2,3,1]. Then, the differences are d1=1, d2=-1, d3=2. Now, check all subsets:\n\nSubsets of size 1:\n\nd1=1≠0 → ok.\n\nd2=-1≠0 → ok.\n\nd3=2≠0 → ok.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\nd1+d2=0 → which is bad. So this permutation doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so perhaps for n=3, it's not always possible.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input has n=4 and it's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps for some n, it's possible, and for others, not.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output is -1 only if no such permutation exists.\n\nSo, how to determine whether a permutation exists.\n\nBut I'm not making progress on the algorithm.\n\nPerhaps it's time to think about the code structure.\n\nThe code needs to read the input, process it, and output the desired permutation or -1.\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, a brute-force approach is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, the intended solution is to generate a permutation where each element is in a different position than 'a', and then check for all non-empty proper subsets whether their sum in 'b' is different from 'a's.\n\nBut for n=22, even generating all possible permutations is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be solved by checking whether the multiset of subset sums of 'a' is such that for each subset S, there exists a different arrangement of elements in 'b' where the sum for S is different.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by noting that the condition is automatically satisfied if the permutation is such that each element is in a different position than in 'a', and for any two elements, their sum is unique. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is always solvable for n >=2.\n\nBut that's not the case, as seen in the earlier example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is always solvable except for certain cases.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern or a way to construct 'b' that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange 'b' in such a way that for each i, b[i] is a[i] + some unique delta, ensuring that any subset sum cannot be the same as in 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by reversing the array, but with some modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a permutation where for each i, b[i] = a[i] XOR some mask, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by sorting 'a' and then permuting it in a specific way.\n\nBut without knowing, perhaps it's time to try to find a way to construct 'b' in a way that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to assign each element to a position such that the sum for any subset S in 'b' is different from 'a's sum for S.\n\nOne way to ensure this is to make sure that the sum for any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum for S in 'a'. \n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can assign each element in 'b' in a way that for any two elements, their sum is different from any sum in 'a' for the same pair.\n\nBut this is similar to ensuring that for any pair, their sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum.\n\nBut again, for larger subsets, this may not hold.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the correct approach is to try to construct 'b' by swapping adjacent elements and checking if the condition holds.\n\nBut for n=22, this would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following: if the array 'a' is such that all elements are distinct and the multiset of subset sums is unique, then any permutation would work.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider the following. If we can find a permutation where the sum of any subset S in 'b' is different from the same subset in 'a', then the condition is satisfied.\n\nTo achieve this, perhaps the permutation should be such that for any subset S, the sum of elements in 'b' is different from 'a's sum.\n\nSo, perhaps we can try to construct 'b' in a way that for each position i, the element is chosen such that adding it to the permutation doesn't create any conflicting subset sum.\n\nBut implementing this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the solution is to write code that tries to generate a permutation where each element is in a different position than in 'a', and then checks whether the subset sum condition is met.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impossible due to the high number of permutations.\n\nThus, perhaps the intended solution is to find a way to construct 'b' such that the condition is satisfied by ensuring that for each subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum.\n\nBut without further insight, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by using the fact that if the permutation is such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is unique, then it would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for hints or think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by using the following approach:\n\nConstruct 'b' as a permutation where each element is in a different position than in 'a', and for each i, b[i] is as far away from a[i] as possible in terms of the array's order.\n\nFor example, sort 'a' in increasing order and then reverse it, or something like that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is the reversed array, which worked.\n\nBut as earlier example shows, this doesn't always work.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find any permutation where each element is in a different position than in 'a' and for each pair, their sum is different from any pair in 'a'.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to assign each element to a position such that the difference between 'a' and 'b' for each element is unique.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should proceed to write code that tries to find a permutation where each element is in a different position, and then checks for all non-empty proper subsets whether their sum in 'b' is different from 'a's.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nThus, perhaps the intended solution is to realize that the problem can be solved by simply permuting the array such that each element",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices, the sum of elements in the original array and the permuted array are different.
