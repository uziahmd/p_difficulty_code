Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into segments covered by each lantern. But since the lanterns can be placed in any order, perhaps it's better to sort them first. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might cover more, but if they're apart, then their individual radii would need to cover the gaps between them.\n\nWait, right. So the key is to find the minimal d such that when each lantern covers its own range, the entire street is covered. To compute this, perhaps I should consider the maximum of the required d for each pair of consecutive points in the sorted lantern positions.\n\nLet me think: after sorting the lantern positions, for each consecutive pair, the distance between them must be less than or equal to 2d. But also, the first lantern must reach the beginning of the street, and the last must reach the end.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. Check if the first lantern's coverage starts at 0. The starting point is max(0, a_1 -d). For it to cover 0, we need a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1. Or wait, no. Wait, the coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d, but it's clamped to [0, l]. So the first lantern must cover 0, which implies a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1. Similarly, the last lantern must cover l, so a_n +d >= l → d >= l -a_n.\n\nAdditionally, for the middle part between two consecutive lanterns, say a_i and a_{i+1}, the maximum of (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 and the required d for the first and last points should be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0 (which is a_1, because a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1)\n- The distance from the last lantern to l (l - a_n)\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum of (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 and any other constraints.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two lanterns at positions x and y, with x < y. The area between x and y needs to be covered. The lantern x can cover up to x+d, and the lantern y can cover down to y -d. So the gap between them is y -x. We need x+d >= y -d → d >= (y -x)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- After sorting the lanterns, compute the initial required d as the maximum between the first lantern's distance to 0 (a_1) and the last lantern's distance to l (l - a_n).\n- Then, for each consecutive pair, compute the distance between them and divide by 2. The maximum of all these values is also a candidate for d.\n- The overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial required d and the maximum of the consecutive pairs' required d.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns don't cover the entire street even after considering these? Like, if the first lantern is at position 5, and the next is at 10, and d is 2.5. Then the first covers up to 7.5, the second covers down to 7.5, so the street is fully covered. So yes, that logic holds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n2. Compute the initial d as the maximum of a_1 (since a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1) and l - a_n (since a_n +d >= l → d >= l - a_n).\n3. For each i from 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based indexing), compute the distance between a[i+1] and a[i], then add (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 to the possible d candidates.\n4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light the entire street from point 0 to point \\( l \\). Each lantern lights a segment of the street centered at its position with radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lanterns**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Initial Constraints**: Calculate the initial required radius \\( d \\) based on the first and last lanterns. The first lantern must cover from 0, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Consecutive Pairs**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The radius \\( d \\) must be at least half of this distance to ensure the entire gap is covered by both lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value obtained from the initial constraints and the consecutive pairs' constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    # Initial required d\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    first = a[0]\n    last = a[-1]\n    min_d = max(first, l - last)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        dist = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        temp = dist / 2\n        if temp > min_d:\n            min_d = temp\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(min_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently determining the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Check**: The first and last lanterns provide the initial constraints for the minimum radius \\( d \\).\n3. **Gaps Between Lanterns**: Each gap between consecutive lanterns requires \\( d \\) to be at least half the gap's length to ensure full coverage.\n4. **Maximum Calculation**: The final minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the initial constraints and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the entire street is illuminated.",
