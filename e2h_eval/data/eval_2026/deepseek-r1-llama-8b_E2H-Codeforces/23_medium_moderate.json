In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s', '2m', etc. So, I'll probably represent each tile as a tuple of (number, suit), which I can convert into integers for easier handling.\n\nSo, step one: parse the input into three tiles. Then, for each possible way of adding tiles (from any of the four suits, but considering only the existing suit for sequences), I need to check if after adding some number of tiles, she has a mentsu.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she can draw any tiles, including those she already has. So, for example, if she already has a triplet, she doesn't need to draw anything.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each possible way to add 0, 1, 2, or more tiles, check if the combined set forms at least one mentsu. We need to find the minimal number of draws required across all possibilities.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might be computationally intensive. However, since the maximum number of tiles she can have after drawing is 3 + t, where t is the number of draws, but t can be up to some small number because beyond a certain point, it's guaranteed that she can form a mentsu.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum number of tiles she could have before forming a mentsu? Let's think: the worst case is when she has three tiles, none of which form a mentsu. For example, like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, she needs to add two tiles: 4p and 5p would make a sequence, but wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible target mentsu, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to complete it from her current hand.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu) that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added ones.\n\n2. For each such possible mentsu, determine how many tiles she needs to add to form it.\n\n3. Find the minimal number across all possible mentsu.\n\nBut since the possible options are vast, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), see if the current tiles can contribute to it, and calculate how many more tiles are needed.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence):\n\n   a. Check how many of its required tiles are already present in the hand.\n\n   b. The remaining required tiles are the ones she needs to draw.\n\n   c. The minimal number across all mentsu is the answer.\n\nBut wait, she can have multiple mentsu, but as long as one exists, it's sufficient. So for each possible mentsu, compute the required number of tiles, and then take the minimum.\n\nSo, first, generate all possible mentsu. That is, generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nTriplet (koutsu): For each suit, for each number from 1 to 9, the triplet is (n, s), (n, s), (n, s). So, for each suit, there are 9 possible triplets.\n\nSequence (shuntsu): For each suit, for each starting number from 1 to 7, the sequence is n, n+1, n+2. So, for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences.\n\nSo total mentsu count is 9 (triplets) *3 (suits) + 7*3 = 36 possible mentsu.\n\nThat's manageable.\n\nSo, for each of these 36 mentsu, I can check how many tiles are missing from the current hand, and then compute the minimal required.\n\nBut wait, the current hand is three tiles. For a given mentsu, how many of its three tiles are present in the hand?\n\nFor example, if the mentsu is [1m, 2m, 3m], and the current hand has 2m, then she needs to add 1m and 3m, so two tiles. But wait, she can also add just 3m, but that wouldn't form a shuntsu unless she has 1m, 2m, 3m. Hmm, no, because she needs exactly three tiles.\n\nWait, no. She can have any number of tiles beyond three, but the mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So, for a given mentsu, the number of required tiles is 3 minus the count of overlapping tiles between the current hand and the mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the current hand may have duplicates. For example, if the current hand has two 1m's, and the mentsu is triplet 1m, then the count is 2, so she needs 1 more.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, the required tiles are 3 minus the count of how many tiles in the current hand match the mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the mentsu is a specific set of three tiles. For example, triplet 1m requires three 1m tiles. If the current hand has two 1m and one 2m, then for the triplet 1m, she needs one more 1m.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (each triplet and sequence):\n\n   Count how many tiles in the current hand match the mentsu.\n\n   Required = 3 - count.\n\n   Keep track of the minimal required value across all mentsu.\n\nThe minimal required is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait—this isn't correct. Because the current hand is three tiles, and the mentsu is three tiles. So, for a triplet, the count is how many times the same tile appears in the current hand. For a sequence, it's how many of the three required tiles are present, regardless of order.\n\nFor example, for a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m], if the current hand is [1m,2m,4m], then the count is 2, so required is 1 (needs 3m).\n\nIf the current hand is [1m,1m,2m], then for the triplet 1m, the count is 2, so required is 1.\n\nBut what if the current hand is [1m,1m,1m]? Then, for the triplet 1m, required is 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input into three tiles. For each tile, split into number and suit, and store as tuples (num, suit). Maybe as integers, like (1, 'm') becomes (1, 0), but perhaps better to keep as strings for easy comparison.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the suit as a single character (like 'm', 'p', 's'), and the number as an integer.\n\nSo, for each input string, extract the number (as int) and the suit.\n\nSo, for each of the three tiles, we'll have (number, suit). Let's call them tiles = [t1, t2, t3], where each t is a tuple (n, s).\n\n2. For each possible mentsu:\n\n   a. If it's a triplet (koutsu):\n\n      - For each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n         - For each number from 1 to 9:\n\n             - Create the triplet as [(n, s)] *3.\n\n   b. If it's a sequence (shuntsu):\n\n      - For each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n         - For each start number from 1 to 7:\n\n             - Create the sequence as [(start, s), (start+1, s), (start+2, s)].\n\n3. For each mentsu, count how many of its tiles are present in the current tiles.\n\n   For triplet, it's the count of occurrences of (n, s) in the current tiles.\n\n   For sequence, it's the count of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present in the current tiles.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the mentsu is three specific tiles, and the current tiles may have some of them.\n\n   For a triplet, the count is the number of tiles in the current hand that are equal to each of the triplet's tiles. Since the triplet has three identical tiles, the count is the number of occurrences in the current hand of that tile.\n\n   For a sequence, the count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the current hand. So, for example, if the sequence is 1m,2m,3m, and current hand has 1m and 3m, then count is 2.\n\n   So, for each mentsu, the count is the sum over each tile in the mentsu whether that tile is present in the current hand.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the mentsu consists of three specific tiles. For a triplet, all three must be the same. So, the count is how many of the triplet's tiles are in the current hand.\n\n   For a sequence, the count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the current hand.\n\n   So, for each mentsu:\n\n   count = 0\n\n   for tile in mentsu:\n\n       if tile in current tiles:\n\n           count +=1\n\n   required = 3 - count\n\n   if required < 0:\n\n       required = 0\n\n   Because you can't have negative required.\n\n   So, for each mentsu, compute required, and track the minimal required.\n\n4. The minimal required across all mentsu is the answer.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Because the current hand has three tiles, and the mentsu is three tiles. So, for example, if the current hand has two of the mentsu's tiles, then required is 1.\n\nBut what about if the current hand has more than three tiles after adding? No, because in our problem, she starts with three and can add any number of tiles. So, for each possible mentsu, the required is 3 minus the number of tiles she already has matching the mentsu.\n\nSo, the minimal required is the smallest number of tiles she needs to add to form at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, but what about cases where she can form multiple mentsu with fewer tiles? Like, if she adds two tiles, she can form two different mentsu. But since the problem asks for at least one, it's sufficient to find the minimal required for any mentsu.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, parse the input into three tiles. Each tile is represented as (n, s), where n is the number, s is the suit (as a string, 'm', 'p', 's').\n\nThen, for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute the required tiles.\n\nSo, let's list all possible mentsu:\n\nFor triplets:\n\nEach triplet is three identical tiles of the same number and suit. So, for each suit, 9 triplets.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nEach sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for each suit, 7 sequences (starting at 1,2,...,7).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nGenerate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nFor each, compute the required tiles.\n\nFind the minimal required.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\ntiles = []\nfor each of the three input strings:\n    num = int(first character)\n    suit = second character\n    tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n\nmin_draws = infinity\n\n# Generate all possible mentsu\nfor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    # Generate triplets\n    for num in 1..9:\n        triplet = [ (num, suit) ] *3\n        count = 0\n        for t in triplet:\n            if t in tiles:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\n    # Generate sequences\n    for start in 1..7:\n        seq = [ (start, suit), (start+1, suit), (start+2, suit) ]\n        count = 0\n        for t in seq:\n            if t in tiles:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\nAfter checking all 36 mentsu, the min_draws will be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait: for a triplet, the count is the number of tiles in the current hand that match each of the triplet's three tiles. So, for example, if the triplet is 1m,1m,1m, and the current hand has two 1m tiles, then the count is 2. So required is 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence, the count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the current hand.\n\nSo, for example, current hand is [1m,2m,3m], then for the sequence 1m,2m,3m, count is 3, required is 0.\n\nAnother example: current hand is [1m,1m,2m]. For the triplet 1m, count is 2 (since two 1m tiles are present). For the sequence 1m,2m,3m, count is 2 (has 1m and 2m). So required for triplet is 1, required for sequence is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal required would be 0 in cases where she already has a mentsu.\n\nSo, this approach should work.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe can represent the tiles as a list of tuples. For each triplet and sequence, we can generate their three tiles and count how many are present in the current tiles.\n\nBut wait, in Python, checking if a tuple is in a list is O(n), but since n is 3, it's manageable. Alternatively, we can create a set of the tiles for faster lookups.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to convert the tiles into a set for O(1) lookups.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead the three input strings.\n\nParse each into (num, suit).\n\nStore as a list, and also as a set.\n\nThen, for each possible mentsu:\n\nCompute the required tiles.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ntiles_list = []\nfor s in sys.stdin.readline().split():\n    num = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    tiles_list.append( (num, suit) )\ntiles_set = set(tiles_list)\n\nmin_draws = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    # Triplets\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        triplet = [ (num, suit) ] *3\n        count = 0\n        for t in triplet:\n            if t in tiles_set:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n    # Sequences\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        seq = [ (start, suit), (start+1, suit), (start+2, suit) ]\n        count = 0\n        for t in seq:\n            if t in tiles_set:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\nprint(min_draws)\n\nWait, but wait—what about the possibility of having multiple mentsu that require the same number of draws? It's okay because we're taking the minimal.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nParsing:\n\ntiles_list = [ (1,'s'), (2,'s'), (3,'s'), (9,'m'), (9,'m'), (9,'m'), (3,'p'), (9,'m'), (2,'p') ]\n\ntiles_set contains all these.\n\nFor each mentsu:\n\nLooking at the first example, the user has a shuntsu 1s,2s,3s. So for the triplet 1s, the count is 0 (since no 1s in the hand except for the initial three, which are 1s, 2s, 3s—no, wait, the first input is '1s 2s 3s', so in tiles_list, yes, they have all three. So, for the triplet 1s, the count is zero. So required is 3.\n\nWait, no—wait, the triplet is three 1s. The current hand has 1s, 2s, 3s. So, for the triplet 1s, the count is 1 (only one 1s tile). So required is 2.\n\nWait, but the triplet is three 1s. So, in the current hand, there's only one 1s tile. So, required is 3-1=2. But for the shuntsu 1s,2s,3s, the count is 3, so required is 0.\n\nSo, in the first test case, the minimal is 0.\n\nIn the second example, the second input is '9m 9m 9m'—so she has a triplet already. So, for triplet 9m, count is 3, required is 0.\n\nIn the third example, the third input is '3p 9m 2p'. So, the current tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nShe needs to form a shuntsu. For example, 2p,3p,4p. She has 2p and 3p, so count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nOr 9m, 10m (but 10 is invalid), no. Wait, 9m can't form a shuntsu beyond that. So, perhaps another shuntsu.\n\nWait, in the third input, the tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nSo, looking for shuntsu in p suit:\n\nStart at 2: 2p,3p,4p. She has 2p and 3p. So, count is 2. Required is 1.\n\nStart at 1: 1p,2p,3p. She has 2p and 3p. Count 2. Required 1.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly finds 0,0,1 for the outputs.\n\nWait, but the output in the note is [0, 0, 1], meaning for each of the three inputs, what is the minimal draws.\n\nWait, wait, wait! Oh right, the input is three separate lines, each representing a player's hand. So, the code needs to process each of the three hands separately.\n\nWait, no! Wait, the problem statement says: \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" So, each of the three strings is a hand, and for each hand, we need to compute the minimal draws.\n\nSo, the code needs to read three strings, each representing a hand, and for each hand, compute the minimal draws, then output three numbers, each for each hand.\n\nOh! So, my previous code is incorrect because it treats all three hands together, but actually, each hand is separate.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nRead three lines, each line is a hand of three tiles.\n\nFor each hand, compute the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nThen, output the three minimal numbers, space-separated.\n\nSo, the code structure should be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_min_draws(hand):\n    # ... previous logic ...\n\nhand1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhand2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhand3 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nmin1 = compute_min_draws(hand1)\nmin2 = compute_min_draws(hand2)\nmin3 = compute_min_draws(hand3)\n\nprint(f\"{min1} {min2} {min3}\")\n\nSo, the function compute_min_draws takes a hand (a string like '1s 2s 3s') and returns the minimal draws needed for that hand.\n\nSo, the helper function:\n\ndef compute_min_draws(hand_str):\n    tiles = []\n    for s in hand_str.split():\n        num = int(s[0])\n        suit = s[1]\n        tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n    tiles_set = set(tiles)\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    # Generate all possible mentsu\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        # Triplets\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            triplet = [ (num, suit) ] *3\n            count = 0\n            for t in triplet:\n                if t in tiles_set:\n                    count +=1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n        # Sequences\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [ (start, suit), (start+1, suit), (start+2, suit) ]\n            count = 0\n            for t in seq:\n                if t in tiles_set:\n                    count +=1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n    return min_draws\n\nSo, now, for each of the three hands, we compute the minimal draws, and print them.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nFor the first hand, '1s 2s 3s':\n\ntiles are (1,s), (2,s), (3,s).\n\nFor the triplet 1s, count is 1, required is 2.\n\nFor the shuntsu 1s,2s,3s: count is 3, required 0. So min_draws is 0.\n\nSecond hand: '9m 9m 9m'—triplet 9m, count 3, required 0.\n\nThird hand: '3p 9m 2p'.\n\ntiles are (3,p), (9,m), (2,p).\n\nLooking for shuntsu in p: possible sequences are 1p,2p,3p; 2p,3p,4p; etc.\n\nFor 2p,3p,4p: in the hand, 2p and 3p are present. So count is 2, required 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 1p,2p,3p: 2p and 3p are present. Count is 2, required 1.\n\nOther sequences may not be possible. So minimal is 1.\n\nSo, output is 0 0 1.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all three tiles are the same: '1m 1m 1m'—so for triplet 1m, count is 3, required 0.\n\nAnother case: '1m 2m 4m'—what's the minimal draws?\n\nPossible options:\n\nTriplet: any triplet would require 2 draws (for 1m, 2m,4m, none can form a triplet with current tiles).\n\nShuntsu: for 1m,2m,3m: count is 2, required 1.\n\nSimilarly, 4m,5m,6m: count is 1, required 2.\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: '1m 1m 2m'—can form a triplet by adding one more 1m. Or, a sequence 1m,2m,3m: count is 2, required 1.\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: '1m 3m 5m'—no triplet possible. Shuntsu options: 1,2,3; 3,4,5. She has 1m and 3m for 1m-2m-3m (count 2). She has 3m and 5m for 3m-4m-5m (count 2). So, required 1 for both. So minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but what about adding 2m and 4m? That would form two sequences, but she only needs one.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 1.\n\nAnother case: '1m 2m 3m'—already a shuntsu, so required 0.\n\nWhat about '1m 1m 2m'? For triplet 1m: count is 2, required 1. For sequence 1m,2m,3m: count is 2, required 1. So minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code handles all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about performance.\n\nEach hand is processed independently, and for each, 36 mentsu are considered. Since 36 is a small number, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). A mentsu is formed by three identical tiles (triplet) or three consecutive numbers in the same suit (sequence).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input:** Read the input which consists of three strings, each representing a tile.\n2. **Generate Mentsu:** For each possible mentsu (both triplets and sequences), check how many tiles from the current hand are already part of the mentsu.\n3. **Calculate Required Tiles:** For each mentsu, compute the number of additional tiles needed to complete it.\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws:** Track the minimum number of draws required across all possible mentsu for each hand.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_draws(hand_str):\n    tiles = []\n    for s in hand_str.split():\n        num = int(s[0])\n        suit = s[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    tiles_set = set(tiles)\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    \n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        # Check all possible triplets\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            triplet = [(num, suit)] * 3\n            count = 0\n            for t in triplet:\n                if t in tiles_set:\n                    count += 1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n        \n        # Check all possible sequences\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [(start, suit), (start + 1, suit), (start + 2, suit)]\n            count = 0\n            for t in seq:\n                if t in tiles_set:\n                    count += 1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < min_draws:\n                min_draws = required\n    \n    return min_draws\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\nhand1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhand2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhand3 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nmin1 = compute_min_draws(hand1)\nmin2 = compute_min_draws(hand2)\nmin3 = compute_min_draws(hand3)\n\nprint(f\"{min1} {min2} {min3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Parsing Input:** Each input string is split into individual tiles, which are stored as tuples of integers and characters.\n- **Generating Mentsu:** We consider all possible triplets and sequences for each suit. A triplet consists of three identical tiles, while a sequence consists of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n- **Counting Tiles:** For each mentsu, we count how many of its tiles are present in the current hand. The required number of additional tiles is calculated as 3 minus this count.\n- **Finding Minimum Draws:** We track the minimum number of draws required across all possible mentsu for each hand and print the results for the three hands.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures we find the minimum number of draws needed for each hand.",
