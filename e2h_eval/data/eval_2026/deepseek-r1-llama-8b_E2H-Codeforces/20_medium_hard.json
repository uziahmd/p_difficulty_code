For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let's break down what a beautiful multiset is. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. And we need to choose the c_s's such that when you build the largest possible beautiful multiset, its size is exactly f.\n\nWait, no— wait. The problem says that for each s, the count of s's prefixes in the multiset must not exceed c_s. So the beautiful multiset is determined by these c_s values. Our goal is to choose the c_s's such that the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, for a given set of c_s's, the maximum size is f. We need to count how many such sets of c_s's exist.\n\nFirst, let's think about what determines the maximum size. For each string s, the maximum number of times its extensions can appear in the multiset depends on the c_t for all t that are prefixes of s.\n\nWait, maybe we should model this as a tree structure. Each node is a string, and its children are the longer strings that start with it. Then, for each node s, the number of times it appears in the multiset is constrained by c_s. But also, any longer strings that extend s will contribute to the count for s.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented in terms of the subtree rooted at each node. The maximum possible number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree of s is limited by c_s. Because each occurrence of a child of s would add to the count of s as a prefix.\n\nSo, for each node s, the sum over all its children t of the counts of t in the multiset must be ≤ c_s. Because each occurrence of t contributes to the count of s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset can include any binary strings of length up to n. So, for each string s, the count of s in the multiset is variable. But for the constraints, for each s, the sum of the counts of all s' that are proper prefixes of s must be ≤ c_s. Because each s' is a prefix of s, so each occurrence of s' adds to the count for s.\n\nWait, no: for each s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as their prefix is the sum of the counts of s itself plus the counts of all its proper superstrings (like s followed by 0 or 1). Or wait, no: the count is the sum of the counts of all strings that start with s. So for s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of s, plus the counts of all s0, s1, s00, s01, etc., up to length n.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the constraint is that the sum of the counts of all t where s is a prefix of t (including t = s) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the multiset's maximum size is f, the sum of all counts across all t must equal f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each s, and then the maximum possible sum of counts for all t is f.\n\nWait, but the way the constraints are set, each c_s must be ≥ the sum of the counts of all t that are proper supersets of s. Because for each t that is a proper superset of s, s is a prefix of t, so the count of t contributes to the count for s.\n\nThis seems similar to a tree where each node's value must be at least the sum of its children.\n\nHmm. So, for each string s, the count of s (let's denote it as x_s) can be as large as possible, but subject to the constraints:\n\nx_s ≤ c_s\n\nand for each proper superset t of s (t is longer than s and starts with s), x_t must be ≤ c_{prefix of t}?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for t being a proper superset of s, the count x_t contributes to the sum for s. So, for s, sum_{t is a superset of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nBut in terms of the hierarchy, each s has parents which are its prefixes. So for s, the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for s, the sum includes all t where s is a prefix of t, including t = s. So, for each s, sum_{t is a superset of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nBut for t being a proper superset, x_t is added to s's sum, and also for any s' that is a proper subset of t, like s itself.\n\nSo, the constraints form a tree-like structure where each node's c_s must be at least the sum of x_t for all t in its subtree.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model this as a tree and find the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming, considering the strings in order of increasing length.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each string s, the maximum allowed x_s is c_s, but also, for all its ancestors (prefixes), their c values must be sufficient to accommodate the x values of their descendants.\n\nWait, but the c values are fixed once chosen. So, for each s, the x_s can be up to c_s, but also, for each proper superset t of s, x_t contributes to s's sum.\n\nWait, no: for s, the sum includes all x_t where t is a superset of s (including s itself). So, for s, sum_{t is superset of s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nWhich implies that x_s ≤ c_s.\n\nSimilarly, for any proper superset t of s, x_t ≤ c_t.\n\nBut since t is a superset, s is a proper subset of t. So, for s, the sum includes x_t. So, for s, the sum is x_s + x_{s0} + x_{s1} + ... ≤ c_s.\n\nBut x_{s0} and x_{s1} are part of the sum for s.\n\nWait, but for s, the sum is x_s plus the sum of x_t for all t that are longer and start with s. So, the sum is x_s plus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWhich means that for s, the sum is x_s plus the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s (excluding s itself).\n\nSo, for s, the constraint is:\n\nx_s + sum_{t in subtree of s, t != s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nBut this seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the maximum possible x_s is c_s minus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s. But since x_t depends on the same condition, it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this using inclusion-exclusion. The maximum possible x_s is c_s minus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into determining for each s whether the sum of certain variables exceeds some limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Möbius function in a poset. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is f. So, the sum of x_s for all s must be f. But each x_s is constrained by the c_s and the constraints from their supersets.\n\nWait, but the sum of x_s is f. So, the sum over all s of x_s equals f.\n\nEach x_s is bounded by c_s and the constraints from the sum of its supersets.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this using inclusion-exclusion and Möbius inversion.\n\nWait, suppose that for each s, the sum of x_t for t in the closure of s (all supersets) is <= c_s.\n\nThen, the maximum possible f is the sum of x_s, subject to these constraints.\n\nWait, but each x_s contributes to all of its subsets (proper subsets). So, for each s, the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of inequalities, where for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nAnd the sum of all x_t is f.\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to assign x_t (non-negative integers) satisfying these constraints, and then multiply by the number of ways to assign c_s's that allow this assignment.\n\nWait, but no: the c_s's are given, and the x_t's are variables subject to the constraints based on c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as for each s, the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s (including s) must be <= c_s.\n\nThe sum of x_t for all s is f.\n\nSo, our problem is to find the number of ways to assign c_s's such that the maximum possible f (sum of x_t's) is exactly f.\n\nWait, but no: for a given set of c_s's, the maximum f is determined by the maximum possible sum of x_t's, which is the maximum f achievable under the constraints.\n\nSo, the question is to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, how do we compute this?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each possible subset of s's, we can determine whether it's possible for the sum to reach f, and then count accordingly.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of subsets is 2^15=32768, which is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to represent the problem as a product of independent choices for each node in a trie, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the constraints form a hierarchical structure because each s is a prefix of its supersets. So, perhaps the problem can be broken down by considering each string in order of decreasing length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a DP, where for each string s, we track the minimum required c_s.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the minimal c_s's needed to achieve a certain f. Then, for each possible f, compute the number of ways to assign c_s's that are at least the minimal required, and subtract those that require more than f.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal c_s's. For a given f, what is the minimal possible c_s for each s? Or perhaps, what is the minimal sum that can be achieved given certain c_s's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the minimal c_s is the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s. But x_t's are variables.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal c_s for each s is determined by the number of times s can appear in the multiset, considering all the constraints from above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal c_s for each s is the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Since each x_t contributes to all of its subsets, the constraints form a tree-like structure where each node's c_s must be at least the sum of x_t for all its descendants.\n\nWait, so for each s, c_s must be >= sum_{t is in the subtree of s} x_t.\n\nBut the sum of all x_t is f.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: count the number of ways to assign c_s's such that for all s, c_s >= sum_{t in subtree of s} x_t, and sum x_t = f.\n\nBut x_t's are non-negative integers.\n\nWait, but the c_s's are given as part of the input. No, wait: the c_s's are variables we're trying to assign, and for each assignment, the maximum sum f is computed, and we need to count the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nWait, no: the c_s's are chosen, and then the maximum f is determined. We need to count the number of c_s's for which the maximum f is exactly f_target.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of c_s's such that the maximum possible sum of x_t's is exactly f.\n\nEach x_t can be up to c_t, but also, for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent this as a linear programming problem, but for integers.\n\nWait, but for n=15, that's a lot of variables (the number of binary strings up to length n is 2^n - 1, which is 32767 when n=15). That's way too big for standard methods.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again.\n\nEach c_s must be at least the sum of x_t for all t in the subtree of s.\n\nBut x_t is the count for t, which is a binary string.\n\nSo, the sum for s is x_s + x_{s0} + x_{s1} + ... (all t that are proper supersets of s).\n\nSo, for each s, c_s >= x_s + sum_{t is proper superset of s} x_t.\n\nBut x_s can be up to c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum for s is x_s plus the sum of x_t for t in its subtree.\n\nSo, for s, the sum is the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nIncluding s itself.\n\nSo, the constraints can be written as:\n\nsum_{t is a superset of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nAnd sum_{t} x_t = f.\n\nOur goal is to count the number of c assignments where the maximum f is exactly f_target.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother idea: for each s, the maximum possible x_s is c_s, but also, the sum for s's parent must include x_s.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps, instead of thinking about all s, we can model this with inclusion-exclusion, considering the dependencies between the c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required c_s's can be determined by considering the sum of x_t's in their subtrees.\n\nWait, for example, the root node (empty prefix) has sum x_t for all t, which is f. So, c_root must be >= f.\n\nFor each node s, c_s must be >= the sum of x_t's in its subtree.\n\nBut since the sum of x_t's in the subtree of s is f minus the sum of x_t's in the subtrees of the other nodes, perhaps it's possible to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a tree where each node contributes a certain amount to the constraints of its ancestors.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing a clear way forward here.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern or try small examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nWhat are the possible c_0 assignments?\n\nSince n=1, the only strings are \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nWait, no, n=1: the strings are of length 1. So s can be \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nWait, for n=1, the multiset can include \"0\", \"1\", or both.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\nFor s=\"0\": the number of strings in the multiset that have \"0\" as a prefix is the count of \"0\" plus the count of \"00\", \"01\", etc. But wait, n=1, so the only strings are \"0\" and \"1\". So, for s=\"0\", the sum is x_0.\n\nFor s=\"1\", the sum is x_1.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nx_0 <= c_0\n\nx_1 <= c_1\n\nSum x_0 + x_1 = f.\n\nIn the sample, f=2.\n\nWe need to find the number of c_0 and c_1 assignments such that the maximum possible sum x_0 + x_1 is exactly 2.\n\nSo, for each possible c_0 and c_1, we calculate the maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, but the sum is exactly x_0 + x_1, which is f.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum is f.\n\nSo, the condition is that the maximum sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, for the first sample, n=1, the possible c_0 and c_1 assignments are such that x_0 + x_1 = 2.\n\nBut x_0 <= c_0 and x_1 <= c_1.\n\nSo, what are the possible c_0 and c_1 values?\n\nThe sample says there are three possibilities.\n\nLooking at the note, the three cases are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2: Then x_0 can be 0, x_1 can be 2. Sum is 2.\n\n2. c_0=1, c_1=1: x_0 can be 1, x_1 can be 1. Sum is 2.\n\n3. c_0=2, c_1=0: x_0 can be 2, x_1 can be 0. Sum is 2.\n\nSo, the c_0 can be 0,1,2, but not all combinations are allowed.\n\nWait, in case c_0=0 and c_1=1: then x_0 can be 0, x_1 can be 1. Sum is 1 < 2. So, that wouldn't be counted.\n\nSo, the condition is that the maximum possible sum is exactly 2. So, the sum must be 2, and the constraints must allow it.\n\nSo, the number of c assignments is the number of (c_0, c_1) pairs where c_0 >= a, c_1 >= b, and a + b = 2.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the problem as finding the number of c assignments where the maximum possible sum is f, which is the sum of x_s's.\n\nSo, for a given c assignment, the maximum sum is the maximum possible sum of x_s's that satisfies the constraints.\n\nWe need to count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each c assignment, the maximum sum is f. So, the sum of x_s's is exactly f, and the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut the x_s's are non-negative integers, and for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} x_t <= c_s.\n\nWait, but how do we model this for all s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum f is determined by the sum of the c_s's minus some overlapping terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the c_s's is greater than or equal to f, and the difference between the sum of c_s's and f is the sum of the overlaps.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: the sum of x_s's is f, which is the sum of all the x_s's. Each x_s is the count of the string s in the multiset.\n\nEach x_s contributes to all of its subsets.\n\nSo, for each s, the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nsum_{t in subtree(s)} x_t <= c_s for all s.\n\nsum x_t = f.\n\nWe need to count the number of c assignments where the maximum possible f is exactly f_target.\n\nSo, for each c assignment, the maximum f is the maximum sum of x_t's that satisfies the constraints.\n\nSo, for a given c assignment, the maximum possible f is the maximum sum of x_t's, which is the sum of c_s's minus the overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the constraints in terms of the Möbius function on the inclusion lattice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each c assignment, the maximum f is the sum of c_s's minus the sum over all s of the number of s's proper supersets multiplied by something.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAnother idea: The constraints can be rewritten as:\n\nc_s >= sum_{t in subtree(s)} x_t.\n\nBut the sum of x_t's is f.\n\nSo, sum_{t} x_t = f.\n\nThus, for each s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} x_t <= c_s.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as sum_{t in subtree(s)} x_t <= c_s.\n\nBut the sum of x_t's is f, which is the sum of x_s plus x_{s0} + x_{s1} + ... \n\nSo, for s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} x_t is equal to x_s plus sum_{t in subtree(s0)} x_t, assuming s0 is one of the children.\n\nWait, perhaps this suggests that the constraints can be represented as a system where each c_s is the sum of x_t's in its subtree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible f is equal to the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the c_s's for the proper supersets.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum f is equal to the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the c_{t} for t in the closure of s.\n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the constraints as a directed acyclic graph, where each node s has edges to its proper supersets. Then, the constraints form a dependency chain.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nPerhaps I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, the problem is to count the number of c assignments where the maximum possible f is exactly f_target.\n\nEach c_s can be anything between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to:\n\nCompute the number of c assignments in [0, k]^m (where m is the number of binary strings of length 1..n) such that the maximum sum of x_s's under the constraints is exactly f.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for a given c assignment, the maximum possible f is the sum over s of min(c_s, sum_{t in subtree(s)} c_t).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum f is the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the constraints from the supersets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum f is the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the c_t's for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, that might make sense.\n\nBecause for each s, the sum of x_t's in its subtree is bounded by c_s, but x_t's for t in the subtree of s also have their own constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum f is equal to the sum of c_s for all s, minus the sum of c_t for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1, so the strings are \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nSo, m=2.\n\nThe maximum f is 2.\n\nIn the sample, the correct c assignments are:\n\nCase 1: c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nSum c_0 + c_1 = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nIn this case, according to the hypothesis, f = 2.\n\nYes.\n\nCase 2: c_0=1, c_1=1.\n\nSum is 2.\n\nf=2.\n\nYes.\n\nCase 3: c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\nSum is 2.\n\nf=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in this case, the hypothesis holds.\n\nAnother test: suppose n=2.\n\nSuppose c_00=1, c_01=2, c_10=2, c_11=3.\n\nIn the example, the sum of c_s's is 1+2+2+3=8.\n\nBut the maximum f is 4 (since the beautiful multiset has 4 strings). Hmm, but 8- (c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11 - sum of c_t's for t that are supersets of s).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nf_max = sum_{s} c_s - sum_{s} (sum_{t is a proper superset of s} c_t).\n\nSo, for each s, we subtract the sum of c_t for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nIn the sample where n=2:\n\nsum c_s is 1+2+2+3=8.\n\nsum of c_t for proper supersets of s:\n\nFor s=00, no proper supersets except 00 itself.\n\nFor s=01, proper supersets are 01 (no), so nothing.\n\nWait, no: for s=00, the proper supersets are 000, 001, etc., but in n=2, the maximum is 2, so the proper supersets would be beyond n. So, for n=2, the only proper supersets for s are those of length 2.\n\nWait, perhaps this line of thought isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the maximum f is equal to the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the c_t's for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, let's try this.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nsum c_s = 1+2+2+3 = 8.\n\nsum c_t for proper supersets of s:\n\nFor s=00: no proper supersets within n=2.\n\ns=01: no proper supersets within n=2.\n\ns=10: same.\n\ns=11: same.\n\nSo, the sum of c_t's for proper supersets is zero.\n\nSo, f_max = 8 - 0 = 8.\n\nBut in the sample, the f_max was 4.\n\nSo, this doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, so this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the maximum f is the sum of the c_s's minus the sum of the c_t's for t that are proper subsets of s.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nsum c_s is 8.\n\nsum c_t for t proper subsets of s:\n\nFor s=00: t can be none, since it's the root.\n\ns=01: t is 0 and 00 (if they exist). But in the example, 0 is a prefix of 01.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, sum the c_t for all t that are proper subsets of s.\n\nIn the example:\n\nFor s=00: no proper subsets except empty string, which is not considered.\n\nSo sum is zero.\n\ns=01: t=0 and 00 (but 00 is not a subset of 01). Wait, no: 00 is not a prefix of 01. So, the proper subsets of 01 are 0 and 00? No, because 00 is '00' and 01 is '01'; 00 is a prefix of 01 only if it's the same as 01's beginning, which it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the proper subsets are those that are prefixes of s.\n\nSo, for s=01, the proper subsets (in terms of being prefixes) are 0 and 00?\n\nWait, no: the prefixes of 01 are 0, 0 followed by 0, 0 followed by 1, which is 01.\n\nSo, the proper prefixes (excluding s itself) are 0 and 00.\n\nBut 00 is not a prefix of 01.\n\nWait, no: 00 is a binary string of length 2, same as 01. Is 00 a prefix of 01? No, because 00 starts with '0', and 01 starts with '0' as well. But the second character differs. So 00 is not a prefix of 01.\n\nSo, for s=01, the proper prefixes are 0 only.\n\nSo, for each s, the sum is the sum of c_t for t being a proper prefix of s.\n\nSo, for s=00: no proper prefixes except empty string.\n\ns=01: sum of c_t for t being proper prefixes, which is c_0.\n\ns=10: same as 01, sum is c_1.\n\ns=11: sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nSo, in the example:\n\nsum c_t for proper prefixes of s:\n\ns=00: 0.\n\ns=01: c_0 =1.\n\ns=10: c_1=1.\n\ns=11: c_0 + c_1 = 1+1=2.\n\nTotal sum is 0 +1 +1 +2=4.\n\nSo, f_max = sum c_s (8) - sum c_t for proper supersets of s (which was 0) plus sum c_t for proper subsets of s (4). Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum f is equal to sum c_s minus sum over s of the sum of c_t for t being proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, in the sample, sum c_s is 8.\n\nsum over s of sum of c_t for t being proper supersets of s.\n\nFor s=00: no proper supersets within n=2.\n\ns=01: no proper supersets within n=2.\n\ns=10: same.\n\ns=11: no proper supersets within n=2.\n\nSo sum is 0.\n\nSo, f_max would be 8 - 0 =8, which contradicts the sample where f_max was 4.\n\nSo this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAnother Idea: For each s, the maximum x_s can be up to c_s, but also, the x_s cannot exceed the sum of the c_t for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, because the x_s is part of the sum for all its ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum x_s is min(c_s, sum_{t in proper supersets of s} c_t).\n\nBecause, for s, the sum of x_t in its subtree is x_s + x_{s0} + x_{s1} + ... which must be <= c_s. But each x_t for t in the subtree of s must also satisfy their own constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum x_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the maxima x_t for t in the proper supersets of s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum x_s is c_s, but this can't be more than the sum of the x_t's for t in the proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, but this seems circular.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum of x_t's is f, and each x_t contributes to the sum of all its subsets, perhaps the maximum f is equal to the sum of c_s's minus the sum of c_t's for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nsum c_s =1+2+2+3=8.\n\nsum c_t for t proper supersets of s.\n\nFor each s, sum of c_t for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nIn the sample, for s=00, the proper supersets are 000, 001, etc., but within n=2, there are no proper supersets of s=00.\n\nSo, sum is 0.\n\ns=01: same, no proper supersets.\n\ns=10: same.\n\ns=11: same, no proper supersets.\n\nSo, total sum is 0.\n\nSo, f_max =8-0=8, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum f is the sum of c_s's minus the sum of the c_t's for t that are proper subsets of s.\n\nIn the sample, sum c_s=8.\n\nsum c_t for t proper subsets of s:\n\ns=00: no proper subsets (assuming we ignore the empty string).\n\ns=01: t=00 (no) and t=0.\n\nWait, t=0 is a proper subset of 01.\n\nSo, c_t for t=0 is 1.\n\ns=10: same, c_t for t=0 is 1.\n\ns=11: t=00 (no), t=01 (no), t=10 (no), t=0 and t=1.\n\nSo, c_t for t=0 is 1, t=1 is 1.\n\nSo, sum for s=11 is 1+1=2.\n\nSo, overall sum is 0 (s=00) +1 (s=01) +1 (s=10) +2 (s=11) =4.\n\nSo, f_max=8-4=4, which matches the sample.\n\nAh! So, this seems promising.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nf_max = sum_{s} c_s - sum_{s} sum_{t is a proper subset of s} c_t.\n\nBecause each c_t is included in the sum for all s that have t as a proper subset.\n\nSo, the maximum f is equal to the sum of all c_s's minus the sum of all c_t's for t being proper subsets of s.\n\nWait, this makes sense because for each t, c_t is added to the sum for all s that are proper supersets of t. So, when we compute sum c_s for all s, each c_t is counted multiple times: once for each s that is a proper superset of t.\n\nSo, when we subtract the sum of c_t for all t, but each c_t is subtracted once for each s that is a proper superset of t.\n\nWait, no, in the formula f_max = sum c_s - sum_{s} sum_{t subset s, t != s} c_t.\n\nWhich is the same as sum c_s - sum_{t} c_t * (number of s that are proper supersets of t).\n\nBut the number of proper supersets of t is equal to the number of binary strings longer than t that start with t.\n\nWait, for a string t of length l, the number of proper supersets is 2^{n-l} - 1, because each proper superset must be longer than t and start with t.\n\nSo, for each t, the term c_t is subtracted (2^{n - l(t)} - 1) times.\n\nThus, the formula for f_max is:\n\nf_max = sum_{s} c_s - sum_{t} (2^{n - len(t)} - 1) * c_t.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of c assignments where this f_max equals exactly f.\n\nBut wait, how can we model this?\n\nBecause the c assignments are variables, and for each assignment, we compute f_max as per the formula, and we need to count the number of assignments where f_max is equal to f.\n\nSo, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute the number of tuples (c_s for all s) where each c_s is in [0, k], and the sum c_s minus sum (2^{n - len(t)} - 1)*c_t equals f.\n\nBut wait, no. The formula is f_max = sum c_s - sum_{t} (2^{n - len(t)} -1 ) * c_t.\n\nBut since each t is a string of length >=1, the sum is over all t.\n\nWait, but the formula can be rewritten as:\n\nf_max = sum_{s} c_s - sum_{t} ( (2^{n - len(t)} -1) ) * c_t.\n\nBut this can be rearranged as:\n\nf_max = sum_{t} c_t * ( 1 - (2^{n - len(t)} -1) ) )\n\nBecause:\n\nsum c_s = sum_{t} c_t * (1 + 1 + ... ), where the number of times c_t is added is equal to the number of s that are proper supersets of t plus 1 (for t itself). So, the total coefficient for c_t in the sum c_s is (number of proper supersets of t) + 1 = (2^{n - len(t)} -1) + 1 = 2^{n - len(t)}.\n\nSo, sum c_s = sum_{t} c_t * 2^{n - len(t)}.\n\nThen, subtract sum_{t} c_t * (2^{n - len(t)} -1 ).\n\nSo, f_max = sum c_t * 2^{n-len(t)} - sum c_t*(2^{n-len(t)} -1 ) = sum c_t * 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because that would imply f_max is the sum of c_t's, which contradicts the earlier sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nLet me re-calculate.\n\nsum c_s is sum_{s} c_s.\n\nsum_{s} sum_{t subset s, t != s} c_t is sum_{t} c_t * (number of s that are proper supersets of t).\n\nThe number of s that are proper supersets of t is (2^{n - len(t)} - 1), since each proper superset is longer than t and starts with t.\n\nSo, f_max = sum c_s - sum_{t} c_t * (2^{n - len(t)} - 1).\n\nBut sum c_s is sum_{t} c_t * (number of times c_t appears in the sum of s).\n\nEach c_t appears in sum c_s for all s that are proper supersets of t, plus for s=t.\n\nWait, no: sum c_s is just the sum over all s of c_s.\n\nBut for each t, c_t is added once for s=t, and for each proper superset of t, s is added, which is (2^{n - len(t)} -1) times.\n\nSo,",
