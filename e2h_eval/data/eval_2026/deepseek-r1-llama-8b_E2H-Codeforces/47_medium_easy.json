    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. So the problem is about finding the best k to minimize the LCM of a+k and b+k. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let me rephrase. Let’s denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since k is added to both a and b, y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the difference between y and x is fixed as d = |b - a| or something. Wait, no—wait, because if a > b, then y - x would be negative, but maybe it's better to take absolute value. Or perhaps it's better to compute d as |a - b|? Hmm, maybe not. Because depending on whether a is larger than b or not, the sign might matter, but in terms of LCM, it's the same as when their difference is positive.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the case when a <= b. Because if a is less than or equal to b, then adding k to both will still keep x = a +k and y = b +k, with y >= x. So the difference is fixed as d = b - a. If a > b, then after adding k, a +k could be larger or smaller than b +k depending on k, but maybe it's easier to handle the case when a <= b by swapping them. Because the problem is symmetric in a and b in some way.\n\nSo perhaps the first step is to compute d = |a - b|. Because when you add k to both a and b, the difference between them remains the same. So for any k, x and y have a fixed difference of d.\n\nWait, no, wait: a +k and b +k have a difference of (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the difference is fixed regardless of k. So d is fixed as |a - b|.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y, where x + y = (a +k) + (b +k) = a + b + 2k. And the difference between x and y is d = |a - b|.\n\nWait, no. Because x is a +k, y is b +k, so x + y = a + b + 2k, and y - x = b - a. So x and y are two numbers whose sum is s = a + b + 2k and difference is d = b - a. But since k is variable, s can vary. But since we're looking to minimize the LCM(x, y), which is equal to (x*y)/gcd(x,y).\n\nBut since x and y are determined by their sum and difference, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of their sum and difference.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nx = (s - d)/2\ny = (s + d)/2\n\nWhere s is the sum x + y, and d is the difference y - x.\n\nWait, yes, because x + y = s, and y - x = d. So solving these two equations gives x = (s -d)/2 and y = (s +d)/2.\n\nSo for any s, x and y are determined. But s is dependent on k because s = a + b + 2k. So s can be written as s = (a + b) + 2k. So varying k changes s, thus varying x and y.\n\nOur goal is to choose k such that the LCM(x, y) is minimized. But x and y are functions of s, which depends on k.\n\nSo perhaps we can express LCM(x, y) in terms of s and d. Since x and y are (s-d)/2 and (s+d)/2, respectively.\n\nSo let's compute the GCD of x and y. Well, since x and y are consecutive terms in a sequence with difference d, their GCD must divide d.\n\nWait, more precisely, the GCD of x and y is the same as the GCD of x and d. Because y - x = d, so GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, y - x) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo the GCD of x and y is g = GCD(d, x). Since x = (s -d)/2, which is ( (a + b + 2k) - d ) / 2. Hmm, but d is fixed as |a - b|.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute d as b - a if b >= a, else a - b. Because when a > b, then adding k to both, the difference becomes (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b, which is the same as the original difference.\n\nSo let's assume without loss of generality that a <= b. Then d = b - a.\n\nSo now, for any k, x = a +k, y = b +k. So x + y = a + b + 2k, which is s.\n\nNow, the LCM(x, y) is (x * y) / gcd(x, y). As mentioned earlier, gcd(x, y) = g = GCD(d, x). Because d = y - x.\n\nSo substituting x = (s -d)/2 and y = (s +d)/2 into the LCM formula:\n\nLCM(x, y) = [ (s -d)(s +d)/4 ] / g \n\nBut s = a + b + 2k, which is also equal to 2*( (x + y) ), but perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since x = (s -d)/2 and d is known, perhaps we can find an expression for the LCM in terms of s and d.\n\nWait, but s is dependent on k, which is what we're trying to find. So perhaps the approach is to find s such that the LCM is minimized.\n\nWait, but how? Because s varies as k varies, and we need to find the s (and hence k) that minimizes the LCM.\n\nHmm, another thought: since x and y are determined by s and d, and their product over GCD is the LCM, perhaps the optimal s is the one that makes x and y as small as possible, but also co-prime.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case because sometimes having a higher GCD might result in a lower LCM despite larger x and y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x and y are as close as possible, but that's not always true.\n\nWait, let's take an example from the problem statement.\n\nFirst example: a=6, b=10. So d=4.\n\nWe need to find k such that x=6+k, y=10+k.\n\nIn the sample, k=2: x=8, y=12. Their LCM is 24.\n\nWhat is the sum s = 8+12=20. Which is a + b + 2k = 6+10 + 4 = 20. Correct.\n\nWhat is the minimal LCM here? Let's see other possible k values.\n\nk=0: x=6, y=10 → LCM is 30.\n\nk=1: x=7, y=11 → LCM is 77.\n\nk=2: LCM 24.\n\nk=3: x=9, y=13 → LCM 117.\n\nk=4: x=10, y=14 → LCM 70.\n\nk=5: x=11, y=15 → LCM 165.\n\nk=6: x=12, y=16 → LCM 96.\n\nk=7: x=13, y=17 → 221.\n\nk=8: x=14, y=18 → LCM 126.\n\nk=9: x=15, y=19 → 285.\n\nk=10: x=16, y=20 → LCM 80.\n\nWait, wait—so at k=2, LCM is 24, which is the smallest.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is achieved when k=2.\n\nSo what's special about that k? Let's see: the sum s is 20.\n\nx = (20 -4)/2=8, y=(20+4)/2=12. So x and y are 8 and 12, whose GCD is 4. So LCM is (8*12)/4 = 24.\n\nAnother observation: the sum s is equal to 20, which is 6 + 10 + 2*2=20. So in this case, choosing k=2 gives s=20.\n\nWait, but why is this the optimal point? What's the relation between s and the minimal LCM?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when s is as small as possible, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the first test case, when k=0, s is 16, but the LCM is 30. When k=2, s is 20, but the LCM is 24, which is smaller.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is such that x and y have a certain GCD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when s is equal to d multiplied by some factor that's as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to note that the LCM(x, y) is (x*y)/g, where g is the GCD(x, y). Since y = x + d, the GCD of x and x +d is the same as GCD(x, d). So g = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo LCM(x, y) = x*(x + d) / GCD(x, d).\n\nBut x is a +k, and we can write x as (s -d)/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way: since x and y are x = (s -d)/2, y = (s +d)/2, and d is fixed, perhaps the LCM can be expressed in terms of s.\n\nSo substituting x into the LCM formula:\n\ng = GCD( (s -d)/2, d )\n\nThen, LCM(x, y) = [ (s -d)(s +d) /4 ] / g.\n\nSimplify numerator: (s² - d²)/4.\n\nSo LCM = (s² - d²)/(4g).\n\nBut g is the GCD of (s -d)/2 and d. So let's compute g = GCD( (s -d)/2, d ). Let's denote m = (s -d)/2.\n\nSo g = GCD(m, d).\n\nSo LCM = (s² -d²)/(4 * GCD(m, d)).\n\nBut m is (s -d)/2, which is equal to x.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it: since x and y are x = (s -d)/2 and y = (s +d)/2, and d is fixed, then for a given s, x and y are determined. We need to find s such that the LCM of x and y is minimized.\n\nBut s is a function of k: s = a + b + 2k. So varying k increases s by 2 each time k increases by 1.\n\nSo the question is: for which value of s does the LCM of x and y, as defined above, become minimal?\n\nSo perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is chosen such that x and y are multiples of some factors that make their LCM as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is equal to some multiple related to d.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find s such that (s -d) is divisible by 2, and then find the minimal LCM based on s.\n\nBut this is getting a bit stuck.\n\nMaybe I should think differently. Since x and y are two numbers with a fixed difference d, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x and y are as small as possible, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, in the first example, when k=0, x=6, y=10: their LCM is 30. When k=2, x=8, y=12: LCM is 24. So even though x and y are larger, the LCM is smaller. So that suggests that making x and y as small as possible isn't the only factor.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the optimal k is such that the sum s is chosen such that the product x*y is as small as possible, but also considering the GCD.\n\nWait, but how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is equal to d multiplied by some integer.\n\nWait, let's think: for s = t*d, then x = (t*d -d)/2 = d(t-1)/2, y = d(t+1)/2.\n\nThen the LCM is (x*y)/GCD(x,y). Since x and y are d(t-1)/2 and d(t+1)/2, their GCD is d * GCD( (t-1)/2, (t+1)/2 ). Since t+1 and t-1 are two apart, their GCD is 2 if t is odd, etc.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when s is such that x and y are as small as possible, but their GCD is as large as possible.\n\nBecause LCM is (x*y)/g, so if g is large, the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal k is the one that maximizes g, the GCD of x and y, while keeping x and y as small as possible.\n\nHmm, but how do I find such k?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal s such that (s -d) is even, and then compute x and y, and find the minimal LCM.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again: since x and y are (s-d)/2 and (s+d)/2, respectively, and d is fixed, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is as small as possible, but also x and y are such that their GCD is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but how do I find s?\n\nAnother approach: for any k, the sum s = a + b + 2k. So s can be written as s = (a + b) + 2k.\n\nSo k can be written as k = (s - (a + b)) / 2.\n\nSince k must be non-negative, s must be at least (a + b), and s must be >= (a + b) because k is non-negative.\n\nWait, wait: no. Because if a + b is, say, 10, and s is 8, then k would be negative, which is not allowed. So s must be >= (a + b), because 2k = s - (a +b) must be >=0.\n\nSo s starts from s_min = (a + b) when k=0, and increases by 2 as k increases by 1.\n\nSo the possible s's are s = s0 + 2m, where m is a non-negative integer, and s0 = a + b.\n\nWait, but wait: suppose a + b is even or odd? No, because k can be zero, which gives s = a + b.\n\nSo s starts at s0 = a + b, and increases by 2 each step (since k increases by 1 each step).\n\nSo the possible s's are s0, s0 + 2, s0 +4, etc.\n\nSo for each possible s >= s0, and s has the same parity as s0 (because s = s0 + 2m), we can compute x and y, and then compute the LCM.\n\nBut since a and b can be up to 1e9, iterating through all possible s's is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when s is the smallest possible such that (s -d) is divisible by 2. Because s must be >= s0, but perhaps for some s, (s -d) is even, which is necessary for x and y to be integers.\n\nWait, but s0 is a + b. So let's compute s0 and see if s0 -d is even.\n\nIf s0 -d is even, then x and y are integers.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the next s in the sequence (s0, s0+2, ...) where s -d is even.\n\nBecause x = (s -d)/2 must be integer.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved either at s0 or at s0 +1 (if needed) to make (s -d) even.\n\nWait, but wait: because s must be >= s0, and s must be s0 + 2m, so s can be s0, s0+2, s0+4, etc.\n\nSo for (s -d) to be even, s must be congruent to d mod 2.\n\nBecause s -d ≡ 0 mod 2 → s ≡ d mod 2.\n\nSo the condition is that s and d have the same parity.\n\nSo the first s >= s0 that satisfies s ≡ d mod 2 is either s0 if s0 ≡ d mod 2, or s0+1 if s0 and d have different parities, but since s must be s0 + 2m, perhaps s0+1 is not allowed, unless s0+1 is even. Wait, no: because s can only take values s0, s0+2, s0+4, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because s must be s0 + 2m, so the parity of s is the same as s0.\n\nBecause adding 2 doesn't change the parity.\n\nSo for (s -d) to be even, s must have the same parity as d.\n\nSo if s0 has the same parity as d, then s0 is a valid candidate. Otherwise, we need to find the next possible s in the series s0, s0+2, s0+4, etc., that has the same parity as d.\n\nSo the minimal possible s is s0 if s0 ≡ d mod 2, else s0 + (1 if (s0 +1) is even) ? Wait, no—because adding 2 each time keeps the parity same.\n\nWait, for example: if s0 is even and d is even → s0 is good.\n\nIf s0 is even and d is odd → then s must be s0 + 1, but since s must be in the form s0 + 2m, that's not possible. So we have to choose the next s in the series that is s0 + 2, but wait: s0 is even, adding 2 gives even again. So for d being odd, s must be even or odd?\n\nWait, s must be such that s ≡ d mod 2. So if d is odd, s must be odd.\n\nBut s is s0 + 2m, which has the same parity as s0.\n\nSo if s0 is even, then s is even for all m. So if d is odd, no solution exists for s in the series s0, s0+2, etc. Because even s cannot be congruent to odd d mod 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because s can be any value greater than or equal to s0, but only those s's of the form s0 + 2m. So if s0 has the same parity as d, then s0 is acceptable. Otherwise, no solution exists? But that can't be because x and y must be integers.\n\nWait, no. Because x and y must be integers because k is non-negative integer. So x and y are (s -d)/2 and (s +d)/2. So s must satisfy s -d is even.\n\nWhich means that s must be congruent to d mod 2.\n\nSo for any s in the series s0, s0+2, s0+4, etc., if s ≡d mod 2, then x and y are integers.\n\nOtherwise, they are not.\n\nWait, but in our initial setup, d = b -a, assuming a <= b.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample:\n\na=6, b=10 → d=4.\n\ns0 = 6+10 =16.\n\nd is even.\n\ns0 is even.\n\nSo s0 ≡d mod 2 → yes.\n\nSo s0 is acceptable.\n\nSo x = (16 -4)/2=6, y=20/2=10. LCM is 30.\n\nBut in the sample, the optimal k was 2, leading to s=20.\n\nWhich is s0 +4=20.\n\nSo why is that better?\n\nAh, because although s0 is acceptable, the LCM is higher than when s=20.\n\nSo the minimal LCM may occur at a higher s.\n\nSo this suggests that just choosing the smallest possible s is not sufficient.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is to find all possible s's that satisfy s >= s0 and s ≡d mod 2, and among these, find the s that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how many such s's are there? Because for a and b up to 1e9, this approach would be O(something big), which is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps we need to find a way to compute the minimal LCM without enumerating all possible s's.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe LCM is (x * y)/g, where g is the GCD of x and y.\n\nBut x and y are (s -d)/2 and (s +d)/2.\n\nSo the product x*y is ((s^2 -d^2))/4.\n\nAnd g is the GCD of x and y, which is the same as GCD(x, d).\n\nBecause y =x +d, so GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, to minimize the LCM, we need to minimize (x * y) / g.\n\nBut x*y is (s² -d²)/4, and g is GCD(x, d).\n\nHmm.\n\nBut x is (s -d)/2.\n\nSo substituting, x = (s -d)/2.\n\nSo g = GCD( (s -d)/2, d ).\n\nLet me write this as g = GCD( (s -d)/2, d ).\n\nSo the LCM is (s² -d²)/(4 * g).\n\nSo our goal is to find s >= s0, s ≡d mod 2, that minimizes (s² -d²)/(4g), where g = GCD( (s -d)/2, d ).\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps, for a given d, the minimal LCM is achieved when (s -d)/2 is as small as possible, but also when the GCD of (s -d)/2 and d is as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when (s -d)/2 is a multiple of the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nSo let's think: for (s -d)/2 to have a large GCD with d.\n\nBecause that would increase g, thus reducing the LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal s is such that (s -d)/2 is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of d and something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the maximum possible g, which divides d, and then choose s such that (s -d)/2 is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, because g must divide d.\n\nSo for each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find s such that (s -d)/2 is a multiple of g.\n\nThen, for each such g, compute the corresponding s and the resulting LCM.\n\nThen, among all these possibilities, choose the one with the minimal LCM.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. Compute s0 = a + b.\n\n3. Enumerate all possible divisors g of d.\n\n4. For each g, find the smallest s >= s0 such that (s -d)/2 is a multiple of g.\n\n   a. The condition is (s -d) must be divisible by 2g → s = d + 2g * k, where k is a positive integer.\n\n   b. Also, s must be >= s0.\n\n5. For each such s, compute the LCM and track the minimal one.\n\n6. Among all s's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest s (which corresponds to the smallest k).\n\nSo the plan is to find all divisors of d, and for each, compute the minimal s that satisfies the conditions, then compute the LCM for each such s, and select the one with minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, since d can be up to 1e9, the number of divisors is manageable because even 1e9 has at most ~1000 divisors.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Compute d.\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute the minimal s >= s0 such that (s -d) is divisible by 2g.\n\n   So s = d + 2g * m, where m is a positive integer.\n\n   Also, s must be >= s0.\n\n- So the minimal s for this g is max(s0, d + 2g * 1). Because m must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but wait: (s -d) must be divisible by 2g → s = d + 2g * m, where m is a positive integer.\n\nSo for each g, the minimal possible s is d + 2g * m, with m >=1, and s >= s0.\n\nWait, but m can be 1 only if d + 2g >= s0.\n\nOtherwise, m needs to be larger.\n\nBut perhaps, for each g, the minimal s is the smallest s >= s0 such that s ≡d mod 2g.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because 2g is the step size.\n\nSo for each g, we can compute the minimal m such that d + 2g * m >= s0.\n\nOnce we have that, s is determined.\n\nThen, for each such s, compute x = (s -d)/2, y = (s +d)/2.\n\nCompute the LCM as (x*y)/gcd(x, y) → which is (x*y)/g', where g' is the GCD(x, d).\n\nWait, but x is (s -d)/2 = (d + 2g*m -d)/2 = g*m.\n\nSo x = g*m.\n\nThus, the GCD(x, d) is GCD(g*m, d).\n\nBut since g is a divisor of d, because we're considering all divisors of d, then GCD(g*m, d) = g * GCD(m, d/g).\n\nBecause g divides d, so d = g * k for some integer k.\n\nThus, GCD(g*m, g*k) = g * GCD(m, k).\n\nSo the LCM is (x * y) / (g * GCD(m, k)).\n\nBut x = g*m, y = g*m + d.\n\nWait, y = x +d.\n\nBut x is g*m, and d is g*k, so y = g*m + g*k = g*(m +k).\n\nSo y = g*(m +k).\n\nSo x * y = g*m * g*(m +k) = g² m (m +k).\n\nThe GCD(x, y) is g * GCD(m, m +k) = g * GCD(m, k).\n\nThus, the LCM is (g² m (m +k )) / (g * GCD(m, k)) ) → g m (m +k) / GCD(m, k).\n\nSo the LCM for this g and m is (g m (m +k)) / GCD(m, k).\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   Compute k = d / g.\n\n   Now, for this g, find the minimal m such that s = d + 2g*m >= s0.\n\n   Then, compute the LCM as (g * m * (m +k)) / GCD(m, k).\n\nSo the minimal LCM across all possible g and m is the answer.\n\nBut how do I choose m for each g?\n\nThe idea is that for each g, we can find the minimal m that allows s to be >= s0, and then compute the corresponding LCM.\n\nBut perhaps for each g, the minimal m is the smallest m where m >= ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) ), but rounded up to ensure that s >= s0.\n\nWait, let's compute m for each g:\n\nWe have s = d + 2g*m >= s0 → 2g*m >= s0 -d → m >= ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) ).\n\nBut since m must be an integer >=1.\n\nWait, but wait: s0 is a + b, and d = b -a (assuming a <=b).\n\nSo s0 -d = a + b - (b -a) = 2a.\n\nSo s >= 2a.\n\nBut in any case, for each g, m must be at least the smallest integer such that d + 2g*m >= s0.\n\nSo m >= ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) )\n\nBut s0 -d is 2a.\n\nSo for each g, m must be >= ceil( (2a)/(2g) ) = ceil(a/g).\n\nBut since m must be >=1, perhaps the minimal m for each g is max(1, ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) )).\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because for a particular g, if (s0 -d) is positive, then m must be at least (s0 -d)/(2g), rounded up.\n\nBut let's think numerically.\n\nSuppose s0 -d = 10, 2g =5 → m >= 2.\n\nSo for each g, compute m_min = max(1, ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) )).\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate for each g, all possible m starting from 1, and compute the corresponding s, and track the minimal LCM.\n\nBut for a and b up to 1e9, and d up to 1e9, the number of divisors of d is manageable, but for each g, the number of m's to check could be large.\n\nHmm, but perhaps for each g, the minimal LCM is achieved when m is as small as possible.\n\nBecause for larger m, the x and y are larger, but perhaps the GCD increases, leading to a lower LCM.\n\nWait, but it's unclear. So perhaps for each g, the minimal LCM is achieved when m is as small as possible.\n\nThus, for each g, the minimal m is the minimal possible m that satisfies s >= s0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   Compute k = d / g.\n\n   Compute the minimal m such that s = d + 2g*m >= s0.\n\n   m_min = max(1, ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) )).\n\n   Then, compute x = g*m_min, y = g*(m_min +k).\n\n   Compute LCM = (x * y) / GCD(x, y) → which is (g*m_min * g*(m_min +k)) / (g * GCD(m_min, k)).\n\n   Simplify: LCM = (g^2 m_min (m_min +k)) / (g * GCD(m_min, k)) ) → (g m_min (m_min +k)) / GCD(m_min, k).\n\nSo, for each g, compute m_min, then compute LCM as per above.\n\nThen, track the minimal LCM across all g's, and the corresponding k.\n\nWait, but how do I get k? Because k is d/g, which is fixed for each g.\n\nWait, the k in the code is the variable we're trying to find, but in this approach, for each g, we're computing a possible s, which leads to a certain k.\n\nWait, no, in this approach, k is the variable, but s is a function of k. So perhaps I'm conflating variables here.\n\nWait, in the problem, k is the variable to find, and s = a + b + 2k.\n\nSo for each possible s that meets the conditions, we can compute k = (s - (a + b)) / 2.\n\nSo for each g, we compute m_min, then compute s = d + 2g*m_min.\n\nThen, compute k = (s - s0)/2 = (d + 2g m_min - (a + b)) / 2.\n\nBut s0 is a + b, and d = b -a → d + a + b = 2b.\n\nSo s = d + 2g m_min = (b -a) + 2g m_min.\n\nThus, k = (s - (a + b)) / 2 = ( (b -a) + 2g m_min - a - b ) / 2 → (-a + 2g m_min)/2 → (2g m_min -a)/2 → g m_min - a/2.\n\nWait, but a is an integer, so a/2 is either integer or half-integer.\n\nHmm, but k must be integer.\n\nWait, s = a + b + 2k → s - (a + b) = 2k → k = (s - (a + b)) / 2.\n\nSo if s is computed as d + 2g m_min, which is (b -a) + 2g m_min.\n\nThen, s - (a + b) = (b -a) + 2g m_min - a -b → (-a) + 2g m_min -a → 2g m_min - 2a → 2(g m_min -a).\n\nThus, k = (2(g m_min -a)) / 2 = g m_min -a.\n\nSo k must be equal to g m_min -a.\n\nBut since k must be non-negative, g m_min -a >= 0 → m_min >= a/g.\n\nWait, but m_min is the minimal m for which s >= s0.\n\nSo perhaps for each g, we need to compute m_min as the minimal m such that g m_min >= a.\n\nBecause k = g m_min -a must be >=0.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation says m_min is the minimal m that makes s >= s0.\n\nWhich is s = d + 2g m_min >= s0 → but s0 = a +b.\n\nSo perhaps m_min is the minimal m such that d + 2g m_min >= a +b.\n\nWhich is m_min >= ceil( (a +b -d)/(2g) ).\n\nBut d = b -a → a +b -d = a +b - (b -a) = 2a.\n\nSo m_min >= ceil( 2a/(2g) ) = ceil( a/g ).\n\nSo m_min is at least ceil(a/g).\n\nBut also, since k must be non-negative, g m_min >=a.\n\nWhich is m_min >= ceil(a/g).\n\nSo for each g, m_min is the maximum between 1 and ceil( a/g ), but also ensuring that s >= s0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to compute m_min as the maximum between 1 and ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) ), which is ceil( (2a)/(2g) ) = ceil(a/g).\n\nSo m_min = max(1, ceil(a/g)).\n\nBut perhaps m_min can be 1, but if a/g is larger than 1, then m_min is larger.\n\nBut for each g, the minimal m is the minimal m >=1 such that s >= s0.\n\nWhich is m >= ceil( (s0 -d)/(2g) ) = ceil( (2a)/(2g) ) = ceil(a/g).\n\nSo for each g, m_min = max(1, ceil(a/g)).\n\nThus, for each divisor g of d:\n\n   m_min = max(1, ceil(a/g))\n\n   compute s = d + 2g * m_min\n\n   compute k = g * m_min - a\n\n   compute x = g * m_min\n\n   y = x + d = g * m_min + (b -a)\n\n   compute g_x_y = GCD(x, y) = GCD(g*m_min, g*m_min + (b -a)) = GCD(g*m_min, b -a)\n\n   but since g is a divisor of d = b -a, then GCD(g*m_min, d) = g * GCD(m_min, d/g).\n\n   So the LCM is (x * y) / g_x_y = (g m_min (g m_min + d)) / (g * GCD(m_min, d/g)) ) → (m_min (g m_min +d )) / GCD(m_min, d/g).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to compute the GCD as GCD(x, y), which is GCD(g m_min, g m_min +d) = GCD(g m_min, d).\n\nSince d is a multiple of g, because g is a divisor of d.\n\nThus, GCD(g m_min, d) = g * GCD(m_min, d/g).\n\nThus, the LCM is (g m_min * (g m_min +d )) /",
