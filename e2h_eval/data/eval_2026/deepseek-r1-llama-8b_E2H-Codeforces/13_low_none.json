For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the input is three notes separated by spaces. My task is to classify them as major, minor, or strange based on the semitone distances between them.\n\nLet me think about what defines a major and minor triad. For a major triad, when the notes are ordered in a certain way, the first two should be 4 semitones apart, and the next two should be 3. So, if I have notes X, Y, Z, after sorting them in some order, the distance from X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. Then it's a major chord. For minor, the distances are 3 and 4 respectively.\n\nWait, but how do I order the notes? Because the order isn't fixed. The chord is unordered, so I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the approach is: take all permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. If any permutation meets the major or minor condition, then the triad is major or minor. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous—so no case where a triad is both major and minor.\n\nSo first, I need a way to represent the notes and their positions. Let's assign each note an index in the list of 12 notes. That way, the distance between two notes can be calculated as (y - x) mod 12, since the scale is cyclic.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is measured from the lower to higher note. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones, but E to C is 8. But in the problem statement, when we're checking, the order matters because the distance is taken from lower to higher. So for a chord, the notes are arranged in such a way that the first note is lower than the second, which is lower than the third in the ordered sequence.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says that a chord is an unordered set, but for the purpose of determining major or minor, the notes are ordered in a way that the distances are correct.\n\nSo for each possible ordering of the three notes, I need to check if they satisfy the major or minor condition.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Assign each note a numerical value. Let's create a list of the notes in order: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\n2. For each note, find its index in this list.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three input notes. There are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute the distances between x and y, y and z.\n\n   - The distance between x and y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But since the distance is from lower to higher, it's (y_index - x_index) % 12. Similarly for y and z.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the distance is always from the lower note to the higher. So for any two notes, the distance is (higher - lower) % 12.\n\n5. For each permutation, calculate d1 = distance between x and y, and d2 = distance between y and z.\n\n   Then, if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, it's a major triad.\n\n   If d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, it's a minor triad.\n\n6. If any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. Else, if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'. Else, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, because the triad could have multiple permutations that fit, but the problem says the answer is unique, so once a permutation satisfies, we can immediately decide.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read the three notes as a list.\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n\n- For each permutation:\n\n   a. Calculate the indices of each note.\n\n   b. Compute d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   c. Compute d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   d. Check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major found.\n\n   e. Else, check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor found.\n\n   f. If either is found, return accordingly.\n\nIf none of the permutations meet either condition, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, I need to implement this.\n\nLet's think about how to represent the notes. I'll create a list of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The classification is based on the distances between the notes when ordered correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note with an index in a predefined list of 12 notes. This allows us to calculate the distance between notes using their indices.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the chord type, generate all permutations of the three input notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. The distance is calculated as the difference in their indices modulo 12.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. A major chord has distances of 4 and 3 semitones respectively, while a minor chord has distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\ndef get_index(note):\n    return notes_order.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (get_index(y) - get_index(x)) % 12\n        d2 = (get_index(z) - get_index(y)) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (get_index(y) - get_index(x)) % 12\n        d2 = (get_index(z) - get_index(y)) % 12\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nif is_major(input_notes):\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor(input_notes):\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned an index from 0 to 11 based on its position in the list `['C', 'C#', 'D', ..., 'H']`.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distance between consecutive notes is calculated using their indices modulo 12.\n4. **Chord Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, we print \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor condition, we print \"minor\". If none do, we print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible orderings of the notes to determine the correct chord type.",
