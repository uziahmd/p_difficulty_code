A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t toasts.\n\nTotal drink needed: n * t * nl (since each of the n friends takes nl ml per toast)\nTotal slices needed: n * t (each toast per friend needs one slice)\nSalt needed: n * t * np (each friend uses np grams per toast)\n\nNow, the available resources are:\n\n- Total drink: k * l (all the bottles' contents)\n- Slices: c * d (total slices from limes)\n- Salt: p grams\n\nSo, the constraints for t are:\n\n1. n * t * nl ≤ k * l\n2. n * t ≤ c * d\n3. n * t * np ≤ p\n\nWe need to find the maximum t that satisfies all three inequalities.\n\nOur goal is to compute t such that all three conditions are met, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum possible t based on each resource and then take the minimum of those.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nFor each resource, compute the maximum possible t that resource allows, then the overall t is the minimum of those.\n\nSo for drink:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nBut wait, if (k*l) is not enough for n*nl*t, then we have to see what's the max t possible. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for limes:\n\nmax_toasts_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nBecause each toast requires n slices (one per friend), so total slices needed is n*t, which must be <= c*d.\n\nFor salt:\n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nOnce we have these three maximums, the actual maximum t is the minimum of these three.\n\nThen, that's our answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input values.\n- Compute each of the three possible maxima.\n- Take the minimum of them.\n- Output that minimum.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. We have to make sure that each of these calculations is correct, especially integer division.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nCompute drink: (4*5) =20 ml. Each toast per friend needs 3ml, so per toast for all 3 friends: 3*3=9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... → floor is 2.\n\nLime: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast per friend needs 1 slice, so 3 slices per toast. 80/3 is 26.666→ 26? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait—no, the calculation is 80 slices divided by n (3) per toast. Because each toast requires n slices. So 80 /3 is 26.666, which means 26 toasts. But in the sample note, it's 80 toasts? Wait no.\n\nWait the sample note says: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each. So total slices is 80. They can make 80 toasts, each requiring 1 slice. But each toast is per friend. Oh, wait no: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends takes one slice → total 3 slices per toast. So the total slices needed for t toasts is 3t.\n\nSo 3t ≤80 → t ≤80/3=26.666, so t=26.\n\nBut in the sample note, they get 80 toasts. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait the sample note says:\n\nOverall, friends have 20ml (4*5) → 20",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - 1 lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available: `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices available: `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available: `p`.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Find the Limiting Resource**: The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the smallest value among the three calculated values above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input as a single line and split into integers\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible toasts based on each resource\nmax_toasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# The minimum of these will be the answer\nmax_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\n# Output the result as a string\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the given variables.\n- **Calculating Maximum Toasts**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, salt), compute the maximum number of toasts possible given the constraints.\n- **Determining the Result**: The smallest value among the maximum toasts calculated for each resource determines the actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends have the same number of toasts and all resources are used efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can enjoy without running out of any required resource.",
