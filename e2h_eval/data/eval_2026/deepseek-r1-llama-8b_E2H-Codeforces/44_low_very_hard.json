He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp practicing problem-solving. He has a list of n problems with their difficulties. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day, he must solve a contiguous sequence of problems from the start of the list. So, for example, on day 1, he might solve the first m problems, then on day 2, the next p, and so on until all n are done.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these daily profits. My goal is to find the way to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups such that the total profit is maximized.\n\nHmm. So, I need to split the array into exactly k segments, each non-empty and contiguous, and maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints: n can be up to 2000, k up to 2000 as well. So, a O(nk) solution is acceptable, but anything higher might not work.\n\nWhat's the optimal strategy? Well, to maximize the sum of maxima, I want as many high values as possible to be the maxima of their respective segments. But since the segments are contiguous, perhaps the best way is to have each segment's maximum be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but each segment's maximum contributes once to the total. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to select the top k elements as the maxima of each segment. But that's not necessarily possible because the segments must cover the entire array in order.\n\nSo, maybe the optimal way is to choose certain positions as the maxima for each segment, ensuring that they are non-decreasing in some way. Wait, no, because each segment is after the previous one. So the next segment starts where the previous left off.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the segments are contiguous, any splitting points divide the array into k parts. For each split, we calculate the max of each part and sum them.\n\nWe need to choose where to split the array into k parts such that the sum of the maxima is as large as possible.\n\nHow can I model this? Maybe dynamic programming.\n\nYes, dynamic programming seems promising here.\n\nLet's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems, divided into j segments.\n\nOur aim is to compute dp[n][k], which is the answer.\n\nFor the base case, dp[0][0] = 0, since zero problems and zero days give zero profit.\n\nFor the transitions, let's think about how to build dp[i][j]. For each position i and j, we can look back at some m < i, and take the maximum from m+1 to i, then add it to dp[m][j-1].\n\nBut wait, the maximum would be the maximum between m+1 and i. So, for each possible m, we can compute the current max and update the dp accordingly.\n\nBut if we do this naively, for each i, j, and m, the time complexity becomes O(n^3), which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet's think about the state transitions more carefully. For dp[i][j], we can consider all possible m (from j-1 to i-1). Because, to form j segments, we need at least j-1 splits before m.\n\nWait, no: To split into j segments, the first j-1 segments must end before m. So, for each i, j, m can range from j-1 (since each of the first j-1 segments must have at least one problem) up to i-1.\n\nSo, for each i and j, dp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1...i])).\n\nCalculating max(a[m+1...i]) for each m and i is O(n) per transition, which again leads to O(n^3) time.\n\nThis is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute the maximums for all possible intervals quickly.\n\nHmm, but even with that, it's O(n^3) in the worst case.\n\nIs there a way to optimize this?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum for the interval m+1 to i can be efficiently calculated by keeping track of the current maximum as we increase i.\n\nYes! For each i, as we process m from i-1 down to j-1, the maximum can be updated incrementally. For example, for a fixed i, when m decreases by 1, the new interval is m+1 to i, so the maximum could be either the previous max or a[m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day.\n\n### Approach\nThe optimal approach to solve this problem involves using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` problems divided into `j` segments.\n2. **Base Case**: Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` since zero problems and zero days result in zero profit.\n3. **State Transition**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, consider all possible previous positions `m` where the `j-1` segments end. The profit for the new segment from `m+1` to `i` is the maximum value in this interval. Update `dp[i][j]` by considering all possible values of `m`.\n4. **Efficient Maximum Calculation**: For each `i` and `j`, compute the maximum value in the interval `[m+1, i]` incrementally to avoid recalculating it from scratch each time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum profit by leveraging the properties of contiguous subarrays and dynamic programming.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for j in range(1, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            max_val = 0\n            for m in range(i-1, j-1, -1):\n                if a[m] > max_val:\n                    max_val = a[m]\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + max_val)\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the splits\n    splits = [0]*k\n    current = n\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        for m in range(current-1, j-1, -1):\n            if dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1:current+1]) == dp[current][j]:\n                splits[j-1] = m - splits[j-1]\n                current = m\n                break\n    \n    # Calculate the total profit\n    total = dp[n][k]\n    \n    print(total)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, splits)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties `a`.\n2. **DP Initialization**: A 2D DP table is initialized where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit for the first `i` problems divided into `j` segments.\n3. **Filling DP Table**: For each possible number of segments `j` and each possible number of problems `i`, the DP table is filled by considering all possible previous positions `m` to form the current segment. The maximum value of the current segment is tracked incrementally to ensure efficiency.\n4. **Reconstructing Splits**: After computing the DP table, the actual splits are reconstructed by backtracking from the final state to determine how the problems were distributed across the days.\n5. **Output**: The total maximum profit and the optimal distribution of problems into days are printed.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the optimal distribution of problems to maximize the total profit using dynamic programming and incremental maximum tracking.",
