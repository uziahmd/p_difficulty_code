For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful multiset? It's a collection of binary strings of length exactly n. For every string s (of any length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. And we want the maximum size of such a multiset to be exactly f.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So for each s, the count of its extensions (including itself if it's in the multiset) can't exceed c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum possible size of such a multiset given the c_s's? Oh right, because the c_s's determine the constraints on the counts, and then the maximum size is the largest possible under those constraints.\n\nSo our task is to find the number of assignments of c_s's such that when you compute the maximum possible beautiful multiset, its size is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the approach would involve two steps:\n\n1. For a given assignment of c_s's, compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset.\n2. Count all such assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, enumerating all possible c_s's isn't feasible since there are way too many possibilities. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach binary string s has a certain number of extensions. For example, s=0 of length 1 can be extended by 0 or 1, so it has 2 extensions. But wait, no: the multiset is of exactly length n strings. So for s being a prefix of a string t of length n, t can be part of the multiset.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this with inclusion-exclusion based on the trie structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into constraints on the counts of the binary strings in the multiset. Because for each node in the trie (each possible prefix), the count of its children (including itself) is limited by c_s.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to model the problem using the concept of a trie. Each node in the trie represents a binary string s. The count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of all the counts of its descendants (including itself). So for the multiset to be beautiful, for each node s, the sum of counts of its descendants must be <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of such a multiset is the sum of the counts of all leaves in the trie. So for each node, the sum of its subtree (excluding the root) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the root is not a string of length >=1. So the root's children are the single-character strings.\n\nWait, actually, each node s (which is a binary string) has a count of how many times it appears in the multiset. Then, for each s, the sum of counts of all its children (including itself) must be <= c_s. Because any string that starts with s will contribute to the count of s's subtree.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nFor each node s (non-leaf), the sum of its subtree (the sum of counts of s and all its descendants) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no, because s itself is a node, and any string that starts with s is either s or another longer string. So the sum of the counts of all nodes in the subtree rooted at s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nYes. So for each node s, sum_{t is a descendant of s} count[t] <= c_s.\n\nOur goal is to choose c_s for all s, and arrange the counts such that these inequalities hold, and the total sum of counts is exactly f. We need to find the number of ways to choose the c_s's so that the maximum possible f is achieved.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given set of c_s's, the maximum possible f is the maximum sum of counts across all possible beautiful multisets. So each c_s determines the upper bounds on the sum of their subtrees.\n\nSo for each possible c_s assignment, the maximum f is determined by the constraints:\n\nsum_{t is a child of s} count[t] <= c_s for all s.\n\nThe maximum f is the maximum possible sum of counts, which would be achieved by setting each count[t] to",

The goal is to count the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) values that result in the maximum multiset size being exactly \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Trie Structure Insight**: Each binary string can be represented as a node in a trie. The constraints on the counts of these strings form a hierarchical structure where each node's subtree must not exceed its \\( c_s \\) value.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach to represent the state of the trie nodes and their constraints. The state transitions are based on the possible counts of each node's subtree, ensuring the constraints are satisfied.\n\n4. **State Representation**: The DP state `dp[mask][s]` represents the number of ways to assign counts to the nodes corresponding to the bitmask `mask`, considering up to string length `s`.\n\n5. **Transition Between States**: For each state, we consider the possible ways to extend the current node's subtree while respecting the constraints imposed by \\( c_s \\) values.\n\n6. **Final Count Calculation**: After processing all nodes, the result is the sum of all valid DP states where the total count equals \\( f \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Generate all possible binary strings up to length n\n    max_len = n\n    all_strings = []\n    for l in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        for s in ['0', '1']^l:\n            all_strings.append(s)\n    \n    # Build the trie structure\n    trie = {}\n    for s in all_strings:\n        node = trie\n        for c in s:\n            if c not in node:\n                node[c] = {'children': {}, 'count': 0}\n            node = node[c]\n        node['is_leaf'] = True\n    \n    # Precompute the order of processing nodes\n    order = []\n    stack = [(trie, None)]\n    while stack:\n        current_node, parent = stack.pop()\n        order.append(current_node)\n        if parent is not None:\n            parent['children'][current_node] = None\n        else:\n            pass\n        for child in current_node.get('children', {}):\n            stack.append((child, current_node))\n    \n    # Map each node to its index in the order list\n    node_indices = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(order)}\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << len(order))]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Process each node in order\n    for mask in range(1 << len(order)):\n        for s in range(len(order)):\n            if not (mask & (1 << s)):\n                continue\n            node = order[s]\n            current_dp = dp[mask]\n            if current_dp == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Determine the maximum allowed count for this node's subtree\n            max_allowed = k\n            if node.get('is_leaf'):\n                max_allowed = min(k, f - 0)  # itself can contribute to the sum\n            else:\n                max_allowed = min(k, f - sum(node.get('count') for child in node.get('children', {})))\n            \n            if max_allowed < 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # The node's count can be from 0 to max_allowed\n            for cnt in range(0, max_allowed + 1):\n                new_mask = mask | (1 << s)\n                if new_mask >= (1 << len(order)):\n                    continue\n                dp[new_mask][node.get('count', 0) + cnt] = (\n                    dp[new_mask][node.get('count', 0) + cnt] + current_dp\n                ) % MOD\n    \n    # Sum all states where the total count is exactly f\n    result = 0\n    for mask in range(1 << len(order)):\n        if dp[mask][f] > 0:\n            result = (result + dp[mask][f]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves constructing a trie to represent all possible binary strings up to length \\( n \\).
