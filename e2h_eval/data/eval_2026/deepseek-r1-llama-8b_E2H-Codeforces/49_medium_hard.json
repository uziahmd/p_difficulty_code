They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all the given roads' GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied. And if it's possible, I have to output any valid assignment.\n\nHmm, let's think about the problem. Each edge between two vertices (lawns) gives us a pair (g, l), which is the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two vertices. So for two connected lawns u and v, their mushroom counts must satisfy:\n- gcd(u, v) = g\n- lcm(u, v) = l\n\nWait, but we also know that for any two numbers a and b, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, a * b = g * l. That's a key relationship here.\n\nSo for each edge, u and v must be such that their values multiply to g*l. Also, the gcd of u and v is g, and the lcm is l. So that gives me some constraints to work with.\n\nBut how do I model this? Maybe using a graph where each node has a value, and each edge imposes certain conditions on those values.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations or constraints, which can be solved using some kind of graph traversal method, perhaps similar to BFS or DFS, assigning values as we go.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the known roads as edges in a graph. Each edge connects two nodes (lawns) and has a g and l.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each edge, the two nodes must have values a and b such that:\n   - a * b = g * l\n   - gcd(a, b) = g\n   - lcm(a, b) = l\n\n3. **System of Equations**: The constraints form a system where each edge defines relationships between the nodes it connects. So, each node's value depends on its connected edges.\n\n4. **Topological Sort Approach**: Maybe arrange the nodes in a way that allows us to assign values step by step. But wait, the graph might not necessarily be a DAG. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a system where each variable (mushroom count) is determined by the constraints from the edges. But since each edge gives two variables (a and b), perhaps we can model this as a system of equations and find possible solutions.\n\nWait, another thought: For each edge, the two nodes' values must satisfy a = (g * something) and b = (g * another thing), because the gcd is g. So maybe express each node's value in terms of multiples of g, but that could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since a * b = g*l, and knowing that g is the gcd of a and b, then a and b must be multiples of g. Let me denote a = g * x and b = g * y. Then, the lcm(a, b) is g * lcm(x, y). But the given lcm is l, so:\n\nlcm(a, b) = g * lcm(x, y) = l => lcm(x, y) = l / g.\n\nAlso, since a and b are g*x and g*y, their product is g^2 * x*y = g*l => x*y = l/g.\n\nWait, but l must be divisible by g because lcm(a, b) is a multiple of the gcd. So, if any edge has g > l, then it's impossible. So first, I should check that for all edges, g <= l. Because otherwise, the lcm cannot be less than the gcd.\n\nYes, that's an initial check. If any edge has g > l, then it's impossible, so output NO.\n\nSo step one: For each edge, check if g > l. If any such case exists, output NO.\n\nNext, for each edge, compute the possible pairs (x, y) such that x * y = (l/g) and lcm(x, y) = (l/g). Wait, because after substituting, x and y are factors of (l/g).\n\nWait, let's see. After setting a = g*x, b = g*y:\n\nWe have a*b = g^2 * x*y = g*l => x*y = l/g.\n\nAnd lcm(a, b) = g * lcm(x, y) = l => lcm(x, y) = l/g.\n\nSo now, x and y must satisfy:\n\nx * y = d (where d = l/g)\nand lcm(x, y) = d.\n\nWhat are the possible (x, y) pairs?\n\nWell, since x*y = d and lcm(x,y) is d. Since d is positive integer.\n\nThe lcm of x and y is equal to (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So:\n\nd = (x*y)/gcd(x, y) => but x*y is d, so d = d / g_xy, where g_xy is gcd(x, y). So this implies that g_xy must be 1, meaning that x and y are coprime.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nBecause x*y = d, and lcm(x, y) = d. So:\n\nlcm(x, y) = (x*y) / gcd(x, y) = d / g_xy = d.\n\nSo, d / g_xy = d => g_xy = 1.\n\nThus, x and y must be coprime.\n\nSo, the possible (x, y) pairs are pairs of coprime integers whose product is d.\n\nSo, for each edge, d is l/g, and we need to find x and y such that x*y = d and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nMoreover, since x and y are positive integers.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible (x, y) pairs are the factorizations of d into two coprimes.\n\nFor example, if d is 6, then the possible (x, y) pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But wait, (2,3) is coprime, yes.\n\nWait, but what if d is 4? Then possible pairs are (1,4), (4,1), (2,2). Wait, but 2 and 2 have a gcd of 2, so they are not coprimes. So only (1,4) and (4,1) are allowed.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible (x, y) pairs are the pairs of divisors of d where x and y are coprimes.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- For each edge, compute d = l / g.\n- Check that d is integer (i.e., l is divisible by g). If any edge doesn't satisfy this, output NO.\n- Then, find all possible pairs (x, y) where x * y = d and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nOnce we have these possible pairs for each edge, the problem becomes assigning x and y to each edge in a way that is consistent across the entire graph.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a constraint satisfaction problem. Each edge can have certain possible assignments, and the variables are the x and y values for each node.\n\nWait, no. Because each node's x and y is connected via edges. Wait, maybe not. Wait, each node is part of multiple edges. So, for a node u, it appears in several edges. Each edge u-v imposes that u's x and v's x are related via their respective edge's x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to model variables for each node, representing x_u and y_u. Then, for each edge u-v, the x_u * y_v = d, and the same for other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIn the earlier substitution, a = g_u * x_u, and b = g_v * x_v? Or wait, perhaps each node has an associated x and y, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each node has a single value, say s, and the edges impose certain constraints on these s values.\n\nWait, no, because each edge involves two nodes, and each node can have different constraints based on the edges it's part of.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each node's value is determined by the edges it's connected to. But how?\n\nAnother idea: We can model the problem as a system of equations where each equation represents the constraints between two variables (nodes). However, the variables are connected in a way that makes it difficult to solve directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be represented as a bipartite graph where each node's value is determined by its edges, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each edge u-v with (g, l) must satisfy:\n\ns_u * s_v = g * l.\n\nBut wait, no, because s_u and s_v are the mushroom counts, and for this edge, the GCD(s_u, s_v) = g and LCM(s_u, s_v) = l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the GCD and LCM are computed for s_u and s_v, and their product is s_u * s_v. So, s_u * s_v = g * l, because GCD(s_u, s_v) = g and LCM(s_u, s_v) = l.\n\nWait, that's correct. So for each edge, s_u * s_v = g * l.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning s_1, s_2, ..., s_n such that for every edge (u, v, g, l), s_u * s_v = g * l.\n\nAdditionally, for each edge, the GCD(s_u, s_v) must be exactly g, and the LCM must be l.\n\nBut wait, if s_u * s_v = g*l, and the GCD is g, then the LCM is indeed (s_u * s_v) / GCD(s_u, s_v) = (g*l)/g = l. So the LCM condition is automatically satisfied if the product is correct and the GCD is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the main condition is that for each edge, s_u * s_v = g*l, and that the GCD(s_u, s_v) = g.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent this as a system of equations. Each edge u-v adds the equation s_u * s_v = k, where k is g*l.\n\nBut solving such a system is challenging because each equation is nonlinear.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is connected to others via multiplicative constraints.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have variables connected via equations like x + y = k, which can be solved with a topological sort approach. But multiplication is more complex.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure, but I'm not sure how that would help with multiplicative constraints.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each variable can be expressed as a product of primes, and the constraints can be broken down into prime factors. But this might get complicated, especially since the constraints can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the variables are connected in a way that forms a tree, allowing us to assign values step by step. But if the graph has cycles, we need to ensure that the constraints are consistent around the cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Check for each edge whether g divides l. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component, perform a BFS or DFS, assigning values to the nodes step by step, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. If during this process, a contradiction is found (i.e., a node's assigned value conflicts with an existing assignment based on an edge), then output NO.\n\n4. If all constraints are satisfied, output YES along with the assigned values.\n\nBut how to assign the values? Let's think about a node being visited for the first time. We can assign it a value of 1, but then look at all edges connected to it. For each edge, the other node's value must be (g*l) / current_node_value. But then, when moving to the next node, we have to ensure that all edges are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, choose a root node, assign it a value of 1, and then propagate the required values through the edges. But this may not always work because the choice of 1 might lead to inconsistencies elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, the root can be assigned a variable x, and each child node's value is determined based on the edge constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps using a system of equations where each node's value is a function of the root's value. Then, for each connected component, the system can be solved to find if a solution exists and what the root's value must be.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me consider a connected component. Let's pick a root node, say node A. Assign a variable x to A. Then, for each edge connected to A, say edge A-B with (g, l), the product s_A * s_B = g*l. So s_B = (g*l)/s_A. Similarly, for each edge B-C, s_C = (g'*l')/s_B, and so on.\n\nThis forms a system where each node's value is expressed in terms of the root's x. Now, if the system is consistent, then all edges in the component will have s_i * s_j = g*l for their respective edges.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can model each node's s in terms of x, the root's value.\n\nOnce all nodes are expressed in terms of x, we can then substitute back into the edges to find the constraints on x.\n\nFor example, suppose in a component, after substituting, for some edge (u, v) we have:\n\ns_u * s_v = g * l.\n\nBut s_u is expressed as (x * ... ) and s_v as (x * ... ), so their product must equal g*l.\n\nThis gives an equation in x, which may have zero, one, or multiple solutions.\n\nIf no solution exists, the overall problem is impossible.\n\nIf there's exactly one solution modulo some factors, we can assign x accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do we handle this?\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nSuppose we have a component with three nodes: A connected to B, and B connected to C.\n\nEdge A-B: (g1, l1) → s_A * s_B = g1 * l1.\n\nEdge B-C: (g2, l2) → s_B * s_C = g2 * l2.\n\nNow, express s_B in terms of s_A: s_B = (g1*l1)/s_A.\n\nThen, s_C = (g2*l2)/s_B = (g2*l2) / (g1*l1/s_A) ) = (g2*l2 * s_A) / (g1*l1).\n\nNow, for any other edge involving A, like A-C, if there is one, we can check if the product s_A * s_C equals the expected g*l.\n\nBut in the case of multiple edges, including cycles, this could cause contradictions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n1. Pick a root node.\n\n2. Express each node's s in terms of the root's x.\n\n3. Substitute these expressions into all edges of the component.\n\n4. For each edge, substitute the expressions and check if the product equals the required g*l.\n\n5. If all edges in the component are satisfied, proceed.\n\n6. Otherwise, the component is invalid.\n\nBut how do I handle this substitution systematically?\n\nPerhaps, for each connected component, I can model the relations as a tree, and for each node, track how its s is related to the root's x. Then, for each edge, I can compute the expected product and see if it matches.\n\nWait, but in a graph, there may be multiple paths between two nodes, leading to different expressions. So, when processing a component, I need to ensure that all edges are consistent with the current assignments.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- For each connected component, perform BFS or DFS to assign each node a 'value' that is a function of the root's value.\n\n- For each edge, once both ends are processed, check if the product of their assigned values equals the required g*l.\n\n- If any inconsistency is found, the entire problem is impossible.\n\nBut how to represent the 'functions'? Perhaps each node's s can be expressed as x multiplied by some constant.\n\nWait, let's try this.\n\nAssume that for a connected component, I have a root node R. For each node u in the component, I'll express s_u as x * c_u, where x is the root's value, and c_u is a constant determined by the edges.\n\nThen, for any edge (u, v, g, l), the product s_u * s_v must equal g*l. Substituting, x*c_u * x*c_v = g*l → x² * c_u * c_v = g*l.\n\nSo, for each edge, this equation must hold.\n\nTherefore, for each component, all edges must satisfy that equation.\n\nBut how do I compute c_u for each node?\n\nLet's think of it as a system where each edge contributes an equation to the variables c_u and c_v.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge (u, v, g, l):\n\nc_u * c_v = (g*l) / x².\n\nBut x is the root's value, which is fixed for the component. So, the product c_u * c_v must equal (g*l)/(x²). But this varies per edge, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the c_u's as variables relative to each other, and find if their product along any path between two nodes is consistent.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to model the relations as follows:\n\nEach node's s is a multiple of x, the root's value. So s_u = x * a_u, where a_u is a rational number.\n\nThen, for each edge (u, v, g, l):\n\ns_u * s_v = g*l → x*a_u * x*a_v = g*l → x² a_u a_v = g*l → a_u a_v = (g*l)/(x²)\n\nBut x is the root's value, which is unknown. So, for each edge, this equation must hold.\n\nBut how can we find a consistent set of a_u's that satisfies all these equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each component, we can express a_u in terms of the root's a_1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the root's a_1 is 1, and then each a_u is expressed as a product of certain factors based on the edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of a small example.\n\nSuppose we have a component with two nodes A and B connected by an edge with g=2, l=6.\n\nSo, d = l/g = 3.\n\nSo, the possible (x, y) pairs for (A,B) are (1,3) and (3,1), since x*y=3 and gcd(x,y)=1.\n\nSo, in this case, s_A * s_B = 2*6 =12.\n\nAssuming s_A = 2*1=2, s_B = 2*3=6. Then, 2*6=12, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if s_A=6, s_B=2.\n\nBut wait, the GCD(s_A, s_B) must be 2, and the LCM must be 6.\n\nWait, in the first case, GCD(2,6)=2, LCM=6. Correct.\n\nIn the second case, GCD(6,2)=2, LCM=6. Also correct.\n\nSo, for each edge, there are two possible assignments, depending on the order of x and y.\n\nBut when the graph is connected, the choices made for each edge must be consistent.\n\nSo, for a connected component, the choice of x and y for each edge must form a consistent system.\n\nThis suggests that for each connected component, the edges form a system that can be satisfied with some assignment of a_u's, which are functions of the root's x.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the product of a_u's around any cycle must be 1.\n\nBecause, for any cycle, each edge contributes a factor of a_u * a_v = (g*l)/(x²), but when going around the cycle, the product of all a's must multiply to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key.\n\nFor example, consider a cycle A-B-C-A.\n\nEach edge contributes:\n\na_A * a_B = (g1*l1)/(x²)\n\na_B * a_C = (g2*l2)/(x²)\n\na_C * a_A = (g3*l3)/(x²)\n\nMultiply all three equations together:\n\n(a_A a_B)(a_B a_C)(a_C a_A) = [ (g1 l1)(g2 l2)(g3 l3) ] / x^6\n\nSimplify left side: a_A² a_B² a_C² = (g1 l1 g2 l2 g3 l3) / x^6\n\nBut the right side is (product of all g*l) / x^6.\n\nBut for this to hold, the product of a_A a_B a_C squared must equal the product of (g*l) for all edges in the cycle.\n\nWait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the product of all a_u along a cycle must be 1.\n\nBecause, for each edge in the cycle, a_u * a_v = (g*l)/(x²), and when you go around the cycle, the product of all a_u's along the cycle would be the product of (g*l)/(x²) for each edge.\n\nBut each node is involved twice (as u and v), so the product of all a_u's would be the square of the product of a_u's for the nodes in the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for a cycle, the product of a_u along the cycle must be 1.\n\nBecause, for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = (g*l)/(x²). When you traverse the entire cycle and come back to the start, the product of all a_u's for the nodes in the cycle (each appearing exactly once) multiplied together would be equal to the product of (g*l)/(x²) for each edge, but each a_u appears twice in this product (once as u and once as v). So the total product is (product of (g*l)) / x^{2k}, where k is the number of edges in the cycle.\n\nBut the left side is (product a_u)^something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a cycle, the product of a_u's for all nodes in the cycle must be 1.\n\nBecause, for each edge in the cycle, a_u * a_v = (g*l)/(x²), and when you multiply all such equations for the cycle, the left side becomes (product a_u for each node) squared, and the right side is the product of (g*l) for each edge divided by x^{2m}, where m is the number of edges in the cycle.\n\nSo, (product a_u)^2 = (product (g*l)) / x^{2m}.\n\nBut for the cycle to be consistent, the product a_u for all nodes must be 1, because when you multiply all a_u's around the cycle, you get 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo, for each connected component, the product of a_u's for all nodes in the component must be 1.\n\nBecause, in a component without cycles (a tree), this isn't necessary, but when there's a cycle, the product must be 1 to satisfy all edge constraints.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem could be:\n\n1. For each edge, check if g > l. If any, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component, build a system where each node's a_u is expressed as a function of the root's a_r (a_r is 1 for the root).\n\n3. For each edge, enforce a_u * a_v = (g*l)/(x^2). But x is the root's value, which is unknown.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each component, the product of all a_u's must be 1.\n\nBecause, for each cycle in the component, the product of a_u's must be 1.\n\nSo, for the entire component, the product of all a_u's must be 1.\n\nBut how does that help in assigning the a_u's?\n\nHmm, perhaps this suggests that the component can be considered as a bipartition where the product of a_u's is 1.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to model the problem using BFS and track the possible multiplicative factors for each node.\n\nWait, perhaps each node can have a value that is a product of certain primes, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, choose a root, assign it a value of x, and then for each edge, assign the connected node's value as (g*l)/x. Then, proceed to explore other edges, ensuring consistency.\n\nBut this could lead to conflicts when a node is connected to multiple edges with different constraints.\n\nSo, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node, assign it a value x (some variable, not fixed yet).\n\n- For each node u, keep track of its value as x multiplied by some constant a_u.\n\n- For each edge (u, v, g, l), the product s_u * s_v must equal g*l.\n\nSubstituting, x*a_u * x*a_v = g*l → x² a_u a_v = g*l → a_u a_v = (g*l)/(x²).\n\nSo, for each edge, this equation must hold.\n\nNow, during BFS:\n\n- When visiting node u through edge (u, v), compute a_v as (g*l)/(x² a_u).\n\n- If node v has already been visited, check if the computed a_v matches the existing value. If not, contradiction.\n\n- If node v hasn't been visited, assign a_v and proceed.\n\nBut x is the root's value, which is unknown. How do I handle that?\n\nHmm, perhaps x can be considered as a variable, and for each component, the a_u's are expressed in terms of x. Then, for each edge in the component, the equation a_u a_v = (g*l)/(x²) must hold.\n\nOnce all a_u's are expressed in terms of x, for each edge, the equation must be satisfied. This gives a system of equations that may have solutions only if all equations are compatible.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, the equations can be represented as a system where the a_u's are connected via ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the a_u's are connected via a tree where each a_u is the product of the a_v's along the path from the root.\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nAnother idea: For each component, the a_u's form a multiplicative system. So, for each edge (u, v), a_v = (g*l)/(x² a_u). So, once a_u is known, a_v can be determined.\n\nThus, during BFS, when processing an edge, if the adjacent node hasn't been assigned a value yet, assign it based on the current edge's equation. If it has been assigned, check for consistency.\n\nBut again, x is the root's value, which is unknown. So, this approach might not directly apply.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can treat x as a variable and proceed symbolically. For example, for each component, the a_u's are determined up to a multiplicative factor of x^k, where k is the number of edges processed. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of a_u's for all nodes in the component must equal 1.\n\nBecause, for any cycle in the component, the product of a_u's along the cycle must be 1.\n\nSo, for each component, the product of a_u's across all nodes is 1.\n\nThis can be used to find x.\n\nBut I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of all a_u's in the component is equal to x^{d}, where d is the number of edges in a spanning tree of the component. Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each edge (u, v) introduces the relation a_u a_v = k, where k is (g*l)/(x²), then for a spanning tree of the component, the product of a_u's would be the product of all k's along the edges.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother approach: Try to model the problem for each component as a system of equations and solve for x.\n\nEach component can be treated as a separate system.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each component:\n\n   a. Choose a root node, say node 0.\n\n   b. Assign a variable x to node 0.\n\n   c. For each node u, assign a value a_u, which is a function of x.\n\n   d. For each edge in the component, express a_u a_v = (g*l)/(x²).\n\n   e. Solve this system to find possible values of x.\n\n   f. If no solution exists, the entire problem is impossible.\n\n   g. If a solution exists, assign x and the corresponding a_u's.\n\n2. Once all components are processed, check that for every edge, the product s_u s_v equals g*l.\n\n3. Additionally, check that the GCD of s_u and s_v is g, and the LCM is l.\n\nWait, but checking the GCD and LCM might not be necessary if the product is correct and the GCD is correct.\n\nBecause, as previously noted, if s_u * s_v = g*l, then the LCM is (s_u * s_v) / GCD(s_u, s_v) = (g*l)/g = l, so the LCM condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps the only condition to check is s_u * s_v = g*l and GCD(s_u, s_v) = g.\n\nBut how do we ensure the GCD condition?\n\nWait, for each edge, the GCD(s_u, s_v) must be exactly g, not just a divisor of g.\n\nSo, even if s_u * s_v = g*l, it's possible that the GCD is a divisor of g, but not equal to g.\n\nSo, how can we ensure that the GCD is exactly g?\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because, for example, if g is 2 and l is 6, the possible s_u and s_v are (2,6) or (6,2). Their GCD is 2, which is correct. But if g is 2 and l is 4, the possible s_u and s_v are (2,4) or (4,2). GCD is 2, correct.\n\nWait, but what if g is 2 and l is 8. Then, possible s_u and s_v are (2, 8), (8, 2), (4,4) (but wait, 4 and 4 have GCD 4, which is larger than g=2. So that's invalid.)\n\nWait, so in that case, the possible pairs are only (2,8) and (8,2), because (4,4) would have GCD 4, which is larger than g=2, thus invalid.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible pairs are those where x and y are coprimes, x*y = d = l/g, and the GCD of x and y is 1.\n\nThus, for each edge, the possible (x, y) pairs must have GCD 1 and x*y = d.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible (x, y) pairs are limited.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each edge, find all possible (x, y) pairs, then model the graph as a system where the edges' (x, y) choices must be consistent across the entire component.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, as each edge can have multiple possible pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each component, the possible (x, y) pairs for each edge must form a consistent assignment.\n\nSo, for each component, we can model the possible (x, y) pairs for each edge and see if there exists a way to assign them such that the constraints are satisfied across the entire component.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative idea is to model each node's value as a variable and each edge as a constraint that s_u * s_v = g*l. Then, the problem reduces to solving this system of equations.\n\nBut solving such a system is non-trivial, especially when there are multiple solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each edge, compute d = l/g. Check that d is integer. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Choose a root node.\n\n   b. Assign a variable x to the root.\n\n   c. For each node u in the component, express s_u in terms of x. For example, s_root = x, s_child = (g*l)/x, etc.\n\n   d. For each edge in the component, check if the product s_u * s_v equals g*l. If not, output NO.\n\n3. After all components are processed, for each edge, compute s_u and s_v, and check if their GCD is exactly g.\n\nWait, but this misses the point that for each edge, the possible (s_u, s_v) pairs are constrained by their GCD being g and LCM being l.\n\nSo, even if the product is correct, the GCD might not be.\n\nBut earlier analysis shows that the product being correct and the GCD being correct ensures the LCM is correct, but not vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps after ensuring the product, we need to also verify the GCD.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nGiven s_u * s_v = g*l, and GCD(s_u, s_v) = g.\n\nWe can express s_u = g * a, s_v = g * b.\n\nThen, a * b = l/g, and GCD(a, b) must be 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible (a, b) pairs are those where a * b = l/g, and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible (a, b) pairs are the same as the possible (x, y) pairs discussed earlier.\n\nThus, for each edge, the possible (a, b) pairs are limited.\n\nSo, for each component, the a and b assignments must be consistent across all edges.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a system where each edge enforces a certain relation between the a and b variables of its endpoints.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the a and b variables can be expressed in terms of the root's a value.\n\nFor example, choosing a root with a = 1, then each connected node's a is determined by the edges.\n\nBut when edges form a cycle, the a's must loop back correctly.\n\nSo, the algorithm would involve:\n\nFor each component:\n\n1. Choose a root.\n\n2. Assign a = 1 to the root.\n\n3. For each edge, determine the possible (a, b) pairs and assign accordingly.\n\n4. During BFS, when visiting a new node, compute its a based on the edge's a and b possibilities.\n\n5. If a conflict is found (same node has two different a values), output NO.\n\n6. Once all nodes are processed, for each edge, check if the a and b values are such that their product is l/g and their GCD is 1.\n\n7. Also, for each node, ensure that all edges connected to it are satisfied.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Read the input and construct the graph.\n\n2. For each edge, check if g > l. If any, output NO.\n\n3. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Perform BFS to assign a values to each node.\n\n   b. For each node u, track its a value.\n\n   c. For each edge, ensure that the product of a_u and a_v equals l/g, and that GCD(a_u, a_v) is 1.\n\n   d. If any edge fails these checks, output NO.\n\n4. After all components are processed, output YES and the s values, where s_u = g_u * a_u for each node.\n\nWait, but what is g_u? Oh, wait, no. Because for each node u, s_u is the product of the a_u and g of the root. Or perhaps I'm mixing variables.\n\nWait, earlier substitution was:\n\ns_u = g * a_u, and s_v = g * a_v, where a_u and a_v are coprimes and a_u * a_v = l/g.\n\nSo, for the entire component, the root's a is 1, and other a's are determined based on edges.\n\nThus, the s values are determined as s_u = g * a_u, where a_u is assigned during BFS.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each component, assign a values based on the edges.\n\n- Compute s_u = g_u * a_u.\n\nWait, no, because each edge's g is specific to that edge. So, perhaps the root's g is 1, and each node's a is determined based on the edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root's s is x, and for each edge, s_u * s_v = g*l.\n\nThus, for each edge, the product of the two s's is known.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps model the problem as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of a certain base value, and the edges enforce multiplicative constraints. This can be modeled using a BFS where each node's value is determined by the edges, and any conflicts are detected early.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   a. Choose a starting node, assign it a value of 1.\n\n   b. For each edge from this node,",
