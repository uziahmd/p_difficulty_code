Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial sum of the found cards can be calculated, and then we need to determine how many more cards (with values between -x and x) are needed so that when added to this sum, the total becomes zero.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that Natasha hid all his cards, but he found some. So the found cards' sum is S. He wants the total sum (including the ones he hasn't found yet) to be zero. But since Natasha hid all, maybe the found cards are a subset of the original. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the found cards are part of the original set. So the total sum after considering the found and the missing ones must be zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps the found cards are a subset of all possible cards. So, the sum of the found cards is S. To make the total sum zero, the sum of all found plus the sum of the missing ones should be zero. But the missing ones are the other cards that were hidden by Natasha. Since the initial set includes all integers from -x to x, excluding the found ones? Or wait, no: the problem says that Natasha hid all of them, but Vanya found n of them. So the initial set is the complete set of all possible cards with values from -x to x. And Natasha took some cards and hid them, but Vanya found n of them. So the total sum of all the cards is zero because each positive has a corresponding negative. So the sum of all the cards is zero. Then, the sum of the found cards is S. So the sum of the missing (hidden) cards is -S. Because S + (-S) = 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: what's the minimal number of cards that Vanya needs to find such that the sum of these missing cards is equal to -S. But since the missing cards are a subset of the possible cards (each with absolute value <=x), and the found cards are a subset as well.\n\nWait, no. Because the found cards are already part of the initial set, so the sum S is the sum of the found, and the sum of the missing is T, so S + T = 0. So T = -S.\n\nBut since the missing cards are part of the initial set, their sum can be any integer that allows the sum to be T. But since each card can be any integer between -x and x, including the found ones. Wait, no, the found ones are already part of the initial set. So the missing ones are the remaining ones in the initial set, which are not found.\n\nWait, no. Maybe the initial set is all the possible cards, which is an infinite number? No, wait, the problem says you can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x. So for example, if x=2, there are infinitely many cards with values -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So Natasha hid some of them, and Vanya found n of them. So the sum of the found is S, and the sum of the hidden (which are the rest of the initial set) is T. Then S + T = 0, so T = -S.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal number of cards that Vanya needs to find such that T can be achieved with the remaining cards (the hidden ones). Wait, no. Wait, Vanya found some of the initial set, and the sum of the found is S. The hidden cards are those that Natasha took, and their sum is T = -S. Now, the question is, what's the minimal number of additional cards that Vanya needs to find (from the initial set) so that the sum of the found cards (including these new ones) is S' such that S' + T = 0. Wait, no. Because the initial set includes all the possible cards, and the found cards are a subset of that. The sum of the found cards is S. The sum of the hidden (Natasha's) is T = -S. Now, Vanya wants to find some of the hidden cards to add to his found set, so that the new sum is zero. So the new sum would be S + S_new = 0. So S_new = -S. But the S_new is the sum of the additional found",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card has a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum for Hidden Cards**: To make the total sum zero, the sum of the hidden cards must be \\( -S \\).\n3. **Check Feasibility**: Check if it's possible to achieve the required sum with the remaining possible cards (each with absolute value ≤ x). If not, determine the minimal number of additional cards needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Additional Cards**: If the required sum is achievable, determine the minimal number of cards needed by considering the maximum contribution each card can make towards the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\nrequired = -current_sum\n\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_contribution = x * 1 if required > 0 else x * (-1)\n    min_cards = abs(required) // max_contribution\n    if min_cards == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n2. **Required Sum Adjustment**: The sum of the hidden cards must be the negative of the found sum to balance the total to zero.\n3. **Feasibility Check**: If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, check if the required sum can be achieved with the available card values.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Calculate the minimal number of cards needed by considering the maximum possible contribution each card can make towards the required sum. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the required sum by the maximum possible contribution per card, ensuring we handle both positive and negative contributions correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
