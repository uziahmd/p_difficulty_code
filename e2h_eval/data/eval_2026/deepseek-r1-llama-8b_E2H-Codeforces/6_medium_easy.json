Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum to exactly x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as minimal as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Since n can be up to 2*10^5, any O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. For each voucher, calculate its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher whose duration is exactly x minus this duration.\n\n2. But how do we efficiently find such vouchers that don't overlap with the current one?\n\nWait, but even if we can find all possible pairs where durations add up to x, checking whether they are non-overlapping could take time. So perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in some way.\n\nAnother idea: group vouchers by their duration. For each voucher, compute what duration it needs (x - current_duration), then look for vouchers with that duration that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut how do we check for non-overlapping efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher i, we can find all vouchers j with duration d = x - duration_i, and then check if they are non-overlapping and keep track of the minimal cost.\n\nBut again, for each i, finding j's could be expensive if not done properly.\n\nWait, maybe we can sort the vouchers based on their end times. Then, for a given voucher i, all possible j's that end before i start can be found quickly using binary search. Similarly, those that start after i ends can be found quickly.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n\n- Create a dictionary mapping each duration to a list of vouchers. So for each duration d, we have all vouchers with that duration.\n\n- Also, create a sorted list of all vouchers' end times, along with their index or something else needed.\n\nWait, maybe for each voucher, we can store li, ri, cost, and duration. Then, for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j where duration_j is x - duration_i. Then, among these j's, we need to find those that either end before i starts or start after i ends.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such j's.\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, we can have two lists:\n\n- A list of vouchers ending before a certain time.\n\n- And a list of vouchers starting after a certain time.\n\nWait, but that might not be feasible because for each query, the time is dynamic.\n\nAlternatively, for all vouchers, we can pre-sort them by their end times and also by their start times.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, when looking for j's with duration d, we can:\n\n1. Find all j's where j's end < i's start.\n\nThese j's can be found by binary searching in the list of vouchers sorted by end time.\n\n2. Find all j's where j's start > i's end.\n\nAgain, we can have a sorted list of vouchers sorted by start time, and perform a binary search to find those j's that start after i's end.\n\nWait, that seems promising.\n\nSo here's a more detailed plan:\n\n- For all vouchers, compute their duration, and group them by duration. So for each d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n- Sort the entire list of vouchers by their end time. Let's call this list sorted_end.\n\n- Sort the entire list of vouchers by their start time. Call this list sorted_start.\n\n- For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute the required duration d = x - duration_i.\n\n   b. Check if d is present in our duration map. If not, skip.\n\n   c. For each voucher j in the d group:\n\n      i. Check if j and i are the same voucher. If yes, skip.\n\n      ii. Check if j doesn't overlap with i. So either j ends before i starts or j starts after i ends.\n\n      iii. If they don't overlap, calculate the total cost and keep track of the minimum.\n\nBut wait, this would be O(n * m), where m is the number of vouchers with duration d, which could be up to n. So for n=2e5, this would be 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's definitely not feasible. So we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible duration d, precompute all vouchers with that duration and sort them in a way that allows us to quickly find compatible j's for a given i.\n\nFor example, for each d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- sorted_end_d: list of vouchers with duration d, sorted by end time.\n\n- sorted_start_d: list of vouchers with duration d, sorted by start time.\n\nThen, for a given voucher i, for d = x - duration_i:\n\n- To find j's where j ends before i starts, we can perform a binary search in sorted_end_d to find the largest end <= i's start.\n\n- Similarly, to find j's where j starts after i ends, we can binary search in sorted_start_d for the smallest start >= i's end + 1.\n\nWait, but for j's in d group, how do we get their costs?\n\nAh right, because we need the minimal total cost. So for each d, we need to process vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost for non-overlapping j's.\n\nWait, maybe for each d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by end time, and for each position in this list, we can track the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the start time sorted list, for each position, track the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nSo, for each d, pre-process two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list by end time, and for each position, the minimal cost up to that point (so that any j with end <= i's start can contribute the minimal cost).\n\n2. A sorted list by start time, and for each position, the minimal cost from that point onwards (so that any j with start >= i's end can contribute the minimal cost).\n\nThen, for each voucher i, for d = x - duration_i, we can:\n\n- Binary search in sorted_end_d to find the maximum end <= i.start.\n\n   Among these, find the minimal cost.\n\n- Binary search in sorted_start_d to find the minimum start >= i.end + 1.\n\n   Among these, find the minimal cost.\n\nThe minimal total cost would be the sum of i's cost and the minimal cost found in either of the above cases.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where a voucher j is both in sorted_end_d and sorted_start_d for different d's? No, each voucher is in exactly one group per d.\n\nWait, no. Each voucher has a fixed duration, so for each d, each voucher belongs to exactly one group (the group of their own duration). So for a given d, the sorted_end_d and sorted_start_d contain only the vouchers with that duration.\n\nSo, for each d, we can precompute the prefix minima for the end-sorted list, and the suffix minima for the start-sorted list.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n- Collect all vouchers with duration d. Let's call this list D.\n\n- Sort D by end time (ri) in ascending order. Let's call this sortedEndD.\n\n- Precompute an array minCostEnd, where minCostEnd[i] is the minimal cost from D[0..i].\n\n- Similarly, sort D by start time (li) in ascending order. Call this sortedStartD.\n\n- Precompute an array minCostStart, where minCostStart[i] is the minimal cost from D[i..end].\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for any voucher i, when looking for j's with duration d = x - duration_i, we can:\n\n- In sortedEndD, find the latest j where j's end <= i's start. Then, the minimal cost for such j's is minCostEnd up to that index.\n\n- In sortedStartD, find the earliest j where j's start >= i's end + 1. Then, the minimal cost for such j's is minCostStart from that index onwards.\n\nWait, but how to handle the binary search correctly.\n\nLet me think about the sortedEndD list. For each j in this list, j's end is ri.\n\nWe want j's end <= i's li (since j ends before i starts).\n\nSo for i's li, we can perform a binary search in the sortedEndD's end times to find the largest ri <= li.\n\nOnce we find that index, the minimal cost up to that index is minCostEnd[index]. But if there are multiple j's at that index, it's the minimal cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for the sortedStartD list, each j's li is the start time. We want j's li >= i's ri + 1. So for i's ri, we can binary search in the sortedStartD's li to find the first li >= i.ri + 1.\n\nOnce found, the minimal cost from that index to the end is minCostStart[index].\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, compute their durations.\n\n2. For each d, collect the vouchers, sort by end, compute minCostEnd.\n\n   Also, sort by start, compute minCostStart.\n\n3. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d_required = x - duration_i.\n\n   b. If d_required is not in our duration map, skip.\n\n   c. Else, get the sortedEndD and sortedStartD for d_required.\n\n   d. Find in sortedEndD the latest voucher j where j.end <= i.start.\n\n      - The minimal cost is the minCostEnd up to that index.\n\n   e. Find in sortedStartD the earliest voucher j where j.start >= i.end + 1.\n\n      - The minimal cost is the minCostStart from that index.\n\n   f. Take the minimal total cost between the two options (if any).\n\n   g. Keep track of the global minimal cost.\n\n4. After processing all i's, if the minimal cost is found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nThis approach should be efficient because for each i, the operations are O(log m), where m is the number of vouchers with duration d_required.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach voucher has li, ri, cost, duration.\n\nWe'll need a dictionary where keys are durations, and values are tuples:\n\nEach tuple contains:\n\n- sortedEndD: a list of vouchers sorted by ri, along with their indices.\n\n   Wait, no, perhaps just a list of the vouchers (li, ri, cost), sorted by ri.\n\n   Then, for each voucher in sortedEndD, we can have their cost.\n\n   Then, the minCostEnd array is built as the running minimum.\n\nSimilarly for sortedStartD: sorted by li, and minCostStart is the running minimum from the end.\n\nWait, no. For minCostStart, it's the minimal cost from that position to the end. So for sortedStartD, we can compute a suffix array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to len(sortedStartD)-1.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each d in duration_map:\n\n   sortedEndD = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\n   min_cost_end = []\n   current_min = infinity\n   for voucher in sortedEndD:\n       current_min = min(current_min, voucher.cost)\n       min_cost_end.append(current_min)\n\n   sortedStartD = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.li)\n   min_cost_start = [infinity] * len(sortedStartD)\n   current_min = infinity\n   for i in range(len(sortedStartD)-1, -1, -1):\n       current_min = min(current_min, sortedStartD[i].cost)\n       min_cost_start[i] = current_min\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\nd = x - i.duration\n\nif d not in duration_map: continue\n\nelse:\n\n   end_list = duration_map[d].sortedEndD\n\n   # find the largest j in end_list where j.ri <= i.li\n\n   low = 0, high = len(end_list)-1\n\n   res = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low+high)//2\n\n       if end_list[mid].ri <= i.li:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           low = mid + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid - 1\n\n   if res != -1:\n\n       min_cost = end_list[res].cost\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost = infinity\n\n   # Now for start_list\n\n   start_list = duration_map[d].sortedStartD\n\n   target = i.ri + 1\n\n   low = 0, high = len(start_list)-1\n\n   res = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low+high)//2\n\n       if start_list[mid].li >= target:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n       else:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n   if res != -1:\n\n       min_cost_start = start_list[res].min_cost_start\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_start = infinity\n\n   total_cost = i.cost + min_cost (from end) and i.cost + min_cost_start (from start)\n\n   take the minimal of these two, and compare to the global minimal.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each d, the sortedEndD is a list of vouchers, sorted by ri. So for each voucher in end_list, we can access their cost directly.\n\nSimilarly for the start_list.\n\nSo, the code outline is clear.\n\nNow, handling the binary searches correctly is crucial.\n\nBut wait, what about when res is -1 in either case? Then, that option is not available.\n\nSo, for each i, we can consider both possibilities, and if any gives a valid j, we take the minimal.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial setup.\n\nWe'll need to create the duration_map, which maps each duration to a structure containing the sortedEndD, sortedStartD, min_cost_end, and min_cost_start.\n\nWait, no. Because for each d, we can precompute the sortedEndD, min_cost_end, sortedStartD, and min_cost_start. So during preprocessing, for each d, we store all four.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can precompute these four arrays and store them in the duration_map as a tuple.\n\nSo, during the initial processing:\n\n- For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li +1.\n\n- Add the voucher to duration_map[duration], which is initially a list.\n\nThen, for each d in duration_map:\n\n   sortedEndD = sorted(vouchers in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\n   min_cost_end = [infinite] * len(sortedEndD)\n\n   current_min = infinite\n\n   for i in range(len(sortedEndD)):\n\n       current_min = min(current_min, sortedEndD[i].cost)\n\n       min_cost_end[i] = current_min\n\n   sortedStartD = sorted(vouchers in duration_map[d], key=lambda x: x.li)\n\n   min_cost_start = [infinite] * len(sortedStartD)\n\n   current_min = infinite\n\n   for i in range(len(sortedStartD)-1, -1, -1):\n\n       current_min = min(current_min, sortedStartD[i].cost)\n\n       min_cost_start[i] = current_min\n\n   duration_map[d] = {\n\n       'end_list': sortedEndD,\n\n       'end_min': min_cost_end,\n\n       'start_list': sortedStartD,\n\n       'start_min': min_cost_start,\n\n   }\n\nWait, but vouchers in the same d group may have the same li, but that's okay because when we sort by li, they will be grouped together.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher i:\n\nWe compute d_required = x - duration_i.\n\nIf d_required is not in duration_map, skip.\n\nElse, get the end_list and start_list, etc.\n\nThen perform the binary searches as discussed.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate the durations.\n\nFirst voucher: 3-1+1=3.\n\nSecond: 2-1+1=2.\n\nThird:6-5+1=2.\n\nFourth:2-1+1=2.\n\nSo for x=5, the required pairs are vouchers with durations 3 and 2.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, compute d_required = 5 - duration_i.\n\nFor i being the first voucher (duration 3): d_required is 2.\n\nSo look for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nIn this group, we have three vouchers: the second, third, fourth.\n\nFor each of these, check if they don't overlap with the first voucher.\n\nThe first voucher's end is 3. So any voucher j in duration 2 must either end before 1 (which none do), or start after 3.\n\nLooking at the j's:\n\nSecond voucher: starts at 1, ends at 2 → overlaps.\n\nThird voucher: starts at 5, ends at 6 → doesn't overlap.\n\nFourth voucher: starts at 1, ends at 2 → overlaps.\n\nSo the only possible j is the third voucher. Its cost is 1. So total cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the sample answer.\n\nSo, the code would find this.\n\nNow, for the third voucher (duration 2), d_required is 3. So it looks for vouchers with duration 3. Only the first voucher exists.\n\nCheck if the first voucher ends before 5 starts (5 is the start of the third voucher). The first voucher ends at 3, which is before 5. So the two vouchers are non-overlapping. The cost is 4+1=5 as well.\n\nSo both i and j are considered.\n\nThus, the minimal cost is 5.\n\nIn the sample, the output is 5.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nEach voucher has duration 3. So x is 2. So no two vouchers can sum to x. Thus, output is -1.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All vouchers have the same duration, which is x/2. But if x is even, and all have x/2, but no two are non-overlapping.\n\nSo, the code should return -1.\n\nEdge Case 2: Two vouchers, one with duration x-1, and another with 1. But they are overlapping, so no solution.\n\nEdge Case 3: Vouchers have varying durations, but the minimal cost is achieved by taking one from the end and one from the start.\n\nAnother edge case: a voucher j that is compatible with multiple i's, but the minimal cost comes from a specific j.\n\nNow, considering the data structures, for each voucher, the binary searches are O(log m), which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines, each line has li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute duration for each.\n\nCreate the duration_map as a dictionary, where each key is a duration, and the value is a struct (as a dictionary) that holds:\n\n- end_list: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- end_min: list of minimal costs up to each index.\n\n- start_list: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\n- start_min: list of minimal costs from each index onward.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\nCompute d_required = x - duration_i.\n\nIf d_required not in duration_map: continue.\n\nElse, get the d_required's struct.\n\nPerform the binary search on the end_list for j's that end <= i.li.\n\nIf any found, get the minimal cost from end_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, perform binary search on the start_list for j's that start >= i.ri +1.\n\nIf any found, get the minimal cost from start_min from that index.\n\nTake the minimal between the two, add to i's cost, and keep track of the global minimal.\n\nFinally, output the global minimal if found, else -1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the vouchers.\n\nEach voucher can be represented as a tuple or a class instance. Perhaps a class is better for clarity.\n\nSo, let's define a Voucher class:\n\nclass Voucher:\n    def __init__(self, li, ri, cost):\n        self.li = li\n        self.ri = ri\n        self.cost = cost\n        self.duration = ri - li + 1\n\nBut since in Python, creating a class may have some overhead, but for 2e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\nBut a class is more readable.\n\nNow, in the code:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( Voucher(l, r, c) )\n\nThen, build the duration_map.\n\nduration_map = {}\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n\n    d = v.duration\n\n    if d not in duration_map:\n\n        duration_map[d] = {\n\n            'end_list': [],\n\n            'end_min': [],\n\n            'start_list': [],\n\n            'start_min': [],\n\n        }\n\n    duration_map[d]['end_list'].append(v)\n\n    duration_map[d]['start_list'].append(v)\n\nWait, no. Because for each d, the end_list and start_list are the same list of vouchers. So, perhaps for each d, the end_list is a sorted list, and the start_list is another sorted list.\n\nWait, no. For each d, the end_list is the list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by ri. Similarly for start_list.\n\nSo, for each d in duration_map:\n\n   end_list = sorted(v for v in duration_map[d]['vouchers'], key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\n   start_list = sorted(v for v in duration_map[d]['vouchers'], key=lambda x: x.li)\n\nWait, but this would require for each d, to collect all vouchers, sort them, and then precompute the min_cost arrays.\n\nSo, perhaps the preprocessing step is:\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(lambda: {'data': []})\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n\n    duration_map[v.duration]['data'].append(v)\n\nThen, for each d in duration_map:\n\n   data = duration_map[d]['data']\n\n   # Sort by end time (ri)\n\n   end_list = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\n   # Precompute min_cost_end\n\n   min_cost_end = []\n\n   current_min = float('inf')\n\n   for voucher in end_list:\n\n       current_min = min(current_min, voucher.cost)\n\n       min_cost_end.append(current_min)\n\n   # Sort by start time (li)\n\n   start_list = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x.li)\n\n   # Precompute min_cost_start\n\n   min_cost_start = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n\n   current_min = float('inf')\n\n   for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n\n       current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n\n       min_cost_start[i] = current_min\n\n   # Update the duration_map\n\n   duration_map[d]['end_list'] = end_list\n\n   duration_map[d]['min_cost_end'] = min_cost_end\n\n   duration_map[d]['start_list'] = start_list\n\n   duration_map[d]['min_cost_start'] = min_cost_start\n\nWait, but in this way, for each d, the end_list and start_list are the same as the data, but sorted differently. So, for each voucher in the end_list, we can access their cost.\n\nSo, during the processing of each voucher i:\n\nd_required = x - i.duration\n\nif d_required not in duration_map:\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    info = duration_map[d_required]\n\n    # Check for end-based j's\n\n    end_list = info['end_list']\n\n    target = i.li\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = len(end_list) -1\n\n    best = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if end_list[mid].ri <= target:\n\n            best = mid\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    if best != -1:\n\n        min_end_cost = info['min_cost_end'][best]\n\n    else:\n\n        min_end_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Check for start-based j's\n\n    start_list = info['start_list']\n\n    target_start = i.ri + 1\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = len(start_list) -1\n\n    best_start = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if start_list[mid].li >= target_start:\n\n            best_start = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    if best_start != -1:\n\n        min_start_cost = info['min_cost_start'][best_start]\n\n    else:\n\n        min_start_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Now, the minimal cost is the min of the two, added to i's cost.\n\n    total_cost = i.cost\n\n    if min_end_cost != float('inf'):\n\n        total_cost += min_end_cost\n\n    if min_start_cost != float('inf'):\n\n        if total_cost > min_start_cost + i.cost:\n\n            total_cost = i.cost + min_start_cost\n\n    # Or, better to compute both and choose the minimal.\n\n    candidates = []\n\n    if min_end_cost != float('inf'):\n\n        candidates.append(i.cost + min_end_cost)\n\n    if min_start_cost != float('inf'):\n\n        candidates.append(i.cost + min_start_cost)\n\n    if candidates:\n\n        current_min = min(candidates)\n\n        if current_min < global_min:\n\n            global_min = current_min\n\nSo, in code, for each i, we compute the two possible options and take the minimal.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial state.\n\nInitialize global_min as infinity.\n\nAfter processing all i's, if global_min is still infinity, output -1. Else, output global_min.\n\nNow, the code structure is clear.\n\nBut wait, the code has to make sure that i and j are different vouchers. How?\n\nBecause in the preprocessing, for each d, the end_list and start_list include all vouchers with that duration, including possibly i itself.\n\nWait, no. Because the end_list is all vouchers with duration d. So when i has duration d_required, which is x - i.duration, then the j's are in the d_required group. So, if i's duration is d_required, then d_required is x - i.duration → i.duration + j.duration = x. But if j is also in the same group as i, then j.duration is equal to i.duration. So, j.duration = i.duration → i.duration + i.duration = x → 2*i.duration =x → i.duration = x/2.\n\nBut in this case, the code would find j's in the same group as i, but when looking for j's, the code may pick i itself as a j, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, so in the case where i has duration d, and d_required is d, then the j's are in the same group as i. So, when processing i, we may pick j=i, which is invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid selecting i as j.\n\nHmm, so this is a potential bug.\n\nHow to handle this?\n\nWhen i and j are in the same group, and d_required is i.duration, then when we look for j's, j could be i.\n\nThus, in the code, when d_required == i.duration, we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nSo, how to handle that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is insufficient because when d_required is the same as i's duration, the code might pick i itself as a j, leading to an invalid pair.\n\nSo, how to prevent this.\n\nIdea: For each i, when d_required is equal to i.duration, then in the end_list and start_list, the j's could include i itself. So when performing the binary search, j can be i.\n\nThus, when d_required is equal to i.duration, we need to ensure that j is not i.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nwhen d_required == i.duration:\n\n   when looking for j's in the end_list, exclude i.\n\nSimilarly for the start_list.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach: For each i, when d_required is in the duration_map, proceed as before, but when d_required == i.duration, then in the end_list and start_list, remove i from consideration.\n\nBut that could complicate things.\n\nAlternative Idea: When checking j's, for each j found in the end_list or start_list, ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to process vouchers in such a way that j cannot be i.\n\nWait, but j is in the group of d_required, which is x - i.duration.\n\nBut when d_required is equal to i.duration, then j is in the same group as i.\n\nThus, in the code, when d_required == i.duration, we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nSo, in the code, when d_required == i.duration, during the binary search, we need to avoid selecting j=i.\n\nBut how to do this without modifying the list.\n\nAlternatively, when d_required == i.duration, after finding the best index, check if the voucher at that index is i. If yes, then we need to look for the next possible index.\n\nBut that could complicate the binary search.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each j in the end_list and start_list, when d_required == i.duration, check if j is i. If yes, skip it.\n\nBut during the binary search, it's hard to know whether the voucher at a particular index is i.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the binary search, after finding the best index, we can iterate through the nearby indices to find the first j that is not i.\n\nBut that could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each voucher i, when d_required is i.duration, after finding the best index, if the voucher at that index is i, then we need to find the next voucher in the end_list or start_list that doesn't include i.\n\nBut this requires that the end_list and start_list are ordered, and that i appears exactly once.\n\nWait, but i can appear in the end_list and start_list for d_required.\n\nWait, for the same d_required, i is present in both end_list and start_list.\n\nSo, during the binary search for the end_list, if the best index is pointing to i, then we need to find the next voucher in the end_list that comes after i.\n\nWait, but i is in the end_list, but the end_list is sorted by ri.\n\nSo, in the end_list, if i is present, it's in the correct place based on its ri.\n\nSo, during the binary search, when the best index is pointing to i, we can adjust the binary search to find the next voucher that comes after i in the end_list.\n\nBut that would complicate the binary search.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the best index, if the voucher is i, we can set best to -1, and look for the next voucher in the end_list that is not i.\n\nBut that's not straightforward.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is more complicated than I thought.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since i and j must be different vouchers, regardless of their durations, perhaps during the binary search, when d_required is equal to i.duration, we can ignore any j that is i.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nWait, perhaps during the binary search, when we find a voucher j that is i, we can note that and then look for the next possible voucher.\n\nBut this would require modifying the binary search logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps, for each voucher i, when d_required is equal to i.duration, the code can process the j's in the end_list and start_list, and for each j, check if j is i. If yes, skip; else, consider.\n\nBut this approach would have to loop through the j's that are in the end_list and start_list, which could be O(m) time, which is not acceptable.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is flawed because it doesn't account for i and j being the same voucher when d_required equals i.duration.\n\nSo, perhaps, in the preprocessing, for each d, we should not include i in the end_list and start_list when d_required equals i.duration.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because when d_required is x - i.duration, which could be equal to i.duration, and thus, j is in the same group.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that i can be part of the j's when d_required is i.duration.\n\nThus, in the code, when d_required is equal to i.duration, the j's are in the same group as i, and thus, j can be i.\n\nSo, to avoid that, perhaps when d_required is equal to i.duration, the code can process the j's, but ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when d_required is equal to i.duration, we can skip i when considering j's.\n\nWait, but how to know if j is i in the end_list and start_list.\n\nBecause in the end_list, j is a Voucher object, and comparing j to i can be done via identity.\n\nBut during the binary search, the end_list is a list of Voucher objects, so for each voucher in the end_list, we can check if it is i.\n\nBut this is O(1) per check.\n\nSo, during the binary search, when d_required == i.duration, for each candidate j in the end_list, after finding the best index, we can check if the voucher at that index is i. If yes, then we need to find the next voucher in the end_list that is not i.\n\nBut this complicates the binary search.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when d_required is equal to i.duration, the code can process the end_list and start_list by excluding i.\n\nBut that would require making copies of the end_list and start_list, which is not efficient.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is more complex than I thought. Maybe the initial approach is sufficient, and the case where i and j are the same is handled correctly.\n\nWait, in the code, when d_required is equal to i.duration, and j is i, the code would try to add i.cost + i.cost to the total, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code must ensure that i and j are different.\n\nThus, the code must be adjusted to handle this case.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each i, when processing j's, check if j is i. If yes, skip.\n\nBut this is difficult because during the binary search, we don't know which voucher j is.\n\nThus, perhaps, in the code, after finding the best index in the end_list, we can check whether the voucher is i itself, and if yes, then skip.\n\nBut this is not efficient, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps in practice, this situation can be avoided because the vouchers are non-overlapping if i and j are different.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\", so i and j can't be the same voucher.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the problem says that you have to choose exactly two vouchers. So, for each i and j, i and j must be different vouchers. So, the same voucher can't be used twice.\n\nSo, in the code, when i and j are different vouchers.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the two vouchers must not intersect, but it's allowed if the two vouchers are the same in terms of days, but the two vouchers must be different.\n\nWait, no, the vouchers can have same days but different durations.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible.\"\n\nBut if the duration is x, and the two vouchers are the same in duration, but are non-overlapping.\n\nBut I'm not sure, maybe the two vouchers can be same duration.\n\nBut the problem says \"exactly two vouchers\", which implies that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nWait, the question says \"i≠j\". So, the two vouchers must be different vouchers.\n\nSo, the vouchers must be distinct.\n\nSo, for the same voucher, if the two vouchers are same, but the problem says i and j must be different.\n\nSo, the code must select two different vouchers.\n\nThus, when choosing i and j, it's possible that two vouchers have the same duration but are non-overlapping.\n\nThus, in the sample input, when the two vouchers are the same, but in different positions, but same duration, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle the scenario where two vouchers are from the same duration.\n\nBut in the first sample, the code chooses the first and third vouchers, which are different.\n\nThus, back to the original issue: how to prevent selecting j = i when d_required is equal to i.duration.\n\nThus, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nWhen d_required is equal to i.duration, and the voucher j is i, then we skip.\n\nBut to do that, perhaps during the binary search, after finding the best index, we can check if the voucher is i.\n\nBut that requires checking each voucher in the list, which can be O(m) time.\n\nThus, perhaps, for each d, we can have an index map that for each voucher, points to its position in the end_list and start_list.\n\nBut that would require additional memory.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each d, create a list of end_list and a list of start_list, and for each voucher in the",
