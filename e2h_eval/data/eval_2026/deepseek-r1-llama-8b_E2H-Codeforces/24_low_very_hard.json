She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a state space problem where each state is defined by the current position of the cursor and the range of currently open tabs (a and b). But since a and b change as tabs are closed, this could get complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider what actions are necessary. To close the tabs outside [l, r], she needs to:\n\n1. Close all tabs to the left of l.\n2. Close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut the order might matter. Also, she can choose to close left or right first.\n\nLet me outline possible steps:\n\n- First, she needs to position herself at a place where she can close the left tabs. So she might need to move left to l, then close left. Similarly, for the right side, she might need to move right to r, then close right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close all tabs to the left without moving all the way to l. Wait, no. Because when she closes to the left, it's all tabs to the left of the current position. So if she's at position i, closing left will remove all tabs <i. Similarly, closing right removes all >i.\n\nSo, the strategy depends on whether she can close the required regions in a way that minimizes movement.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down into parts.\n\nCase 1: No need to do anything. That is, when l=1 and r=n, meaning all tabs are already in the desired segment. Then the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, she needs to close tabs outside [l, r].\n\nLet me consider the initial situation:\n\nShe starts at pos. The current a is 1 and b is n.\n\nShe needs to make sure that after some operations, a = l and b = r.\n\nSo, she needs to perform two actions: close left and/or close right.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because closing left will set a to the current position. So to get a >= l, she needs to have her current position >= l, and then close left. Similarly, to get b <= r, she needs to be at position <= r, and then close right.\n\nWait, no. Let's think:\n\nWhen she's at position i, and she closes left, all tabs to the left of i (i.e., <i) are closed. So after this, the new a becomes i. Similarly, closing right will close all tabs >i, setting b to i.\n\nSo, to ensure that a is l, she must have closed all tabs before l. That means, she needs to be at a position >= l, then close left. Because closing left at position x will set a to x, which needs to be >= l.\n\nSimilarly, to set b to r, she needs to be at a position <= r, then close right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Move to a position where you can close the left part (to reach a >= l), then close left.\n- Then, move to a position where you can close the right part (to reach b <= r), then close right.\n\nOr the other way around: close right first, then left.\n\nWhich approach is better depends on the positions and the required l and r.\n\nSo, let's model the steps.\n\nFirst, we need to decide the order of closing: left first or right first.\n\nWe can compute both possibilities and take the minimal steps.\n\nLet's outline the steps for each scenario.\n\nScenario A: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from initial position to some x, where x is >= l.\n   At x, close left. Now a becomes x.\n\n   Time taken: number of steps to move from pos to x, plus 1 step for closing.\n\n2. Now, a is x. We need to move to some y, where y <= r.\n   At y, close right. Now b becomes y.\n\n   Time taken: steps from x to y, plus 1 step for closing.\n\nTotal steps: (steps to x) + 1 + (steps from x to y) + 1.\n\nWait, but what is x and y? For x, it's the position where we close left. Since after closing left, a becomes x, which must be >= l.\n\nSo, x can be any position",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within this segment open. The solution involves considering different strategies for moving the cursor and closing tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Necessary Actions**: Luba needs to close all tabs to the left of `l` and all tabs to the right of `r`. She can either close the left tabs first or the right tabs first.\n2. **Calculate Movement and Closing Time**:\n   - **Close Left First**: Move to a position where she can close all tabs to the left, then move to a position where she can close all tabs to the right.\n   - **Close Right First**: Similarly, move to a position where she can close all tabs to the right, then move to a position where she can close all tabs to the left.\n3. **Compute Minimum Time**: Calculate the time required for both strategies and choose the one with the minimum time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef calculate_time(n, pos, l, r):\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Case 1: Close left first, then right\n    # To close left, need to be at least at l, then close\n    x = max(l, pos)\n    steps_to_x = abs(x - pos)\n    time_left_first = steps_to_x + 1  # 1 step to close\n    \n    # Now, current a is x. Need to get to y <= r and close right\n    y = min(r, x)\n    steps_to_y = abs(y - x)\n    time_right = steps_to_y + 1\n    total_time_left_first = time_left_first + time_right\n    \n    # Case 2: Close right first, then left\n    # To close right, need to be at least at r, then close\n    y_r = max(r, pos)\n    steps_to_y_r = abs(y_r - pos)\n    time_right_first = steps_to_y_r + 1  # 1 step to close\n    \n    # Now, current b is y_r. Need to get to x >= l and close left\n    x_r = min(l, y_r)\n    steps_to_x_r = abs(x_r - y_r)\n    time_left = steps_to_x_r + 1\n    total_time_right_first = time_right_first + time_left\n    \n    return min(total_time_left_first, total_time_right_first)\n\nprint(calculate_time(n, pos, l, r))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If all tabs are already in the desired segment, no action is needed, so the time is 0.\n- **Close Left First Strategy**: Calculate the steps to move to the leftmost position `l` from the initial position `pos`, close the left tabs, then move to the rightmost position `r` from `l` and close the right tabs.\n- **Close Right First Strategy**: Similarly, calculate the steps to move to the rightmost position `r` from the initial position `pos`, close the right tabs, then move to the leftmost position `l` from `r` and close the left tabs.\n- **Return Minimum Time**: Compare the times for both strategies and return the minimum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider both possible orders of closing tabs and efficiently compute the minimum time required using simple arithmetic operations.",
