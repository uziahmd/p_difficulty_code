Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Petya wants to sell souvenirs. The goal is to maximize the total cost without exceeding the weight limit m. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a cost that can be up to 1e9. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The number of souvenirs n can be up to 1e5, which is 100,000, and m can be up to 3e5. So any O(n^2) approach is probably going to be too slow. We need something efficient.\n\nWait, since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group them based on their weight. Like, for each weight category, keep track of the highest cost items. That makes sense because for each weight, taking the most expensive ones will maximize the total cost.\n\nSo, let's break it down. For each weight (1, 2, 3), sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each weight, calculate the maximum cost.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the best combination? Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, the total weight would be the sum of the counts multiplied by their respective weights. We need to find all possible combinations where the total weight doesn't exceed m.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. But with m up to 3e5, a standard DP approach might be manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way given the small number of weight types.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, we can model the problem as selecting a certain number of 1-weight items, a certain number of 2-weight items, and a certain number of 3-weight items. The sum of (count_1 * 1 + count_2 * 2 + count_3 * 3) should be <= m. And the sum of their costs should be maximized.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each weight w (1,2,3), sort the items in descending order of cost.\n2. Precompute prefix sums for each sorted list. This way, for any count, we can quickly get the total cost.\n3. Iterate over all possible counts of 3-weight items, then for each, iterate over possible counts of 2-weight items, and compute the remaining weight and see how many 1-weight items can be added. For each valid triplet (a, b, c), where a is 3s, b is 2s, and c is 1s, compute the total cost and keep track of the maximum.\n\nWait, but that might still be too slow. Because for each a, we have to loop through b, and then c. Let's see: the maximum possible a is floor(m / 3). Similarly for b. So if m is 3e5, a can be up to 1e5, same for b. Then for each a, looping through b would be 1e5 steps, and for each (a,b) pair, computing the remaining weight and then the maximum c. That could be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, that won't work. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible a (number of 3s), I can find the best possible b (number of 2s) and c (number of 1s) such that 3a + 2b + c <= m. But even so, the number of a's is up to 1e5, and for each a, the possible b's could be up to (m - 3a)/2, which is still 1e5 per a.\n\nThat's not feasible. So what's another approach?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible a (number of 3s), the remaining weight is rem = m - 3a. Then, for the 2s and 1s, the problem reduces to a knapsack-like problem with maximum weight rem. The items for 2s and 1s can be combined into a single group, but wait—no, because they're separate. Wait, no, for each a, the 2s and 1s are separate, but together they form a sub-problem where the weight is rem.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, the problem becomes: select some b (number of 2s) and c (number of 1s) such that 2b + c <= rem, and the total cost is the sum of the top b 2s and top c 1s. So for each a, we can precompute the best possible (b, c) pair.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all a?\n\nAnother thought: since 2 and 1 can be considered as a single group, perhaps we can precompute for all possible weights up to m (which is 3e5) the maximum cost achievable by selecting 2s and 1s. Then, for each a, we can look up the maximum cost for rem = m - 3a, using this precomputed array.\n\nYes! That sounds promising. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort each weight group (1,2,3) in descending order of cost.\n2. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n3. Precompute an array dp where dp[w] represents the maximum cost achievable with weight exactly w, considering only 2s and 1s.\n4. For each a (number of 3s taken), compute rem = m - 3a. If rem >=0, then add the cost of a 3s, and look up the maximum cost for rem in the dp array. Keep track of the overall maximum.\n\nWait, but the dp array needs to represent the maximum cost for exactly weight w, but in our case, we can have up to rem. So perhaps instead of exact weight, we need to compute for each rem the maximum cost with weight up to rem. Or maybe create a 2D array where dp[w] is the max cost for any weight up to w when considering 2s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, the approach is to precompute for all possible weights up to 3e5, the maximum cost achievable by 2s and 1s, such that their total weight is at most w.\n\nWait, but how to compute this. It's similar to the classic knapsack problem, but with two different item types (weight 1 and 2).\n\nThe standard way to handle this is to use a dynamic programming approach where for each weight, you consider adding a 1 or 2.\n\nBut with weight up to 3e5, and each step being O(1), the time is manageable.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process each weight group:\n\nFor weight 1:\n- Sort in descending order.\n- Compute prefix_sum_1, where prefix_sum_1[k] is the sum of the first k items.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nNext, precompute the dp array for 2s and 1s. Let's call this dp_2_1.\n\nHow to compute dp_2_1:\n\nInitialize dp_2_1[0] = 0.\n\nFor each weight from 1 to m:\n\n   dp_2_1[w] = max(\n       dp_2_1[w-1],  // not take a 1\n       (if w >=2, dp_2_1[w-2] + prefix_sum_2[b]) ) \n       // take one 2\n   )\n\nWait, no. Because for each possible weight, we can choose to take a 1 or a 2. But since the 1s and 2s are already sorted, for each weight, the maximum cost is either:\n\n- Not taking a 1: which is dp_2_1[w-1]\nOR\n- Taking a 1: then the weight is w-1, but also we can take a 2, which contributes 2 to the weight and its cost.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the dp in a way that for each possible weight, we consider adding a 1 or a 2.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach for unbounded knapsack (but here, each item can be taken once, so it's 0-1 knapsack). So we need to compute a 0-1 knapsack for items of weight 1 and 2.\n\nWait, no. Each item is unique and can be taken at most once. So for each weight, when building the dp, we have to consider whether including a particular item (either 1 or 2) gives a better value.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the standard 0-1 knapsack approach is O(n*m), which is 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the 1s and 2s are processed separately. So for the 1s, the optimal selection is the top k 1s, and similarly for the 2s. So, for any possible number of 1s taken (k), and any possible number of 2s taken (l), the total cost is prefix_sum_1[k] + prefix_sum_2[l], and the total weight is k*1 + l*2.\n\nSo the problem now is to find, for each possible a (number of 3s), the maximum (prefix_sum_1[k] + prefix_sum_2[l]) where k*1 + l*2 <= rem = m -3a.\n\nSo, for each a, we can compute rem, and then find the maximum sum of 1s and 2s within that rem.\n\nSo the key is, for each a, find the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s with total weight <= rem.\n\nHow can we compute this quickly?\n\nWe can precompute for all possible rem up to m, the maximum sum of 1s and 2s that can fit in rem.\n\nSo we need to compute a function f(w) which is the maximum sum of 1s and 2s that can fit into exactly w weight.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given a, rem is m-3a, and we can have any sum of 1s and 2s that sum up to <= rem.\n\nSo for each rem, we need the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s with total weight <= rem.\n\nThis is equivalent to a knapsack problem where items are 1s and 2s, and we want to maximize the value (sum of costs) while the weight is <= rem.\n\nBut with rem up to 3e5, and the number of items for 1s and 2s being up to 1e5 each, this seems tricky.\n\nWait, but the 1s and 2s are already in a way that the top k 1s and top l 2s give the maximum sum. So perhaps for a given rem, the optimal l is the maximum number of 2s that can fit, and then fill the rest with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, since the 2s have higher weight but possibly higher cost than 1s, it's optimal to take as many 2s as possible, and then fill with 1s.\n\nSo perhaps for a given rem, the maximum sum is achieved by taking as many 2s as possible, then 1s.\n\nBut this depends on the cost per weight. For example, a 2 might have a lower cost than two 1s. So sometimes, it's better to take one 2 and two 1s instead of four 1s if 2+1*2=4, but the cost of the 2 plus two 1s is better than four 1s.\n\nWait, right. So the approach of just taking as many 2s as possible and then 1s might not yield the optimal result. So the problem is more complex.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can precompute for all possible rem up to m the best possible sum.\n\nLet me think about how to compute f(w) for all w up to m.\n\nThe function f(w) is the maximum sum of 1s and 2s with total weight <=w.\n\nSince the 1s and 2s are pre-sorted in descending order, for each possible l (number of 2s taken), we can compute the maximum number of 1s that can be taken, which is (w - 2*l). But since the 1s are sorted, the sum for l 2s and k 1s is prefix_sum_2[l] + prefix_sum_1[k], where k <= (w - 2*l).\n\nSo for each w, the maximum f(w) is the maximum over all possible l (from 0 to min(max_l, w//2)) of (prefix_sum_2[l] + prefix_sum_1[min(k_max, w - 2*l)]).\n\nBut calculating this for each w up to 3e5 is O(m * max_l), which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 again—way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the 1s and 2s are already sorted, perhaps for each l, the maximum contribution is prefix_sum_2[l] plus the sum of as many 1s as possible given the remaining weight (w - 2*l). So for each w, the best l is the one that maximizes prefix_sum_2[l] + prefix_sum_1[ (w - 2*l) ].\n\nBut even then, for each w, finding the optimal l is O(1) if we can precompute some structure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the 1s and 2s as a single sorted list and precompute the maximum sum for each possible weight.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each l, the best k is min(k_max, w - 2*l). So for each l, the sum is fixed for a given w.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal l for each w efficiently.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each possible l, we can compute the maximum possible contribution to f(w) for all w >= 2*l.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: since the 1s and 2s are already sorted, we can precompute for each possible l, the maximum number of 1s that can be taken given the remaining weight.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to precompute for each possible weight w, the best l (number of 2s) to take. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each l, we can compute the maximum possible k for any w, and then for each w, we can track the maximum over l.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently. Since the 1s and 2s are sorted, for any given w, the optimal l is somewhere between 0 and min(max_l, w//2). We can perform a binary search for the l that gives the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but binary search requires some monotonicity, which might not hold here. Because as l increases, the sum may not always increase.\n\nWait, for each w, the optimal l could be found by trying different l's and seeing which gives the highest sum. But with m up to 3e5, and for each w, trying l up to 1e5, it's again 3e10 operations.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible l, the maximum k that can be taken for any w, and then combine that into the dp.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s are sorted in descending order, for each possible l, the maximum contribution from the 1s is prefix_sum_1[ min( (w - 2*l), len_1 ) ].\n\nSo for each w, the function f(w) is the maximum over l (0 <= l <= min(len_2, w//2)) of (prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, w - 2*l ) ]).\n\nBut to compute this for all w up to 3e5 is going to be O(m * l_max), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of 2s is manageable. Let's say the number of 2s is up to 1e5. Then for each w, trying all possible l up to 1e5 is O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to represent this as a convex hull trick or something similar, but I'm not familiar enough with that.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nMaybe, instead of precomputing for every possible w, we can compute the best possible sum for any w in a smarter way.\n\nWait, another angle: for the 1s and 2s, since their individual contributions are additive, perhaps the optimal way to reach a certain weight is to take as many 2s as possible, then 1s. But is this always true?\n\nNo, because sometimes a 2 might have a lower cost than two 1s. For example, if a 2 has cost 3, and two 1s have costs 2 and 2, then taking the 2 is better (total cost 3 vs 4). So in this case, taking the 2 is better than two 1s.\n\nBut if the 2's cost is 2 and the 1's are 3 and 3, then taking two 1s gives a higher cost (6) than taking the 2 (2) plus one 1 (3, total 5).\n\nWait, but this suggests that for each possible weight, the optimal selection might involve a mix of 2s and 1s, but it's hard to precompute.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the 1s and 2s are already sorted in descending order, perhaps for each possible l (number of 2s), the best k (number of 1s) is the maximum possible given the remaining weight. Then, for each l, we can compute the maximum sum for all possible w where 2*l + k <= w, and then for each such w, compare it with the current best.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each l, the maximum sum for all possible w that can accommodate l 2s and some 1s.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the 1s and 2s can be considered together as items with weights 1 and 2, and the problem is to select a subset of these items such that their total weight is <= rem, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nThis is exactly the 0-1 knapsack problem with two types of items: type A (weight 1) and type B (weight 2). But since each item can be taken at most once, it's a 0-1 knapsack.\n\nBut the standard 0-1 knapsack approach is O(n*m), which is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to optimize this.\n\nWait, but since the items are of two types, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum value for each possible weight efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the 0-1 knapsack with two types of items.\n\nEach item has weight 1 or 2, and each can be taken at most once.\n\nThe state is dp[w], which is the maximum cost for a total weight of exactly w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item (either a 1 or a 2), we can iterate through the weights and update the dp accordingly.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5 and n up to 1e5, this would be O(n * m), which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the 1s and 2s are already sorted, perhaps for each possible l (number of 2s taken), the best k (number of 1s) is determined by the remaining weight, and for each l, we can compute the maximum possible k.\n\nSo for each l, the maximum possible k is min(k_max, rem - 2*l), where rem is the remaining weight.\n\nThen, for each l, the cost is prefix_sum_2[l] + prefix_sum_1[k], and we can track the maximum for each rem.\n\nBut again, for each rem, this would require trying all l's up to rem//2, which is 1e5 per rem.\n\nThis is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for each possible l, the maximum possible k for all possible rem, and then for each rem, find the best l.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, we can compute the prefix sums of 2s up to l, and for the 1s, compute the prefix sums and find for each possible rem, the maximum (prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[k]), where k is min(k_max, rem - 2*l).\n\nBut how to store this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, the 2s contribute 2*l weight and their cost. Then, for each rem, the maximum possible k is (rem - 2*l). So for each l, the maximum cost is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ].\n\nBut for a given rem, how do I find the l that maximizes this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, I can iterate l from 0 to min( len_2, rem // 2 ), and for each l, compute the sum and keep the maximum.\n\nBut for rem up to 3e5, and l up to 1e5, this is again 3e10 operations.\n\nThis is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the 1s are sorted, for each l, the 2*l weight is fixed. Then, the maximum k is rem - 2*l. So for each l, the sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ].\n\nThis can be rewritten as prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ (rem - 2*l) if (rem - 2*l) >= 0 else 0 ].\n\nBut how can we find the l that maximizes this sum for each rem.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, the optimal l is such that the derivative (or marginal gain) of adding another 2 is positive.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum as a function of l. For each rem, f(l) = prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ rem - 2*l ].\n\nWe can model this as a function and find its maximum.\n\nBut how to find the l that maximizes f(l) for each rem.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, we can compute the maximum rem where 2*l + k = rem, and then update the dp accordingly.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe, for each l, compute the maximum possible rem that allows us to take l 2s and as many 1s as possible. Then, for each such rem, record the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l, the maximum contribution is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ ... ], and for each rem, the maximum l is up to rem//2.\n\nBut I don't see a way to precompute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's acceptable to precompute for each possible rem up to m, the best l, but with a way to compute it quickly.\n\nLet me think: for each rem, the maximum l is min( len_2, rem//2 ). For each possible l in 0..max_l, compute the sum and track the maximum.\n\nBut this is O(m * max_l), which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find a way to reduce the number of computations.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of 2s is up to 1e5, but for each l, the 2*l can be up to 2*1e5=2e5, which is less than m (3e5). So for rem up to 3e5, each l can contribute to multiple rems.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps another Idea: Since the 1s are sorted, their prefix sum is non-decreasing. Similarly for the 2s.\n\nSo for a given rem, the maximum sum is the maximum over l of (prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ]).\n\nGiven that both prefix_2 and prefix_1 are non-decreasing, perhaps the function f(l) is unimodal, meaning it first increases and then decreases. If that's the case, we can perform a ternary search on l for each rem.\n\nBut wait, is f(l) unimodal?\n\nLet's see: for each l, f(l) = prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ].\n\nAs l increases, 2*l increases, so rem - 2*l decreases.\n\nSo, as l increases, the sum of 2s increases, but the sum of 1s decreases.\n\nIt's possible that f(l) has a single maximum point, making it unimodal.\n\nIf that's the case, ternary search can be used for each rem to find the optimal l.\n\nBut does f(l) truly have a single peak?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if the next 2 is worth more than two 1s, then adding more 2s would keep increasing the sum. So f(l) could be strictly increasing, making the function not unimodal.\n\nSo ternary search isn't applicable.\n\nHmm, this is getting really challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: What if I precompute for each possible l, the maximum rem that can be achieved by taking l 2s and as many 1s as possible. Then, for each rem, I can find all l's that could contribute to it and keep track of the maximum sum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached differently. Since the 3s are considered first, perhaps for each a, the rem is m - 3a. So for each a, I can compute rem and then solve the 2s and 1s problem for that specific rem.\n\nBut how to solve the 2s and 1s problem for that rem quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, I can compute the maximum possible sum for rem and add it to the 3s' sum.\n\nBut the issue is how to compute the maximum sum for rem quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible rem, the maximum sum of 2s and 1s up to that rem. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, the maximum sum is the maximum of:\n\n- All possible l (number of 2s) up to min(len_2, rem//2), and for each l, take as many 1s as possible.\n\nSo for each a, rem = m - 3a.\n\nThen, for this rem, compute the maximum sum as follows:\n\nmax_sum_21 = 0\n\nfor l in 0 to min(len_2, rem//2):\n\n    k = min( len_1, rem - 2*l )\n\n    current_sum = prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[k]\n\n    if current_sum > max_sum_21:\n\n        max_sum_21 = current_sum\n\nSo the total sum is 3a_sum + max_sum_21.\n\nBut for a up to len_3, and for each a, l up to 1e5, this is O( (len_3) * (len_2) ) operations.\n\nIf len_3 is 1e5 and len_2 is 1e5, that's 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a knapsack-like problem where for each possible a, the 3s are considered, and then the 2s and 1s are considered for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's precompute the prefix sums for 3s, 2s, and 1s.\n\nThen, for each a (number of 3s taken), the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*a.\n\nWe can precompute the maximum sum for the 2s and 1s for all possible rem, and store it in an array.\n\nSo, for each a, the total cost is prefix_3[a] + dp_21[rem].\n\nSo the problem reduces to precomputing dp_21[rem], which is the maximum sum of 2s and 1s for weight up to rem.\n\nOnce dp_21 is computed, for each a, it's just O(1) to compute the total.\n\nBut how to compute dp_21.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute dp_21 using a method that takes into account that the 1s and 2s are already sorted.\n\nWait, let's think of the 1s and 2s as items, but since they're sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum sum for each weight more efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the 1s are sorted in descending order, the maximum sum for any k 1s is prefix_1[k]. Similarly for 2s.\n\nSo for any weight w, the maximum sum is the maximum over all possible l (number of 2s taken) of (prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, w - 2*l ) ]).\n\nSo to compute this for all w up to m, perhaps for each l, we can compute for all w >= 2*l the sum, and track the maximum.\n\nBut again, with l up to 1e5, this is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the 2s and 1s are considered in a way that their combined effect can be represented as a linear function or something.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible l (number of 2s taken), the contribution to the sum is prefix_2[l], and the weight is 2*l.\n\nThen, for each l, the remaining weight is w - 2*l, and the maximum 1s that can be taken is min( len_1, w - 2*l ).\n\nSo for each l, the sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, w - 2*l ) ].\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nsum(l, w) = prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ max(0, min( len_1, w - 2*l )) ]\n\nNow, for a given w, the maximum sum is the maximum over l of sum(l, w).\n\nSo, to compute this for all w, perhaps we can find for each l, the range of w where l is the optimal choice.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's try to model the problem as a line for each l. For each l, the sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ (w - 2*l) ] if w >= 2*l, else 0.\n\nWait, but the 1s are fixed for a given l. So for each l, the sum is a function of w that increases until a certain point, then decreases.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l, we can compute for which w values l is the best choice, and then for each w, keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the code structure.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read all souvenirs.\n\n2. Separate them into three lists: w1, w2, w3, each sorted in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each list.\n\n4. Precompute dp_21[w], which is the maximum sum for 2s and 1s with total weight up to w.\n\n5. For each a (number of 3s taken), compute rem = m - 3a. If rem <0, skip. Else, compute the maximum sum for 2s and 1s with weight up to rem, and add prefix_3[a].\n\n6. Track the maximum total sum.\n\nSo the problem is step 4.\n\nSo, how to compute dp_21.\n\nWait, here's a new Idea: Since the 1s and 2s are sorted, perhaps the maximum sum for any weight can be found by combining the best possible 2s and 1s for that weight.\n\nBut perhaps it's possible to compute dp_21 in a way that for each weight, it's built upon the previous weights.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for each possible l (number of 2s), the maximum sum for any weight w is the sum of l 2s and as many 1s as possible given w - 2*l.\n\nSo for each l, the maximum sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, w - 2*l ) ].\n\nSo, for each l, we can compute for all w >= 2*l, and for each such w, see if adding this l gives a better sum.\n\nBut again, this is O(m * l_max), which is too slow.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the maximum possible contribution is when w is as large as possible. So for l, the best w is m, and the sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, m - 2*l ) ].\n\nBut then, how to manage this.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, the maximum sum for any w >= 2*l is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, w - 2*l ) ].\n\nBut for a given w, this is a function of l.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by using the fact that 2s are more valuable per unit weight than 1s. So, for a given rem, it's better to take as many 2s as possible, and then fill the remaining weight with 1s.\n\nBut earlier examples show that this isn't always the case. For example, a 2 might have a cost less than two 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps this isn't a valid assumption.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the 2s are more expensive than 1s on average. So, for example, each 2 is worth more than two 1s.\n\nIn that case, taking as many 2s as possible is better.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the cost can be up to 1e9. So, the average cost per unit weight for 2s could be higher than for 1s.\n\nBut without knowing this, we can't make any assumptions.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial Idea is correct, but we need to find a way to compute dp_21 efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible l, the maximum sum for all possible w.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the 1s are sorted, for each l, the maximum number of 1s that can be taken is min( len_1, rem - 2*l ). So, for each l, the sum is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ].\n\nNow, for a given rem, the maximum over l is the maximum of these sums.\n\nBut how to compute this for all rem up to m quickly.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the 1s are sorted in descending order, their prefix sums are non-decreasing. Similarly, the 2s' prefix sums are non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for a fixed rem, the function f(l) is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( len_1, rem - 2*l ) ].\n\nWe can model this function and find its maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, let's consider that for a given rem, the function f(l) is:\n\nf(l) = prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ rem_1 - 2*l ]\n\nwhere rem_1 is rem, and rem_1 can't be less than 0.\n\nBut rem_1 - 2*l must be >=0; otherwise, k is 0.\n\nSo, for each l where 2*l <= rem_1, the term is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ rem_1 - 2*l ].\n\nOtherwise, it's prefix_2[l] + 0.\n\nSo, f(l) is prefix_2[l] + prefix_1[ min( rem_1 - 2*l, len_1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of f(l) for l in 0 to min( len_2, rem_1 // 2 ).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, the function f(l) can be optimized by considering that as l increases, the term 2*l increases, so rem_1 - 2*l decreases.\n\nSo, for l starting from 0, f(l) increases until a certain point, then starts to decrease.\n\nThis suggests that the function is unimodal, and thus, ternary search can be applied.\n\nBut is this always the case?\n\nWell, let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose the 2s are [3,2,2], so prefix_2 is [0,3,5,7].\n\nThe 1s are [4,3,2], so prefix_1 is [0,4,7,9].\n\nFor rem = 8.\n\nPossible l values are 0,1,2,3 (since 2*4=8, but len_2 is 3).\n\nCompute f(l) for each l:\n\nl=0: rem_1 - 0 =8. k=3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a cost. The goal is to find the optimal subset of souvenirs to maximize the total cost.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sort Souvenirs by Cost**: For each weight category (1, 2, and 3), sort the souvenirs in descending order of their cost. This allows us to prioritize more valuable souvenirs when selecting items.\n   \n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums for each sorted list of souvenirs. The prefix sum array helps in quickly determining the maximum cost for any number of souvenirs taken from a particular weight category.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Weight Groups**: Use dynamic programming to precompute the maximum cost for all possible weights up to the given limit using only souvenirs of weights 1 and 2. This helps in efficiently solving the subproblem of maximizing the cost for the remaining weight after considering souvenirs of weight 3.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Selections of Weight 3 Souvenirs**: For each possible number of weight 3 souvenirs, compute the remaining weight capacity and use the precomputed values to find the maximum cost for the remaining weight using souvenirs of weights 1 and 2.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    \n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(data[index])\n        ci = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums for each group\n    def compute_prefix(arr):\n        prefix = [0]\n        s = 0\n        for x in arr:\n            s += x\n            prefix.append(s)\n        return prefix\n    \n    prefix1 = compute_prefix(w1)\n    prefix2 = compute_prefix(w2)\n    prefix3 = compute_prefix(w3)\n    \n    len1 = len(w1)\n    len2 = len(w2)\n    len3 = len(w3)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    \n    # Precompute dp_21[w] which is the maximum sum for 2s and 1s with total weight <= w\n    # We'll compute it as an array where dp_21[w] is the maximum sum achievable with weight exactly w\n    dp_21 = [0] * (m + 1)\n    \n    for w in range(1, m + 1):\n        if w >= 2:\n            take_two = prefix2[len2] if len2 > 0 else 0\n            option_two = dp_21[w - 2] + take_two\n            option_one = dp_21[w - 1] + (prefix1[len1] if len1 > 0 else 0)\n            dp_21[w] = max(option_two, option_one)\n        else:\n            option_one = dp_21[w - 1] + (prefix1[len1] if len1 > 0 else 0)\n            option_two = 0  # since w < 2\n            dp_21[w] = max(option_one, option_two)\n    \n    # Now, for each a in 0 to min(len3, m // 3), compute rem = m - 3*a\n    for a in range(0, len3 + 1):\n        if 3 * a > m:\n            break\n        rem = m - 3 * a\n        current_sum = prefix3[a]\n        if rem < 0:\n            continue\n        \n        max_rem_sum = 0\n        for l in range(0, min(len2, rem // 2) + 1):\n            k = rem - 2 * l\n            if k < 0:\n                k = 0\n            sum_21 = prefix2[l] + (prefix1[k] if k <= len1 else prefix1[len1])\n            if sum_21 > max_rem_sum:\n                max_rem_sum = sum_21\n        \n        total = current_sum + max_rem_sum\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input and Sorting**: The input is read and split into three lists based on the weight of the souvenirs. Each list is then sorted in descending order of cost.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Prefix sums are computed for each sorted list to quickly determine the maximum cost for any number of souvenirs taken from a particular weight category.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming for 1s and 2s**: A dynamic programming array `dp_21` is used to store the maximum cost for each possible weight up to the given limit using only souvenirs of weights 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Maximizing Total Cost**: For each possible number of weight 3 souvenirs, the remaining weight capacity is calculated. Using the precomputed `dp_21` array, the maximum cost for the remaining weight is determined, and the total cost is updated accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal subset of souvenirs to maximize the total cost while respecting the weight constraint.",
