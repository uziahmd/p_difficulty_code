The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she also has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a_1, then for the second task, she must be at a_2 after the first is done, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, no—the description says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read that again.\n\nNo, it says: \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps, the way it's phrased, she has to process the tasks in order, and for each i, before starting the i-th task, she must have already done all j < i tasks. So the processing is sequential: task 1, then task 2, etc., but each requires being at a certain location.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial problem statement says: \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe it's that for the i-th task, she must have already completed all the previous tasks (j < i), which implies that the tasks are processed in order. So, she does task 1, then task 2, etc., and for each task i, she must be at a_i.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3, then she does task 1, which is at a_1, then task 2 at a_2, then task 3 at a_3. But how does this translate into movement along the ring?\n\nThe key is that she starts at house 1. Then, for each task i from 1 to m, she has to move to a_i, and the time taken is the distance she moves between each consecutive position.\n\nBut since the ring is circular, moving from a house to the next can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but the problem says that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So, movement is only possible in the clockwise direction. So, from any house, you can only go to the next house in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"the ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.\" So, the ring is a loop where each house is connected to its next in the clockwise direction. So, to move from house x, you can only go to x+1, and from there to x+2, etc., modulo n because it's a ring.\n\nWait, but wait—how is the movement? Like, if you're at house 4 in a ring of 4, you can only go to house 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, etc.? Or perhaps, the ring is such that each house is connected to the next in the clockwise direction, forming a cycle. So, the distance from x to y is the minimal steps required to get from x to y in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time. So, each step is moving to the next house in the clockwise direction. So, the path from house A to B can be either going through the forward direction or the backward, but since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, you cannot go against the flow. So, Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is a ring, so for any two houses, there are two paths connecting them: one clockwise and one counter-clockwise. But since the ring is one-way and traffic is clockwise, Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. So, for example, if she's at house 1 in a ring of 4, she can only go to 2, then 3, then 4, then back to 1, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way, meaning that you can't move in the opposite direction. So, once you leave a house, you can only proceed to the next in the clockwise order. So, the entire ring forms a directed cycle.\n\nSo,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a one-way ringroad in a clockwise direction. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete all previous tasks before starting the next one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: The houses are arranged in a ring, meaning the first house is adjacent to the last house in the clockwise direction.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Since the ring is one-way and traffic is clockwise, Xenia can only move from each house to the next house in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Task Completion Order**: Tasks must be completed in the given order, meaning she must be at the required house for each subsequent task after completing all previous ones.\n4. **Calculate Distance Efficiently**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from her current position to the required house using the ring structure. This involves computing the minimal steps needed considering the circular nature of the ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    target = a[i]\n    # Calculate the distance from current to target\n    if current < target:\n        distance = target - current\n    else:\n        distance = (target + n) - current\n    time += distance\n    current = target\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with 0 time units.\n- **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest path from the current house to the target house on the ring.\n- **Distance Calculation**: If moving clockwise from the current house to the target house is shorter, use that distance. Otherwise, compute the distance considering the wrap-around due to the ring structure.\n- **Update Time and Position**: Add the calculated distance to the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes all tasks in the minimum possible time by efficiently calculating the required movements along the ring.",
