Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum to exactly x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as minimal as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently because n can be up to 2e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is out of the question; that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nStep 1: For each voucher, calculate its duration. Then, for each possible duration d, keep track of the minimal cost for that duration.\n\nWait, but since we're looking for two vouchers whose durations sum to x, perhaps we can group the vouchers by their duration and then look for pairs where d1 + d2 = x.\n\nFor example, for each voucher with duration d, find all vouchers with duration (x - d), and check if they can be used together without overlapping.\n\nBut even that might not be efficient enough if done naively, because for each voucher, we might have to check many others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible duration d, precompute the minimal cost vouchers in that duration. Then, for each d, we can look for x-d and see if there are vouchers in both d and x-d.\n\nBut wait, we also need to ensure that the two vouchers don't overlap. So just having the right durations isn't enough; their time intervals must not overlap.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers, grouping them by their duration.\n\n- For each possible duration d, find all vouchers with duration d and for each such voucher, find the minimal cost voucher in duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even that sounds computationally heavy because for each voucher, you'd have to scan through all vouchers of (x - d) and check for non-overlapping.\n\nWait, but maybe we can precompute for each possible duration d, the minimal cost of a voucher, along with some information about their start and end times, so that when combined with another duration, we can quickly check for non-overlapping.\n\nAnother thought: For each possible duration d, store the vouchers in a list sorted by their end time. Similarly, for duration x-d, have the vouchers sorted by their start time. Then, for each voucher i of duration d, find vouchers j of duration x-d where j's start is >= i's end + 1 or j's end <= i's start - 1. But even this seems tricky because for each i, we need to find the best j in x-d that doesn't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible duration d, we can keep track of two things:\n\na) The minimal cost voucher with duration d, regardless of the time (but perhaps for each possible end time, keep the minimal cost).\n\nb) The earliest ending voucher for each duration d.\n\nSimilarly, for each d, have the earliest starting vouchers.\n\nWait, maybe that's not directly applicable. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider that for each possible duration d, I'll collect all vouchers with that duration. For each such group, I can sort the vouchers based on their end times and start times.\n\nThen, for each voucher i of duration d, I can look for vouchers j of duration x-d such that either j ends before i starts, or i ends before j starts.\n\nThe key here is to find, for each i, the minimal cost j in the x-d group that doesn't overlap with i.\n\nBut how do I do that efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, we can precompute two structures:\n\n- The minimal cost for vouchers up to a certain end time.\n- The minimal cost for vouchers that start after a certain start time.\n\nWait, maybe for each d, we can sort the vouchers in x-d group by their end times. Then, for a given i, which has an end time E_i, we can find all j in x-d group where j's end time <= E_i - 1. Among those, find the one with the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for j's that start after i's end, we can sort the x-d group by their start time and find those j's whose start time >= E_i + 1, and find the minimal cost among them.\n\nSo, for each i, the minimal possible j is the minimum between these two cases.\n\nThis approach could be manageable.\n\nBut considering the number of possible d's, which can be up to 2e5 (since duration can be up to 2e5), and for each i, doing a binary search on two sorted lists, it should be feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each duration d, a list of all vouchers with that duration, along with their start and end times and cost.\n\n2. For each d, create two sorted lists:\n   a. Sorted by end time: for quick lookup of j's that end before i's start.\n   b. Sorted by start time: for quick lookup of j's that start after i's end.\n\n3. Also, for each d, compute prefix minima of cost in the sorted by end list. So, for a given end time, we can quickly find the minimal cost up to that point.\n\n4. Similarly, for the sorted by start list, compute suffix minima of cost. So, for a given start time, find the minimal cost from that start onwards.\n\nThen, for each voucher i of duration d_i, we can:\n- Look in the x-d_i group (d_j = x - d_i) for j's that end before i starts (j.end <= i.start - 1). For this, in the x-d group's end-sorted list, find all j's where j.end <= i.start - 1. The minimal cost among these is the prefix up to that point.\n\n- Similarly, look for j's in the x-d group that start after i ends (j.start >= i.end + 1). The minimal cost among these can be found via the suffix minima.\n\nThe minimal cost for this i would be the minimum of these two possibilities. We can then track the global minimal across all i.\n\nBut wait, what about when d_i is x - d_i? That is, when x is even and d_i is x/2. In that case, we need to find two vouchers with the same duration that don't overlap.\n\nIn this case, for each i in the d_i group, we need to find j in the same group where j does not overlap with i.\n\nSo, the approach needs to handle this case as well.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n- For each voucher, compute its duration.\n\n- Group all vouchers by their duration.\n\n- For each duration d in the groups:\n   a. Sort the vouchers in d by end time, and compute prefix minima of cost.\n   b. Sort the vouchers in d by start time, and compute suffix minima of cost.\n   c. For each voucher i in d, compute the target duration t = x - d.\n      i. If t < 0, skip.\n      ii. If t == d: we need to find another voucher in the same group that doesn't overlap with i. So, in the same group, find j where j.end < i.start or j.start > i.end. For this, in the sorted end list, find j's end <= i.start - 1 and get the minimal cost. Also, in the sorted start list, find j's start >= i.end + 1 and get the minimal cost. Take the min between these and i's own cost (if any).\n      iii. Else: look into the group of t duration.\n          - For the group t, find j's where j.end <= i.start -1: use the end-sorted list's prefix minima up to the largest j.end <= i.start-1.\n          - Find j's where j.start >= i.end +1: use the start-sorted list's suffix minima from j.start >= i.end+1.\n          - Take the min of these two, and add to i's cost if it exists.\n   d. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, the global minimum is the answer. If none found, return -1.\n\nBut wait, the group for t may not exist. So, for each i, we have to check whether the group for t exists.\n\nAlso, when t == d, we have to make sure that the group for t is the same as d, and that there are at least two vouchers in the group.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, we'll read all the vouchers, compute their durations, and group them.\n\nThen, for each group d, sort the vouchers by end and by start, and precompute the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nThen, for each voucher i in group d:\n\nt = x - d_i\n\nif t < 0: continue\n\nif t not in the groups: continue\n\nelse:\n\n   if t == d_i:\n\n      in group d_i, look for j's that are not i, and non-overlapping.\n\n      So, in the end-sorted list, find all j's with j.end <= i.start - 1. The minimal cost among them is the prefix up to that point.\n\n      Similarly, in the start-sorted list, find j's with j.start >= i.end + 1. Minimal cost is the suffix from that point.\n\n      Take the min of these two, add to i's cost.\n\n   else:\n\n      group_t = groups[t]\n\n      in group_t, find j's that end <= i.start - 1. The minimal cost is the prefix minima up to the max j.end <= i.start -1.\n\n      Also, find j's in group_t that start >= i.end +1. The minimal cost is the suffix minima from the first j.start >= i.end +1.\n\n      Take the min of these two, if any, and add to i's cost.\n\nWe have to compute this for all i, and track the minimal total cost.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing the binary searches:\n\nFor a group sorted by end, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum j.end <= i.start -1.\n\nSimilarly, for a group sorted by start, we can find the first j.start >= i.end +1, and then query the suffix minima from that point.\n\nImplementing this requires for each group, having a list sorted by end, with a prefix array of minima.\n\nSimilarly, a list sorted by start, with a suffix array of minima.\n\nFor example, for group d:\n\nend_list = sorted by end time.\n\nprefix_min = [infinity] * (len(end_list)+1)\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor i in range(len(end_list)):\n    current_min = min(current_min, end_list[i].cost)\n    prefix_min[i+1] = current_min\n\nstart_list = sorted by start time.\n\nsuffix_min = [infinity] * (len(start_list)+1)\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n    current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n    suffix_min[i+1] = current_min\n\nSo, when processing a voucher i:\n\nFor the t group:\n\nif t != d_i:\n\n   group_t = groups[t]\n\n   # Case 1: j ends before i starts\n\n   # Find all j in group_t where j.end <= i.start -1.\n\n   # Using end_list of group_t, perform binary search for the value <= i.start -1.\n\n   low = 0, high = len(group_t_end_list) -1\n\n   # find the rightmost index where group_t_end_list[j].end <= i.start -1.\n\n   pos = bisect_right(group_t_end_list, i.start -1)\n\n   if pos > 0:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = group_t_prefix_min[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\n   # Case 2: j starts after i ends.\n\n   # group_t's start_list, find the first index where j.start >= i.end +1.\n\n   # binary search leftmost occurrence.\n\n   target = i.end + 1\n\n   pos = bisect_left(group_t_start_list, target)\n\n   if pos < len(group_t_start_list):\n\n       min_cost_case2 = group_t_suffix_min[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\n   if min_cost_case1 < infinity or min_cost_case2 < infinity:\n\n       total_cost = i.cost + min(min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2)\n\n       if this is less than current global min, update.\n\nElse, when t == d_i:\n\n   group_t is same as group d_i.\n\n   So, in this case, process within the same group.\n\n   # Case 1: j ends before i starts.\n\n   # group_d's end_list, find j's end <= i.start -1.\n\n   pos = bisect_right(group_d_end_list, i.start -1)\n\n   if pos >0:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = group_d_prefix_min[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\n   # Case 2: j starts after i ends.\n\n   target = i.end +1\n\n   pos = bisect_left(group_d_start_list, target)\n\n   if pos < len(group_d_start_list):\n\n       min_cost_case2 = group_d_suffix_min[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\n   if min_cost_case1 < inf or min_cost_case2 < inf:\n\n       # Now, j cannot be i itself.\n\n       # Because we need two different vouchers.\n\n       # So, in the min_cost_case1 and min_cost_case2, we need to ensure that j is not i.\n\n       # Wait, but how? Because in the group, we have all vouchers, including i.\n\n       # So, when i is part of the j's, we need to exclude it.\n\n       # Hmm, this complicates things.\n\n       # So, perhaps the initial approach is flawed because when t == d_i, i could be part of the j's, leading to selecting the same voucher twice.\n\n       # Therefore, we need to find j's that are different from i.\n\n       # How to handle this?\n\n       # This adds a layer of complexity.\n\nSo, perhaps when t == d_i, the code needs to find j's in the same group that are not i and satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nIn that case, during the processing of i, we can't consider j's that are i.\n\nThus, when t == d_i, the group is the same, but when looking for j's, we must exclude i.\n\nSo, the previous approach works only if j's are different from i.\n\nThus, the initial approach may include j being i, leading to invalid pairs.\n\nSo, how to fix this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-process the groups, ensuring that for each group, when t == d_i, we look for j's that are not i.\n\nBut that complicates the data structures.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each i, when t == d_i, the group is the same as d_i, so when we look for j's in that group, we can:\n\n- For case 1 (j ends before i starts): in the group's end_list, find all j's where j.end <= i.start-1. The minimal cost among these j's.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, j's start after i ends.\n\nBut j must not be i.\n\nSo, in the group, for each i, when t == d_i, we need to find j's in the group that meet the non-overlapping condition and are not i.\n\nSo, for the group, the end_list includes all vouchers, including i.\n\nSo, when we compute the prefix minima, it's possible that i is the minimal cost in some segment. But when considering j's, j can't be i.\n\nThus, the initial approach may pick j as i, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to, for each i, when t == d_i, compute the minimal cost j in the group where j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each group, we can keep track of the minimal cost vouchers in the group, along with their end times and start times.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the minimal cost could be for a voucher that is after i, which might not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, when t == d_i, and we are processing i, we can:\n\n- Exclude i from consideration.\n\nSo, in the group, create a temporary list excluding i, then proceed as before.\n\nBut that's going to be O(n) per i, which is too slow.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: for the group when t == d_i, pre-sort the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost j that meets the non-overlapping condition and is not i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can precompute two structures:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, with a separate structure that allows us to find the minimal cost j where j.end <= i.start -1 and j is not i.\n\nSimilarly for the start.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when t == d_i, for each i, when considering case 1 and case 2, we can find the minimal j in the group (excluding i) that satisfies the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, when t == d_i, we can precompute for each possible end time, the minimal cost voucher that ends at or before that time, excluding the current i.\n\nBut that seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, when t == d_i, we can have two sorted lists, but each list excludes the current voucher i.\n\nBut that's not feasible because for each i, it's a different list.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each group, when t == d_i, when processing i, we can perform the binary search as before, but then, if the minimal cost found includes i, we have to find the next minimal.\n\nBut that could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when t == d_i, when we look for j's in case 1 and case 2, we can treat i as invalid and adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps for case 1, when we find j's end <= i.start -1, and the minimal cost is found. If that minimal cost is i's cost, then we need to find the next minimal in that subset.\n\nBut that requires more complex logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, when t == d_i, for each i, we can:\n\n- For case 1: find j's in the group where j.end <= i.start -1 and j is not i.\n\nSimilarly for case 2.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that.\n\nWait, perhaps for the group, when t == d_i, the end_list contains all j's, including i. So, when we perform the binary search for j's end <= i.start -1, it's possible that i is one of them.\n\nSo, when i's end <= i.start -1, which is impossible because end >= start.\n\nWait, no, because i's end is ri, and i's start is li. So, li <= ri.\n\ni's end is ri, so i's end is >= i's start.\n\nThus, for case 1, j's end must be <= i.start -1. Since i's end is >= i's start, j's end is <= i.start -1 < i.start <= i.end. So, j's end is definitely before i's start, so j and i don't overlap in that case.\n\nWait, wait: if j ends before i starts, then j and i are non-overlapping.\n\nBut if j is i, then j.end = i.end, which is >= i.start, so j and i do overlap. Thus, in case 1, j can't be i.\n\nSo, in the case when t == d_i and case 1, when j's end <= i.start -1, j can't be i because i's end is >= i's start.\n\nSo, for case 1, when t == d_i, the j's considered are all in the group, but j can't be i.\n\nWait, no. Because j's end could be <= i.start -1, which is before i's start, but j could be i only if i's end <= i.start -1, which is impossible.\n\nBecause for any voucher i, li <= ri.\n\nSo, i's end is ri >= li.\n\nSo, i's start is li. So, i's end is >= li.\n\nSo, i's end <= i.start -1 implies li <= ri <= li -1, which is impossible.\n\nThus, j can't be i in case 1 when t == d_i.\n\nSo, for case 1 when t == d_i, j's considered are all in the group, and j is not i.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct for case 1.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: j's start >= i's end +1.\n\nBut j can't be i, because i's start >= i's end +1 implies li >= ri +1, which is impossible.\n\nThus, for case 2, j's considered are all in the group, and j is not i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, j's start is >= i's end +1.\n\nIf j is i, then j's start is >= i's end +1 implies i's start >= i's end +1, which is impossible.\n\nThus, j can't be i in case 2.\n\nThus, in the case where t == d_i, the initial approach is correct because in both cases, j can't be i.\n\nThus, the initial approach is valid.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\nCompute d_i = duration of i.\n\nt = x - d_i.\n\nIf t is negative, skip.\n\nIf t not in groups, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nIf t == d_i:\n\n   group is the same as group_i.\n\n   process as before.\n\nElse:\n\n   group_t is groups[t].\n\n   process as before.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nEach group will have:\n\n- end_list: list of vouchers sorted by end time.\n\n- start_list: list of vouchers sorted by start time.\n\n- prefix_min: array where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost among the first k vouchers in end_list.\n\n- suffix_min: array where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from the k-th voucher in start_list to the end.\n\nSo, for each group, these four arrays are precomputed.\n\nNow, in Python, I can represent each group as a dictionary, with keys 'end_list', 'start_list', 'prefix_min', 'suffix_min'.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each group, I'll process the vouchers, sort them, and compute the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nOnce all groups are preprocessed, I can iterate through each voucher and process as described.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nThe first line is '4 5\\n' followed by four lines. Each line represents a voucher.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the input description:\n\nEach of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri, costi.\n\nSo, for the first sample, n=4, x=5.\n\nVoucher 1: li=1, ri=3, cost=4. Duration 3.\n\nVoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, cost=5. Duration 2.\n\nVoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, cost=1. Duration 2.\n\nVoucher 4: li=1, ri=2, cost=4. Duration 2.\n\nGrouping by duration:\n\nd=3: one voucher (voucher 1).\n\nd=2: three vouchers (voucher 2, 3,4).\n\nProcessing voucher 1 (d=3):\n\nt = 5 -3=2. So, look into group d=2.\n\nIn group d=2, which has vouchers 2,3,4.\n\nSort end_list: voucher2 (end 2), voucher3 (end 6), voucher4 (end 2).\n\nprefix_min: [inf, 5, 5, 5].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, when sorted by end, the order is voucher2 (end 2), voucher4 (end 2), voucher3 (end6).\n\nWait, wait, no. Voucher2 is 1-2 (end 2), voucher4 is 1-2 (end 2), voucher3 is 5-6 (end 6).

No vouchers in group have end <=0.

So 1 >=6? No. So case2 is inf.\n\nThus, total cost is1 (voucher3's cost) +4=5.\n\nWait, but in the group for d=3, the only voucher is voucher1, which has cost4.\n\nSo, for voucher3, case1: j's end is3 <=4, so j is voucher1. So, 1+4=5.\n\nThus, the minimal is5.\n\nSo, the code should capture that.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\nEach voucher has duration3.\n\nSo, group d=3 has 3 vouchers.\n\nFor each i, t=2-3=-1 → invalid.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nSo, output is-1.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: Two vouchers with same duration, and their intervals are exactly the same. But in this case, they would overlap, so can't be chosen.\n\nBut in the code, when t ==d_i, for each i, j's are considered, but j can't be i. So, if all j's in the group are overlapping with i, then no solution.\n\nEdge Case 2: All vouchers have the same duration, but some non-overlapping pairs exist.\n\nAnother Edge Case: One voucher, but n is at least 2. Wait, no, n is >=2.\n\nWait, the problem states n>=2.\n\nSo, the code must handle cases where multiple groups are needed.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, dictionaries can be used to group the vouchers.\n\nBut for each group, we need to process the end_list and start_list, and their prefix and suffix minima.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nWe'll have a groups dictionary, where each key is a duration, and the value is a tuple containing end_list, start_list, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nSo, for each voucher, compute its duration, and add to the corresponding group.\n\nOnce all vouchers are grouped, for each group, sort the end_list and compute prefix_min.\n\nSimilarly, sort the start_list and compute suffix_min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i in all groups:\n\nCompute t = x - d_i.\n\nIf t not in groups, skip.\n\nElse, if t ==d_i:\n\n   process within the same group.\n\nElse:\n\n   process in the t group.\n\nIn each case, perform the binary search for the relevant j's, and compute the minimal cost.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l +1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\nfor l, r, c, d in vouchers:\n    groups[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\npreprocess groups:\n\nfor d in groups:\n    # sort end_list by end time\n    end_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # sort start_list by start time\n    start_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for voucher in end_list:\n        current_min = min(current_min, voucher[2])\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n    prefix_min = [float('inf')] + prefix_min  # to make it 1-based.\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [float('inf')] * (len(start_list)+1)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i][2])\n        suffix_min[i] = current_min\n    # suffix_min[i] represents the minimal from i to end.\n\n    groups[d] = {\n        'end_list': end_list,\n        'start_list': start_list,\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nNow, initialize the minimal cost as infinity.\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i = voucher\n    t = x - d_i\n    if t < 0:\n        continue\n    if t not in groups:\n        continue\n\n    # get the group info\n    group_info = groups[t]\n    if t == d_i:\n        # same group\n        end_list = group_info['end_list']\n        start_list = group_info['start_list']\n        prefix_min = group_info['prefix_min']\n        suffix_min = group_info['suffix_min']\n    else:\n        # different group\n        end_list = group_info['end_list']\n        start_list = group_info['start_list']\n        prefix_min = group_info['prefix_min']\n        suffix_min = group_info['suffix_min']\n\n    # case1: j ends <= i.start -1\n    # find in end_list, j's end <= l_i -1.\n\n    # binary search for l_i -1 in end_list's end times.\n\n    # end_list is list of tuples (l, r, c).

But j can't be i because i's end is >= i's start.\n\nSo, in case1, j can't be i.\n\nSame for case2: j's start >= i's end +1. So, j can't be i.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nVoucher1: d=3, t=2. group for 2 has 3 vouchers.\n\ncase1: j ends <=0 → no j's.\n\ncase2: j starts >=4.\n\nLooking at group2's start_list: [1,1,5]. target is4.\n\nbisect_left finds the first j.start >=4. It's at index2 (5). So, suffix_min[2] is1.\n\nThus, total cost is4+1=5.\n\nVoucher2: d=2. t=3.\n\ngroup for3 has one voucher (d=3). So, j's group is3.\n\ncase1: j ends <=0 → no.\n\ncase2: j starts >=3 (r_i=2 +1=3).\n\ngroup3's start_list is [1]. 1 >=3? No. So, no j's.\n\nThus, no contribution.\n\nVoucher3: d=2. t=3.\n\nsame as above.\n\ncase1: j ends <=4.\n\ngroup3's end_list is [3]. 3<=4 → yes. So, min_case1 is4.\n\ncase2: j starts >=7 → no.\n\nThus, total is1+4=5.\n\nVoucher4: d=2. t=3.\n\nsame as above.\n\ncase1: j ends <=0 → no.\n\ncase2: j starts >=3 → no.\n\nThus, no.\n\nThus, the minimal is5.\n\nAnother test case: when t= x is 2, but each voucher has duration 3. So, sample 2's output.\n\nBut according to the note, in the second sample, each voucher's duration is3, which makes it impossible to select two vouchers adding to 2.\n\nThus, the code should return -1.\n\nSo, the code will correctly return -1.\n\nI think this approach covers all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling when t is zero? Well, the problem says x≥2, but in the constraints, x can be up to 2e5. So, the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the two vouchers must be disjoint and the total duration is exactly x. So, when x=0, but that's impossible because n>=2. So, no, that's not possible.\n\nWait, the problem says, the two vouchers don't intersect, but the sum of durations is x.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles this.\n\nAnother thing: vouchers may have same duration but different costs.\n\nBut the code correctly picks the minimal ones.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the problem statement, the two vouchers must be different. So, when we are processing, we have to ensure that i≠j. But in the code, the condition is handled by checking i≠j, but in the code, when we choose i and j, but in the code, it's possible that the same voucher is considered as i and j. So, the code ensures that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nWait, but in the code, i and j must be different. So, the code is correct because for each pair, the vouchers are different.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when you loop over all possible pairs, ensuring that i and j are different, but in the problem statement, it's required.\n\nWait, the code loops over all vouchers, trying all possible i and j, ensuring that the code considers all possible pairs, ensuring that i and j are different.\n\nBut in the code, when the two vouchers are chosen as i and j, but i and j could be the same voucher. But in the code, for the same group, when t==d_i, j's are different from i because j must have end <=i.start-1, which is impossible for j=i.\n\nThus, the code doesn't allow choosing the same voucher twice.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother potential issue is handling the binary searches correctly.\n\nBut in the code, for the end_list, the end times are extracted into a separate list for binary search.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized. The approach involves efficiently grouping vouchers by their duration and using binary search to quickly find the best possible pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: Each voucher is grouped by its duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Preprocess Groups**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, sort the vouchers by their end time and start time. Compute prefix minima for the sorted end times to quickly find the minimum cost up to a certain end time and suffix minima for the sorted start times to quickly find the minimum cost from a certain start time onwards.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, determine the required complementary duration to sum up to `x`. Use binary search on the sorted end and start times to find the minimum cost vouchers that do not overlap with the current voucher.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        r = int(input[ptr+1])\n        c = int(input[ptr+2])\n        ptr +=3\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c, duration))\n\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, c, d in vouchers:\n        groups[d].append((l, r, c))\n\n    # Preprocess each group\n    for d in groups:\n        # Sort by end time\n        end_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        # Sort by start time\n        start_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Compute prefix min\n        prefix_min = [float('inf')] * (len(end_list) + 1)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(end_list)):\n            current_min = min(current_min, end_list[i][2])\n            prefix_min[i+1] = current_min\n\n        # Compute suffix min\n        suffix_min = [float('inf')] * (len(start_list) + 1)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n            current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\n        groups[d] = {\n            'end_list': end_list,\n            'start_list': start_list,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i = voucher\n        t = x - d_i\n        if t < 0:\n            continue\n        if t not in groups:\n            continue\n\n        group_info = groups[t]\n        end_list = group_info['end_list']\n        start_list = group_info['start_list']\n        prefix_min = group_info['prefix_min']\n        suffix_min = group_info['suffix_min']\n\n        # Case 1: j ends <= l_i - 1\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in end_list]\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_i - 1)\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min[pos]\n        else:\n            min_case1 = float('inf')\n\n        # Case 2: j starts >= r_i + 1\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in start_list]\n        target = r_i + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target)\n        if pos < len(start_times):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        else:\n            min_case2 = float('inf')\n\n        if min_case1 != float('inf') or min_case2 != float('inf'):\n            current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n            total = c_i + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick access.\n3. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: Each group is sorted by end and start times, and prefix and suffix minima are computed to enable efficient minimum cost queries.\n4. **Finding Non-overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, the complementary duration is calculated.
