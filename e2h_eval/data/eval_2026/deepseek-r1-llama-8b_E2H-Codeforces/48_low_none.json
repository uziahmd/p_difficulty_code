            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from one base to another, considering that the second base might be using Roman numerals. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the input gives me two integers a and b. But wait, the second part can be 'R', which means it's using the Roman numeral system. So I need to handle cases where b is either a regular base or Roman.\n\nThe next line is a number c in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but if b is R, then I have to represent the number as a Roman numeral instead of a decimal string.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the inputs correctly.\n2. Parse the number c in base a into its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\n3. Depending on whether b is R or a number, convert the decimal value into the target base (either a standard number string or a Roman numeral).\n\nWait, but how do I determine if b is R? Oh right, because the input for b could be 'R' or a number. So I'll need to check each case.\n\nLet me think about the conversion steps.\n\nFirst, parsing c from base a. Since c can be up to 103 digits long, I need an efficient way to parse it without running into performance issues. But since the constraints are small (a and b up to 25), it's manageable.\n\nFor example, if a is 10 and c is '16', that's 16 in decimal.\n\nThen, for converting to base b:\n\n- If b is a number (not R), then I need to convert the decimal number into base b as a string.\n- If b is R, then I need to convert the decimal number into a Roman numeral string.\n\nSo, the main parts are:\n\na. Parsing c into a decimal number.\nb. Converting the decimal to the target base (either as a number string or a Roman numeral).\n\nLet me tackle part a first.\n\nParsing c: Since c is given in base a, each digit is multiplied by a^position, starting from the right. For example, c = '123' in base 10 is 1*100 + 2*10 +3*1=123.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says c may have leading zeros, but the output shouldn't have any. So during parsing, I just process each character as a digit in base a.\n\nI need to make sure that each character in c is a valid digit in base a. For example, if a is 10, then each digit must be 0-9. If a is 16, digits can be 0-9, A-F (but case-insensitive? Probably uppercase, as per the example).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input c is given as a string, so I should process each character as per their base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c, check if it is a valid digit in base a. Otherwise, it's an error, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nSo, for each char in c, convert to its integer value. For example, 'A' is 10, but only if base a is >=11. Wait, but in the problem statement, a can be as low as 2. So for example, if a is 10, then 'A' is invalid. So when a is 10, the digits can only be 0-9.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the number is written in base a. So if a is 10, then the digits can be 0-9. If a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase). So each digit in c must be a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo during parsing, I need to check each character of c is a valid digit in base a. Otherwise, it's invalid. But the problem says that the input is correct, so I don't need to handle errors.\n\nNow, how to convert each character to its value. For example, in base 10, '5' is 5. In base 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo for each character in c, I can map it to its corresponding value. For numbers beyond 9, like A, B, etc., we treat them as their respective values.\n\nSo, perhaps create a helper function that takes a character and the base a, returns the corresponding integer value. For example:\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        # assume uppercase\n        val = ord(c) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError  # but according to problem statement, this won't happen\n        return val\n\nWait, but what about lowercase letters?

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, considering that the target base might be using Roman numerals. The approach involves parsing the input number, converting it to a decimal (base 10) equivalent, and then converting this decimal number to the target base, which could either be a standard number string or a Roman numeral.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Parse Number:** Convert the number `c` from base `a` to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.\n3. **Convert to Target Base:**\n   - If `b` is a number, convert the decimal number to a string representation in base `b`.\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef char_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef parse_c(s, a):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = char_value(c, a)\n        value = value * a + digit\n    return value\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    a_b = input_lines[idx].split()\n    idx += 1\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b = a_b[1]\n    c = input_lines[idx]\n    \n    decimal = parse_c(c, a)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(decimal))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        if decimal == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            result = []\n            while decimal > 0:\n                remainder = decimal % base\n                result.append(str(remainder))\n                decimal = decimal // base\n            result_str = ''.join(reversed(result))\n            print(result_str if result_str else '0')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into the necessary components: the bases `a` and `b`, and the number `c`.\n2. **Parsing `c`:** The function `parse_c` converts the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and computing the total value.\n3. **Converting to Roman Numeral:** The function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values and appending the corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Converting to Base `b`:** If `b` is not 'R', the decimal number is converted to a string in base `b` by repeatedly dividing by `b` and collecting remainders.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process, ensuring that the output is correctly formatted without leading zeros, whether it is a standard number string or a Roman numeral.",
