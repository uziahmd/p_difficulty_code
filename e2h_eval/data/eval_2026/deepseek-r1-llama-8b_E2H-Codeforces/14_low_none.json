He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of 25, 125, etc., since they contribute more than one 5.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.\n\nBut how do I find all n's that give exactly m zeros? I think binary search can be useful here. Because the function that counts trailing zeros is monotonic increasing as n increases. So for a given m, there's a range of n where the count equals m.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be multiple n's that give the same count. Like in the example, when m is 1, n can be 5,6,7,8,9. So I need to find the lower and upper bounds where the count is m.\n\nSo the plan is: first, find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then, find the largest n where the count is <= m. But wait, because the count is non-decreasing, it's possible that for some m, there are no n's (like if m=0), or multiple n's.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n where the trailing zeros count is m.\n2. Find the maximum n where the trailing zeros count is m.\n3. If there's no such n, output 0.\n4. Else, collect all n's from min to max, inclusive. The count would be max - min + 1.\n\nSo the key is to implement a function that, given a number, calculates the number of trailing zeros. Let's call this function count_zeros(n).\n\nImplementing count_zeros(n) is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to perform the binary search to find the minimal n that gives exactly m zeros. Wait, not exactly m, because the function is non-decreasing. So perhaps we can find the first occurrence where the count is >= m, and then check if that's equal to m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe binary search for the lower bound where the count is >=m, and then see if it's exactly m. Similarly, find the upper bound where the count is <=m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find the smallest n where the count is >=m, and the largest n where the count is <=m. Then, if the smallest n's count is exactly m, proceed; else, there are no solutions.\n\nLet me think about the binary search steps.\n\nFor the lower bound: the minimal n where count(n) >=m.\n\nFor the upper bound: the maximal n where count(n) <=m.\n\nWait, no. Because once count(n) reaches m, it might stay at m for higher n. So the upper bound should be the highest n where count(n) is exactly m.\n\nHmm, perhaps another way: the minimal n where count(n) = m, and the maximal n where count(n) = m. Then, if the minimal is found, and the count is m, then the numbers from minimal to maximal are the answers.\n\nSo how to find the minimal n where count(n) == m?\n\nWe can use binary search between low=0 and high=some_max. What's a good initial high? Since each 5^i contributes to the count, the maximum possible n for a given m can't be more than 5*m. Because 5*1 =5, 5*2=10, etc. Or maybe even higher. Alternatively, set high to 5*(m+1), which should be sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, for m=5, the n's are 20,21,22,23,24. Wait no, the sample input was m=1, and n's were 5-9. Wait, perhaps my initial understanding is off.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input where m=1.\n\nn=5: 120, which has 1 zero.\nn=6: 720, also 1.\nSimilarly, up to n=9: 362880, which also has 2 zeros? Wait wait, no. Wait 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! 5040 (1), 8! 40320 (1), 9! 362880 (two zeros). Oh right! So why does the sample say that for m=1, the output is 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This includes multiples of 25, 125, etc., each contributing more than one 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the largest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is at most \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Validation and Range Extraction**: After determining the bounds, we check if the lower bound actually results in exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. If it does, the valid range of \\( n \\) values is from the lower bound to the upper bound, inclusive. If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial guess, can be adjusted if necessary\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nmin_n = find_min_n(m)\nmax_n = find_max_n(m)\n\nif min_n <= max_n and count_trailing_zeros(min_n) == m:\n    print(max_n - min_n + 1)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\nelse:\n    print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by counting the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\), including higher powers of 5.\n- **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **find_max_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at most \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **Main Logic**: Reads the input \\( m \\), determines the valid range of \\( n \\) values using the helper functions, and prints the results or indicates no valid \\( n \\) exists if necessary.",
