    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be in the remaining array, then calculate the instability and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through each element and for each, checking the max and min of the remaining elements would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute this without having to recompute max and min for each possible removal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the original max and min of the entire array. When I remove an element, the new max could either stay the same or decrease if I removed the current max. Similarly, the new min could stay the same or increase if I removed the current min.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the element I'm removing is either the max or the min. What if I remove an element that's neither? Then the max and min remain the same as the original array's max and min, right?\n\nWait no. For example, suppose the array is [1,3,4]. If I remove 3, the max becomes 4 and min is 1. So the instability remains 3. But if I had another scenario where the array is [5, 2, 7], removing 5 would leave min as 2, max as 7, same as before. So in that case, the instability doesn't change.\n\nWait, so maybe the key is to see whether removing a certain element affects the max or min. So, perhaps the optimal way is to consider candidates where removing them could potentially reduce the instability.\n\nSo, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, sort the array. Sorting might help because then the max and min are at the ends.\n\nOnce sorted, the initial instability is a[-1] - a[0].\n\nNow, when we remove an element, the new array will have a new max (if the removed element was the max) or same max otherwise. Similarly for the min.\n\nWait, but when the array is sorted, the max is a[-1], the min is a[0].\n\nWhen we remove a[i], the new array's min could be a[i-1] if i was the first occurrence of a[i], but wait no— since it's sorted, all elements before a[i] are <= a[i], and all after are >= a[i]. Wait, no, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, so a[i] <= a[i+1].\n\nSo if I remove a[i], the new min is the minimum of the remaining elements. Since the array is sorted, the min would be the first element if i was 0, else a[i-1], unless there are duplicates before a[i]. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,1,2,3], and I remove a[1] (which is 1), the new array's min is still 1 (since a[0] is 1). So the min doesn't change.\n\nAh, right. So the new min after removing a[i] is the min of the array excluding a[i]. But since the array is sorted, the min is either a[0] (if a[i] is not the min) or the next element after a[i-1] if a[i] is the min.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute all possible candidates for the new max and min.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.\n2. Compute the initial max and min, which are a[-1] and a[0].\n3. The initial instability is max - min.\n4. Now, for each position i (0 <= i < n), when we remove a[i], what is the new max and min?\n\nThe new max can be either the same as before (if a[i] is not the current max) or the second last element (a[-2]) if a[i] is the current max.\n\nSimilarly, the new min can be either the same as before (if a[i] is not the current min) or the second element (a[1]) if a[i] is the current min.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the array is sorted, the max is a[-1], and the min is a[0]. So when you remove a[i], the new max is the maximum of a[0..n-2], which is a[-2] if a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential new maximum and minimum values after removing an element.\n2. **Initial Calculation**: Compute the initial instability using the maximum and minimum values of the sorted array.\n3. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element, consider the effect of its removal on the maximum and minimum values:\n   - If removing an element that is not the current maximum or minimum, the instability remains the same as the initial calculation.\n   - If removing the current maximum, the new maximum will be the second last element in the sorted array.\n   - If removing the current minimum, the new minimum will be the second element in the sorted array.\n4. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Track the minimum instability across all possible removals.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum instability without repeatedly scanning the entire array, leveraging sorting and simple conditional checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n    \n    # Check if removing max could help\n    if a[-1] == a[-2]:\n        pass\n    else:\n        candidate_max = a[-2]\n        if candidate_max - a[0] < min_instability:\n            min_instability = candidate_max - a[0]\n    \n    # Check if removing min could help\n    if a[0] == a[1]:\n        pass\n    else:\n        candidate_min = a[1]\n        if a[-1] - candidate_min < min_instability:\n            min_instability = a[-1] - candidate_min\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the maximum and minimum values and efficiently evaluate the effect of removing each element.\n- **Initial Instability**: The initial instability is calculated using the maximum and minimum values of the sorted array.\n- **Element Removal Evaluation**: By considering the removal of each element, we check if it can reduce the instability by potentially changing the maximum or minimum value. This is done by checking the next highest or lowest values in the sorted array.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach runs in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is efficient for large arrays up to the given constraint of 100,000 elements.\n\nThis solution effectively minimizes the instability by evaluating the impact of each possible removal in a structured and efficient manner.",
