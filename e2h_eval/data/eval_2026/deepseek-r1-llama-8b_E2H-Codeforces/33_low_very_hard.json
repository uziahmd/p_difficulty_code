You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the value of a given integer 'a' by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. So, I'm given two strings: a and s. The string a represents the number, and s is a sequence of digits. For each digit in s, I can choose any position in a to replace one of its digits with that digit, but each digit from s can only be used once. My goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the key is to replace the earliest possible digit in 'a' with the largest possible available digit from 's' that's larger than the current digit. But I also need to consider which digits to use from 's' to maximize the overall number.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this. I think the optimal strategy would be to iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right. For each position, if there's a digit in 's' that's larger than the current digit, we should replace it with the largest possible such digit. Then, we move on to the next position and repeat the process with the remaining digits in 's'.\n\nBut wait, maybe not just the largest possible. Because sometimes, using a slightly smaller digit early on might allow us to use larger digits later. Or perhaps not—since earlier digits have higher significance. So, the optimal approach is to always pick the largest possible digit from 's' that's larger than the current digit in 'a' at the earliest position possible.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists of characters (digits) so that we can manipulate them.\n2. Sort the 's' list in descending order so that we can pick the largest available digit first.\n3. Iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right:\n   a. For the current position, check if there are any digits left in 's' that are larger than the current digit.\n   b. If yes, replace the current digit with the largest possible digit from 's' that's bigger. Then, remove that digit from 's' (since each can be used only once).\n   c. If no such digit exists, leave the current digit as is and proceed to the next position.\n4. After processing all digits of 'a', output the modified 'a'.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple digits in 's' larger than the current digit? We should choose the largest possible one to maximize the number. So, for example, if the current digit is '3' and 's' has '5' and '7', we should pick '7'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet's think about the example given:\n\nInput:\na = '1024'\ns = '9871234567'\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the sample input is written as ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567'], but perhaps the actual inputs are two lines. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the output is ['1124', '987']. So, the first number becomes 1124. Let's see why.\n\nOriginal a is 1024.\n\nThe sequence s is '9871234567'. Wait, that's a string, so when split, perhaps it's '0','1','0'? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the input structure.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is a, the second is s. So, for the sample input, a is '1024' and s is '9871234567'.\n\nWait no, the user wrote the input as ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567'], but perhaps in reality, the input is two separate lines. So, the first line is the a string, and the second line is the s string.\n\nIn the sample, after processing, a becomes 1124.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nLooking at a = '1024' and s = '9871234567'.\n\nWait, wait. Let's parse the sample:\n\nAfter processing, the output is '1124'. So, the first digit is 1, then 1, then 2, then 4.\n\nLooking at the initial a: 1 0 2 4.\n\nWhat's s? It's '9871234567', which is the digits 9,8,7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSo, the sorted s in descending order is [9,8,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1].\n\nNow, go through each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 1. We have s starting with",

Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. The goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Inputs**: Convert both the integer 'a' and the sequence 's' into lists of characters (digits) for easy manipulation.\n2. **Sort the Sequence**: Sort the sequence 's' in descending order so that we can always pick the largest available digit first.\n3. **Iterate and Replace**: Iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right:\n   - For each position, check if there are any remaining digits in 's' that are larger than the current digit in 'a'.\n   - If such digits exist, replace the current digit with the largest possible digit from 's' and remove that digit from 's'.\n   - Continue this process until all digits of 'a' have been processed or all useful digits from 's' have been used.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of 'a' by making the most significant changes first, using the largest available digits from 's'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\na_list = list(a)\ns_list = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    if not s_list:\n        break\n    current = a_list[i]\n    if current < s_list[0]:\n        a_list[i] = s_list.pop(0)\nprint(''.join(a_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The code reads the input values for 'a' and 's', converting them into lists of characters.\n- **Sorting**: The sequence 's' is sorted in descending order to facilitate the selection of the largest possible digit for each replacement.\n- **Replacement Loop**: The loop iterates through each digit of 'a', checking if a larger digit from 's' can be used. If so, it replaces the current digit and removes the used digit from 's'.\n- **Output**: The modified list of digits is joined into a string and printed as the result.\n\nThis method efficiently maximizes the value of 'a' by strategically using the largest possible digits from 's' in the most significant positions first.",
