Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in these diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call this the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the cells that are not on either of these diagonals should be the same and different from the X character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines each containing n characters. Oh right, but since the input might have quotes or something, I'll read each line as a string.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read n, then read n lines into a 2D list or just process them as needed.\n\nNext, I need to find the two diagonals. For a square matrix of size n x n, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0).\n\nFor each of these diagonals, I need to check that all characters are the same. Also, the two diagonals must have the same character because both diagonals must consist of the same letter for the X.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters along both diagonals. Then, check if all characters in both diagonals are equal.\n\nIf they aren't equal, it's immediately a NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, note down the diagonal character, say 'd_char'.\n\nThen, we need to check all other cells that are not on the diagonals. These cells must all be the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nSo, how do I get all the non-diagonal cells?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if it's not on either of the diagonals, it needs to be checked.\n\nSo, for each i from 0 to n-1, and j from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (i == j) → part of main diagonal\nor (i + j == n-1) → part of the other diagonal\nthen it's on a diagonal.\n\nElse, it's a non-diagonal cell.\n\nNow, for all non-diagonal cells, collect their characters and see if they are all the same, and also different from 'd_char'.\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal cells? That can only happen when n is 1, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 3 and odd. So, for n=3, there are some non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check the two diagonals:\n   a. Collect all characters in both diagonals.\n   b. If any of the diagonals has varying characters, return NO.\n   c. Check if the two diagonals have the same character. If not, return NO.\n3. Now, collect all the non-diagonal characters:\n   a. If all non-diagonal characters are the same and different from d_char, return YES.\n   b. Else, return NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the non-diagonal cells have more than one distinct character? Like, maybe some are 'a' and others 'b'? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(line)\n\nThen, check the diagonals.\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nother_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\n\nCheck if all elements in main_diag are the same, and same for other_diag, and main_diag[0] == other_diag[0].\n\nIf not, print NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n            non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nNow, check if all characters in non_diag_chars are the same.\n\nAlso, check that this character is different from d_char.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but what if non_diag_chars is empty? No, because for n >=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is (n^2 - 2n + 1) = (n-1)^2. Which is positive.\n\nSo, for example, when n=3: 9 cells, 5 are non-diagonal.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's test with the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWait, I think the first example is a 5x5 grid.\n\nThe main diagonal is x, o, o, o, x.\n\nSo, the main diag is x, o, o, o, x. Are all same? No. So the diagonals don't meet condition 1, hence output is NO.\n\nWait, no, wait, the first sample's output is NO. So in that case, yes, it's correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 3x3:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w.\n\nOther diagonal: w, s, w.\n\nSo, both diagonals have w and s alternating. Wait, wait, no, wait for main diagonal, grid[0][0] is w, grid[1][1] is s, grid[2][2] is w.\n\nSo, the main diagonal has w, s, w. Not all same. So the condition fails, so output is NO? But the sample output shows YES for the second case.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe second input is 3:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWait, the main diagonal is w, s, w.\n\nOther diagonal is w, s, w.\n\nSo, the diagonals are not all same. So why does the sample output say YES for this case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample output is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sample inputs.\n\nWait, the first input is a 5x5 grid, but the sample output is 'NO'.\n\nSecond input is 3x3 grid:\n\nLine 1: wsw → indexes 0,1,2: w, s, w.\n\nLine 2: sws → indexes 0,1,2: s, w, s.\n\nLine 3: wsw → indexes 0,1,2: w, s, w.\n\nSo, the main diagonal is grid[0][0] = w, grid[1][1] = w, grid[2][2] = w. So all w's.\n\nOther diagonal is grid[0][2] = w, grid[1][1] = w, grid[2][0] = w. So all w's.\n\nSo both diagonals are all 'w's. Now, the non-diagonal cells are the rest.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): s\n\n(0,2): w (but that's on the other diagonal)\n\nWait, no, for i=0, j=1: i != j and i +j = 1, which is not 2 (since n=3, n-1=2). So 0+1=1 !=2, so it's non-diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=0: 1+0=1 !=2 → non-diagonal.\n\nSo all cells except the diagonals are:\n\nAt (0,1): s\n\nAt (1,0): s\n\nAt (1,2): w → no, wait, grid[1][2] is 's' in line 2, which is 'sws' → grid[1][2] is 's'.\n\nWait, let me list all non-diagonal cells.\n\ni=0, j=1: 's'\n\ni=0, j=2: on other diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=0: 's'\n\ni=1, j=2: on other diagonal?\n\nNo, for i=1, j=2: i +j = 3, which is larger than n-1=2. So, it's not on the other diagonal. Wait, no: the other diagonal is where i +j = n-1. For n=3, i+j=2.\n\nSo for i=1, j=2: 1+2=3>2, so not on either diagonal.\n\nWait, no, wait: the other diagonal is from (0,2) to (2,0). So for i=1, j=1: on main diagonal. For i=1, j=0: i +j=1 ≠2 → non-diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: the main diagonal is i ==j.\n\nThe other diagonal is i +j = n-1.\n\nSo for n=3, i +j =2.\n\nSo, in the 3x3 grid:\n\ncells are:\n\n(0,0) → main diagonal.\n\n(0,1) → non.\n\n(0,2) → other diagonal.\n\n(1,0) → non.\n\n(1,1) → main.\n\n(1,2) → i+j=3>2 → non.\n\n(2,0) → other.\n\n(2,1) → non.\n\n(2,2) → main.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nNow, in the sample input, the grid is:\n\nLine 1: wsw → (0,0)=w, (0,1)=s, (0,2)=w.\n\nLine 2: sws → (1,0)=s, (1,1)=w, (1,2)=s.\n\nLine3: wsw → (2,0)=w, (2,1)=s, (2,2)=w.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1)=s\n\n(1,0)=s\n\n(1,2)=s\n\n(2,1)=s.\n\nAll 's's.\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals are all 'w's, and the non-diagonal cells are all 's's, different from 'w'.\n\nSo, it satisfies the condition, hence output is YES.\n\nAh, okay, so the code would correctly return YES.\n\nSo, the plan seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if a list is all same chars\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return True  # but in our case, non-diag can't be empty\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Check diagonals\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nother_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(other_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif main_diag[0] != other_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = main_diag[0]\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n                non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) ==0:\n        # Only possible if n=1, but n is at least 3, so not possible.\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        if all_same(non_diag) and non_diag[0] != d_char:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non-diagonal cells are all same, but different from d_char?\n\nYes, that's the condition.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif all_same(non_diag) and non_diag[0] != d_char → YES.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nTesting this code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nAs above, main_diag is [w,w,w], other_diag is [w,w,w]. So, proceed.\n\nnon_diag is [s, s, s, s]? Wait, wait, no. Wait, for i=0, j=1 → 's'; i=1, j=0 → 's'; i=1, j=2 → 's'; i=2, j=1 → 's'. So four 's's.\n\nSo, all same, and 's' != 'w' → YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid like:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p x\n\nDiagonals are all x's, non-diagonal are p's. So output YES.\n\nWhat about a grid where the diagonals are same but non-diagonal have varying letters.\n\nLike:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nDiagonals are a's. Non-diagonal are b's. So output YES.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same but non-diagonal have a mix.\n\nLike:\n\na b a\n\nc a d\n\na b a\n\nDiagonals are a's, but non-diagonal have b, c, d, etc. So output NO.\n\nWhat about when diagonals are not same.\n\nLike:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nWait, no, the main diagonal is a,a,a, other diagonal is a,a,a. So same.\n\nAnother case:\n\na b a\n\nb b b\n\na b a\n\nDiagonals are a, b, a and a, b, a. So, diagonals are not all same. So output NO.\n\nSo code should handle all these.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nn=3.\n\nTest case where non-diagonal are all same and same as diagonals.\n\nLike:\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nDiagonals are a's. Non-diagonal are a's. So, condition requires non-diagonal to be different. So output is NO.\n\nBecause non-diagonal and diagonal have same letter.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. But according to problem statement, n is at least 3.\n\nSo, code doesn't need to handle n=1.\n\nI think this covers all the cases.\n\nSo, now write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, the function all_same returns True if all same, else False.\n\nSo, in the first condition:\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(other_diag):\n\n→ if either diagonal is not uniform, output NO.\n\nElse, check if main_diag[0] == other_diag[0]. If not, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, check non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting with sample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e.\n\nOther diagonal: x, x, x.\n\nSo, main diagonal has x, x, e → not all same. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'.
