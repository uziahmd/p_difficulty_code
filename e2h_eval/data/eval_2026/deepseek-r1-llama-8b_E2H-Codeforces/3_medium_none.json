Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into segments covered by each lantern. But since the lanterns can be placed in any order, perhaps it's better to sort them first. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might cover more, but if they're apart, then their required d might be larger.\n\nWait, but the lanterns' positions are given, so maybe the optimal d is determined by the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns when they are sorted. Or perhaps not exactly, because sometimes a single lantern can cover a large area, which might affect the gaps before or after.\n\nLet me think: For the street to be fully covered, every point must lie within at least one lantern's coverage. So the key is to find the minimal d such that for every x in [0, l], there exists some lantern i where x is in [ai -d, ai +d].\n\nBut trying to model this directly seems complicated. Maybe a binary search approach would work here. Since d can vary, and the minimal d is somewhere between 0 and l/2 (since if all lanterns are at one end, the maximum needed is l/2 to cover the entire street).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Find the minimal d such that the union of all [ai -d, ai +d] covers [0, l].\n3. To find this d, perform a binary search over possible d values.\n\nBut how to check whether a certain d is sufficient? For a given d, we can process each lantern's coverage and see if the union covers the entire street.\n\nWait, but processing each lantern's coverage isn't enough. We need to know if the intervals [ai -d, ai +d] cover [0, l] without any gaps.\n\nAnother approach: For the street to be fully covered, the leftmost lantern's rightmost point should be >=0, the rightmost lantern's leftmost point <= l, and for each adjacent pair of lanterns, their coverage must meet or overlap.\n\nWait, no. Because the lanterns may not be in order. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nSort the lantern positions. Then, the minimal d must satisfy that each consecutive pair of lanterns (after sorting) has a distance between them such that the sum of their individual coverages (d) is at least the distance between them. Or wait, no— because each lantern's coverage extends d on both sides. So for two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b), the distance between them is (b - a). Each contributes d to cover towards each other. So the minimal condition is that (b - a) <= 2d. Because the maximum reach of the first is a + d, and the second is b - d. If a + d >= b - d, then they overlap.\n\nWait, yes. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns (after sorting), the distance between them must be <= 2d. Otherwise, the middle of the street between them won't be covered.\n\nAdditionally, the first lantern's right end must cover up to at least 0, and the last lantern's left end must cover down to at least l.\n\nWait, no, because the first lantern's coverage starts at a_1 - d, which could be negative, but the actual coverage starts at 0. Similarly, the last lantern's coverage ends at a_n + d, which could be beyond l, but it's clipped to l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the street is from 0 to l. So for each lantern, the coverage is [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)]. So for the first lantern, its coverage starts at 0 if a_1 <=d. For the last lantern, its coverage ends at l if a_n +d >= l.\n\nSo to ensure that the entire street is covered, the union of all [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)] must be [0, l]. How can we check if a given d satisfies this?\n\nPerhaps the steps are:\n\n- Sort the lanterns in increasing order.\n\n- Check two main conditions:\n\n   a. The first lantern's coverage starts at 0. So a_1 - d <= 0? No, because a_1 is sorted, so a_1 is the smallest. So a_1 - d could be less than 0, but the coverage starts at 0. So the condition is that the first lantern's coverage includes 0, which is automatically true because a_1 -d <= 0 implies that 0 is included. Wait, no, because the coverage is [max(0, a_1 -d), min(l, a_1 +d)]. So for 0 to be covered, a_1 -d must be <= 0. Which is always true because a_1 is the first in the sorted list. So 0 is covered if a_1 <=d, otherwise, the coverage starts at a_1 -d which is positive, but then the street from 0 to a_1 -d is not covered. So wait, no. That's a problem.\n\nWait, for example, if a_1 is 5, and d is 3. Then a_1 -d is 2. So the coverage starts at 2. So the point 0 is not covered. So the first condition is that the first lantern's coverage must include 0. So a_1 -d <= 0 → a_1 <=d.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's coverage must include l. So a_n +d >= l → a_n >= l -d.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not sufficient, because even if a_1 <=d and a_n >= l -d, the middle parts may have gaps.\n\nSo the steps to check for a given d are:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns.\n\n2. Check if the first lantern's a_1 -d <=0 → which ensures that the first part is covered.\n\n3. Check if the last lantern's a_n +d >=l → which ensures the last part is covered.\n\n4. For the middle parts, between consecutive lanterns, check that the next lantern's a_i -d is <= previous lantern's a_{i-1} +d. So the coverage overlaps.\n\nWait, but this is only necessary between consecutive lanterns after sorting. Because if the i-th lantern's coverage ends at a_i +d, and the (i+1)-th starts at a_{i+1} -d, then for them to overlap, a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d → which is equivalent to (a_{i+1} - a_i) <= 2d.\n\nSo the overall condition is:\n\nFor all i from 1 to n-1:\n\na_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d → (a_{i+1} - a_i) <= 2d.\n\nAdditionally, the first lantern's a_1 -d <=0 → a_1 <=d.\n\nAnd the last lantern's a_n +d >=l → a_n >= l -d.\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, then the entire street is covered.\n\nSo with this in mind, the steps for the solution are:\n\n- Sort the array a.\n\n- Compute the minimal d such that:\n\n   a. a[0] <=d.\n\n   b. a[-1] >= l -d.\n\n   c. For each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]), a[i+1] - a[i] <= 2d.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal d that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nNow, how to compute this d?\n\nWe can model this as an optimization problem where d must be as small as possible while satisfying all the above inequalities.\n\nThese inequalities can be rewritten as:\n\nd >= a[0]\n\nd >= (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all i in 0..n-2\n\nd >= l - a[-1]\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a[0], \n\n- (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all i,\n\n- (l - a[-1]).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because the first condition is a_0 <=d, which implies d >= a_0. The last condition is a_n >= l -d → l - a_n <=d → d >= l - a_n. And for each pair, (a_{i+1} -a_i)/2 <=d.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum among all these lower bounds.\n\nYes! Because each of these lower bounds must be satisfied, so the maximum of them will be the minimal d.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array a in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. Compute the initial lower bounds:\n\n   a. lower_bound1 = a[0]\n\n   b. lower_bound2 = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 for each i from 0 to n-2.\n\n   c. lower_bound3 = l - a[-1]\n\n3. Find the maximum of all these lower bounds.\n\nThat's it!\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nCompute the lower bounds:\n\nlower_bound1 = 0.\n\nlower_bound2 for each pair:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 →1\n\n7-5=2 →1\n\n9-7=2→1\n\n14-9=5→2.5\n\n15-14=1→0.5\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5.\n\nlower_bound3 = 15 -15 =0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting: [2,5]\n\nlower_bound1 =2.\n\nlower_bound2: (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nlower_bound3:5-5=0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2. Which is the sample output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then:\n\nlower_bound1=5.\n\nlower_bound2: none.\n\nlower_bound3=10-5=5.\n\nMaximum is 5. So d=5, which makes sense because the lantern covers from 0 to 10.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[1,4], l=5.\n\nSorted a:1,4.\n\nlower_bound1=1.\n\nlower_bound2: (4-1)/2=1.5.\n\nlower_bound3:5-4=1.\n\nMax is 1.5.\n\nSo d=1.5.\n\nCheck coverage:\n\nFirst lantern covers 1-1.5=-0.5 → 0 to 2.5.\n\nSecond covers 4-1.5=2.5 to 6, but l is 5, so 2.5 to5.\n\nCombined, they cover 0 to 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [0, 3, 5], l=5.\n\nSorted a:0,3,5.\n\nlower_bound1=0.\n\nlower_bound2 for 0-3: 1.5; 3-5:1.\n\nlower_bound3:5-5=0.\n\nMax is 1.5.\n\nSo d=1.5.\n\nCheck:\n\nFirst covers 0 to 1.5.\n\nSecond covers 3-1.5=1.5 to 3+1.5=4.5.\n\nThird covers 5-1.5=3.5 to 5+1.5=6.5, but l is5, so 3.5 to5.\n\nWait, the union is from 0 to 4.5, but the third lantern covers from 3.5 to5. So what about the point between 4.5 and3.5? Oh, no, wait, the second lantern covers up to4.5, and the third starts at3.5, which is less than4.5. So the coverage is continuous.\n\nWait, no: 4.5 is higher than 3.5. So from 3.5 to4.5, both cover it. So yes, everything is covered.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i, convert to integers.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute the lower bounds:\n\nlower1 = a[0]\n\nlower2 = max( (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for i in 0..n-2 )\n\nlower3 = l - a[-1]\n\nd = max(lower1, lower2, lower3)\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1?\n\nThen, the lower2 is zero, but lower1 is a[0], and lower3 is l -a[0].\n\nSo d is the maximum of a[0] and (l -a[0]). So which one is larger?\n\nBecause a[0] must be <=d and a[0]+d >=l.\n\nWhich is the same as d >= max(a[0], l -a[0]).\n\nWhich is correct because for n=1, the lantern must cover from 0 to l.\n\nSo for example, if a[0]=2, l=5.\n\nlower1=2.\n\nlower3=5-2=3.\n\nSo d=3.\n\nWhich is correct, because 2-3= -1 (starts at 0) and 2+3=5 (ends at5).\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=5, l=10.\n\nlower1=5.\n\nlower3=10-5=5.\n\nd=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to handle n=1 correctly.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute lower1 = a[0]\n\nCompute lower3 = l - a[-1]\n\nCompute lower2 = 0.\n\nIf n >1:\n\n   for i in 0 to n-2:\n\n       diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n       current_lower = diff / 2.0\n\n       if current_lower > lower2:\n\n           lower2 = current_lower\n\nd = max(lower1, lower2, lower3)\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but lower2 is the maximum of all (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\nSo in code, initializing lower2 to 0 and then taking the max across all pairs.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, implement this.\n\nBut wait, what if a[-1] is greater than l? Like, suppose a[-1] is 10 and l is 5. Then lower3 is 5 -10 = -5. So d must be >= max(...) including lower3, which is -5. But lower1 is a[0], which could be less than that.\n\nWait, but that can't happen because a[-1] is the maximum of the sorted array. So if a[-1] >= l, then a[-1] +d >= l is automatically true for any d>=0, because a[-1] +d >= a[-1] >= l.\n\nSo lower3 is l -a[-1], which is <=0.\n\nSo in that case, lower3 doesn't impose any constraint on d beyond d >=0.\n\nSo in code, when computing d, lower3 could be negative, but the max function will ignore it.\n\nFor example, a[-1] = 10, l=5.\n\nlower3 = 5-10= -5.\n\nd is the max of lower1, lower2, and -5.\n\nSo if lower1 is 3, lower2 is 2, then d is 3.\n\nWhich is correct because a[-1] is 10, so a[-1] +d=13 >=5, so the coverage is up to5.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the next line as a string, split into integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute lower1 = a[0]\n\nlower2 = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    current = diff / 2.0\n\n    if current > lower2:\n\n        lower2 = current\n\nlower3 = l - a[-1]\n\nd = max(lower1, lower2, lower3)\n\nBut wait, what about when n=1?\n\nIn that case, n-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run, lower2 remains 0.0.\n\nWhich is correct because for n=1, the only constraints are lower1 and lower3.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nTesting the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 7 15\n\nLanterns: [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nlower1=0.\n\nlower2:\n\n(3-0)/2=1.5\n\n(5-3)/2=1\n\n(7-5)/2=1\n\n(9-7)/2=1\n\n(14-9)/2=2.5\n\n(15-14)/2=0.5 → max is 2.5.\n\nlower3=15-15=0.\n\nd= max(0, 2.5, 0) →2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na=[2,5] → sorted.\n\nlower1=2.\n\nlower2: (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nlower3=5-5=0.\n\nd=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=[5], l=10.\n\nlower1=5.\n\nlower2=0.\n\nlower3=10-5=5.\n\nd=5.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [0,3,5], l=5.\n\nlower1=0.\n\nlower2:\n\n(3-0)/2=1.5.\n\n(5-3)/2=1.\n\nso lower2 is 1.5.\n\nlower3=5-5=0.\n\nd=1.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[0], l=0.\n\nThen, a[0]=0.\n\nlower1=0.\n\nlower2=0.\n\nlower3=0-0=0.\n\nd=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, a=0, l=100.\n\nlower1=0.\n\nlower3=100-0=100.\n\nd=100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1,4], l=5.\n\nlower1=1.\n\nlower2= (4-1)/2=1.5.\n\nlower3=5-4=1.\n\nd=1.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, a=[0, 1, 100], l=100.\n\nsorted a: 0,1,100.\n\nlower1=0.\n\nlower2:\n\n(1-0)/2=0.5.\n\n(100-1)/2=49.5.\n\nso lower2=49.5.\n\nlower3=100 -100=0.\n\nd=49.5.\n\nWhich is correct because the second lantern covers 1-49.5= -48.5 →0, and 1+49.5=50.5.\n\nThird lantern covers 100-49.5=50.5 to 149.5, but l=100, so 50.5 to100.\n\nThus, the coverage starts at 0, ends at100, and the middle is covered.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n",
