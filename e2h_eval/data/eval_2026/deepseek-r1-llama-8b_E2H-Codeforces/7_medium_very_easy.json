The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine for a given number n whether it's possible to construct a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I have to figure out for each test case if such a snowflake exists.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe snowflake is an undirected graph constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect the initial vertex to k new vertices (k > 1).\n- Each vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step creates a root connected to k children. Then, each of those children must themselves create k more children, but wait—no, not exactly. Because after the initial step, any leaf (vertex with only one edge) must undergo this expansion step. So the process continues recursively.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each step involves adding k new vertices to each such leaf. So the structure is like a tree where every node except the leaves has exactly k+1 edges? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach time a leaf (degree 1) is found, it must add k new nodes connected to it. So the process keeps expanding until there are no more leaves, but wait, no—because each step may create new leaves.\n\nWait, no. The process is: initially, we have one node. Then, we add k children to it. So now, the root has degree k, and the k children have degree 1. Then, each of these k children must add their own k children. So each of them adds k new nodes. So after that, each of the original k children has degree k+1 (connected to the root and their own k children). But then, their own children are leaves (degree 1), which would require another step of adding k children each.\n\nBut the problem says that each step should be done at least once. Hmm, the initial step is adding the first k nodes, and then the step of adding k nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when after the initial step, each of the k leaves adds k nodes. So in total, the minimal n is 1 (root) + k (first layer) + k*k (second layer) = 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, looking at the example given in the problem statement: the smallest possible snowflake for k=4 is shown. Let me calculate that. 1 +4 +16=21. So the sample input includes 9, which is less than 21, so it's 'NO', which matches the output.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in the form:\n\nn = 1 + k * (m) \n\nwhere m is a number that represents some steps beyond the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the total number of nodes is built recursively. Let's model it.\n\nLet me denote S as the number of nodes in the snowflake. The structure is a rooted tree where each node (except the leaves) has exactly k children. But wait, no—each node that is a leaf (has degree 1) must generate k new children. So the structure is similar to a k-ary tree of some depth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the snowflake as a rooted tree where each internal node has exactly k children. Wait, but the snowflake's construction is a bit different because each leaf must undergo expansion at least once. So the minimal depth is two layers beyond the root.\n\nWait, let me think about the construction:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: k nodes, each connected to the root. These are leaves after level 0, so they must each generate k children.\n- So level 2: k*k nodes.\n\nThus, the minimal snowflake has 1 + k + k^2 nodes.\n\nBut what about larger structures? For example, maybe after level 2, each of the level 2 nodes (which are leaves) also generate their own k children. So level 3 would have k^3 nodes, and so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(sum of s_i), where s_i depends on how many times we've expanded each node.\n\nWait, no. Each node that is a leaf must be expanded at least once. So the process can't stop until all leaves have been expanded once.\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the process starts with the initial step, then does at least one more step where each current leaf adds k children.\n\nSo the minimal structure is when after the initial step, each of the k leaves adds k children. So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut what about larger structures? Suppose after that, each of the k^2 leaves adds k children. Then the total becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo, the general formula for the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k*(m)\n\nwhere m is a sum that depends on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is a complete k-ary tree of height h, where h >= 2.\n\nWait, a complete k-ary tree of height h has the property that all leaves are at level h, and the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^h = (k^(h+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut in our case, the snowflake requires that each leaf (from any level) must add k children. So perhaps the structure is a perfect k-ary tree of some depth.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in the snowflake, each node that is a leaf must add k children. So it's more like a tree where each non-root node has exactly k children. So the structure is a k-ary tree of depth d, where the root has depth 0.\n\nIn that case, the number of nodes is (k^(d+1) - 1)/(k-1), since each level up to depth d has k^i nodes.\n\nBut wait, let's check for the minimal case. When d=2: 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3-1)/(k-1). So yes.\n\nBut wait, for d=1, the number is 1 +k. But in our problem, the process requires that each leaf must undergo the expansion step at least once. So for d=1, after the initial step, each leaf is the k nodes, and they must each add k children. So the minimal is d=2.\n\nSo the snowflake structure is a perfect k-ary tree of depth at least 2. Thus, n must be equal to (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1), where m >=3 (since depth is m-1 >=2, so m >=3). Or wait, no. Let's see:\n\nDepth is the maximum distance from the root. For a perfect k-ary tree of depth d, the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1}-1)/(k-1).\n\nIn our case, the minimal depth is 2, so the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo n must be equal to (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) where m is at least 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps the tree isn't necessarily perfect. Because in the problem statement, it's allowed to have deeper trees as long as each leaf has been expanded at least once. So the structure could be any tree where each node has k children except for the leaves, which have zero or more children (but each leaf must have at least one child, because the step is done at least once).\n\nWait, no. Because the step is done at least once. So each leaf must have at least one expansion. So the tree must have depth at least 2.\n\nBut the tree doesn't have to be perfect. It can have varying depths as long as each leaf has at least one expansion.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because then n can be represented in various ways, not just as the sum of a perfect k-ary tree.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find all possible k>1 and m>=2 such that n = 1 + k*(s), where s is the sum of the subsequent expansions.\n\nWait, let me model it differently. Let's say the initial node is connected to k children. Each of these children must then add k children (since the step is done at least once). So the structure is a tree where each node has exactly k children except for the leaves, which have zero. But wait, no, because the leaves are required to have at least one expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that each node (except leaves) has exactly k children, but leaves can have zero or more, but each leaf must have at least one child.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the step is done at least once. So any node that was a leaf must have added k children. So in the tree, the leaves are exactly the nodes that have been expanded at least once. So the tree is such that all non-root nodes have exactly k children, except for the root, which has k children.\n\nWait, no. The root has k children, which are leaves after the first step. Then, each of these leaves must add k children. So their children become leaves in the next step, and so on.\n\nSo the tree is a complete k-ary tree of some depth, but not necessarily perfect. Because each node must have exactly k children, except the leaves which have zero. But that's not possible because the leaves must expand into k children, so they cannot have zero children.\n\nAh, right. So each node that is a leaf (after some step) must add exactly k children. So the tree is a perfect k-ary tree of depth d >=2.\n\nBecause every internal node (non-leaf) has exactly k children, and every leaf node has exactly k children (as they must have expanded at least once). So the tree is a perfect k-ary tree of depth d.\n\nTherefore, the number of nodes in the snowflake is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d >=2.\n\nSo for each n, we need to determine if there exists integers k>1 and d>=2 such that n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 9 → Output: NO.\n\nWhat possible k and d could give n=9?\n\nCheck possible k>1:\n\nk=2:\n\nLooking for (2^{d+1}-1)/(2-1) = 2^{d+1} -1 =9 → 2^{d+1}=10 → Not a power of 2.\n\nk=3:\n\n(3^{d+1}-1)/2 =9 → 3^{d+1} =19 → Not a power of 3.\n\nk=4:\n\n(4^{d+1}-1)/3=9 →4^{d+1}=28→ No.\n\nk=5: 5^something minus 1 divided by 4 equals 9?\n\nNo, 5^2=25 → (25-1)/4=6≠9.\n\nk=6: (6^2-1)/5=11, which is bigger than 9.\n\nSo no possible k, hence output NO.\n\nAnother sample input is 13 → YES.\n\nCheck for k=2: (2^d+1 -1)/1= 2^d+1=13 → 2^d=12 → d=log2(12) → not integer.\n\nk=3: (3^d+1-1)/2 = 3^d/2=13 → 3^d=26 → no.\n\nk=4: (4^d+1-1)/3=4^d/3=13 →4^d=39 → no.\n\nk=5: (5^d+1-1)/4=5^d/4=13 →5^d=52 → no.\n\nk=6: (6^d+1-1)/5=6^d/5=13 →6^d=65 → no.\n\nk=7: 7^d+1-1 /6=7^d/6=13 →7^d=78 → no.\n\nk=8: (8^d+1-1)/7=8^d/7=13 →8^d=91 → no.\n\nWait, but what about d=3?\n\nWait, for d=2: (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for k=3: 1+3+9=13. Yes! So n=13 is possible with k=3, d=2.\n\nYes, that's why the sample output is YES.\n\nSo the approach is to check for each n whether it can be written as (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m >=3.\n\nWait, no. Because for d=2, m is 3. So in that case, n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the general formula is n = (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m >=3.\n\nSo for a given n, I need to check if it can be expressed in that form for any k>1 and m>=3.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each n, determine if there exists k>1 and m>=3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\nFor each test case, given n:\n\n1. If n < 3: automatically NO.\n\nBecause the minimal n is 1 +k +k², which for k=2 is 7. So n=1 is too small.\n\nWait, no. For k=2, the minimal n is 7 (1+2+4). So n=1: no, n=2: no, n=3: no, n=4: no, etc.\n\nWait, no. The minimal n is 1 +k +k². For k=2, 1+2+4=7.\n\nSo n must be at least 7.\n\nSo for n <7, the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but let's see: for k=3, minimal n is 13. So for n=13, it's yes.\n\nWait, but for the initial step, the minimal n is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo n has to be at least 7.\n\nSo for n <7, output is NO.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nIf n <7: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to find if there exists k>1 and m>=3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the approach is to find all possible k's and see if any m exists.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e18), we need an efficient way.\n\nSo how do we find possible k's for a given n?\n\nWell, for a given k, m must satisfy:\n\n(k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation:\n\nk^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nSo for each k>1, compute whether there's an m >=3 such that k^m = n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut trying all possible k's up to sqrt(n) is feasible, but for t=1e4 and n=1e18, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible k, we can compute m and see if it's an integer >=3.\n\nBut how do we choose the possible k's?\n\nNote that for fixed n, k can't be larger than n, but even that's too big.\n\nSo perhaps we can iterate over possible values of m, compute possible k's, and check if k is integer.\n\nWait, but m >=3. Let's consider that for each m starting from 3 upwards, and for each m, see if there's a k>1 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1)=n.\n\nBut for m=3: n =1 +k +k².\n\nSo for m=3, solving for k:\n\nk² +k +1 =n → k² +k + (1-n)=0.\n\nDiscriminant D=1-4*(1-n) =4n-3.\n\nSo k must be [ -1 ± sqrt(4n-3) ] /2.\n\nSince k>1, only the positive solution is relevant.\n\nSo sqrt(4n-3) must be an integer, and (-1 + sqrt(4n-3)) must be even.\n\nSo for m=3, the condition is:\n\n4n-3 must be a perfect square, and the square root is odd (since sqrt(4n-3) must be odd, because 4n-3 is 3 mod 4, and squares mod 4 are 0 or 1. So sqrt(4n-3) must be odd.\n\nLet me check with the sample input.\n\nSample n=13:\n\n4*13-3=49, which is 7². So sqrt is 7, which is odd. So k=( -1 +7 )/2=3, which is integer. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, n=255: for m=3, 4*255-3=1020-3=1017, which is 31.9... not a square. So no for m=3.\n\nWait, but perhaps for higher m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n1. Check if n is less than 7 → output NO.\n\n2. Else, for m from 3 to log_max, do the following:\n\n   a. Compute the equation (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n   b. Rearranged: k^m = n*(k-1) +1.\n\n   c. We can think of this as for a given m, can we find a k>1 such that k^m is equal to n*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut solving for k in this equation is difficult.\n\nAlternative approach: for a given n, find all possible k>1 that could satisfy the equation for some m>=3.\n\nWe can iterate k from 2 to cube root of (n) or something, but for n=1e18, cube root is 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each k, how do we find m such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut perhaps for a given k, we can compute for each possible m.\n\nWait, but for each k, what's the maximum possible m?\n\nWe can note that for a given k, (k^m -1)/(k-1) increases exponentially with m.\n\nSo for each k, the maximum possible m is limited by the fact that (k^m -1)/(k-1) <=n.\n\nSo for each k, we can binary search m in the range 3 to log_k(n*(k-1)+1).\n\nBut for k up to 1e6, and t=1e4, this may be manageable.\n\nBut wait, 1e4 * 1e6 is 1e10 operations, which is way too much.\n\nThat's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible m, find k.\n\nWe can loop m from 3 up to the maximum possible (like log_2(n) is about 60), since for m=60, k^60 is huge, so for each m, compute possible k.\n\nFor each m, we can compute k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1)=n.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can rearrange the equation:\n\nk^m = n*(k-1) +1.\n\nWe can try to find k for each m.\n\nBut for a given m, solving for k is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, perform binary search on k.\n\nBecause for each m, the function f(k) = (k^m -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1.\n\nSo for each m, perform binary search on k in [2, ... , upper_bound], to see if f(k) =n.\n\nIf for any m, such a k exists, return YES.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBecause m can be up to, say, 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18), so for each test case, we can loop m from 3 to 60, and for each m, perform a binary search on k.\n\nSo for each test case, the steps are:\n\nLoop m from 3 to 60:\n\n   Binary search for k in [2, ... , n] such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) ==n.\n\nIf any such k exists, return YES.\n\nElse, after all m's, return NO.\n\nThis approach should be feasible, as for each test case, it's 60 steps, each involving a binary search of about log2(1e18) ≈60 steps. So per test case, 60*60=3600 operations. For t=1e4, that's 3.6e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute (k^m -1)/(k-1) efficiently, without causing integer overflows.\n\nBut in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given mid (candidate k), compute f(mid) = (mid^m -1)/(mid-1). Compare it to n.\n\nBut computing mid^m for mid=1e9 and m=60 is 1e540, which is a very big number. So we need to handle this carefully.\n\nWait, but in Python, big integers are handled, but for m=60, mid=1e9, mid^m is 1e540, which is way larger than n (1e18). So for each binary search step, for a given mid and m, compute mid^m, subtract 1, divide by mid-1, and see if it equals n.\n\nBut for mid=1e9 and m=60, this is computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable in Python for the given constraints.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute f(mid) incrementally and check early if it exceeds n.\n\nBecause f(k) grows rapidly with k and m.\n\nSo during the computation of f(k), we can stop early if the partial product exceeds n*(k-1)+1, thus avoiding unnecessary computation.\n\nWait, f(k) is (k^m -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo for a given k and m, we can compute this sum step by step, and if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can break and return that this k is too big.\n\nThis way, we can avoid computing very large exponents.\n\nYes, that's a good optimization.\n\nSo the algorithm for each m and binary search step:\n\nFor a given m, perform binary search on k in low=2, high= some upper bound (like n-1, since for m=3, the minimal k is 2, and for higher m, k can't be too big).\n\nFor each candidate k:\n\nCompute the sum s = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nBut during the computation, if s exceeds n, we can break early and treat it as larger than n.\n\nCompare s to n.\n\nIf s ==n: return True.\n\nElse, adjust binary search accordingly.\n\nSo for each binary search step, compute the sum s incrementally and stop early.\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nSo let's outline the code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   if n <7: print NO and continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 3 to 60:\n\n          low = 2\n\n          high = n-1  # because for m=3, the minimal k is 2, and for larger m, k will be smaller.\n\n          while low <=high:\n\n              mid = (low + high) //2\n\n              compute s =1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{m-1}\n\n              during the computation:\n\n                  if s exceeds n, break and set s =n+1.\n\n              if s ==n:\n\n                  return YES for this test case.\n\n              elif s <n:\n\n                  low = mid +1\n\n              else:\n\n                  high = mid -1\n\n      after all m's, return NO.\n\nBut wait, for each m, the sum s is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}, which is the same as (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the code will correctly compute s.\n\nBut implementing this requires writing a helper function that, given k and m, computes s, stopping if s exceeds n.\n\nSo the helper function could look like:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    s =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        s += current\n\n        if s >n:\n\n            return n+1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return s\n\nBut wait, for m=3, it's 1 +k +k².\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, for each m from 3 to 60, we can perform a binary search for k.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible m?\n\nBecause for a given n, the minimal m is 3, but what's the maximum m?\n\nThe sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} =n.\n\nWe can find the maximum possible m as log_k(n).\n\nBut in practice, for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60.\n\nSo iterating m from 3 to 60 is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 9 → Output: NO.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nCheck if any k exists.\n\nCompute for k=2: 1+2+4=7 <9.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9=13>9.\n\nSo no.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nLooking for k where 1 +k +k² +k^3 =9.\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1 is invalid.\n\nSo no.\n\nSimilarly, higher m's won't help.\n\nSo output is NO.\n\nAnother sample: 13.\n\nm=3: k=3, sum=13 → yes.\n\nAnother sample: 255.\n\nCheck for m=3:\n\nEquation is 1 +k +k² =255.\n\nk² +k -254=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 +1016=1017.

So not a match.\n\nWait, but what about m=2?\n\nWait, earlier steps: no, because m starts from 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps for higher m, but perhaps m=3 is not the only possibility.

Which is not a perfect square. So no solution.\n\nWait, but perhaps for m=4, k=4: sum is 85.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that for m=4, there's a solution.\n\nWait, let's compute for k=6 and m=4: sum is 1+6+36+216=259>255.\n\nSo no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, 255 is a YES.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=4, k=5 gives sum 1+5+25+125=156.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=5, k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=4, k=255/(some other way).\n\nWait, maybe the snowflake isn't a perfect k-ary tree of depth d, but has varying depths.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure allows for some nodes to have more than k children.\n\nWait, no. According to the problem statement, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (a leaf) must be connected to k new vertices. So the tree is built such that each node has exactly k children, except the leaves, which have zero. Wait, but leaves must have at least one child, as the step is done at least once.\n\nSo no, the tree must be a perfect k-ary tree.\n\nHmm, but then why is 255 a YES?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the possible m and k.\n\nWait, 255 = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo let's try k=2.\n\nThen, (2^m -1)/(2-1) =2^m -1 =255.\n\nSo 2^m=256 → m=8.\n\nSo yes!\n\nBecause 2^8=256, 256-1=255.\n\nSo for k=2, m=8.\n\nSo for m=8, which is >=3, it's valid.\n\nAh! So for n=255, the solution is k=2, m=8.\n\nSo the sum is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach for n=255 would find that for m=8, k=2.\n\nSo in the code, when m=8, the binary search for k=2 would find that the sum is 255.\n\nThus, the code would return YES.\n\nSo the code needs to loop m up to 60, which covers m=8.\n\nSo in the code, for each m from 3 to 60, including 8, we would find this case.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the steps in code are:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n <7 → output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 3 to 60:\n\n          low=2, high= some value (maybe up to n).\n\n          while low<=high:\n\n              mid = (low +high)//2.\n\n              compute s=1 +mid +mid^2 + ... +mid^{m-1}.\n\n              if during the computation, s exceeds n → break and set s=n+1.\n\n              if s ==n → output YES and proceed to next test case.\n\n              elif s <n → low=mid+1.\n\n              else → high=mid-1.\n\n      after all m's → output NO.\n\nSo now, the code can be written.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nn=7 → k=2, m=3 → YES.\n\nn=255 → k=2, m=8 → YES.\n\nn=13 → k=3, m=3 → YES.\n\nn=1 → NO.\n\nn=6 → NO.\n\nn=3 → NO.\n\nn=2 → NO.\n\nn=4 → NO.\n\nn=7 → YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=10101.\n\nSample output is NO.\n\nLet's see why.\n\nIs there any m and k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1)=10101.\n\nCheck for k=2:\n\nWe need 2^m -1=10101 →2^m=10102 → not a power of 2.\n\nk=3:\n\n1+3+9+...+3^{m-1}=10101.\n\nCheck for m=3: 1+3+9=13 <10101.\n\nm=4: 1+3+9+27=40 <10101.\n\nm=5: 1+3+9+27+81=121 <10101.\n\nContinue until sum exceeds.\n\nBut for k=3, the sum grows exponentially. So for m=12: sum is 1+3+9+...+3^11 = (3^12-1)/(3-1) = (531441-1)/2=265,720 → less than 10,101? No, wait 265,720 is bigger than 10,101.\n\nWait, 3^7 is 2187. sum up to m=7 is 1+3+9+27+81+243+729=1093 <10,101.\n\nm=8: sum is 1093 +2187=3280 <10101.\n\nm=9: 3280 +6561=9841 <10101.\n\nm=10: 9841 + 19683= 29524>10101.\n\nSo for k=3, m=9: sum is 9841 <10101.\n\nm=10: sum is 29524>10101.\n\nSo no.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4:\n\nsum for m=3: 1+4+16=21 <10101.\n\nm=4: 1+4+16+64=85 <10101.\n\nm=5: 1+4+16+64+256=341 <10101.\n\nm=6: 341+1024=1365 <10101.\n\nm=7: 1365 +4096=5461 <10101.\n\nm=8: 5461 +16384=21845>10101.\n\nSo for k=4, m=7: sum is 5461 <10101.\n\nNo.\n\nk=5:\n\nsum for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific way where each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex must be connected to \\( k \\) new vertices, and this step must be done at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph can be thought of as a perfect k-ary tree of depth \\( d \\) where each internal node has exactly \\( k \\) children, and each leaf node (after expansion) also has exactly \\( k \\) children.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of vertices in such a tree is given by the formula \\( \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \\), where \\( m \\) is the depth of the tree plus one, and \\( k \\) is the number of children each node has. For a valid snowflake graph, \\( m \\) must be at least 3.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, we check if there exist integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \\). We do this by iterating over possible values of \\( m \\) from 3 to 60 (since higher values are impractical for large \\( n \\)) and using binary search to find a suitable \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    s = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        s += current\n        if s > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return s\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = n - 1  # Upper bound for k\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Small Values**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's immediately determined to be invalid as the smallest possible snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Depths**: For each possible depth \\( m \\) starting from 3 up to 60, perform a binary search to find a suitable \\( k \\).\n4. **Binary Search for \\( k \\)**: For each \\( m \\), the binary search checks if there exists a \\( k \\) such that the sum of the series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{m-1} \\) equals \\( n \\).\n5. **Compute Sum Efficiently**: The `compute_sum` function efficiently calculates the sum, stopping early if it exceeds \\( n \\) to avoid unnecessary computations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations for the snowflake graph without excessive computational overhead, even for very large values of \\( n \\).",
