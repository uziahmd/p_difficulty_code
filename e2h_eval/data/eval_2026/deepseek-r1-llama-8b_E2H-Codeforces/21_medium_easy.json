The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible using the keys. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem says that each key can be used to unlock at most one chest, and each chest can be opened once. The condition for a key j and chest i is that a_i + b_j must be odd. So, I need to find the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked given the constraints.\n\nHmm, let's think about the parity of a_i and b_j. Because adding two numbers gives an odd result only if one is even and the other is odd. So, for a_i and b_j to have a sum that's odd, one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\nThat means, the chests can be divided into two groups based on their a_i values: those that are even and those that are odd. Similarly for the keys.\n\nSo, let's categorize the chests:\n\n- Even chests: these require keys that are odd because even + odd = odd.\n- Odd chests: these require keys that are even because odd + even = odd.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. If a chest has a_i even, then to get an odd sum, b_j must be odd. Because even + odd = odd. Similarly, if a_i is odd, then b_j needs to be even for the sum to be odd.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Count how many even and odd chests there are.\n2. Count how many even and odd keys there are.\n3. For each type (even chest -> needs odd key, odd chest -> needs even key), match the available keys to the chests in a way that maximizes the number of unlocks.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about it. We have two separate problems:\n\n- How many even chests can we unlock with the available odd keys?\n- How many odd chests can we unlock with the available even keys?\n\nWe can process these two separately and sum them up.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to handle each case optimally.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Separate the chests into even and odd counts.\n- Similarly, separate the keys into even and odd counts.\n- For even chests, the number that can be unlocked is the minimum of the count of even chests and the count of available odd keys. But wait, no—because each key can be used only once. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimum of the two, but also considering how many can be covered.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the number of even chests is E, and the number of odd keys is O1. Then, the maximum possible even chests we can unlock is min(E, O1). But wait, no—because each key can be used only once. So, if E is 5 and O1 is 3, then we can unlock 3 even chests.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd chests, the number is min(Od_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nSo, the total would be the sum of these two minima.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the keys are being used across both types. Oh right, because the same key can't be used for both. So, for example, if you have some even keys and some odd keys, you have to decide how to allocate them between unlocking even and odd chests.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nSo, what's the optimal way to allocate the keys?\n\nWe need to maximize the sum of even_chests_unlocked and odd_chests_unlocked, given the constraints on the keys.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet’s denote:\n- E = number of even chests\n- O = number of odd chests\n- K_even = number of even keys\n- K_odd = number of odd keys\n\nWe need to decide how many even keys to use for even chests, and how many odd keys to use for even chests. Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach even chest requires an odd key. Each odd chest requires an even key.\n\nSo, the even keys can be used for the odd chests, and the odd keys can be used for the even chests.\n\nBut the allocation is such that:\n\n- The number of even chests that can be unlocked is the minimum of E and the available odd keys.\n\n- The number of odd chests that can be unlocked is the minimum of O and the available even keys.\n\nBut wait, this isn't correct because the keys are all part of either the even or odd group. So, when you decide how to allocate, it's a matter of choosing how many even keys to assign to odd chests, and how many odd keys to assign to even chests.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of the two minima, but sometimes that might not be possible because the allocation could interfere. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think of it as:\n\nWe can allocate up to K_odd keys to the even chests, and up to K_even keys to the odd chests. But the total can't exceed K_odd + K_even, of course.\n\nWait, no. Because each key is used once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe have two resources: K_odd and K_even.\n\nWe need to choose x and y such that:\n\nx ≤ E → number of even chests unlocked, which uses x keys from K_odd.\n\ny ≤ O → number of odd chests unlocked, which uses y keys from K_even.\n\nAnd the total x + y should be as large as possible, subject to x ≤ K_odd and y ≤ K_even.\n\nBut wait, that's not all. Also, the sum x + y cannot exceed n, the total chests.\n\nWait, yes, because each chest can be unlocked at most once.\n\nBut the main point is that the sum x + y is bounded by the sum of the two minima, but perhaps not. So, the maximum is the minimum of (E + O) and (K_odd + K_even), but also limited by individual constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum between:\n\n- (E + O) and (K_odd + K_even), since that's the total possible.\n\nBut also, the sum can't exceed (E + O) because that's all the chests.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked? It's the maximum number of chests where each is matched with a key, considering the parity.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the number of even chests that can be unlocked and the number of odd chests that can be unlocked.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible given the constraints on the keys.\n\nSo, let's model this as:\n\nmax_chests = min(E + O, K_odd + K_even)\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, suppose E=3, O=3, K_odd=2, K_even=2. Then E+O=6, K_odd + K_even=4. So the maximum is 4. But is that achievable?\n\nYes, because you can assign 2 even chests to use 2 odd keys, and 2 odd chests to use 2 even keys. So 2+2=4.\n\nAnother example: E=5, O=0, K_odd=3, K_even=10.\n\nThen max_chests would be 5, because O=0. So, assign 3 keys from K_odd to E=5. So 3 even chests unlocked, and 0 odd.\n\nSo, in this case, the sum is 3, which is less than E=5 because K_odd is 3.\n\nSo, the initial idea is to take the minimum between E + O and K_odd + K_even, but also, the sum can't exceed E + O, but also can't exceed the sum of the two individual constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum can't be more than E + O because that's all the chests.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum of:\n\n- (E + O) and (K_odd + K_even), but also, each part can't exceed their own resource.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because for example, E=100, O=100, K_odd=50, K_even=50.\n\nIn this case, E + O=200, K_odd + K_even=100. So the maximum is 100. Which is correct because you can unlock 100 chests.\n\nAnother example: E=3, O=3, K_odd=1, K_even=1. Then, the maximum is 2, because you can unlock 1 even and 1 odd chest.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is the minimum of (E + O) and (K_odd + K_even).\n\nBut wait, let's test another case. Suppose E=3, O=3, K_odd=2, K_even=2.\n\nThen, the sum is 4, which is 2+2. But E + O is 6, which is larger than 4. So the maximum is 4.\n\nAnother test case: E=5, O=0, K_odd=3, K_even=10.\n\nE + O is 5, K_odd + K_even is 13. So the maximum is 5.\n\nYes, because 3 even chests can be unlocked with 3 odd keys, and 0 for the others.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests (E and O).\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys (K_even and K_odd).\n3. Compute total_max = min(E + O, K_even + K_odd).\n   - Because each chest requires a key, and the total number of keys determines the upper limit.\n4. But also, the sum can't exceed the number of chests. So the maximum is min(total_max, n).\n\nWait, but since E + O is always equal to n, because E is the count of even chests, O is the count of odd ones. So E + O = n.\n\nSo, the maximum is the minimum between n and (K_odd + K_even).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because, for example, if K_odd + K_even is larger than n, then we can only unlock n chests. Otherwise, we can unlock K_odd + K_even chests.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nCompute the total number of even keys plus odd keys. The maximum number of chests is the minimum between n and (K_odd + K_even).\n\nWait, but is that always the case?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose K_odd is 5, K_even is 5. And n is 10.\n\nE=3, O=7.\n\nSo, K_odd + K_even =10, which is equal to n. So, maximum is 10.\n\nBut E=3, which can be unlocked with K_odd=5 (since 3 <=5). O=7, which can be unlocked with K_even=5 (since 5 <7). So, the maximum is 3+5=8. Which is less than 10.\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nSo, my previous approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, what's happening here.\n\nWait, in this case:\n\nE=3 (even chests), O=7 (odd chests).\n\nKeys: K_odd=5 (odd keys), K_even=5 (even keys).\n\nSo, each even chest uses an odd key, each odd chest uses an even key.\n\nSo, the maximum number of even chests that can be unlocked is min(E, K_odd) =3.\n\nThe maximum number of odd chests that can be unlocked is min(O, K_even)=5.\n\nTotal is 3+5=8, which is less than K_odd + K_even=10.\n\nBut according to the previous formula, min(n, K_odd + K_even) is min(10,10) =10. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nSo, what's the correct way?\n\nAh, right, because the sum of E and O is fixed as n, but the sum of K_odd and K_even may be higher, but we can't unlock more than n chests.\n\nWait, but in the example above, the sum of E and O is 10, which is n=10. But the actual maximum is 8, which is less than 10.\n\nSo, the initial approach of min(n, K_odd + K_even) is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So, the correct approach must consider both the sum of E and O, and the sum of K_odd and K_even, but also, the individual constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is min(E + O, K_odd + K_even, ... something else? Or perhaps it's the sum of the min(E, K_odd) and min(O, K_even), but that can't be directly added because the allocation affects each other.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nWe have two variables: x is the number of even chests unlocked, which can be at most min(E, K_odd).\n\ny is the number of odd chests unlocked, which can be at most min(O, K_even).\n\nBut the total x + y is subject to x <= K_odd and y <= K_even, but also, the sum x + y can't exceed E + O (which is n), but also, the sum can't exceed K_odd + K_even.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nWe need to find the maximum x + y, such that x <= E, y <= O, x <= K_odd, y <= K_even, and x + y <= n.\n\nBut that's not sufficient because E + O is n.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, the maximum x is 3 (using all K_odd=5), and y is 5 (using all K_even=5), giving x+y=8. But since n is 10, why can't we unlock more?\n\nBecause the other chests are either even or odd, but the keys are all used up.\n\nWait, but in that example, K_odd is 5, which is enough for E=3. K_even is 5, which is enough for O=7.\n\nWait, no, because O=7 is the number of odd chests. So, y can't exceed 5 (since K_even is 5). So, the maximum y is 5, but O is 7, so 5 is allowed.\n\nSo, the total is 3+5=8, but the sum of K_odd + K_even is 10.\n\nSo, in this case, the sum is 8, which is less than 10.\n\nSo, the maximum is determined by the sum of the individual minima, but also limited by the sum of the key counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is the minimum between (E + O) and (K_odd + K_even), but also, the sum of the individual minima.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the sum of the minima, but can't exceed the sum of the key counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is the minimum between (sum of min(E, K_odd) + sum of min(O, K_even)), and (K_odd + K_even)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first example where E=3, O=7, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nmin(E, K_odd) is 3.\n\nmin(O, K_even) is5.\n\nSum is 8.\n\nWhich is less than K_odd + K_even =10.\n\nSo, the maximum is 8.\n\nSo, the formula is sum of the minima, but the sum can't exceed the total number of keys.\n\nSo, the maximum chests is min( (min(E, K_odd) + min(O, K_even)), (K_odd + K_even) ) ).\n\nWait, but that's not quite correct. Because in another scenario, perhaps the sum of the minima is greater than the sum of the keys.\n\nFor example, E=4, O=4, K_odd=3, K_even=3.\n\nmin(E, K_odd)=3, min(O, K_even)=3. Sum is 6.\n\nSum of keys is 6. So, the maximum is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: E=5, O=5, K_odd=3, K_even=3.\n\nSum of minima is 6, which is less than sum of keys (6). So, maximum is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the earlier example, sum of minima was 8, sum of keys 10. So, maximum is 8.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nmax_chests = min( min(E, K_odd) + min(O, K_even), K_odd + K_even )\n\nBut wait, why not just sum the minima? Because the sum can't exceed the sum of the keys.\n\nWait, no, because sometimes the sum of minima can be more than the sum of the keys.\n\nWait, let me think. Is that possible?\n\nLike, if E=10, O=10, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nmin(E, K_odd)=5, min(O, K_even)=5. Sum is 10. Sum of keys is 10. So, okay.\n\nAnother case: E=3, O=3, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nmin(E, K_odd)=3, min(O, K_even)=3. Sum is 6. Sum of keys is 10. So, maximum is 6, which is less than sum of keys.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Separate the chests into even and odd counts: E and O.\n2. Separate the keys into even and odd counts: K_even and K_odd.\n3. Compute x = min(E, K_odd)\n4. Compute y = min(O, K_even)\n5. The maximum chests is min(x + y, K_odd + K_even)\n   - Because x + y can't exceed the sum of the keys, which is K_odd + K_even.\n6. Also, the maximum can't exceed n (since E + O =n), but since x + y can't be more than n, because x <= E, y <= O.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where E=3, O=7, K_odd=5, K_even=5:\n\nx = min(3,5) =3\n\ny = min(7,5)=5\n\nx + y=8, which is less than K_odd + K_even=10.\n\nSo, the maximum is 8.\n\nAnother example: E=5, O=5, K_odd=3, K_even=3.\n\nx=3, y=3. Sum 6. Sum of keys 6. So, maximum 6.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute x = min(E, K_odd)\n\nCompute y = min(O, K_even)\n\nmax_chests = min(x + y, K_odd + K_even)\n\nBut wait, why not min(x + y, n)? Because x + y can't exceed E + O =n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_c = min( (min(E, K_odd) + min(O, K_even)), (K_odd + K_even) )\n\nBut since min(E, K_odd) + min(O, K_even) can't be more than E + O, which is n, then the first term is already <=n.\n\nSo, the second condition (K_odd + K_even) is the limiting factor.\n\nSo, the maximum chests is the minimum of (x + y) and (K_odd + K_even).\n\nBut wait, let's test another case.\n\nCase where K_odd + K_even is larger than n.\n\nE.g., E=3, O=3, K_odd=10, K_even=10.\n\nx =3, y=3. sum is 6.\n\nK_odd + K_even=20.\n\nSo, maximum chests is 6.\n\nWhich is correct because E=3, O=3, so 6 chests.\n\nAnother case: E=3, O=3, K_odd=3, K_even=3.\n\nx=3, y=3. sum 6. K_odd + K_even=6.\n\nSo, maximum is 6.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the a array, count E and O.\n\n- Read the b array, count K_even and K_odd.\n\n- Compute x = min(E, K_odd)\n\n- Compute y = min(O, K_even)\n\n- max_c = x + y\n\n- but ensure that max_c does not exceed K_odd + K_even.\n\n- So, max_c = min(max_c, K_odd + K_even)\n\nBut wait, because x + y could be more than K_odd + K_even?\n\nNo, because x is the number of even chests unlocked, which uses x keys from K_odd. Similarly, y uses y keys from K_even.\n\nSo, x + y is the total number of keys used, which can't exceed K_odd + K_even.\n\nBecause each key is used once.\n\nSo, x + y <= K_odd + K_even.\n\nBecause x is <= K_odd and y <= K_even.\n\nSo, the sum x + y is automatically <= K_odd + K_even.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is x + y.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where E=3, O=7, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nx =3, y=5. sum is 8.\n\nWhich is less than K_odd + K_even=10.\n\nSo, the maximum is 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, so then why was the initial approach wrong?\n\nBecause earlier I thought that the maximum is the minimum of n and (K_odd + K_even), but that's not the case.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nCompute x = min(E, K_odd)\n\nCompute y = min(O, K_even)\n\nmax_c = x + y\n\nSo, the maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, because K_odd + K_even is the total number of keys, and x + y can't exceed that.\n\nSo, the maximum is x + y.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial idea of taking the minimum of (E+O, K_odd + K_even) is incorrect.\n\nBut in the earlier example where E=3, O=3, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nx + y = 3 +3 =6, which is less than 10 (K_odd + K_even=10).\n\nSo, the maximum is 6, which is correct.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute x and y, and sum them.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount_evens_a = number of even a_i.\n\ncount_odds_a = n - count_evens_a.\n\ncount_evens_b = number of even b_j.\n\ncount_odds_b = m - count_evens_b.\n\nx = min(count_evens_a, count_odds_b)\n\ny = min(count_odds_a, count_evens_b)\n\nmax_c = x + y\n\nprint(max_c)\n\nWait, but wait in the earlier example where E=3, O=7, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nx=3, y=5. sum 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in another example where E=5, O=5, K_odd=3, K_even=3.\n\nx=3, y=3. sum 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: E=3, O=3, K_odd=2, K_even=2.\n\nx=2, y=2. sum 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct solution is to simply compute x + y, where x is the min of E and K_odd, and y is the min of O and K_even.\n\nBut wait, what if E=3, O=3, K_odd=5, K_even=5.\n\nx=3, y=3. sum 6, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, but the correct approach is to compute x + y, regardless of whether it's less than K_odd + K_even or not.\n\nWait, but why is that? Because each key can be used only once, but the sum x + y is the total number of keys used. So, it's inherently <= K_odd + K_even.\n\nBecause x is the number of even chests unlocked, which uses x keys from K_odd.\n\ny is the number of odd chests unlocked, which uses y keys from K_even.\n\nSo, x + y <= K_odd + K_even.\n\nHence, the maximum is x + y.\n\nSo, the correct formula is to compute x + y.\n\nSo, that's the solution.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCount the number of even a_i (E).\n\nCount the number of odd a_i (O) = n - E.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCount the number of even b_j (K_even).\n\nCount the number of odd b_j (K_odd) = m - K_even.\n\nCompute x = min(E, K_odd).\n\nCompute y = min(O, K_even).\n\nmax_c = x + y.\n\nPrint max_c.\n\nWait, but in the sample input provided:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo, a is [9,14,6,2,11].\n\nEven a_i: 14,6,2 → E=3.\n\nOdd a_i: 9,11 → O=2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20].\n\nEven b_j:8,4,20 → K_even=3.\n\nOdd b_j:7 → K_odd=1.\n\nSo:\n\nx = min(3,1)=1.\n\ny = min(2,3)=2.\n\nx + y =3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\na_i: all even (E=5), O=0.\n\nb_j: 5 is odd. K_even=0, K_odd=1.\n\nx = min(5,1)=1.\n\ny = min(0,0)=0.\n\nsum is 1.\n\nSample output is 1.\n\nThird sample:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50.\n\na_i:10 is even → E=1, O=0.\n\nb_j: all even (K_even=4, K_odd=0).\n\nx= min(1,0)=0.\n\ny= min(0,4)=0.\n\nsum is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [2,4,6] → E=3, O=0.\n\nb: [1,3,5] → K_odd=3, K_even=0.\n\nx = min(3,3)=3.\n\ny = min(0,0)=0.\n\nsum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,3,5] → E=0, O=3.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → K_even=3, K_odd=0.\n\nx= min(0,0)=0.\n\ny= min(3,3)=3.\n\nsum is3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,2,3] → E=1, O=2.\n\nb: [1,2,3] → K_odd=2, K_even=1.\n\nx= min(1,2)=1.\n\ny= min(2,1)=1.\n\nsum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\nWe can unlock 1 even chest (using 1 odd key), and 1 odd chest (using 1 even key). Total 2.\n\nBut the sum of K_odd + K_even is 3. So, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list, count the number of even elements.\n\nE = number of even a_i.\n\nO = n - E.\n\nRead b list, count the number of even elements.\n\nK_even = number of even b_j.\n\nK_odd = m - K_even.\n\nx = min(E, K_odd)\n\ny = min(O, K_even)\n\nmax_c = x + y\n\nprint(max_c)\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input format is a bit tricky. Looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as three lines:\n\nFirst line: n m.\n\nSecond line: a_1 ... a_n.\n\nThird line: b_1 ... b_m.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the input is presented as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nBut in reality, the input is read as three separate lines. So, in code, we can read the first line as n, m.\n\nThen, read the next line as the a list.\n\nThen, read the third line as the b list.\n\nBut in the sample input, each of the three parts is a separate line.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, compute E as len([x for x in a if x % 2 ==0]).\n\nSimilarly for O.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps compute E and O by checking each element.\n\nAlternatively, for a list, we can loop through each element and count.\n\nSo, code:\n\nE = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 ==0:\n\n        E +=1\n\nO = n - E\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample inputs, it works.\n\nSo, the final code would be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that can be unlocked using the given keys. Each key can unlock a specific type of chest based on the parity (even or odd) of the numbers written on the key and the chest.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of the key number and the chest number is odd. This means:\n   - An even-numbered key can unlock an odd-numbered chest.\n   - An odd-numbered key can unlock an even-numbered chest.\n   \n2. **Categorization**: We categorize the chests into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers. Similarly, we categorize the keys into even and odd groups.\n\n3. **Counting**: Count the number of even and odd chests and keys. Let:\n   - `E` be the number of even chests.\n   - `O` be the number of odd chests.\n   - `K_even` be the number of even keys.\n   - `K_odd` be the number of odd keys.\n\n4. **Matching Keys to Chests**:\n   - To unlock even chests, we use odd keys.\n   - To unlock odd chests, we use even keys.\n   \n5. **Maximize Unlocks**: The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is determined by the minimum number of matching keys available for each type of chest. Specifically:\n   - `x = min(E, K_odd)` is the maximum number of even chests that can be unlocked.\n   - `y = min(O, K_even)` is the maximum number of odd chests that can be unlocked.\n   - The total number of unlocked chests is `x + y`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + m]))\n    \n    # Count even chests\n    E = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            E += 1\n    O = n - E\n\n    # Count even keys\n    K_even = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            K_even += 1\n    K_odd = m - K_even\n\n    x = min(E, K_odd)\n    y = min(O, K_even)\n    max_c = x + y\n    print(max_c)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string and split into manageable parts for processing.\n- **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: We count the number of even and odd chests and keys.\n- **Matching Keys to Chests**: We determine how many chests can be unlocked by using the available keys optimally.\n- **Output the Result**: The result is the sum of the maximum possible unlocked even and odd chests.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using the given keys, considering the constraints on key usage.",
