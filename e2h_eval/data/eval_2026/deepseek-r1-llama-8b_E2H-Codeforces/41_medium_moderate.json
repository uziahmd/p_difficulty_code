There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best approach. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nWe have n spots on a street where we can build houses. Each spot can have a height between 0 and h. The goal is to maximize the profit, which is the sum of squares of each house's height. \n\nBut there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. So for each such restriction, the maximum height in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nHmm, the challenge is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied and the profit is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since n and m are up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because the constraints are small, perhaps a bitmask or some state representation could work.\n\nWait, but with n=50, the state space might get too big if we try to represent it as a DP with position and some other variables. Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem by considering the intervals and their constraints, and find for each spot the maximum possible height it can have without violating any constraints.\n\nAnother thought: each restriction affects a range of spots. For each spot, its maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include this spot. Wait, no, because a spot could be in multiple ranges. For example, a spot in the middle might be covered by several restrictions. So the maximum allowed height for a spot is the minimum of all x_i for the restrictions that apply to it, and also not exceeding h.\n\nSo first, for each spot i, determine the maximum allowed height. Let's call this max_height[i]. Then, the problem reduces to choosing for each spot a height between 0 and max_height[i], such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nAh, right! Because the constraints are that in each restriction's range, the maximum is at most x_i. So for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_j where j's restriction covers i. So for each spot, compute this min and then choose the highest possible a_i (<= max_height[i]) to maximize the profit.\n\nWait, but wait—no. Because for a spot i, the maximum possible a_i isn't just the minimum of x_j's for overlapping restrictions, because each restriction's x_j is the maximum allowed in that specific interval. So the maximum allowed a_i is the minimum x_j across all restrictions that cover i, but also can't exceed h.\n\nYes. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_j from restrictions that include this spot.\n\nOnce we have these max_heights for each spot, the problem becomes selecting a_i values between 0 and max_height[i], such that the sum of squares is maximized. Because each a_i can be chosen independently now—since the constraints have already been considered by setting max_height[i].\n\nSo the next step is, for each spot i, choose a_i as high as possible to maximize a_i squared. That would mean, for each spot, set a_i to max_height[i], because higher a_i gives more profit.\n\nWait, but wait—is that correct? Suppose two different restrictions affect the same spot. For example, one restricts spot 2-3 to x=5, another restricts 2-4 to x=3. Then, spot 2 is restricted by both, so its maximum height is min(5,3) = 3. So the maximum for spot 2 is 3.\n\nSo yes, for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that cover it, and h. So once we compute this for each spot, the optimal choice is to set each a_i to this maximum possible value.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), find all restrictions that include i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j).\n\n2. For each such restriction, take x_j. Compute the minimum of all x_j and h.\n\n3. The maximum allowed height for i is this minimum.\n\n4. Then, for each spot, set a_i to this maximum allowed height to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThen, calculate the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then its maximum height is h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for each spot the minimal x among all applicable restrictions plus h, then setting each a_i to that minimal x. Then sum the squares.\n\nWait, but why can't a spot have a lower a_i than the maximum allowed? Because the square function increases with the value, so choosing the maximum possible a_i for each spot will give the maximum possible sum.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each spot i, collect all x_i from the restrictions that include i.\n\n- Take the minimum of those x's and h.\n\n- Set a_i to that minimum.\n\n- Sum all a_i squared.\n\nSo, the key is to process all the restrictions, and for each spot, find the minimum x among all applicable restrictions, and then compare that to h, taking the minimum.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nWe'll process each of the m restrictions. For each restriction, we note the l and r and x. Then, for each spot from l to r, we track the minimum x that applies to it.\n\nSo, let's create an array min_x of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based). Initialize each element to h, since without any restrictions, the maximum is h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l, r, x), we iterate from spot l to r, and for each spot i in this range, we compute the current min_x[i] as the minimum between its current value and x.\n\nAfter processing all restrictions, each min_x[i] holds the maximum allowed height for spot i.\n\nOnce we have min_x, we compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but wait—what about when a spot is covered by multiple restrictions. For example, if spot 2 is covered by a restriction (2-2, x=3) and another (2-3, x=5). Then, the min x for spot 2 is min(3,5) =3, but since spot 2 is only covered by the first restriction, but the second includes it. Oh wait, no—the second restriction includes spot 2, but its x is 5. So the min_x for spot 2 is min(3,5, h). So regardless of how many restrictions cover it, we take the minimum of all x's for those restrictions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize min_x array to h for each spot.\n\nFor each of the m restrictions:\n\n   Read l, r, x.\n\n   For i from l to r:\n\n      if x < min_x[i], then update min_x[i] to x.\n\nBecause for each spot i in this restriction, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between its previous value and x.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, min_x holds the maximum allowed for each spot.\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for the first example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThe min_x for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: min(1, 3, 2) => 1.\n\nSpot 2: min(3) =>3.\n\nSpot3: min(2) =>2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4=14.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2,3.\n\n3 4 7 → affects spots 3,4.\n\nSo min_x for each spot:\n\nspot1: 10 (no restrictions).\n\nspot2: min(8) →8.\n\nspot3: min(8,7)=7.\n\nspot4: min(7) →7.\n\nSo heights are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 100 +64 +49 +49=262.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- Create a list of min_x with size n+1 (since spots start at 1).\n\n- Initialize each min_x[i] to h.\n\n- For each of the m restrictions:\n\n   Read l, r, x.\n\n   For i in l to r:\n\n      if x < min_x[i], then set min_x[i] =x.\n\n- After all restrictions, compute the sum of squares of min_x[1..n].\n\nWait, but wait—is that all? Are all the restrictions correctly handled?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions.\n\nE.g., m=3, all restrictions cover spot 2 with x=3,4,5.\n\nThen min_x[2] is min(3,4,5, h). So if h is 6, min is 3.\n\nAnother case: no restrictions. Then all spots are h, sum is h^2 *n.\n\nAnother case: a spot is covered by a restriction with x=0. So min_x[i]=0.\n\nWhat about when a spot is covered by a restriction with x=0 and another with x=5? Then the min is 0.\n\nSo in code, the initial min_x is h, and for each restriction, it takes the min between current and x.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmin_x = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if min_x[i] > x:\n\n            min_x[i] = x\n\nsum_sq = sum(a*a for a in min_x[1:n+1])\n\nprint(sum_sq)\n\nWait, but wait—what about when the same spot is covered by multiple restrictions? For example, spot 2 is covered by a restriction (2-3, x=3) and another (2-2, x=5). The min_x[2] would be min(3,5) =3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nInput is '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'\n\nSo after processing:\n\nSpot1: min(1) →1.\n\nSpot2: min(3) →3.\n\nSpot3: min(2) →2.\n\nSum is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 2-3,8 → min_x[2]=8, min_x[3]=8.\n\nRestriction2:3-4,7 → min_x[3] becomes min(8,7)=7; min_x[4]=7.\n\nSo min_x[1]=10, 2=8, 3=7,4=7.\n\nSum is 10² +8²+7²+7²=100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=1. Restriction is 1-1, x=3.\n\nSo min_x[1] is min(5,3) =3. Sum is 9.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=10, m=2. Restrictions: 1-2, x=5 and 1-2, x=3.\n\nSo for spot1: min(5,3)=3.\n\nSpot2: same as spot1, 3.\n\nSum is 3² +3²=18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute for each spot the minimum of h and all x's from the restrictions that cover it, then sum their squares.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house can have a height between 0 and a specified maximum, and certain restrictions limit the maximum height within specific ranges of spots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to maximize the profit, which is the sum of squares of the heights of the houses. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must be at most a certain height. The challenge is to ensure all restrictions are satisfied while maximizing the profit.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum value of all relevant restrictions and the global maximum height. This ensures that each spot's height respects all applicable restrictions.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize an array `min_heights` where each element represents the maximum allowed height for the corresponding spot.
