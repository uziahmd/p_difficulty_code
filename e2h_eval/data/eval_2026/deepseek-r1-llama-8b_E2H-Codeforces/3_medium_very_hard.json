Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Maybe it's similar to interval covering problems. But since d is the same for all lanterns, I need to find the minimal d where all the street is covered.\n\nFirst, let me think about the constraints. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern i has a position ai. For a given d, each lantern covers [ai-d, ai+d], clamped to 0 and l. The union of all these must cover [0, l].\n\nSo the minimal d is the smallest value where this condition holds.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAn initial thought is to binary search on d. Because as d increases, the coverage can only increase. So the function that checks if a certain d is sufficient is monotonic. That means binary search is feasible.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Binary search for the minimal d.\n2. For each candidate d, check if the union of all lanterns' coverage covers [0, l].\n3. If it does, try a smaller d. Otherwise, try a larger d.\n\nBut wait, the minimal d could be determined by specific points where the coverage just touches. For example, maybe two lanterns are spaced apart in such a way that their combined coverage without any overlap requires a certain d.\n\nSo, how to implement step 2: checking whether a given d is sufficient.\n\nLet's think about the process. For each lantern, compute the left and right ends of its coverage. Then, we need to see if all the gaps between these intervals are covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to merge all the intervals first and see if the merged coverage includes [0, l]. But merging intervals for each d might be computationally expensive if done naively, especially since n can be up to 1000 and l up to 1e9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to sort the lanterns and then compute the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, considering their coverage. Wait, but since d is fixed, the coverage isn't fixed—each lantern's coverage depends on d.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to proceed with the binary search approach.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the array of ai's. Because the lanterns are sorted, it's easier to handle the coverage.\n\nOnce sorted, for each adjacent pair of lanterns, the distance between them is important. But because each lantern's coverage is 2d, the gap between two consecutive lanterns' coverage must not exceed 2d. Hmm, maybe not exactly, because each lantern covers d on both sides, but the lanterns themselves may be close enough that their coverage overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical points are the start and end of the street, and the edges of each lantern's coverage.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the problem as follows:\n\nThe entire street must be covered. So for the sorted lanterns, the leftmost point is 0, the rightmost is l. Each lantern contributes a coverage interval. To ensure that all points are covered, the union of these intervals must include [0, l].\n\nSo, for a given d, the coverage of each lantern is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)]. We need to make sure that the union of all these intervals covers 0 to l.\n\nHow to check this efficiently.\n\nAn efficient way would be to merge the intervals and see if the merged intervals span from 0 to l.\n\nBut merging for each d in binary search could be O(n log n) each time. Since binary search will take about 60 iterations (for d up to 1e9), the total time would be acceptable (n is up to 1000, 60*1000 is manageable).\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nImplement binary search on d:\n\n- low = 0 (since d must be positive)\n- high = (l / 2) (because a single lantern at l/2 can cover up to l with d = l/2)\n\nWait, no. For example, if the street is length l, the maximum needed d is when the lantern is at one end. Like, if a lantern is at 0, then d needs to be at least l to cover the entire street. So high should be l.\n\nWait, but when you have multiple lanterns, the required d could be less than l.\n\nBut for the binary search, setting high to l is safe.\n\nSo, the steps for each iteration of binary search:\n\n1. Compute mid = (low + high)/2.\n2. For each lantern, compute the coverage interval [left_i, right_i].\n3. Collect all these intervals.\n4. Merge them into a list of non-overlapping, sorted intervals.\n5. Check if the merged list starts at 0 and ends at l. If yes, set high = mid. Else, set low = mid + epsilon.\n\nWait, but how to merge the intervals efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to merge intervals:\n\n- Sort all intervals by their left endpoint.\n- Initialize a result list with the first interval.\n- For each subsequent interval, compare its left endpoint with the end of the last interval in the result. If it's within or equal to the last's right, merge them into a new interval. Else, add as a new interval.\n\nAfter merging, check if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each mid, we can generate the coverage intervals, sort them, merge, and check coverage.\n\nBut wait, for each mid, generating the intervals can be done quickly.\n\nNow, what about the initial setup.\n\nWe need to sort the lantern positions.\n\nSo, first, read the input, parse the lantern positions, sort them.\n\nThen, perform binary search on d.\n\nWait, but binary search might require a lot of iterations. For each iteration, we have to process all n intervals.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of iterations? Let's say we have high=1e9. Log2(1e9) is about 30, which is manageable.\n\nEach iteration is O(n log n) because of sorting. But wait, no—because for each d, the intervals are generated, then sorted. So for each mid, generating the intervals is O(n), then sorting is O(n log n). So for 30 iterations, it's 30 * O(n log n) operations. For n=1e3, that's 3e4 operations per iteration, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers, which are the ai's.\n\nSort this list.\n\nCompute the initial low and high for binary search.\n\nWait, but sometimes, even with low=0, high=l, the solution may be somewhere in between.\n\nNow, in the binary search:\n\nWhile high - low > 1e-9 (some small epsilon to prevent infinite loops):\n\n   mid = (low + high) / 2\n\n   compute all the coverage intervals for this mid.\n\n   merge them.\n\n   if the merged intervals cover [0, l], then set high = mid.\n\n   else, set low = mid.\n\nOnce the loop ends, return mid as the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. How precise do we need to be? The output requires that the absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So, using floating-point numbers with sufficient precision is necessary.\n\nSo, the binary search should continue until the difference between high and low is less than 1e-11, perhaps, to allow for accurate results.\n\nBut in practice, setting the loop to run for a fixed number of iterations (like 100) may be sufficient, as each iteration reduces the possible error by a factor of two.\n\nSo, perhaps, to avoid issues with floating-point precision, we can set the number of iterations to a fixed number, like 100, which would give us a precision of about 1e-30, which is more than enough.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the list of a_i, convert to integers.\n\nSort a_i.\n\nSet low = 0.0, high = l.\n\nFor _ in range(100):\n\n   mid = (low + high) / 2\n\n   # compute intervals\n\n   intervals = []\n\n   for ai in a_i:\n\n       left = max(0, ai - mid)\n\n       right = min(l, ai + mid)\n\n       intervals.append( (left, right) )\n\n   # sort intervals by left\n\n   intervals.sort()\n\n   # merge\n\n   merged = []\n\n   for interval in intervals:\n\n       if not merged:\n\n           merged.append( interval )\n\n       else:\n\n           last_left, last_right = merged[-1]\n\n           current_left, current_right = interval\n\n           if current_left <= last_right:\n\n               # overlapping or adjacent; merge\n\n               new_left = last_left\n\n               new_right = max(last_right, current_right)\n\n               merged[-1] = (new_left, new_right)\n\n           else:\n\n               merged.append( (current_left, current_right) )\n\n   # check coverage\n\n   if merged[0][0] == 0 and merged[-1][1] == l:\n\n       high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid\n\nPrint high with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but in some cases, after the binary search, high is the minimal d.\n\nWait, but the binary search needs to find the minimal d where the merged intervals cover [0, l]. So, in the binary search, if the current mid allows full coverage, we can try a smaller d by setting high = mid. Otherwise, we need to increase d, so set low = mid.\n\nWait, no. Because if mid is sufficient, maybe a smaller d is also sufficient. So, in the binary search, when mid is sufficient, we set high to mid, and try lower. Otherwise, we set low to mid, and try higher.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing mid, if the merged intervals cover 0 to l, set high = mid, else set low = mid.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, the a_i's are [2,5].\n\nFor d=2:\n\nLantern 1: 2-2=0, 2+2=4 → [0,4]\n\nLantern 2: 5-2=3, 5+2=7 → [3,5] (clamped to 5)\n\nMerged intervals: [0,5], which covers 0-5. So, d=2 is sufficient.\n\nBut is there a smaller d?\n\nSuppose d=1.9:\n\nLantern 1: 0.1 to 3.9.\n\nLantern 2: 3.1 to 6.9 → clamped to 5.\n\nMerged: [0.1,5], which doesn't cover 0. So, the coverage isn't complete. So, d=1.9 is insufficient.\n\nHence, the minimal d is 2.\n\nIn the binary search:\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5.\n\nmid = 2.5.\n\nCheck coverage.\n\nAt d=2.5, each lantern covers:\n\nLantern 1: 2-2.5 = -0.5 → 0; 2+2.5=4.5.\n\nLantern 2:5-2.5=2.5 → 5+2.5=7.5 → 5.\n\nMerged intervals are [0,4.5], [2.5,5]. Merging gives [0,5], which covers the street. So, set high=2.5.\n\nNext, mid=(0+2.5)/2=1.25.\n\nCheck if d=1.25 is sufficient.\n\nLantern 1: 2-1.25=0.75, 2+1.25=3.25 → [0.75,3.25]\n\nLantern 2:5-1.25=3.75, 5+1.25=6.25 → [3.75,5]\n\nMerged intervals: [0.75,3.25] and [3.75,5]. There's a gap between 3.25 and 3.75. So coverage is incomplete. Thus, d=1.25 is insufficient. So, set low=1.25.\n\nNext mid is (1.25+2.5)/2=1.875.\n\nCheck d=1.875.\n\nLantern 1: 2-1.875=0.125, 2+1.875=3.875 → [0.125,3.875]\n\nLantern 2:5-1.875=3.125, 5+1.875=6.875 → [3.125,5]\n\nMerged: [0.125,3.875] and [3.125,5]. Merging becomes [0.125,5], which covers the street. So, set high=1.875.\n\nNext mid is (1.25+1.875)/2=1.5625.\n\nCheck d=1.5625.\n\nLantern 1: 0.4375 to 3.5625.\n\nLantern 2:5-1.5625=3.4375, 5+1.5625=6.5625 → [3.4375,5]\n\nMerged: [0.4375,3.5625] and [3.4375,5]. The first interval ends at 3.56, the second starts at 3.43. So they don't overlap. So the merged intervals are [0.4375,3.5625], [3.4375,5]. Thus, there's a gap between 3.56 and 3.43? No, wait, 3.5625 is greater than 3.4375? No, 3.5625 is larger, so the intervals do not overlap. So the merged list will have both intervals, but the street is not fully covered.\n\nThus, d=1.5625 is insufficient. So set low=1.5625.\n\nMid becomes (1.5625 + 1.875)/2 = 1.71875.\n\nCheck d=1.71875.\n\nLantern 1: 2-1.71875=0.28125, 2+1.71875=3.71875 → [0.28125,3.71875]\n\nLantern 2:5-1.71875=3.28125, 5+1.71875=6.71875 → [3.28125,5]\n\nMerged intervals: [0.28125,3.71875], [3.28125,5]. Since 3.71875 >=3.28125, they overlap. So merged into [0.28125,5]. Which covers the entire street. So, set high=1.71875.\n\nContinue this until the binary search converges.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when all lanterns are at 0. Then, for d, it's l. Because each lantern's coverage is 0 to d. The union is 0 to d. So, to cover l, d must be l.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. The lantern must cover 0 to l. So, d must be l. Because its coverage is max(0, a1 -d) to min(l, a1 +d). So, for a1=0, d must be l. For a1=l, same.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a1=0, a2=l. Then, the minimal d is such that (0 +d) >= l -d → 2d >= l → d >= l/2.\n\nSo, the code should return l/2.\n\nSo, in this case, the binary search would find the minimal d where (0 +d) >= (l -d) → 2d >= l → d >= l/2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about when a_i's are not sorted? Well, in the code, after reading, we sort the a_i's.\n\nSo, the code handles that correctly.\n\nNow, the implementation in Python.\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nThen, read the next line as a list of integers, split by whitespace.\n\nSort the list.\n\nSet low=0.0, high=l.\n\nRun binary search for about 100 iterations.\n\nFor each mid, compute the intervals.\n\nThen, sort the intervals.\n\nMerge them.\n\nCheck if the merged list starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\nIf yes, set high=mid.\n\nElse, set low=mid.\n\nFinally, print high with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the input lines.\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nlow = 0.0\nhigh = l\nfor _ in range(100):\n    mid = (low + high) / 2\n    intervals = []\n    for ai in a:\n        left = max(0, ai - mid)\n        right = min(l, ai + mid)\n        intervals.append( (left, right) )\n    # sort intervals\n    intervals.sort()\n    # merge\n    merged = []\n    for interval in intervals:\n        if not merged:\n            merged.append( list(interval) )\n        else:\n            last_left, last_right = merged[-1]\n            curr_left, curr_right = interval\n            if curr_left <= last_right:\n                # merge\n                new_left = last_left\n                new_right = max(last_right, curr_right)\n                merged[-1][0] = new_left\n                merged[-1][1] = new_right\n            else:\n                merged.append( [curr_left, curr_right] )\n    # check coverage\n    if len(merged) == 0:\n        # no intervals, which is impossible since n >=1\n        # but in our problem, n can be 1\n        pass\n    else:\n        if merged[0][0] != 0:\n            # coverage doesn't start at 0\n            low = mid\n        elif merged[-1][1] != l:\n            # coverage doesn't end at l\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            # full coverage\n            high = mid\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(high))\n\nWait, but wait—what about when merged has only one interval? Like when n=1.\n\nIn that case, the code correctly checks if that interval starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: when a_i is at 0, and mid is such that ai - mid is negative, so left is 0.\n\nSimilarly for a_i at l.\n\nSo, the code handles that correctly.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo, a_i's are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFor mid=2.5.\n\nEach lantern's coverage:\n\n0: 0-2.5= -2.5 → 0; 0+2.5=2.5 → [0,2.5]\n\n3: 0.5 to 5.5\n\n5: 2.5 to 7.5\n\n7:4.5 to 9.5\n\n9:6.5 to 11.5\n\n14:11.5 to 16.5 → [11.5,15]\n\n15:12.5 to 17.5 → [12.5,15]\n\nSo the intervals are:\n\n[0,2.5], [0.5,5.5], [2.5,7.5], [4.5,9.5], [6.5,11.5], [11.5,15], [12.5,15]\n\nSorting them by left:\n\n0,0.5,2.5,4.5,6.5,11.5,12.5\n\nThen, merging:\n\nStart with [0,2.5]\n\nNext is [0.5,5.5]: overlaps with [0,2.5], so merge into [0,5.5]\n\nNext [2.5,7.5]: starts at 2.5 which is within 5.5 → merged into [0,7.5]\n\nNext [4.5,9.5]: within → merged into [0,9.5]\n\nNext [6.5,11.5]: within → merged into [0,11.5]\n\nNext [11.5,15]: starts at 11.5, which is ≤11.5 → merged into [0,15]\n\nNext [12.5,15]: within → merged remains [0,15]\n\nSo merged is [0,15], which covers the street. So, mid=2.5 is sufficient. So, high is set to 2.5.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output is 2.5. So, the code returns 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code correctly finds d=2.\n\nSo, I think this approach should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Precision: since the binary search runs for 100 iterations, the error is (initial high - low) / 2^100, which is negligible for 1e-9 precision.\n\n- Handling very large l, but since the code uses floating points, it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the initial high and low. High is set to l, which is correct because for n=1, the required d is l.\n\nWait, for n=1, a_i can be anywhere. For example, a_i=0: then, to cover up to l, the d must be l. Similarly, a_i=l: same.\n\nBut in code, for n=1, the merged intervals will be [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)].\n\nSo, for a_i=0 and d=l: [0, l], which covers the street.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lanterns are at the same position.\n\nLike, n=3, a=[5,5,5], l=10.\n\nThen, the minimal d is 5, since the coverage is [0,10]. Wait, no. Wait, for d=5, each lantern's coverage is 0 to 10. So, yes.\n\nBut if l=10, then d=5 is sufficient. But if l=9, then d=4.5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code would correctly compute d as needed.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code accordingly.\n",

These intervals are then merged to check if they cover the entire street.\n3. **Merging Intervals**: After computing the coverage intervals for a given \\( d \\), we sort and merge these intervals to determine if they collectively cover the street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nlow = 0.0\nhigh = l\n\nfor _ in range(100):\n    mid = (low + high) / 2\n    intervals = []\n    for ai in a:\n        left = max(0, ai - mid)\n        right = min(l, ai + mid)\n        intervals.append((left, right))\n    \n    # Sort intervals by their left endpoint\n    intervals.sort()\n    \n    # Merge intervals\n    merged = []\n    for interval in intervals:\n        if not merged:\n            merged.append(list(interval))\n        else:\n            last_left, last_right = merged[-1]\n            curr_left, curr_right = interval\n            if curr_left <= last_right:\n                # Merge the intervals\n                new_left = last_left\n                new_right = max(last_right, curr_right)\n                merged[-1][0] = new_left\n                merged[-1][1] = new_right\n            else:\n                merged.append(list(interval))\n    \n    # Check if the merged intervals cover [0, l]\n    if len(merged) == 0:\n        low = mid\n    else:\n        if merged[0][0] != 0 or merged[-1][1] != l:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n\n# Print with 10 decimal places\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(high))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Lanterns**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate efficient interval merging.\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: We initialize the binary search with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to \\( l \\).\n4. **Mid Calculation**: For each iteration, we calculate the midpoint \\( mid \\) of the current search range.\n5. **Interval Coverage**: For each lantern, compute its coverage interval based on \\( mid \\) and collect all intervals.\n6. **Merging Intervals**: The collected intervals are sorted and merged to form a list of non-overlapping intervals.\n7. **Coverage Check**: After merging, we check if the merged intervals cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). If they do, we adjust the search range to look for a smaller \\( d \\); otherwise, we increase the search range.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum \\( d \\) using binary search combined with interval merging, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
