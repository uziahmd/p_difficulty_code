They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup. The tournament is structured in a way similar to a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on the string s given.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tournament has 2^n teams. They play 2^n - 1 games. The structure is such that in each phase i (from 1 to n), there are 2^{n-i} games. For example, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, pairing the teams as 1v2, 3v4, etc. Each game eliminates one team, so after the first phase, half remain.\n\nThe second phase groups winners from the first phase into larger brackets. For instance, in phase 2, each group is the winner of two previous games. So, for phase 2, the winners from phase 1 (which are 2^{n-1} teams) are paired as (winner1 vs winner2), (winner3 vs winner4), etc., leading to 2^{n-2} games and 2^{n-2} winners moving to phase 3.\n\nEach game's outcome depends on the corresponding character in the string s. If s[i] is '0', then in phase i, each match is won by the team with lower skill. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p of skills where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It seems like a binary decision tree where each game's outcome depends on the current structure and the permutation p.\n\nWait, but considering that the permutation can be any arrangement, perhaps we can model the possible sets of teams that can reach each round based on the s string.\n\nI think the key is to represent the tournament's progression in terms of the necessary conditions for a team to win each round, given the rules of that round.\n\nLet me think about the tournament phases. Each phase i (starting from 1 to n) reduces the number of teams by half. The structure is such that in phase 1, it's a first-round pairing. In phase 2, it's grouping the winners of phase 1 into pairs again, and so on until phase n, which has just one game determining the champion.\n\nFor each phase i, the way the teams are grouped is determined by the initial pairings. Wait, no. The initial pairing is fixed: 1v2, 3v4, etc. Then, the next phase groups the winners of these matches into new pairs. So, the group structure for phase i is based on the initial positions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match, and each level corresponds to a phase.\n\nIn this case, each team's path through the tournament is determined by its position in the initial bracket. For example, for n=3, the initial bracket has 8 teams. The first phase (phase 1) has 4 matches: 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8. The winners of these become the leaves of the next phase's bracket. Phase 2 has 2 matches: (w1 vs w2), (w3 vs w4), etc. The winners proceed to phase 3, which is a single match.\n\nSo, for a team to be the champion, it must win all its matches along its path in this binary tree.\n\nBut since the outcome of each match depends on the phase's rule (s[i]), the path a team can take depends on the permutation of skills.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the tournament as a series of layers, each representing a phase. For each phase, I can determine which teams could have won their matches based on the rules and the permutation p.\n\nWait, but since p is a permutation, the skills are assigned to the teams in some order. So, for each phase, the outcome of each match depends on the relative skills of the two teams in that match.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for each phase, the set of possible winners can be determined based on the rules of that phase and the permutation.\n\nBut how can I model this? Maybe using dynamic programming, tracking for each possible subset of teams that can reach a certain stage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution involves considering the tournament structure as a binary heap-like structure, determining for each team the path they would take to the root, and then figuring out the constraints on their skills based on the s string.\n\nWait, here's an idea: each team has a unique path through the tournament, defined by the binary representation of its position. For example, for n=3, the 8 teams are arranged in a bracket where the binary representations (from ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup where each game's outcome is determined by a given string. The tournament structure is a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on whether the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams, and the root is the final match determining the champion.\n2. **Phases and Rules**: Each phase of the tournament reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Binary Representation**: Each team's position can be represented in binary, which helps in determining their path through the tournament bracket.\n4. **Winning Conditions**: For a team to be the champion, it must win all matches along its path in the binary tree. We need to check if there exists a permutation of skills such that the team can win each match based on the given rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Generate all possible masks for each phase\n    def generate_masks(n):\n        masks = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            mask_size = 2**i\n            for b in range(0, 2**(n - i)):\n                mask = [b & (1 << j) != 0 for j in range(i)]\n                masks.append(mask)\n        return masks\n    \n    # Precompute for each level the required comparisons\n    levels = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        level = []\n        size = 2**i\n        for group in range(size // 2):\n            left = group * 2\n            right = left + 1\n            level.append((left, right))\n        levels.append(level)\n    \n    # Now, for each team, determine the path it takes in the tournament\n    # The path is determined by the binary representation of the team's index\n    # For example, for n=3, team 5 (binary 101) would have the path:\n    # Phase 1: 5 vs 6 (position 4 and 5)\n    # Phase 2: winner vs next pair\n    # Phase 3: final\n    \n    # For each team, compute the required comparison outcomes for each phase\n    # We'll represent each team's possible path as a list of tuples indicating which other team it needs to beat\n    \n    # Precompute the required comparisons for each team to reach the root\n    # Each team's path is a list of phases, and for each phase, which 'group' it belongs to\n    \n    # For each team, compute the required winners in each round\n    # This is a bit tricky because the grouping depends on the binary structure\n    \n    # Alternative approach: For each possible permutation, simulate the tournament and see if any x can be the winner\n    # But with n up to 18, this is impossible directly.\n    \n    # So, perhaps we can model the constraints for each phase\n    \n    # For each phase, determine the necessary conditions for a team to win\n    \n    # Let's think recursively: For a team to be the overall winner, it must win at every phase it participates in\n    \n    # Each phase i has 2^{n-i} games.
