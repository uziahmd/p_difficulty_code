Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or one is a question mark. Oh right, because the question mark is compatible with any color.\n\nSo, the input gives me two strings, l and r, each of length n. Each character in these strings represents a color for a left or right boot respectively. My goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot such that the pair is compatible, and each boot can be used only once. And I need to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, maybe I should think about counting how many possible pairs there are for each specific color combination and then figure out the optimal way to match them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to each right node if they are compatible. Then the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching in this graph. But wait, n can be up to 150,000, which makes building such a graph impossible because the number of edges would be O(n^2), which is way too big.\n\nSo that's not feasible. I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible types of pairs:\n\n1. Both are question marks: Any left ? can pair with any right ?.\n2. Left is a specific color, right is the same specific color.\n3. Left is a specific color, right is a question mark.\n4. Right is a specific color, left is a question mark.\n\nWait, but I think the question mark can cover all cases except when both are specific and different.\n\nSo perhaps I can count the number of question marks on both sides and use them optimally.\n\nMaybe the strategy is:\n\n- First, pair as many same-specific-color pairs as possible. For example, count how many 'a's are on the left and right, then take the minimum of those counts for each color.\n\n- Then, use the remaining question marks on each side to fill in the gaps. So, after pairing same colors, any remaining left boots (including those that couldn't find a match) can be paired with the remaining right question marks, and vice versa.\n\n- Also, since the question marks can be used anywhere, perhaps we can calculate the total number of question marks on the left and right, and add the minimum of those to the total pairs.\n\nWait, but how do I structure this without overcounting or double-counting?\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach:\n\nCompute for each color c, the number of left boots with color c, and the number of right boots with color c. The number of pairs for c is the minimum of the two counts.\n\nSum all these c's pairs.\n\nThen, compute the number of question marks on the left (L_q) and right (R_q). The number of possible pairs using question marks is min(L_q, R_q), but wait no—because the question marks can be used in any way, including pairing a specific left with a specific right via the question marks.\n\nWait, no. Once we've used the same-color pairs, the remaining left and right boots can include both specific and question mark boots.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is:\n\nTotal pairs = sum over c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) + (number of question marks on left) * (number of question marks on right) ?\n\nNo, that can't be right because the question marks can also be used to pair with specific colors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read.\n\nThe compatibility is: two specific colors must be the same. A question mark is compatible with any other color, including other question marks.\n\nSo, for each left and right boot, the pair is compatible if:\n\n- l_i is '?', or\n- r_i is '?', or\n- l_i == r_i.\n\nSo, the approach is to find as many pairs as possible, ensuring that each left is paired with exactly one right, and vice versa.\n\nThis sounds like a bipartite graph problem, but again, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms won't work. So I need an efficient way to count and assign the pairs.\n\nAnother idea: Let's precompute for each left boot, which right boots are compatible with it. Then, we can model this as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching. But again, with n=150k, this is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Find a way to count the maximum possible pairs without explicitly building the graph.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of frequencies.\n\nFirst, for each color c, the number of lefts and rights with color c can form some pairs. So for each c, the contribution is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nBut also, for the question marks, any left '?' can pair with any right '?",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair, and compatibility is determined by specific colors or the presence of a question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: For each specific color, count how many times it appears on the left and right sides. The number of pairs for each color is the minimum of these counts.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: Question marks can pair with any other color, including other question marks. We calculate the remaining question marks after pairing specific colors and use them to form additional pairs.\n3. **Calculate Total Pairs**: Sum the pairs from specific colors and the pairs formed by question marks to get the total number of compatible pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Count specific colors on left and right\n    left_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    right_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    left_q = 0\n    right_q = 0\n\n    for c in l:\n        if c == '?':\n            left_q += 1\n        else:\n            left_counts[c] += 1\n\n    for c in r:\n        if c == '?':\n            right_q += 1\n        else:\n            right_counts[c] += 1\n\n    # Calculate same color pairs\n    same_pairs = 0\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if c in right_counts:\n            same_pairs += min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n    # Now, handle the question marks\n    # After using same color pairs, the remaining left and right can be paired via ?\n    # But since each left can only be used once, we need to model this correctly\n    # The maximum possible is the minimum of (left_q + same_left, right_q + same_right)\n    # Wait, no.
