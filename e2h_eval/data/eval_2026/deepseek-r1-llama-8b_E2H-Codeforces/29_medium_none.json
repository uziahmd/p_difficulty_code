Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game. The problem is about substituting digits in a string based on multiple queries and then finding the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe initial string s consists of digits. Then, there are n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of digit di with the string ti. After processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, but wait—what's the order of the queries? Oh right, the queries are applied in the order they are given. So each subsequent query could override or build upon the previous ones.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the first query replaces '2's with '00', then the second replaces '3's with an empty string. So each substitution is applied as per the current state of the string.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model how each substitution affects the string and compute the final number efficiently.\n\nBut the string can be up to 105 characters long, and substitutions can be done for each digit in the string. Processing each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence in the string step by step might be feasible since the maximum n is 105, and each substitution can't take more than O(L) time where L is the length of the string after substitutions. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the string as a state that transforms with each substitution. Each substitution can be thought of as a function that modifies the current mapping of digits to their representations.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model each character in the original string and track what it becomes after all substitutions have been applied. Because each substitution is a replacement of a specific digit, and later substitutions can override earlier ones.\n\nWait, but the substitution order matters. For instance, if a substitution changes a digit that was previously replaced, it needs to apply the new substitution.\n\nSo, for example, if we have two substitutions: first replace 'a' with 'b', then replace 'b' with 'c'. So any 'a' becomes 'b', then any 'b' in the result becomes 'c'.\n\nSo, the processing order is important.\n\nHmm, but how can we model this for all possible substitutions?\n\nI think the key is to process each substitution in order, and for each substitution, update the current mapping of each digit to its representation.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to model the transformations of each digit in the original string through all the substitution steps.\n\nEach substitution can be represented as a mapping from a digit to a string. But when a substitution occurs, it affects not just the current digit but any other digit that may have been transformed into it in earlier steps.\n\nWait, no. Because substitution is done on the entire string each time. So each substitution affects the current string as it is at that moment.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Because each substitution can change the string in such a way that the next substitution will process the new string.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Instead of modifying the string step by step, perhaps for each substitution, we can create a new mapping of digits, considering the order of the substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to model the substitution process as a series of functions. Each substitution can be seen as a function that maps a digit to a string. When you apply a substitution, it's applied to the current string, which may have been transformed by previous substitutions.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut applying each substitution directly would involve processing each character of the string multiple times, which could be computationally intensive if the string is large. However, since the maximum length of the initial string is 105 and each substitution can add a lot of characters, but the sum of ti lengths is limited (sum of ti is <=105), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, the sum of ti lengths across all queries is up to 105. So even after processing all substitutions, the total length of the string won't exceed 105 + 105*1 (since each substitution can replace a single character with up to 105 characters). Wait, no, because each substitution can potentially add a lot more, but since each substitution replaces a single digit, the maximum possible length after all substitutions is 105 * 105 = 11025, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but 105 substitutions each adding 100 characters each would give 105*100=10500, which is acceptable for Python to handle.\n\nSo, perhaps the straightforward approach is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Process each query in order. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\n3. After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, and output the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored when converting to the number. So, for example, if the string becomes \"000123\", the numeric value is 123.\n\nBut during the substitution process, the leading zeros may be present, but when converting to the number, we ignore them. So, the actual numeric value depends only on the non-zero digits and the digits after the first non-zero.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Apply all substitutions to the initial string, building the transformed string.\n\n- Remove leading zeros, unless the string is empty (which counts as zero).\n\n- Compute the numeric value of this string, mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the main task is to process the substitutions correctly.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently in Python?\n\nWell, processing each substitution by iterating through the current string and replacing each occurrence of di with ti is straightforward.\n\nBut for each substitution, for each character in the string, if it matches di, we replace it with ti.\n\nYes, but in Python, strings are immutable, so for each substitution, we'd have to create a new string.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nWe can represent the current string as a list or a variable.\n\nInitially, current_str = s.\n\nFor each query in order:\n\n   di is the first character of the query line.\n\n   ti is the rest of the line (after 'di->').\n\nThen, we replace all occurrences of di in current_str with ti.\n\nWait, but wait: the query is of the form \"d->t\", where d is a single character, and t is a string. So, for each occurrence of d in current_str, we replace it with t.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, if current_str is \"123\", and the query is \"2->00\", then after substitution, current_str becomes \"1003\".\n\nWait no: because the initial string is \"123\". So the '2' is replaced by '00', making it \"1003\"? No, wait: initial string is 123, so after substitution of 2->00, the '2' becomes '00', so the new string is '1003'? Or wait, wait, the substitution replaces '2's. So in '123', the '2' is replaced by '00', so the new string is '1003'? Yes.\n\nBut then, in the next substitution, say, '3->', which replaces all '3's with nothing. So the '3' in '1003' becomes empty, so the string becomes '1003' → wait, no. Wait, '1003' has a '3' at the end. Replacing that with empty string would make it '100'.\n\nWait, no: the '3's are replaced with empty, so in '1003', the '3' is the last character. So after substitution, it becomes '100'.\n\nSo, the process is correct.\n\nSo, in code, for each query, we can do:\n\ndi = query[0]\n\nti = query[2:]\n\ncurrent_str = current_str.replace(di, ti)\n\nWait, but in Python, the replace method replaces all occurrences, so that's exactly what we need.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_str = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    query = input().strip()\n\n    # Split into di and ti\n\n    parts = query.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n\n    current_str = current_str.replace(di, ti)\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, we need to compute the numeric value of current_str, ignoring leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is empty after substitutions? Then it's considered as zero.\n\nSo, the steps after processing all substitutions:\n\n1. If current_str is empty: the number is 0.\n\n2. Else: remove leading zeros, then compute the number.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nIn code:\n\nif not current_str:\n\n    num = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    # Remove leading zeros\n\n    stripped = current_str.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not stripped:\n\n        num = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        num = int(stripped)\n\nThen, compute num % MOD, where MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but for very long strings, converting to integer could be slow. So, for the purposes of handling large numbers, perhaps we can compute the modulo on the fly.\n\nBecause for a string of length up to say 10^5, converting it to an integer might cause memory issues, but in Python, it's manageable. Wait, but 10^5 digits is a very big number, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible length after substitutions is 105 * 105 = 11025, which is about 11k digits. Converting that to an integer is feasible in Python, but perhaps it's more efficient to compute the modulo as we parse the string.\n\nYes, because if the string is 1e4 digits long, converting to an integer might take some time, but for the constraints here, it's acceptable. But perhaps computing the modulo incrementally is better.\n\nSo, for the string, we can compute the value mod MOD by processing each character one by one, multiplying by 10 and adding the digit's value, modulo MOD.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nCompute the modulo of the resulting number as follows:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor c in current_str:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    result = (result *10 + digit) % mod\n\nSo, for example, '10031003' is processed as:\n\nstart with 0.\n\nProcess '1': 0*10 +1=1.\n\nProcess '0': 1*10+0=10.\n\nProcess '0': 10*10+0=100.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis way, we avoid dealing with very large integers, which is especially useful if the string is very long.\n\nSo, the code for computing the result is:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor c in current_str:\n\n    result = (result *10 + int(c)) % mod\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if the current_str is empty? Then the result is 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead the initial string s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each query, and apply the substitution in order.\n\nThen, compute the modulo as described.\n\nBut what about cases where the substitution creates leading zeros?\n\nLike in the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n222\\n2->0\\n0->7\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial s is '222'.\n\nFirst query: 2->0. So replace all '2's with '0's. Now s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: 0->7. So replace all '0's with '7's. Now s becomes '777'.\n\nSo the resulting string is '777', which is 777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the string becomes empty.\n\nLike initial string is '0', and substitution is '0->'. Then the string becomes empty, which is considered 0.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_str = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    di_part, ti_part = line.split('->')\n\n    ti = ti_part if ti_part else ''\n\n    current_str = current_str.replace(di_part, ti)\n\n# Now compute the mod.\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor c in current_str:\n\n    result = (result *10 + int(c)) % mod\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input provided in the problem statement, the output is a list of strings, but the actual problem says to print a single integer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, no, actually, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is s, the second is n, then n lines of queries.\n\nThe sample input shows four lines, but perhaps that's a typo. Wait, no, the sample input is written as:\n\nThe following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n...\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps it's a formatting issue, but the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is s.\n\nSecond line is n.\n\nThen n lines of queries.\n\nSo, the sample input is:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\n3->\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nWhich is four lines after the initial s and n.\n\nWait, no, n is 4? Or wait, the sample input is unclear, but perhaps the sample input is four queries.\n\nBut in any case, the code should process each query correctly.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']—each line is a transformation step.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not the case. The problem statement says that the output is a single integer—the remainder after division.\n\nSo, the sample's output is 1, which comes from the fourth substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the sample explanation:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a formatting issue, and the actual input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nqueries: '2->00'\n\nAfter substitution, s becomes '10031003' → output is 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but according to the sample note, the outputs are four steps, but the actual output is a single integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a mistake, but the actual problem expects to output the final result.\n\nSo, the code should process all queries and output the final number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the code as outlined should handle that.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nTest case 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\nAfter substitution, s becomes '10031003'.\n\nComputing 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut 1e9+7 is 1000000007.\n\n10031003 / 1e9+7 is approximately 10 times. 10*(1e9+7) = 1000000070, which is larger than 10031003.\n\nSo 10031003 - 10*(1e9+7) is negative, but wait:\n\nWait 1e9+7 is 1000000007.\n\n10031003 is less than 1e9+7, so mod is 10031003.\n\nBut wait, 1e9+7 is 1,000,000,007.\n\n10,031,003 is less than that, so yes.\n\nSo the output is 10031003.\n\nBut wait, in the sample note, the outputs are given as four steps, but the actual output is one integer.\n\nSo the code as written should handle that.\n\nAnother sample: the third input in the problem.\n\ns = '222'\n\nn = 2\n\nQueries:\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo after first substitution, s becomes '000'.\n\nAfter second substitution, s becomes '777'.\n\n777 mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nSo the code correctly outputs 777.\n\nAnother test case: s is '0', n=1, query '0->'.\n\nAfter substitution, s is empty string. So the result is 0.\n\nAnother test case: s is '1000000008', n=0. So no substitutions. So the string is '1000000008', which is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nSo code should output 1.\n\nSo, the code as written seems to handle all these cases.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- s is empty. But according to the problem statement, the initial s is at least length 1.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 1<=|s| <=105, so initial s is non-empty.\n\nBut after substitutions, s could become empty, which is treated as 0.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution replaces a digit with an empty string, causing the string to lose some digits.\n\nE.g., s='12', substitution '1'->'', so s becomes '2'.\n\nAnother case: substitution for a digit that doesn't appear in the string, which leaves the string unchanged.\n\nAnother thing: when ti is empty, the substitution effectively removes all occurrences of di from the string.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nWhat about when di is a multi-digit string? But according to the problem statement, each query's di is exactly one digit. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all the cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nProcess each query.\n\nCompute the mod.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\ncurrent_str = s\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    # Split into di and ti\n    parts = line.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    current_str = current_str.replace(di, ti)\nMOD = 10**9 +7\nresult = 0\nfor c in current_str:\n    result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\nprint(result)\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nProcessing:\n\nAfter first substitution, current_str is '000'.\n\nSecond substitution: replace '0' with '7' → '777'.\n\nModulo computation gives 777.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: s is '123123', substitution 2->00, so becomes 10031003.\n\nMod is 10031003.\n\nAnother test case: s is '1000000008' with no substitutions. The modulo is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 = 1.\n\nAll seems correct.\n",
