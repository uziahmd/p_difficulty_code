При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a possible error in message transmission between servers. When two identical messages are sent one after another, there might be an error where they merge into one. The way they merge is by overlapping as much as possible. So, the end of the first message is connected with the start of the second, but only if the characters match at that point.\n\nMy task is, given a string t, determine if it could be the result of such an error. If yes, find any possible original message s that could have caused this.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the error looks like. Suppose we have two identical messages s. When they are sent, they might merge into a new string t. The merging happens at some point k, where the last k characters of the first s match the first k of the second s. Then, t becomes s concatenated with the remaining part of s after k. So, t would be s[0..n-k-1] + s[k..n-1], assuming 0-based indexing.\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Because when two messages s and s are sent, the first is s1, the second is s2. They merge at some k where the last k characters of s1 are equal to the first k of s2. So t is s1 concatenated with s2[k:].\n\nBut since s1 and s2 are the same, s2 is s1, so t becomes s1 + s1[k:].\n\nWait, but s1 and s2 are both the same, so t is formed by overlapping them by k characters. So t is s1 concatenated with s1 starting from position k.\n\nSo for example, if s is \"abc\", and k=1, then t would be \"abcc\" (since the first 'c' overlaps with the second 'a'? Wait, no. Wait, if s is \"abc\", then the first message is \"abc\", the second is also \"abc\". When they merge, the overlapping is where the end of the first matches the start of the second. So the maximum possible k is the length of s minus 1? Or perhaps up to len(s)-1.\n\nWait, in the example given in the problem statement: the message \"abrakadabra\" is sent twice. It's possible that during transmission, these two messages are merged. The resulting message could be something like \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" which suggests that the overlap was just one character. Or it could be \"abrakadabrakadabra\" which suggests an overlap of four characters.\n\nSo the process is: when two identical messages s are sent, the receiver may see a message t that is formed by s followed by s[k:], where k is the number of overlapping characters (from the end of the first s to the start of the second s). So t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. But wait, that's not quite right. Because the two s's are being sent, but in the case of an error, the receiver gets a single t which is the concatenation of the two s's, but overlapping as much as possible.\n\nSo the condition is that t must be equal to s + s', where s' is a suffix of s. Because s' is the part of s that didn't overlap.\n\nBut since the two messages are the same, s' must be a suffix of s.\n\nSo t = s + s', where s' is a suffix of s. The length of s' is l, which can be from 1 to len(s)-1. So t must be s concatenated with a suffix of s, of length l >=1 and l <= len(s)-1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the error occurs when two messages are sent in succession. So the correct scenario is that the first message is s, the second is s. But due to the error, they merge into t = s + s[k:], where k is the length of the overlap. So t must be equal to s concatenated with a substring of s that starts at position k.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible k (from 1 to len(s)-1), check if t ends with a substring that is the same as the beginning of s, with length k. Then, the rest of t after that point should be a suffix of s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is: t must be equal to s followed by a suffix of s. So to find s, we can look for possible s lengths m such that m is less than len(t), and t can be split into two parts, the first part being s, and the second part being a suffix of s.\n\nWait, no. Because s is the original message, and t is the result of two s messages being merged. So t is formed by taking s, then adding a suffix of s. So t is s concatenated with s', where s' is a suffix of s, and the length of s' is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nSo for example, if s is \"abcd\", then t could be \"abcdabcd\" (if the overlap is zero, but according to the note, overlap of zero is not considered an error because the messages don't actually merge; they are just sent as separate messages). So in our problem, the error occurs when the overlap is at least 1 character.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that an error occurs when two identical messages are sent and they merge. So in the normal case, without an error, the two messages would be sent as s followed by s, resulting in t of length 2*len(s). But with the error, the overlapping occurs, so t's length is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k. Since k is at least 1, t is shorter than 2*len(s).\n\nSo to model this, for a given t, we need to find a possible s such that t is s concatenated with a suffix of s. Also, the length of t must be len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k. But since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, the length of t is between len(s)+1 and 2*len(s)-1.\n\nWait, but len(t) could vary depending on k. For example, if s is \"a\", then k can be 1, but that would require that the first message's end and the second's start match for 1 character. So t would be \"aa\", which is s (length 1) plus s[1:], which is nothing. Wait, no. Because len(s) is 1, so s[1:] is empty. So t would be \"a\" + \"\" = \"a\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's say s is \"a\". When you send two \"a\"s, if there's an error, they merge. The maximum possible overlap is 1 character (since len(s) is 1). So the merged message would be \"a\" followed by the rest of s after 1 character. But s after 1 character is empty. So t would be \"a\" + \"\" = \"a\". But that's the same as the original, so in this case, the problem says that the situation where two messages are completely overlapped (like \"abcd\" becoming \"abcd\") is not considered an error. So for s of length 1, the error can't happen because the two messages are the same, and their merger would just result in the same message.\n\nWait, no. The note says that if the received message is \"abcd\", it's not considered an error. So, for t to be considered as possibly having an error, it must have been formed by merging two identical messages, which implies that the resulting t is longer than the original s. Because otherwise, if the two messages are identical and completely overlap, the resulting t is s, which is not considered an error.\n\nWait, but how? Because if s is \"a\", sending two \"a\"s would result in t being \"a\", which is the same as the original. But according to the problem statement, this is not considered an error. So for t to be a result of an error, it must have been formed by two messages that partially overlapped.\n\nSo for s to be a possible original message, t must be equal to s concatenated with a proper suffix of s (i.e., a suffix that is not the entire string). So the length of t must be longer than len(s), but less than 2*len(s).\n\nWait, no. Because for example, s could be \"ab\", and the overlap is 1 character. So t would be \"abab\" — which is longer than s. So the condition is that len(t) is equal to len(s) + (len(s) -k), where k is between 1 and len(s)-1. So len(t) must be less than 2*len(s) but more than len(s).\n\nWait, no: len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k. Since k is at least 1, 2*len(s) -k is at most 2*len(s)-1. And len(t) must be greater than len(s) because s' is non-empty.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ns = \"ab\", len(s) = 2.\n\nIf k=1: t = \"ab\" + \"b\" → \"abb\", len(t)=3.\n\nIf k=2: but len(s)-k = 0, so s' is empty. So t would be \"ab\", which is the same as s, which is not considered an error.\n\nSo for t to be a result of an error, len(t) must be between len(s)+1 and 2*len(s)-1.\n\nSo, given t, to find possible s, we can try all possible possible lengths m of s, where m is (len(t)+1)/2 - something. Wait, perhaps m must satisfy that 2*m -k = len(t), where 1<=k <m.\n\nSo len(t) = m + (m -k) → len(t) = 2m -k. Since k is at least 1, len(t) <= 2m-1.\n\nAlso, since k can be up to m-1, len(t) can be as low as m+1 (when k=m-1, len(t)=m + (m - (m-1)) )= m+1.\n\nSo len(t) must be between m+1 and 2m-1, inclusive.\n\nWe can rearrange this: m must be such that (len(t)+1)/2 <= m <= len(t)-1.\n\nBecause for len(t) = m + (m -k), and since k>=1, m + (m-1) >= len(t) → 2m-1 >= len(t). Also, since k <=m-1, m + (m -k) <= 2m-1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For a given t, we can iterate over possible m (possible lengths of s) and see if t can be split into s + s'. Where s' is a suffix of s, and the length of s' is l, which is between 1 and m-1.\n\nSo for each possible m, we can check whether the last (m - l) characters of t form s, and the first l characters are the same as a suffix of s.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m, check if the first part of t (of length m) is s, and the remaining part is a suffix of s.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better way. Let me think:\n\nt must be equal to s + s', where s' is a suffix of s, and len(s') = l, 1 <= l <= m-1.\n\nSo t can be written as t = A + B, where A is s, and B is s'. So the length of B is l, and the last l characters of A must be equal to B.\n\nWait, no. Because s' is a suffix of s, so the first l characters of B must match the last l characters of A.\n\nWait, maybe that's the key. So, for a given m, the candidate s is the first m characters of t. Then, the remaining part of t (after m characters) must consist of a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each possible m in the range [ (len(t)+1)//2 , len(t)-1 ), we can do the following:\n\n- Extract s_candidate as t[:m].\n- Check if the remaining part of t (t[m:]) is a suffix of s_candidate.\n- If yes, then s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through possible m values, where m must be such that len(t) >= m + 1 and len(t) <= 2m-1.\n\n   So m must be at least (len(t)+1)//2, because len(t) <= 2m-1 → m >= (len(t)+1)/2.\n\n   Wait, let's calculate:\n\n   len(t) = 2m -k, where 1<=k <=m-1.\n\n   So the maximum possible len(t) is 2m-1 (when k=1).\n\n   The minimum len(t) is m+1 (when k =m-1).\n\n   So for a given m, len(t) must be between m+1 and 2m-1.\n\n   So m must be in the range where m+1 ≤ len(t) ≤ 2m-1.\n\n   Solving for m:\n\n   len(t) ≥ m+1 → m ≤ len(t)-1.\n\n   len(t) ≤ 2m-1 → m ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\n   So m must satisfy ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ) ≤ m ≤ len(t)-1.\n\n   For example, if len(t) is 5:\n\n   (5+1)/2 =3 → m can be 3,4.\n\n   For len(t)=6:\n\n   (6+1)/2=3.5 → m ≥4.\n\n   So m can be 4,5.\n\n   So for each possible m in this range, we check.\n\n2. For each m in the range, extract s_candidate as t[:m].\n\n3. Check if t[m:] is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   How? We can check if t[m:] is equal to the last l characters of s_candidate, where l is the length of t[m:].\n\n   So for example, if t is \"abcdabcd\", then m could be 4, s_candidate is \"abcd\". The remaining part is \"abcd\", which is the same as s_candidate, so it's a valid case, but according to the note, this is not considered an error.\n\n   Wait, no. Because when two messages are s, and they are sent, in case of an error, the receiver will get s concatenated with a suffix of s. So for example, if s is \"abcd\", and the error causes an overlap of 4 characters, then t would be \"abcdabcd\", which is s + s[4:] → s[4:] is empty, so t is s, which is not considered an error.\n\n   So in the problem, t must have been formed by merging two s's, but the overlap is less than the entire length of s. So the remaining part after m must be a non-empty suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   So the length of t[m:] must be between 1 and m-1.\n\n   So in addition to the above steps, we must ensure that len(t[m:]) is between 1 and m-1.\n\n   So, for a given m, len(t) - m must be >=1 and <= m-1.\n\n   So len(t) -m >=1 → m <= len(t)-1.\n\n   Which is already covered.\n\n   And len(t) -m <= m-1 → len(t) <= 2m-1.\n\n   Which is also covered.\n\n   So for each m in the allowed range, check if t[m:] is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   If yes, then s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nOnce any such s_candidate is found, output \"YES\" and the s_candidate.\n\nOtherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor the input string t:\n\nLoop over m from ( (len(t)+1)//2 ) to len(t)-1, inclusive:\n\n   if len(t) - m is between 1 and m-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n      check if t[m:] == s_candidate[-len(t[m:]):]\n\n      if yes:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf no such m satisfies, return NO.\n\nWait, but in code, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, for each possible m, we can:\n\n- Take the first m characters as s_candidate.\n\n- Take the remaining part as tail = t[m:].\n\n- Check if tail is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can compare whether tail is equal to s_candidate[-len(tail): ].\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor m in range( (len(t)+1)//2, len(t) ):\n\n   if (len(t) - m) <1 or (len(t) -m) > m-1:\n\n       continue\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   tail = t[m:]\n\n   if tail == s_candidate[-len(tail): ]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, for example, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nLet's take the first case.\n\nCase 1: t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nCompute len(t) = let's count: abrakadabrabrakadabra.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' has 16 letters.\n\nSo len(t) = 16.\n\nWe need to find m in ( (16+1)//2 )= 8.5 → 9, up to 15.\n\nFor each m from 9 to 15:\n\nCheck if len(t) -m is between 1 and m-1.\n\nFor each m:\n\nm=9: len(t) -m=7.\n\nWhich is between 1 and 8 (since m-1=8). So proceed.\n\ns_candidate = t[:9] = 'abrakadabr'\n\ntail = t[9:] → 'akadabra'.\n\nCheck if 'akadabra' is a suffix of 'abrakadabr'.\n\nThe length of tail is 7.\n\ns_candidate's last 7 characters: 'drakadabr' → no, wait:\n\nWait, 'abrakadabr' is 9 characters. The last 7 would be from index 2 to 8: 'rakadabr' ?\n\nWait, in Python, s[-l:] gives the last l characters.\n\nSo for s_candidate='abrakadabr', len is 9.\n\ntail is 'akadabra', len 7.\n\nCheck if 'akadabra' == s_candidate[-7:] → s_candidate[-7:] is 'rakadabr'.\n\nSo 'akadabra' vs 'rakadabr' → no.\n\nSo m=9 is invalid.\n\nNext, m=10:\n\nlen(t)-m=6.\n\nWhich is between 1 and 9.\n\ns_candidate = t[:10] = 'abrakadabr a' → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWait, no: t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nt[:10] is 'abrakadabra'.\n\ntail is t[10:] → 'brakadabra'.\n\nCheck if 'brakadabra' is a suffix of 'abrakadabra'.\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabra', which is 10 letters.\n\nThe last 6 letters of s_candidate are 'dabra'.\n\nBut 'brakadabra' is 8 letters? Wait, no: len(tail) is 6.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t)=16.\n\nm=10: s_candidate is t[:10] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\ntail is t[10:] → 'brakadabra' → len(tail)=6.\n\nCheck if 'brakadabra' is the last 6 characters of s_candidate.\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabra' → last 6 letters are 'rabra'.\n\nWait, no: 'abrakadabra' is 10 letters:\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0:a,1:b,2:r,3:a,4:k,5:a,6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,a.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 'abrakadabra' → let me write it out.\n\nWait, 'a','b','r','a','k','a','d','a','b','r' → 10 letters.\n\nSo last 6 letters are indices 4 to 9: 'a','d','a','b','r' ? Wait, no: 6 letters would be positions 4,5,6,7,8,9 → letters 'a','d','a','b','r'? Wait, no, the indexes are 0-based. So the last 6 letters are s_candidate[4:10], which is 'akadabr'.\n\nWait, no: s_candidate[4] is 'k', then 'a','d','a','b','r'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, 'abrakadabra' is spelled as a-b-r-a-k-a-d-a-b-r-a → wait, no, wait, 'abrakadabra' is a famous palindrome. Let me count:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a → that's 11 letters. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → perhaps it's 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → that's 16 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of code.\n\nBut regardless, in the sample, the correct s is 'abrakadabra' (length 10), and the tail is 'brakadabra' (length 6). So we need to check if 'brakadabra' is a suffix of 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 10 letters. Its last 6 letters are 'dabra'? Or 'rabra'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it down.\n\n'abrakadabra' → a b r a k a d a b r a → 11 letters. Oh wait, no, that's 11 letters. So perhaps in the sample, the t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is 16 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think of another approach.\n\nIn code, for each m, extract s_candidate as t[:m], then extract the tail as t[m:]. Then check if the tail equals the last len(tail) characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo in the sample where m=10, s_candidate is t[:10], which is 'abrakadabra' (assuming t is '...'). The tail is 'brakadabra'.\n\nThe last 6 characters of s_candidate would be 'akadabr'? Or perhaps 'akadabra' is 10 letters, so the last 6 letters are 'dabra'? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the code would correctly identify that 'brakadabra' is not a suffix of 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the correct output is 'YES' with s_candidate 'abrakadabra' and tail 'brakadabra'. So perhaps in that case, the tail is 'brakadabra', which is 10 letters, but wait no: len(t) is 16, m=10, so tail is 6 letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t) is 16.\n\nm ranges from (16+1)//2=8.5 → 9 to 15.\n\nFor m=10:\n\ns_candidate is t[:10] → which is 'abrakadab'.\n\ntail is t[10:16] → 'rabrakadabra'.\n\nWait, len(tail) is 6.\n\nCheck if 'rabrakadabra' is a suffix of 'abrakadab'.\n\n'abrakadab' is 10 letters.

Because the problem states that the two messages are identical, so the only way they can merge is if the end of the first matches the start of the second.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the sample expects 'acacaca' as a possible s, but according to the code, it's not found.\n\nSo perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating m's range.\n\nWait, for len(t)=8, the possible m's are from (8+1)//2=4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nWait, but 7 is len(t)-1=7.\n\nSo for m=5,6,7.\n\nFor m=5: l=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\ntail is 'caca'.\n\nCheck if 'caca' is the last 3 letters of 'acaca'.\n\n'acaca' is a c a c a.\n\nSo last 3 letters are 'a c a' → 'aca'.\n\nSo 'caca' is not equal.\n\nm=6: l=2.\n\ns_candidate is 'acacac'.\n\ntail is 'ca'.\n\nCheck if 'ca' is the last 2 letters of 'acacac' → 'c'.\n\nNo.\n\nm=7: l=1.\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca'.\n\ntail is 'ca'.\n\nCheck if 'ca' is the last 1 letter of 'acacaca' → 'a'.\n\nNo.\n\nSo none of the m's work, but the sample expects 'acaca' as a possible s.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect because it's not considering that s could be of length m, but the tail is a suffix of s of length l, which may be less than m.\n\nWait, but in the code, we are checking exactly that: the tail is compared to the last l characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct, but in the sample, the expected s is 'acaca' but the code doesn't find it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the sample, the s is 'acaca', and the tail is 'caca', but the code isn't finding it because the code is only considering certain m's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the code's loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is supposed to loop m from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1, but perhaps the upper limit is len(t)-1, but in Python, the range is exclusive.\n\nSo for len(t)=8, the upper limit is 7, but in the code, the loop is for m in range(5, 8), which includes 5,6,7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo why is the sample expecting 'acaca' as a possible s?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way t is formed.\n\nWait, perhaps the error can also happen when the two messages are different, but the problem says that the error occurs when two identical messages are sent.\n\nSo the initial assumption is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the two messages to be the same, but their merger leads to a t that is s followed by s', where s' is a suffix of s, but the s could be longer than the initial m.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but in the sample, 'acacacaca' can be split into m=4.\n\nBut for m=4, len(t)-m=4, which is greater than m-1=3.\n\nSo the code skips m=4.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the case where the two messages are s and s, but the merger could have happened at any k, including k=0.\n\nBut the problem states that k must be positive.\n\nBecause the note says that when two messages are completely overlapped, it's not considered an error.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut then why does the sample have 'acacacaca' as a YES case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is 'acacacaca' → len(t)=8.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=4, s_candidate is 'acac'.\n\ntail is 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if 'ac",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could be the result of an error in message transmission where two identical messages merged. If possible, we should find one of the original messages.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: When two identical messages are transmitted and merge due to an error, the resulting string `t` is formed by overlapping the end of the first message with the start of the second. This overlap results in `t` being a concatenation of the first message and a suffix of the first message.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible length `m` of the original message `s`, check if `t` can be split into `s` followed by a suffix of `s`. The valid lengths `m` for `s` must satisfy the condition that `t` is formed by merging two identical messages, which means the length of `t` must be between `m + 1` and `2 * m - 1`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over possible lengths `m` for `s` from `(len(t) + 1) // 2` to `len(t) - 1`.\n   - For each `m`, extract the candidate `s` as the first `m` characters of `t`.\n   - Check if the remaining part of `t` (after `m` characters) is a suffix of the candidate `s`.\n   - If such a valid `s` is found, output it; otherwise, output that no error occurred.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nfound = False\nresult = None\n\nfor m in range((len(t) + 1) // 2, len(t)):\n    l = len(t) - m\n    if l < 1 or l > m - 1:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:m]\n    tail = t[m:]\n    if tail == s_candidate[-l:]:\n        result = s_candidate\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\nif found:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: We loop through possible lengths `m` for the original message `s` starting from `(len(t) + 1) // 2` to `len(t) - 1`.\n- **Check Validity**: For each `m`, we check if the remaining part of `t` after the first `m` characters is a suffix of the candidate `s`.\n- **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, we print \"YES\" followed by `s`. If no valid `s` is found, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the original message and ensures that we correctly identify if an error occurred during message transmission.",
