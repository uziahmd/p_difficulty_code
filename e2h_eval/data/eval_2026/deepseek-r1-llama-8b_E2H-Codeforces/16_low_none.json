Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks. My goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from home's block to the university's block. A step is moving between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step must cross a boundary that is a segment of a road. But wait, no. Because two blocks can be adjacent if they share a common border, which is a segment of a road. But for the step to be allowed, their shared border must have a non-zero length. So, for example, two blocks that touch at a single point (like an intersection) don't count as a step because there's no shared border segment.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding how many roads separate the home and university points. Because each time you cross a road, you change blocks. And the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of such roads.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each road that separates the two points would require crossing it once. So the minimal steps would be the count of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose there are multiple roads, and some of them intersect each other. The order in which you cross them might not matter, but the total number of crossings is additive.\n\nSo the key idea is: for each road, check whether home and university are on the same side or different sides. The count of roads where they're on different sides is the answer.\n\nYes! That seems right. Because each such road is a boundary that you have to cross exactly once to get from home to university.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each road (line), compute whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on different sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nBut wait, what about when the home and university are already in the same block without any steps? Well, according to the problem statement, they are in different blocks, because neither is on any road. So the answer can't be zero.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So they are in some blocks, but possibly the same block. In that case, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, no, the problem says it's guaranteed that neither home nor university are on any road. So they are in some blocks, which may or may not be the same.\n\nWait, the problem's output requires us to compute the steps to get from home's block to university's block. If they are already in the same block, then the answer is zero. Otherwise, we need to count the number of roads separating them.\n\nWait, but the sample input has home at (1,1) and university at (-1,-1). The first case in the sample output is 2, which suggests that two roads are separating them.\n\nLet me see the sample:\n\nSample Input:\nHome is (1,1)\nUniversity is (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoads:\n0x +1y +0=0 → y=0\n1x +0y +0=0 → x=0\n\nSo for each road, we check if home and university are on the same side or opposite.\n\nFor the first road (y=0), home is y=1 (above) and university is y=-1 (below). So they are on opposite sides. So this road contributes 1.\n\nFor the second road (x=0), home is x=1 (right) and university is x=-1 (left). They are on opposite sides. So this road contributes 1.\n\nTotal 2 steps. Hence, the sample output is 2.\n\nSo yes, the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: if home and university are on the same side of all roads, then the answer is zero steps. Because you can reach the university without crossing any roads.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each road, determine whether home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n- Sum the number of roads where they are on different sides.\n\nSo now, the task is to implement this.\n\nHow do I determine if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nA line is given by a*x + b*y + c = 0. To determine the side, plug in the point (x, y):\n\nCompute f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c.\n\nIf f(h) and f(u) have the same sign, same side. If different signs, different sides.\n\nBut wait, since the line is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border segment of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) can act as a boundary that separates the plane into two regions. If your home and university are on opposite sides of a road, you must cross that road exactly once. Thus, the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of such roads where your home and university are on opposite sides.\n\n1. **Check Each Road**: For each road defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the value of \\(f(x, y)\\) for both your home and university coordinates.\n2. **Determine Sides**: If the signs of \\(f(x_1, y_1)\\) and \\(f(x_2, y_2)\\) differ, it means they are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Count Separating Roads**: Count how many roads separate your home and university. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2, y2 = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    def on_same_side(a, b, c):\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        return (val1 * val2) > 0\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        if not on_same_side(a, b, c):\n            count +=1\n\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of home, university, and the list of roads.\n- **Helper Function**: `on_same_side` checks if two points lie on the same side of a line by evaluating the sign of the line equation at those points.\n- **Counting Crossings**: For each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides, increment the count.\n- **Output Result**: The count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their regions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
