There are $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$ distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ edge-weighted trees with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each edge is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. Your task is to find the sum of $$$d(1,n)^\\ddagger$$$ of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$). That is why total number of distinct edge-weighted tree is $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$.$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$d(u,v)$$$ denotes the sum of the weight of all edges on the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nThe only line of output should contain a single integer, the required answer, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n### Output\n['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, there is only $$$1$$$ distinct good tree.

The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees. The sum of $$$d(1,4)$$$ over all trees is $$$2 \\cdot (-2) + 8 \\cdot (-1) + 4 \\cdot (0) + 2 \\cdot (1) = -10$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,343$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the sum of d(1,n) over all good edge-weighted trees with n vertices. Each edge can be either 1 or -1, and a tree is good if for every vertex, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me start by understanding what makes a tree 'good'. For each vertex i, the product of all edges connected to it must be -1. So, considering the edges around i, the number of edges with weight -1 must be odd because (-1)^k = -1 implies k is odd.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the overall structure? Maybe I should model this condition more formally. Let's think about each edge as contributing to the product of its endpoints. Since each edge connects two vertices, when you multiply the products for both vertices, you get (product for u) * (product for v) = (edge weight between u and v). Because each edge is shared by exactly two vertices.\n\nLet me denote the product for vertex u as P(u). The condition is P(u) = -1 for all u. Then, for any edge (u, v), P(u) * P(v) = w_uv. Substituting P(u) and P(v), we have (-1) * (-1) = 1 = w_uv. Wait, that would mean that all edges must have weight 1. But that can't be right because the example shows otherwise.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine. Suppose for each vertex u, the product of its incident edges is -1. For an edge (u, v), the edge contributes to both u's product and v's product. So, if the edge is w, then the product for u includes w, and the product for v also includes w. Therefore, the product of the products for u and v is w. So, P(u) * P(v) = w.\n\nBut since each P(u) is -1, P(u)*P(v) = (-1)*(-1) = 1. So w must be 1. But according to the first example, there are trees where edges can be -1 and still satisfy the conditions. So this suggests that my reasoning is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Oh wait, no. The product for each vertex i is the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint. So, for a tree with two vertices connected by an edge of weight -1: each vertex has exactly one edge, so P(1) is -1 and P(2) is -1. Then, P(1) * P(2) is 1, which equals the edge weight, which is -1. That's a contradiction. But the first example says that the only good tree is when the edge is -1, giving d(1,2) = -1. So something's wrong with my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the product. Let me reevaluate. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges must be -1. So for each edge (u, v), it's included in both u's and v's products. So P(u) * P(v) = product of all edges adjacent to u and v, but each edge is counted twice. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait no, each edge is counted once in P(u) and once in P(v). So P(u) is the product of all edges incident to u, and similarly for P(v). So P(u)*P(v) is the product of each edge incident to u and v, each appearing once. But the edge (u, v) is in both P(u) and P(v). So P(u)*P(v) is equal to (product of edges at u) * (product of edges at v) = (w_1 * w_2 * ... * w_k) * (w'_1 * ... * w'_m), where w's are the edges connected to u, and w's are the edges connected to v.\n\nBut since the tree is connected, the edge (u, v) is included in both. So, for example, if u has edges a, b, c, and v has edges a, d, e, then P(u) is a*b*c and P(v) is a*d*e. So their product is (a^2)*b*d*e. But the edge between u and v is a. So, how does this relate to the edge weight?\n\nI think my earlier approach was incorrect. Let me try a different way. Let's consider the entire tree. For each vertex, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Let's consider the product of all such products across all vertices. Each edge is counted twice (once for each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the values \\( d(1, n) \\) over all good edge-weighted trees with \\( n \\) vertices, where each edge is either 1 or -1. A tree is considered good if for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: For a tree to be good, each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. This ensures that the product of the weights of these edges is -1.\n2. **Tree Structure and Edge Weights**: Each edge contributes to the product of both its endpoints. Therefore, the product of the products of all vertices must result in 1, as each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint).\n3. **Rooting the Tree**: We root the tree at vertex 1. The path from the root to any other vertex can be considered to determine the contribution of each edge to the sum \\( d(1, n) \\).\n4. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations for each subtree rooted at a node, considering the constraints on the number of -1 edges.\n5. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we compute it modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo MOD\n    max_n = 2 * n\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-1, 0, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print( (-1) % MOD )\n        return\n    \n    # We need to compute the sum over all good trees of d(1, n)\n    # Let's think in terms of contributions from each edge on the path from 1 to n\n    # We'll model this using combinatorics and DP on the tree structure\n    \n    # The total number of good trees is known, but we need to find the sum of d(1, n)\n    \n    # The sum can be computed as the sum over all possible assignments of edges,\n    # considering the constraints, and the contribution of each edge to the path from 1 to n.\n    \n    # However, directly computing this is challenging.
