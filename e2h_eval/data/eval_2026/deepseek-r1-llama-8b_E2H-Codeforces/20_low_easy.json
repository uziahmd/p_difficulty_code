For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as their prefix doesn't exceed c_s. So for each s, we have a constraint that the count of its prefixes in the multiset is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, we're choosing c_s for each s, and then the beautiful multiset is determined based on these c_s's. But the problem isn't about building the multiset; it's about counting the number of possible c assignments where the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, the task is: for each possible assignment of c_s values, compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, and count how many such assignments result in this maximum being exactly f.\n\nThe input gives n, k, and f. We need to output the count modulo 998244353.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's note that for any assignment of c_s's, the maximum beautiful multiset is determined by certain constraints. To find the maximum size, perhaps we can model this as a problem where each string s contributes some \"weight\" or \"capacity\" that must not be exceeded.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps for each string s, the number of times it appears in the multiset plus the sum of the number of times its superstrings appear, but no, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal required capacity for each node in a trie structure.\n\nWait, considering the binary strings as nodes in a trie where each node is a prefix. For example, the root is the empty string, but in our case, we consider strings of length 1 to n. So the trie will have levels corresponding to the string lengths.\n\nEach node s (non-empty) has children which are s + '0' and s + '1'. So, the structure forms a binary trie.\n\nFor each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of times s appears in the multiset. Because the multiset is a collection of strings of length exactly n, each occurrence of s in the multiset would mean that s is a prefix of that string. So, for each s, the number of occurrences in the multiset is the count we need to compare against c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. So when you have a string t of length n, it is a prefix of all its ancestors in the trie. For example, if t is \"011\", then the prefixes are \"0\", \"01\", \"011\". So, for each prefix s of t, the count of t in the multiset contributes 1 to the count of s's usage.\n\nTherefore, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are of the form s followed by any bits. So, for each s, the count is the number of strings t in the multiset such that s is a prefix of t.\n\nBut since all strings in the multiset are of length exactly n, s must be a prefix of t, meaning that t starts with s, and has length n. So the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. So for each s, the count is the sum over all t in the multiset where s is a proper prefix of t.\n\nWait, but including s itself if s is of length n. Because if s is of length n, then t = s is in the multiset, and s is a prefix of t.\n\nSo, for each s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, including s itself if it's in the multiset.\n\nSo the condition is that for each s, the count of such t's is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of the multiset is f. So, given an assignment of c_s's, the maximum f is achieved by taking the multiset of all possible strings t where for each t, all its prefixes s satisfy that the count of t's in the multiset does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the maximum possible size? It's the largest possible size of a multiset that satisfies all the constraints c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to a flow problem, where each string t can contribute 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for each binary string \\( s \\) of lengths from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The result should be computed modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A beautiful multiset is defined such that for every binary string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\). The goal is to count the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) values that result in the maximum multiset size being exactly \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Trie Structure Insight**: Each binary string can be represented as a node in a trie. The constraints on \\( c_s \\) can be seen as capacities in this trie structure.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach where `dp[mask][i]` represents the maximum number of ways to assign \\( c_s \\) values such that the current mask represents the set of nodes processed, and `i` is the current depth in the trie.\n\n4. **State Transition**: For each state, we consider both possible transitions (appending '0' or '1') and update the DP table accordingly. The transitions are based on the constraints derived from the trie structure.\n\n5. **Final Count Calculation**: After processing all possible masks and depths, the result is derived by considering the constraints and counting valid configurations that meet the required maximum size \\( f \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if f == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # We need to compute the number of ways where the maximum beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n    # The approach is to model this as a problem on a trie, where each node's capacity contributes to the total.\n    # The key insight is that the maximum beautiful multiset size is determined by the sum of certain capacities.\n    # We can model this using inclusion-exclusion and dynamic programming on the trie.\n    \n    # The number of possible masks is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable.\n    max_mask = 1 << n\n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(max_mask)]\n    \n    # Base case: empty set, no strings selected\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for mask in range(max_mask):\n        for i in range(n+1):\n            if dp[mask][i] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Try to add a string of length i+1\n            new_len = i + 1\n            if new_len > n:\n                continue\n            \n            # Current mask after adding new_len: it's the previous mask OR (1 << (new_len-1))\n            # Because the new string is added, which has its own prefixes up to new_len\n            # So, the new mask is mask | (1 << (new_len - 1))\n            new_mask = mask | (1 << (new_len - 1))\n            \n            # For the new string, its prefixes contribute to the count.\n            # The new string adds 1 to all prefixes along its path.\n            # Therefore, for each level j from 1 to new_len, we need to check if the capacity allows.\n            # But since we're trying to maximize the count, the minimum capacity among all prefixes determines the maximum.\n            \n            # The new string contributes 1 to all its prefixes.\n            # So, for each prefix s of the new string, the current count must not exceed c_s.\n            # However, since we are building the multiset, the new string can only be added if all its prefixes allow it.\n            \n            # The minimal required capacity for the new string's prefixes is the sum of their individual constraints.\n            # Wait, perhaps not.
