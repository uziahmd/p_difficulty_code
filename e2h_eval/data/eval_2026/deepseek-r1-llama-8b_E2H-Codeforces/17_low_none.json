He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The main idea is that for each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But wait, no—wait, Ivan has provided all the improper prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which are which. Our job is to assign each string to be either a prefix or a suffix in such a way that there exists at least one possible string s that fits all these assignments.\n\nSo, first, I need to group the input strings by their lengths. Because for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings. One of them is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix. So for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix of s.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which is which? Because for a given l, the prefix of length l must be a substring starting at position 0, and the suffix of length l must end at position n-l.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to consider that for each possible candidate string s, we can check whether all the given strings match the prefixes and suffixes accordingly. However, since n can be up to 100, trying all possible candidates isn't feasible because there are 26^100 possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties that the correct assignment must satisfy. For each l, the two strings of length l are the prefix and suffix. Let's say for each l, the prefix is p_l and the suffix is s_l. Then, for the entire string, the prefix p_1 must be equal to the first character of s. Similarly, the suffix s_{n-1} must be the last character of s.\n\nWait, maybe not directly. Because for example, the prefix of length 2 is the first two characters, which is built upon the prefix of length 1. So the structure must form a chain where each longer prefix extends the previous one.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes must form a chain where each suffix of length l is built from the suffix of length l+1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the possible candidates as follows:\n\nFor each possible l, the two strings of length l must be compatible with each other in the sense that one can be extended to form a longer prefix, and the other can be extended to form a longer suffix.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the correct s. It must have certain properties based on the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSuppose we have for each l, two strings: A and B. One of them is the prefix of length l, the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nNow, for the correct s, for each l, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s.\n\nMoreover, for l < m, the prefix of length m must start with the prefix of length l. Similarly, the suffix of length m must end with the suffix of length l.\n\nSo, for all l, the prefix_p (the prefix string) of length l must be a prefix of the prefix_p of length l+1. Similarly for the suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix of length l is a shorter prefix than the prefix of length l+1. So, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of that length must consist of one being a proper prefix of the other. Or maybe not necessarily proper, because for l = n-1, the prefix is the full string except the last character.\n\nWait, no. Because for l = n-1, the prefix is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. So for the overall string s, the prefix and suffix may or may not overlap.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the approach is to find for each possible pair of prefix and suffix for each l, ensuring that the chains of prefixes and suffixes are consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, among the two strings of length l, one must be a prefix of the other. Because the prefix of length l is a subset of the prefix of length l+1, right? So for l=1, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix of the other. Similarly, for l=2, each of the two strings must be a prefix of one of",

The output will be a string where each character is either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all the input strings by their lengths. For each length `l` from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n2. **Determine Prefix and Suffix Chains**: For each length `l`, the two strings must form valid chains such that the prefix of length `l` is a prefix of the prefix of length `l+1`, and similarly, the suffix of length `l` must be a suffix of the suffix of length `l+1`.\n3. **Construct Valid String**: Using these chains, we can construct the possible original string `s` by ensuring that each step builds upon the previous one correctly.\n4. **Check Consistency**: Verify if the constructed string `s` is consistent with all given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\n# Group strings by their lengths\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_groups = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    length = len(s)\n    length_groups[length].append(s)\n\n# For each length l, determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix\nprefix_suffix = {}\nfor l in length_groups:\n    candidates = length_groups[l]\n    # We need to choose one as prefix and the other as suffix\n    # They must form valid chains\n    # Let's try all possible pairs\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Check if prefix_candidate is a prefix of suffix_candidate\n        if prefix_candidate in suffix_candidate:\n            prefix = prefix_candidate\n            suffix = suffix_candidate\n        else:\n            continue\n        # Now check if the suffix starts with the prefix when reversed\n        # Because the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s\n        # So when reversed, it should be a prefix of the reversed s\n        # Similarly, the suffix_candidate must end with the prefix_candidate\n        if suffix.endswith(prefix):\n            # Also, check if the next longer prefix and suffix are compatible\n            # But since we don't have them, perhaps this is sufficient for now\n            prefix_suffix[l] = (prefix, suffix)\n            break\n\n# Now, build the actual s by combining the prefixes and suffixes\ns = []\ncurrent_prefix = None\ncurrent_suffix = None\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    prefix, suffix = prefix_suffix[l]\n    current_prefix = prefix\n    current_suffix = suffix\n    # The suffix must end with the prefix\n    if not current_suffix.endswith(current_prefix):\n        # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n        pass\n    # To build s, the suffix of l is the last l characters\n    # The prefix of l is the first l characters\n    # So the full string s is prefix + something + suffix\n    # We can take the first part as the prefix of l+1 and then add the suffix\n    # But since we don't have l+1, perhaps we can only do this for the next step\n    # Alternatively, let's build the entire string step by step\n    # Start with the prefix of l\n    # Then, for the next step, the suffix of l must be the last l characters\n    # So, the next character after the prefix is part of the suffix\n    # So, the combined string so far is prefix + some part + suffix\n    # We can take the first part as the next prefix\n    # This is getting complicated; perhaps another approach is needed\n    # Instead, let's assume that the correct assignment is found and proceed\n    # Then, the final string s is built by combining the longest prefix and the suffix\n    # For example, the last character of s is the last character of the suffix of length n-1\n    # The first character is the first character of the prefix of length 1\n    # For the middle parts, we can fill in the characters from the suffix\n    # So, let's construct s as the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1\n    # Wait, no.
