He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a snowflake graph with n vertices can exist. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, and I need to check for each test case if such a graph is possible.\n\nLet's break down the snowflake structure. The initial graph has one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to this initial one. So after the first step, there are 1 + k = k+1 vertices. But wait, the initial step is when you connect the initial vertex to k new ones, which means the initial is connected to k, so that's 1 + k nodes.\n\nThen, each vertex that has only one edge (degree 1) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the process is:\n\n1. Start with 1 node.\n2. Add k children to it. Now total is 1 + k.\n3. Then, for each of those k nodes, since they each have degree 1, each adds k more children. So each of the k nodes contributes k, so adding k^2 nodes. Total now is 1 + k + k^2.\n4. However, the problem says this step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when you do it once. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 vertices.\n\nWait no. Wait, the initial step is connecting the initial node to k new nodes. That's the first step. Then, each node with degree 1 (which are the k nodes from the first step) must each add k new nodes. So for each of them, their children are added. So that's another k * k = k² nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple steps? Like, after adding the k² nodes, each of those new nodes now has degree 1, so they each add k more nodes. So the next step would add k³ nodes. So the structure could have multiple layers.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many times we apply the second step. Let's think about the general structure.\n\nEach time, all leaves (nodes with degree 1) are expanded by adding k children. So each expansion step adds a layer.\n\nLet me model the number of nodes after m expansion steps. The initial node is 1. Then, each expansion adds k^i nodes for i from 1 to m. So the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m}).\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see: After the first expansion, we have 1 +k nodes. Then, each of the k nodes expands into k children, adding k² nodes. So total is 1 +k +k². If we do another expansion, each of the k² nodes adds k children, adding k³. So total is 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m expansion steps (including the initial step) is 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^m). Wait, because the initial step is the first expansion, then each subsequent step is another expansion. Or perhaps the initial step is the root, and the expansion steps are applied m times, each time expanding all current leaves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is a tree where each node has exactly k children, except for the leaves. Wait, no: the initial node has k children. Each of those has k children, and so on. So it's a perfect k-ary tree of depth m, but the problem states that the expansion must be done at least once, meaning that the tree has depth at least 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe initial vertex is connected to k new ones. Then, each vertex connected by only one edge (so each of those k new ones) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is step 1: 1 node, then add k → total 1 +k.\n\nStep 2: for each of the k nodes, add k → add k^2 → total 1 +k +k².\n\nIf step 2 is done again, each of the k² nodes adds k → add k^3 → total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but m is the number of expansion steps. The first expansion is step 1: initial → k nodes. Then step 2: each of those k nodes adds k, so step 2 is the second expansion. So the minimal m is 2.\n\nSo for a snowflake to exist, n must be equal to 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i), but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let's calculate the total number of nodes for various m.\n\nm=1: 1 +k → but according to the problem, the expansion must be done at least once. So m starts from 2.\n\nWait no: the initial step is when the initial node is connected to k. Then, each of those k must be connected to k, which is the first expansion. So m=1 expansion steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the sum S = 1 + k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m}) ), where m is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the total nodes as follows:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i) )\n\nWait, because each expansion adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter initial step: 1 node connected to k → sum up to depth 1. Then, each of the k nodes adds k children → depth 2. So for m expansion steps, the sum would be 1 + k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} ).\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nInitial step: 1 +2 =3 nodes (depth 1).\n\nFirst expansion (m=1): each of the 2 nodes adds 2 → adds 4 nodes, total 7.\n\nSecond expansion (m=2): each of the 4 nodes adds 2 → adds 8, total 15.\n\nThird expansion: 15 + 16 =31.\n\nSo the total is 1 + 2*(1 +2 +4 + ... + 2^m).\n\nYes, because for m=1: 1 +2*(1+2)=7.\n\nWait, 1 + 2*(1 +2) = 1 +6=7. Yes.\n\nSo the general formula is: n = 1 +k*( (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) )\n\nBecause the sum of a geometric series is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, the sum inside the brackets is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1).\n\nSo n = 1 +k * [ (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ].\n\nWe need to find for some k>1 and m>=1 whether n can be expressed like that.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given n, does there exist integers k>1 and m>=1 such that n = 1 +k*( (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1) )?\n\nHmm, okay. So for each n, we need to check if it can be written in this form.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently for n up to 1e18 and t up to 1e4.\n\nHow can we approach this?\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of k and m and see if any combination fits.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 1e18, we need a smart approach.\n\nLet me think about possible k values.\n\nk must be >=2, and for a given k, m must be >=1.\n\nSo for each k starting from 2 up to sqrt(n), or perhaps a bit higher, we can try to compute possible m.\n\nWait, but for large k, the term k*(something) may quickly exceed n, so perhaps the maximum k is around cube root of n, or even lower.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nThe minimal n for a given k is when m=1.\n\nn_min(k) = 1 +k*(1 +k) = 1 +k +k².\n\nThe maximal possible m is when m is such that the next term would make n as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k, the minimal possible n is 1 +k*(1 +k) = 1 +k +k².\n\nThe maximal possible n for a given k is when m is as large as possible, but that's not bounded. So for a given k, perhaps for each possible m, compute n and see if it matches.\n\nBut for each test case, trying all possible k's up to some limit may be feasible.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, trying k up to say 1e9 might be too slow for t=1e4.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given n, factorize it, or find divisors.\n\nWait, the formula is n = 1 +k*S, where S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut S is the sum of a geometric series, which is known as the (m+1)-th repunit in base k.\n\nSo n must be of the form 1 +k * S.\n\nSo for each possible k>1, we can compute S and see if (n-1) is divisible by k, and then check if the quotient S can be expressed as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some m>=1.\n\nSo the steps for each n:\n\n1. Compute (n-1). Let's call this value s = n-1.\n\n2. For each possible k>1, check if s is divisible by k.\n\n3. For each such k, compute s/k, which is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\n4. Check if S can be written in that form for some m>=1.\n\nIf any such k exists, output YES; else NO.\n\nSo the key is to find for each s whether there exists a divisor k>1 of s, such that s/k can be represented as the sum of a geometric series 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, for m>=1.\n\nWait, no: S is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), which is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i. So S is the sum of a geometric series of m+1 terms.\n\nBut m is >=1, so S is at least 1 +k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k.\n\nWait, for m=1, S=1 +k.\n\nFor m=2, S=1 +k +k².\n\nSo for each k, S must be equal to (k^{t} -1)/(k-1) where t >=2, because m+1 >=2.\n\nSo, for a given k and s/k = S, we need to check if S is equal to (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some t >=2.\n\nSo how can we determine that?\n\nWe can compute for each possible k:\n\nCompute s = n-1.\n\nIf s mod k !=0 → skip.\n\nElse, compute S = s /k.\n\nCheck if S can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some t >=2.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, for a given k and S, we can compute the possible t.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n(k^t - 1) = S*(k-1)\n\nSo, k^t = S*(k-1) +1.\n\nWe need to find t such that this holds.\n\nWe can try to compute t for each k.\n\nBut for large S, this could be tricky.\n\nBut since S can be up to (1e18 -1)/2 ≈5e17, and k can be up to sqrt(s) (since s =k*S), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for each k, we can compute t as the logarithm base k of (S*(k-1)+1), but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, we can binary search t.\n\nBut for each k, we can compute possible t values.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible t for a given k.\n\nGiven that S = (k^t -1)/(k-1), for fixed k and S, t can be found via binary search.\n\nWait, but S is known for a given k and n.\n\nSo for each k that divides s =n-1, compute S =s/k, then check if S can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some t>=2.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps for each test case n:\n\n1. If n < 3, output NO. Because the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k², which for k=2 is 7.\n\nWait, wait: for k=2, the minimal n is 1+2+4=7. So n=7 is the smallest possible.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor k=2, the initial step is 1+2=3 nodes. Then, each of the 2 nodes adds 2, making 3 + 4=7. So yes, n=7 is possible.\n\nSo for n=7, output YES.\n\nBut for n=6: is there a k where 6 can be represented?\n\nn=6: s=5.\n\nLooking for k>1 dividing 5. So k=5.\n\nThen S =5/5=1.\n\nWe need to check if 1 can be written as (5^t -1)/(5-1) for t>=2.\n\nCompute for t=2: (25-1)/4=24/4=6≠1.\n\nt=1: (5-1)/4=1, but t must be >=2.\n\nSo no. So 6 cannot be represented.\n\nThus, the sample input had n=6 as 'YES'? Wait, no. Looking back at the sample input, for the fifth case (6) the output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, wait, what's the sample input?\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nSo for n=6, the output is YES. So my earlier reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, let me compute for n=6.\n\nn=6: s=5.\n\nLooking for k>1 that divides 5. So possible k=5.\n\nS =5/5=1.\n\nCheck if 1 can be written as (5^t -1)/(5-1) for t>=2.\n\nt=2: (25-1)/4=24/4=6≠1.\n\nt=1: (5-1)/4=1, but t must be >=2. So no.\n\nWait, so why is n=6 considered a YES?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is n = 1 +k * (sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i), where m >=1.\n\nBecause the expansion must be done at least once.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes, which is m=1.\n\nThen, each expansion step adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is n = 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^m k^i), where m >=1.\n\nWait, let's recalculate for k=2.\n\nIf m=1: sum is 1 +2=3. So n=1 +2*3=7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut for n=6: s=5.\n\nLooking for k and m such that 6 =1 +k*(sum from i=0 to m of k^i).\n\nSo 5 =k*(sum ...).\n\nPossible k=5: sum =1, but 5*1=5. So 5=5 → 1 +5=6.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nIn this case, for k=5 and sum=1, it's (5^{m+1} -1)/(5-1) =1.\n\nSo (5^{m+1} -1)/4=1 →5^{m+1}=5 → m+1=1 →m=0.\n\nBut m must be >=1.\n\nSo that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the expansion must be done at least once. So perhaps the formula allows m=0, but in that case, the expansion is not done.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the expansion steps.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\nThe initial step: connect the initial node to k new nodes. Then, each vertex with degree 1 must be connected to k new nodes. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is when the root is connected to k nodes. Then, the step of expanding each leaf is done at least once.\n\nSo the minimal structure is:\n\nroot (1) → connected to k nodes.\n\nEach of those k nodes is connected to k nodes.\n\nSo the total nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for the minimal case, m=1 expansion steps beyond the initial.\n\nWait, no: the initial step is the first step, then the expansion step is done once.\n\nSo for the minimal case, m=1.\n\nSo the formula is n = 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but in the sample input, n=6 is a YES.\n\nWait, 6-1=5. So looking for k that divides 5, which is 5.\n\nSo S=5/5=1.\n\nSo n=1 +5*(1) =6.\n\nBut according to the formula, S should be the sum of 1 +k +k² +...k^m, which for m>=1.\n\nWait, S must be equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for m>=1.\n\nSo for k=5 and S=1, we have:\n\n(5^{t} -1)/4 =1 →5^t =5 →t=1.\n\nBut m+1 =t →m=0.\n\nWhich is invalid, as the expansion must be done at least once.\n\nSo why is n=6 considered a valid snowflake?\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I have miscounted the expansion steps.\n\nMaybe the initial step is not counted as an expansion step.\n\nWait, let's reevaluate.\n\nThe initial step is when the root connects to k nodes. Then, each of these k nodes must be expanded (the expansion step is done at least once).\n\nSo the initial step is 1 →k.\n\nThen, expansion step 1: each of the k nodes adds k → total 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k +1=6 →k² +k -5=0 →k=(sqrt(21)-1)/2≈1.79, which is not integer. So no solution.\n\nWait, but sample says n=6 is YES.\n\nThis indicates that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is different.\n\nAnother approach: think of the snowflake as a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children.\n\nSo the tree is a complete k-ary tree of height h, where h >=2.\n\nThe number of nodes is then (k^{h} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for h=2, (k²-1)/(k-1) =k+1.\n\nSo the total nodes would be 1 (root) +k (level 1) +k² (level 2) → total is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nSo for n=6, is 6 = (k² -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWhich is k+1.\n\nSo k+1=6 →k=5.\n\nSo 1 +5 +5²=31, which is larger than 6.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where each node except the leaves has exactly k children, and the leaves are at exactly depth m.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is built such that each node has exactly k children, but it's allowed to have varying depths, but each leaf must have been expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a rooted tree where every non-root node is a leaf, and the root has k children, each of whom has k children, etc., but the process stops after at least one expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a tree of depth at least 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, 1 +k +k²=6 →k² +k -5=0 →k=1.79, which is not integer.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion step is optional but must be done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is the root connected to k nodes.\n\nThen, each of those k nodes must be connected to k nodes, but perhaps not all of them. No, the problem statement says that each vertex connected by only one edge (each of those k nodes) must be connected to k new nodes. So they all have to do it.\n\nSo for the minimal case, each of the k nodes adds k children.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, is 1 +k +k²=6 possible?\n\nNo, because k must be integer.\n\nWait, but sample says n=6 is YES.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input includes 6 as a test case, and the output is YES.\n\nSo for n=6, the program should output YES.\n\nSo what is the correct structure for n=6?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is when the root is connected to k nodes, but the expansion step is optional beyond that.\n\nWait, no, the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion steps are done once, but the initial step is not considered as expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is n = 1 +k*(sum_{i=0}^m k^i), where m is the number of expansion steps.\n\nSo for the initial step, m=0, but the expansion step must be done at least once, so m>=1.\n\nSo for m=1, sum is 1 +k.\n\nn=1 +k*(1 +k) =1 +k +k².\n\nFor m=2, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nWait, but that's 1 +k*(1 +k +k²).\n\nSo for n=6, 1 +k*(1 +k) =6 →k*(k+1) =5 →k=5/ (5+1) no, not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m can be zero. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nSo I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal snowflake is when after the initial step, the expansion is done once. So for k=2, 1+2+4=7.\n\nBut sample says n=6 is YES.\n\nSo perhaps my entire model is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see for n=6, which k and m could give us 6.\n\nn=6: s=5.\n\nLooking for k>1, s must be divisible by k.\n\nPossible k:5.\n\nS=5/5=1.\n\nSo S=1 = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo 1 = (5^t -1)/4 →5^t -1=4 →5^t=5 →t=1.\n\nBut t must be >=2 because m+1 =t, and m >=1 → t >=2.\n\nSo 5^t =5 →t=1, which is invalid.\n\nSo no solution for k=5.\n\nWhat other k's divide s=5? Only 5.\n\nSo n=6 is not possible according to this.\n\nBut sample says YES.\n\nSo something is wrong with my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the formula.\n\nPerhaps the formula is n = 1 +k * (sum from i=0 to m of k^i) -1.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n = k * (sum from i=0 to m of k^i).\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFor k=2, m=1: sum is 1+2=3. n=2*3=6.\n\nSo yes, n=6 is possible.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial step is when the root is connected to k=2 nodes, then the expansion is done once, each of those two adds two nodes. So total nodes 1+2+4=7, but according to this formula, n=6.\n\nSo this is conflicting.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n = k * (sum from i=0 to m of k^i).\n\nWhich for k=2, m=1: 2*(1+2)=6.\n\nSo the structure is a tree of height m+1, but the root is not counted in the sum.\n\nBut then, the root is connected to k=2 nodes, each of which has k=2 children.\n\nWait, that would be 1 root, 2 children, 4 grandchildren. Total 7 nodes.\n\nSo this doesn't align.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the formula.\n\nAn alternative approach: perhaps the snowflake is a rooted tree where each node has exactly k children, except possibly the leaves, which are at least one level deep.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children, but the leaves can be at any level as long as each internal node has exactly k children.\n\nIn that case, the number of nodes is (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d is the depth of the tree.\n\nBut then, the problem requires that the snowflake must have at least two levels, because the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the minimal is when d=2: (k²-1)/(k-1)=k+1.\n\nSo for n=6, (k+1) =6 →k=5.\n\nSo n=1 +5 +5²=31, which is larger than 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where each internal node has exactly k children, but the leaves can have varying depths.\n\nWait, no, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a star-shaped tree with the root connected to k nodes, and each of those nodes is connected to any number of leaves, but each of them has exactly k children.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where the root has k children, each of whom has exactly k children, regardless of depth.\n\nBut then, the total nodes would be 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... up to some depth.\n\nBut that's similar to the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the expansion step must be done at least once, but not necessarily all nodes at that step.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each vertex connected by one edge must be connected to k new nodes. So all such nodes must expand.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is wrong.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nAlternative plan: Let me think differently.\n\nWe need to find for a given n, whether n can be written as 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^m), where m >=1.\n\nWait, for n=6:\n\nIs there a k and m where 1 +k*(sum) =6.\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m.\n\nSo 1 +k*(sum) =6 → sum = (6-1)/k =5/k.\n\nSo 5 must be divisible by k.\n\nPossible k=5.\n\nsum=1.\n\nsum=1 → 1 = 1 +5 +5² +... +5^m → no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps sum is 1 +k +k² =5.\n\nWait, 5=1 +5 → but m=0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m >=2.\n\nFor n=6, let's see:\n\nn=6: can it be expressed as 1 +k +k².\n\nFor k=2: 1+2+4=7.\n\nk=1: 1+1+1=3.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo n=6 cannot be expressed as 1 +k +k².\n\nSo why does the sample say YES?\n\nThis suggests that my understanding of the snowflake structure is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is when the root is connected to k nodes, and then each of those nodes must be connected to k nodes, but this can be done multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is built recursively, allowing for multiple expansion steps beyond the initial.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion is done multiple times, leading to a tree where each node has exactly k children, except for the leaves, which can have any number of children, but the internal nodes have exactly k.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where each internal node has exactly k children, and the leaves are at any depth, but the tree has at least two levels.\n\nSo the number of nodes is (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d >=2.\n\nSo for n=6, (k²-1)/(k-1) =6 →k+1=6 →k=5.\n\nSo 1 +5 +5² =31. Which is not 6.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where each internal node has exactly k children, but the tree can have varying depths, as long as each internal node has exactly k children.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should try to look for the pattern in the sample.\n\nSample input 6: output YES.\n\nSo what k and m could produce n=6.\n\nAssume that n=6 =1 +k*(sum from i=0 to m of k^i).\n\nSo sum from i=0 to m of k^i = (n-1)/k =5/k.\n\nSo 5/k must be an integer.\n\nPossible k=5, sum=1.\n\nsum=1 → (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =1.\n\nWhich implies that m+1=1 →m=0.\n\nBut m must be >=1.\n\nSo that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n= k*(sum from i=0 to m of k^i).\n\nWhich would make n=6=5*(1+5)=30 →no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n = sum from i=0 to m of k^i.\n\nWhich for m=2, k=2: 1+2+4=7.\n\nSo n=7.\n\nBut n=6 can't be expressed as 1+2+3=6.\n\nWait, but 1+2+3=6, but 3 isn't a power of 2.\n\nSo that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where the root has k children, each of which can have any number of children, but each of the leaves must have exactly k children.\n\nWait, but that would require that each leaf has k children, which would create a binary-like structure.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where the root has k children, and each of those children can have any number of children, but the entire tree must have at least two levels.\n\nSo the minimal structure is 1 +k +x, where x is any number >=k.\n\nBut then, the total number of nodes can vary widely.\n\nBut for n=6, 1 +k +x=6 →k +x=5.\n\nk must be >1.\n\nSo possible k=2, x=3 → but x must be >=k=2.\n\nSo x=3 is acceptable.\n\nSo n=6 would be 1+2+3=6.\n\nBut is this a valid snowflake?\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nSo each node with degree 1 must add k children.\n\nIn this case, after the initial step, the root has 2 children. Those 2 children have 3 nodes each.\n\nWait, but 3 is not equal to k=2.\n\nSo that violates the problem statement.\n\nSo that's not allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the formula.\n\nAlternative plan: For each test case, loop through possible k and m.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps for each n, we can precompute possible k's.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\n- Compute s =n-1.\n\n- For each possible k in 2..sqrt(s):\n\n   if s mod k ==0:\n\n      S = s/k.\n\n      Now, check if S can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1), for t >=2.\n\n      How?\n\n      We can compute for each possible t.\n\nBut t can be up to log_k(S).\n\nBut for large S, this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternative idea: For each k, compute t such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = S.\n\nWe can try to compute t.\n\nWe can write this as (k^t -1) = S*(k-1).\n\nSo k^t = S*(k-1) +1.\n\nWe can compute t by taking logarithms.\n\nBut due to floating-point inaccuracies, this may not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, we can perform binary search for t.\n\nFor each k and S, find t where k^t = S*(k-1)+1.\n\nBut since t must be an integer, we can try to find such t.\n\nBut for each k and S, the maximum possible t is log_k(S*(k-1)+1).\n\nBut for large k, this could be small.\n\nSo for each k that divides s, compute S and then try to find t.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each n:\n\n1. Compute s =n-1.\n\n2. For each k from 2 to sqrt(s):\n\n   a. If s mod k !=0 → skip.\n\n   b. Else, compute S = s/k.\n\n   c. Check if S can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for t >=2.\n\n      i. Compute target = S*(k-1) +1.\n\n     ii. Find t such that k^t = target.\n\n      iii. To find t, we can try to compute it via binary search.\n\n          For example, compute low=2, high=log_k(target).\n\n          While low <=high:\n\n              mid = (low+high)//2.\n\n              Compute k^mid and see if it equals target.\n\n              If k^mid >target → set high=mid-1.\n\n              else → set low=mid+1.\n\n              If found, return True.\n\n          If found, then return YES.\n\n3. Also, consider k > sqrt(s). For these cases, since k is large, the possible t is small.\n\n   a. Iterate k from 2 to s//2.\n\n   b. But for large s (like 1e18), this is impractical.\n\nWait, but for k > sqrt(s), S = s/k will be less than sqrt(s).\n\nSo for each possible k, we can compute S and then check.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, iterating up to 1e9 is impossible for t=1e4 test cases.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nAnother way to represent S is that S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t.\n\nSo, S is a sum of a geometric series.\n\nThus, S must be of the form (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for a given k, we can compute for various t until the sum exceeds S.\n\nBut for each k, the maximum possible t is log_k(S).\n\nBut for large k, this is small.\n\nSo for each k that divides s, compute S and then check if S can be expressed as (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1) for t >=1.\n\nWait, because m is the number of expansion steps, and each step is one layer.\n\nWait, perhaps t is m+1, so m =t-1 >=1 →t >=2.\n\nSo the condition is t >=2.\n\nSo for each k and S, we need to find t >=2 such that (k^{t} -1)/(k-1) = S.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. If n<3 → output NO.\n\n2. Compute s =n-1.\n\n3. For k in possible divisors of s:\n\n   a. Compute S =s/k.\n\n   b. Check if S can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for t >=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with `n` vertices can exist. The snowflake graph is defined by specific construction rules, and we need to check for each test case if such a graph is possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex. Each vertex with only one edge (degree 1) must be connected to `k` new vertices. This expansion step must be done at least once. The structure can be modeled as a tree where each internal node has exactly `k` children, and the tree must have at least two levels.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k \\left( \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where `k > 1` and `m >= 1`.\n\n3. **Efficient Check**: For each `n`, compute `s = n - 1`.
