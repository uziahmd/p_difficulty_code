Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are only between adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Hmm, that's an interesting constraint.\n\nLet me think about what these swaps allow. So, for example, I can swap '0' and '1' as many times as needed because they are adjacent. But wait, I can't swap '0' and '2' directly because the problem says you can only swap '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, that means '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped. But wait, maybe indirectly through '1's. Like, if I have a sequence like '0', '1', '2', perhaps I can move the '1' around to bring the '0' and '2' closer in some way?\n\nWait, no. Because '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed in some way? Or maybe not, depending on how the '1's are arranged.\n\nWait, let's clarify the allowed operations. We can swap adjacent '0' and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. So, any '0's can be moved past '1's by swapping them one at a time. Similarly, '1's can be moved past '2's. But '0's can't move past '2's unless there's a '1' involved somehow.\n\nHmm, but how? For instance, suppose we have a string like \"02\". Can we swap them? No, because the allowed swaps are only between 0-1 or 1-2. So '0' and '2' can't be swapped. So in that case, the order is fixed. But if we have a longer string with '1's, maybe the '0's can move through '1's, which are adjacent to '2's, allowing '0's to move past '2's via the '1's.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see: suppose the string is '0','1','2'. How can we rearrange them? \n\nWe can swap '0' and '1' to get '1','0','2'. Then, can we swap '1' and '2'? Yes, that gives us '1','2','0'. But now, can we get '0' and '2' to swap positions? Not directly. Because the allowed swaps don't include 0-2. So the '0' is stuck after the '2'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0' and '2' can't cross each other because their relative positions can't be altered without a direct swap. So, the initial order of '0's and '2's must remain the same, but the '1's can be reordered among themselves and possibly around '0's and '2's in certain ways.\n\nWait, that might be the key here. Because the allowed swaps only allow moving '0's past '1's and '1's past '2's, but not '0's past '2's or vice versa. So the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string is preserved. Because to change their order, you'd need a swap between them, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, for example, if the original string has a '0' before a '2', then in the final string, that '0' must come before the '2'. Conversely, if a '2' comes before a '0' in the original, they can't be swapped, so the '2' will remain before the '0' in any permutation.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Suppose the string is '0','2','1'. Can the '2' move past the '1'? Yes, because '2' and '1' are adjacent and can be swapped. So the '2' can move to the end, resulting in '0','1','2'. Now, can the '0' move past the '1'? Yes. So the '0' can move to the right of the '1's, but since the '2' is after the '1', the '0' is stuck before the '2's in terms of their relative positions.\n\nWait, but in this case, the '0' is before the '2' in the original, so after moving the '2' to the end, the '0' is still before the '2's. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nSo, perhaps the key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string. Because any swap that affects them would require moving a '0' past a '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', or between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the string cannot be changed because direct swaps between them are not allowed. Therefore, any '0' must remain before any '2' if it was initially so, and vice versa. However, '1's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past '0's and '2's as long as they are connected through '1's.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Identifying segments of the string where only '1's are present.\n2. Within each segment of consecutive '1's, rearrange them to be in the smallest lex order.\n3. While moving the '1's, ensure that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    stack = []\n    for c in s:\n        while stack and stack[-1] == '1' and c < stack[-1]:\n            stack.pop()\n        stack.append(c)\n    return ''.join(stack)\n\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Stack Utilization**: We use a stack to keep track of the characters as we iterate through the string. For each character, we pop from the stack if the top of the stack is a '1' and the current character is smaller (i.e., '0' or '1'). This ensures that within segments of consecutive '1's, the smallest lex order is achieved.\n- **Maintaining Order**: The stack maintains the order of '0's and '2's as they appear in the original string, ensuring their relative positions are preserved.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, making it suitable for strings up to 10^5 characters long.\n\nThis approach efficiently transforms the string into the smallest possible lexicographical order while respecting the constraints of allowed swaps.",
