For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. So together, they form a perfect fifth (7 semitones in total). For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, adding up to 7 as well, but the order is different.\n\nThe input is three notes, like 'C E G', and I need to process them. The output is one of \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out all possible orderings of these three notes and check if any of them form a major or minor triad.\n\nWait, but how do I represent the notes numerically? Because calculating the distances between them requires knowing their positions in the scale.\n\nLet me think: the notes are in a cyclic order. Let's assign each note a number from 0 to 11, where C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on until H which is 11. Then, after H comes C again, so modulo 12.\n\nWait, the problem statement lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that's 12 notes. Wait, but wait—B and H? Oh right, because sometimes H is used instead of B? Or maybe that's a typo. Wait, no, looking back, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So 12 notes in total. So the order is: C (0), C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4), F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11). Wait, that's 12 notes, right?\n\nWait, but wait—what about B and H? Oh, perhaps the problem uses H instead of B for some regions. So in the problem, H is considered as a separate note after B. So the sequence is up to H as the 12th note.\n\nSo I'll create a dictionary mapping each note to its position. Like:\n\nnote_order = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E':4,\n    'F':5,\n    'F#':6,\n    'G':7,\n    'G#':8,\n    'A':9,\n    'B':10,\n    'H':11\n}\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that after H comes C again. So the scale is cyclic.\n\nNow, for any given triad, I need to generate all possible permutations of the three notes and for each permutation, check if the distances fit either major or minor.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, any permutation can be a candidate. So for each permutation (x, y, z), I can compute the distances between x and y, y and z, and also x and z, but according to the problem, the major and minor definitions require specific distances.\n\nWait, the major chord is when the distances are 4 and 3. So in the permutation, the first two notes are 4 apart, and the next two are 3 apart. So for x, y, z, the distance from x to y is 4, y to z is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for minor, it's 3 and 4.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes? Since the scale is cyclic, the distance is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but considering that moving upwards is positive. So for example, from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. From E to C is (0-4) mod 12 = 8, but in the problem statement, the distance is measured from lower to higher, so from E to C would be 8 semitones.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: \"the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost.\" So the distance is (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x).\n\nWait, no. Let's see: the distance is the minimal step count along the scale. So for any two notes a and b, the distance is (b - a) mod 12, but that's if you go forward. Because the scale is circular. So for example, C to H is (11 - 0) mod 12 = 11 semitones. But wait, what's the actual distance? Because in the problem statement, the distance from C to H is 11 semitones, but if you wrap around, the other way would be 1 semitone (since C to H is one step in the circle). Wait, no—distance is always measured as the smallest possible steps, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the higher note. So, for example, the distance between C and H is 11 semitones, not 1. Because when you go from C to H, you're moving forward 11 steps. So the direction matters.\n\nSo, to calculate the distance between note a and note b, we have to find the number of semitones moving forward from a to reach b. So the formula is (b_pos - a_pos) % 12, but only if b >= a. Otherwise, if a > b, then (b + 12 - a) % 12.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if a is 0 (C) and b is 11 (H), then (11 -0) = 11 semitones. If a is 11 and b is 0, then (0 -11) mod 12 is 1, but according to the problem, the distance from H to C is 1 semitone (since after H comes C). Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower tone to the upper. So, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) semitones. Otherwise, the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nAh, right! So for any two notes, the distance is calculated as (higher note) - (lower note), but if higher is less than lower, then add 12. So the formula is (b - a + 12) % 12.\n\nYes. So for example:\n\nC (0) to E (4): 4 semitones.\n\nE (4) to C (0): (0 -4 +12) =8 semitones.\n\nSo the function to calculate the distance is (b - a +12) %12.\n\nBut wait, because when you have a and b, the lower note is a, higher is b, then the distance is (b -a) if b> a, else (b +12 -a). So the same as (b -a +12) %12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for any pair of notes, the distance is (b -a +12) %12.\n\nSo, for a given permutation of the three notes, say [X, Y, Z], we can compute the distances between X and Y, Y and Z, and X and Z.\n\nWait, but for major, the first two notes should have a distance of 4, the next two should have a distance of 3. So X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the overall X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\nFor minor, X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, we can check if it satisfies either of these conditions.\n\nBut wait, since the triad is unordered, the permutation could be any of the 6 possible orderings. So for each possible permutation, we need to check if it fits major or minor.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Convert each of the three input notes into their numerical representations using the note_order dict.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n\n3. For each permutation (x, y, z), compute d1 = (y - x +12) %12, d2 = (z - y +12) %12.\n\n4. Check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3: then it's a major triad.\n\n5. Else, check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4: then it's a minor triad.\n\n6. If any permutation satisfies either condition, then the triad is major or minor.\n\n7. If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, then it's 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer will always be unambiguous, meaning no triad can be both major and minor. So once a permutation satisfies either condition, we can immediately determine the type.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   - compute d1 and d2 as above.\n\n   - if d1=4 and d2=3: return 'major'\n\n   - else if d1=3 and d2=4: return 'minor'\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none fit, return 'strange'.\n\nSo now, the steps to implement this in code:\n\nFirst, create the note_order mapping.\n\nThen, read the three notes as a list.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the three notes. In Python, I can use itertools.permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, convert each note to its numerical value.\n\nCompute d1 = (y - x +12) %12\n\nd2 = (z - y +12) %12\n\nCheck if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3: mark as major.\n\nElse, check if d1==3 and d2 ==4: mark as minor.\n\nOnce found, return the result.\n\nIf none, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a permutation gives a major, another permutation might give minor? No, because the problem states that the answer is unambiguous.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nnotes = list(input_notes)\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_num = note_order[x]\n    y_num = note_order[y]\n    z_num = note_order[z]\n    d1 = (y_num - x_num + 12) %12\n    d2 = (z_num - y_num + 12) %12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], which outputs ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\nWait, wait, no—the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes, not a list. So for example, the input is 'C E G', which is split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code reads input().split(), which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G\n\nNotes are C, E, G.\n\nIn numbers: 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations include (C,E,G):\n\nd1 =4-0=4; d2=7-4=3 → major.\n\nSo the code will output 'major' as expected.\n\nAnother sample: C# B F.\n\nWait, let me see: the notes are C#, B, F.\n\nWait, note_order is C:0, C#:1, D:2, etc. So B is 10, H is 11.\n\nWait, let me parse the note_order correctly.\n\nWait, the note_order is as follows:\n\n'C' → 0\n\n'C#' →1\n\n'D' →2\n\n'D#' →3\n\n'E' →4\n\n'F' →5\n\n'F#' →6\n\n'G' →7\n\n'G#' →8\n\n'A' →9\n\n'B' →10\n\n'H' →11.\n\nSo, for the second sample input: C#, B, F.\n\nWhich is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nSo the numerical values are:\n\nC# →1\n\nB→10\n\nF→5.\n\nNow, let's generate all permutations and check.\n\nOne permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nWait, B is 10, C# is1, F is5.\n\nWait, wait, no: the permutation is (B, C#, F). So x is B (10), y is C# (1), z is F (5).\n\nd1 = (1 -10 +12) mod12 → (3) mod12=3.\n\nd2 = (5-1 +12) mod12= (14) mod12=2.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=2. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: B, F, C#.\n\nx=10, y=5, z=1.\n\nd1=(5-10+12)=7 mod12=7.\n\nd2= (1-5+12)=8 mod12=8.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, B, F.\n\nx=1, y=10, z=5.\n\nd1= (10-1 +12)=21 mod12=9. Not 4 or 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, B.\n\nx=1, y=5, z=10.\n\nd1=5-1=4 → yes, 4.\n\nd2=10-5=5 → not 3.\n\nWait, 5 isn't 3 or 4. So this permutation doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but wait, the sample input is 'C# B F', which should output 'minor'. So perhaps another permutation.\n\nWait, let's try permutation (B, F, C#).\n\nx=10, y=5, z=1.\n\nd1=5-10= -5 → (5-10+12) =7 mod12=7.\n\nd2=1-5= -4 → (1-5 +12)=8 mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about permutation (F, B, C#)?\n\nx=5, y=10, z=1.\n\nd1=10-5=5 → 5 mod12=5.\n\nd2=1-10= -9 → 3 mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=5, d2=3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation: F, C#, B.\n\nx=5, y=1, z=10.\n\nd1=1-5= -4 → (1-5+12)=8 → mod12=8.\n\nd2=10-1=9.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, maybe permutation C#, F, B.\n\nx=1, y=5, z=10.\n\nd1=4, d2=5.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Because according to the problem statement, the sample input 'C# B F' should output 'minor'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the note_order. Let me double-check the note_order.\n\nWait, the note_order is as per the problem statement:\n\nThe notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the order is:\n\nC (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the input C#, B, F:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is5.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the distances are 3 and 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nWait, x=B (10), y=C# (1), z=F (5).\n\nd1 is (1-10 +12) mod12=3.\n\nd2 is (5-1 +12) mod12= (14) mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the order is C#, B, F.\n\nx=1, y=10, z=5.\n\nd1=10-1=9 mod12=9.\n\nd2=5-10= -5 → 7.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe the correct permutation is B, F, C#.\n\nx=10, y=5, z=1.\n\nd1=5-10= -5 → 7 mod12=7.\n\nd2=1-5= -4 → 8 mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, wait, maybe the correct permutation is F, C#, B.\n\nx=5, y=1, z=10.\n\nd1=1-5= -4 → (1-5 +12) =8 mod12=8.\n\nd2=10-1=9.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is F, B, C#.\n\nx=5, y=10, z=1.\n\nd1=10-5=5.\n\nd2=1-10= -9 → 3 mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=5, d2=3. So 5 and 3. That doesn't fit the minor or major conditions.\n\nHmm, I'm confused because according to the sample input, this should be a minor triad. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the note_order.\n\nWait, perhaps the note_order is different. Maybe H comes before B. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\nSo the order is: ... H, C, C#, D, ..., etc.\n\nSo the note_order is: H is 11, C is 0.\n\nSo the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, no, wait: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nBecause after B comes H, then C again.\n\nSo in the note_order, H is 11, and C is 0.\n\nSo the note_order is correct as I defined earlier.\n\nSo why is the sample input 'C# B F' giving a minor triad?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the permutation.\n\nWait, the notes are C#, B, F.\n\nWhich is 1,10,5.\n\nWait, let's try permutation (B, F, C#).\n\nx=10, y=5, z=1.\n\nd1 = (5-10 +12) mod12 =7.\n\nd2= (1-5 +12) mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is F, B, C#.\n\nx=5, y=10, z=1.\n\nd1=5 to10: 5 semitones.\n\nd2=10 to1: (1-10+12)=3.\n\nSo d1=5, d2=3.\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is C#, B, F.\n\nWait, x=1, y=10, z=5.\n\nd1=10-1=9.\n\nd2=5-10= -5 →7.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the order is F, C#, B.\n\nx=5, y=1, z=10.\n\nd1=1-5= -4 →8 mod12=8.\n\nd2=10-1=9.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note_order.\n\nWait, perhaps B is 11 and H is 10. Did I get the order wrong?\n\nWait, the problem lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the order is C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nYes.\n\nSo B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo the sample input 'C# B F' is 1,10,5.\n\nLooking for a permutation where either:\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nOR\n\nd1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is B, F, C#.\n\nx=10, y=5, z=1.\n\nd1=5-10= -5 → (5-10+12)=7 mod12=7.\n\nd2=1-5= -4 → (1-5 +12)=8 mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct permutation is F, C#, B.\n\nx=5, y=1, z=10.\n\nd1=1-5= -4 → 8 mod12=8.\n\nd2=10-1=9.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a permutation.\n\nWait, another permutation: F, B, C#.\n\nx=5, y=10, z=1.\n\nd1=10-5=5.\n\nd2=1-10= -9 → 3 mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=5, d2=3.\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm doing this wrong. Maybe the distance calculation is incorrect.\n\nWait, for a minor triad, the order must be such that X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4.\n\nSo for the sample input, perhaps there's a permutation where X to Y is 3, Y to Z is4.\n\nLooking for:\n\n(y -x) mod12 ==3.\n\n(z - y) mod12 ==4.\n\nSo (y-x) =3 or 15.\n\n(y -x +12) mod12=3.\n\nSimilarly, (z-y) mod12=4.\n\nSo, for the notes 1,10,5.\n\nCheck all possible permutations.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, B, F.\n\nx=1, y=10, z=5.\n\nd1=10-1=9 →9 mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: B, C#, F.\n\nx=10, y=1, z=5.\n\nd1=1-10= -9 →3 mod12=3.\n\nd2=5-1=4 →4 mod12=4.\n\nYes! So this permutation satisfies d1=3, d2=4.\n\nSo this is a minor triad.\n\nAh! So in the code, for the permutation (B, C#, F), x=10, y=1, z=5.\n\nd1 is (1-10) mod12 is ( -9 ) → 3.\n\nd2 is (5-1) mod12 is4.\n\nSo this permutation fits the minor condition.\n\nSo in the code, when processing this permutation, it will print 'minor' and exit.\n\nSo the code works correctly.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All three notes are the same. But the problem says that the triad is a set of three distinct notes? Or does it allow duplicates? The problem statement says \"exactly three notes\"—so probably distinct.\n\nWait, the problem says 'no less than three notes'—but in practice, the input will have three distinct notes. Because otherwise, the distance would be zero, which is not part of the major or minor definitions.\n\nSo the code can assume that the three notes are distinct.\n\nAnother edge case: the notes are consecutive, but don't form a major or minor.\n\nLike C, D, E.\n\nNumbers: 0,2,4.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nCDE: d1=2, d2=2.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or is neither (strange). The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Since the triad is unordered, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes to check each possible ordering.\n3. **Calculating Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. The distance is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Checking Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. A major chord has distances of 4 and 3 semitones respectively, while a minor chord has distances of 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation satisfies the major condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor condition, output \"minor\". If none do, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_num = note_order[x]\n    y_num = note_order[y]\n    z_num = note_order[z]\n    \n    d1 = (y_num - x_num + 12) % 12\n    d2 = (z_num - y_num + 12) % 12\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: Each note is converted to a numerical value using a predefined dictionary, which simplifies the calculation of distances.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to ensure we check every potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distance between consecutive notes is calculated. The distance is computed as `(higher - lower + 12) % 12` to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Condition Checking**: Each permutation is checked against the conditions for major and minor chords. If a permutation matches either condition, the result is printed immediately.\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible configurations, ensuring that we correctly identify the type of chord or determine that it is strange if no valid configuration is found.",
