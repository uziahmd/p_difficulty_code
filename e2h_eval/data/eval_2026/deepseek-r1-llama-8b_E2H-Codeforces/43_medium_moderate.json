He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way by three friends appending certain characters. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe problem says that A starts with some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and then C appends 'c's. But C has to append exactly the number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. Also, the order must be correct: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. So, any other arrangement would make it invalid.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input string and count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. But I also need to ensure the order is correct. So the string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's. If any 'a' comes after a 'b', or a 'b' comes after a 'c', or a 'c' comes before an 'a' or 'b', then it's invalid.\n\nSo step one is to check the order. How can I do that? Well, the string must consist of a prefix of 'a's, followed by a prefix of 'b's, followed by a prefix of 'c's. So the entire string should be like a^+ b^+ c^+.\n\nTo check this, perhaps I can iterate through the string and make sure that once a character changes from 'a' to 'b' or 'c', it doesn't go back. For example, if after a 'b' we see another 'a', that's invalid.\n\nWait, but what about the counts? Let's think about the conditions:\n\n- The number of 'c's (let's call it c_count) must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's. So, c_count can be equal to a_count or b_count. It could even be equal to both, as per the note.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Check the order of the string. It must be all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. No other characters can come out of order.\n\n2. Once the order is confirmed, check whether the counts satisfy c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, let's plan how to implement this.\n\nFirst, checking the order:\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string and track the current allowed set of characters.\n\nInitialize state as 'a'. Once a 'b' is encountered, state changes to 'b', and from there on, only 'b's and 'c's are allowed. Once a 'c' is encountered, state becomes 'c', and only 'c's are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into segments of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. For example, the string must consist of the form aaa...bbb...ccc.... So, the string can be divided into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. Any other structure is invalid.\n\nSo, how to split the string?\n\nWe can iterate through each character and collect runs of the same character.\n\nFor example, for the string 'aaabccc':\n\nThe runs are ['a','a','a','b','b','c','c','c'].\n\nWe can group them into three runs: all a's, then all b's, then all c's. If during this grouping, any new run is not the next in sequence (like a run of 'b's after a run of 'c's), then the order is invalid.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Initialize a list to keep track of the runs.\n- Iterate through the string, grouping consecutive same characters.\n- After grouping, check that the runs are in the order a, b, c.\n\nSo, if after processing the string, the runs are not exactly [a, b, c], then it's invalid.\n\nOnce the order is correct, proceed to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\nThen, check whether c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nAdditionally, note that the problem states that after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So, the a_count and b_count must each be >= 1. Similarly, the c_count must be >=1 because C appends some letters.\n\nWait, the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's, which could be zero? Wait no, because the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\". Oh, wait, the wording is: \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". So, the number of c's added by C must be at least one? Because \"some\" implies one or more? Or could it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" So, the number of c's added by C is equal to either a_count or b_count.\n\nWait, but the initial string after B has at least one a and one b. So, when C appends, he adds a number of c's equal to a_count or b_count. So, that number could be 0? No, because a_count and b_count are each at least 1. So, c_count is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, in the final string, the c_count must be equal to a_count or b_count, which are each >=1, so c_count is >=1.\n\nThus, in our code, after splitting into runs and ensuring the order is correct, we need to compute a_count, b_count, c_count, and check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the string into runs.\n\n   - For example, 'aabbaa' would be invalid because after a 'b' comes an 'a'.\n   \n   - 'aaabbbaaaa' is invalid because after 'b's comes 'a's.\n\n   - 'aaabbbccc' is valid.\n\n2. Once the runs are correctly in order, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\n3. Check if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count.\n\n4. If both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'a'\n\nInvalid because after B and C, the string must have at least one a, b, and c. So 'a' is invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc'\n\nHere, a_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=1.\n\nc_count is equal to a_count and b_count. So it's valid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc'.\n\nWait, wait, the order is a's, then b's, then c's. So the string 'aabbc' is a valid order.\n\nCompute a_count = 2, b_count=2, c_count=1.\n\nc_count is 1. So 1 is equal to neither 2 nor 2. So condition fails. So output is NO.\n\nWait, no: wait, C appends c's equal to a_count or b_count. So in this case, c_count is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2. So condition fails.\n\nSo output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc'\n\na_count=1, b_count=3, c_count=1.\n\nc_count is 1, which is equal to a_count. So condition is satisfied. Order is correct, so output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc'.\n\nOrder is a, then b, then c. So valid.\n\na_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=2.\n\nc_count is 2, which is equal to neither 1 nor 1. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → invalid due to the 'b's after 'a's.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input string.\n\nThen, process the string into runs.\n\nHow to process runs:\n\nInitialize a list called runs.\n\ncurrent_char = S[0]\n\ncount = 1\n\nfor i from 1 to len(S)-1:\n\n   if S[i] == current_char:\n\n      count +=1\n\n   else:\n\n      add (current_char, count) to runs.\n\n      current_char = S[i]\n\n      count =1\n\nAfter loop, add the last run.\n\nOnce we have runs, check if they are in the correct order.\n\nThe runs must be in the order of 'a' followed by 'b' followed by 'c'.\n\nSo, the first run must be 'a's, second must be 'b's, third must be 'c's.\n\nIf the runs have length less than 3, it's invalid.\n\nFor example, if the string is 'aaa', then the runs are [('a',3)], which is less than 3 → invalid.\n\nSimilarly, 'ab' → runs [('a',1), ('b',1)] → length 2 → invalid.\n\nSo, the runs must have exactly three elements, and the first two must be 'a' and 'b', and the third 'c'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(runs) !=3 → invalid.\n\nElse:\n\n   if runs[0][0] != 'a' → invalid.\n\n   elif runs[1][0] != 'b' → invalid.\n\n   elif runs[2][0] != 'c' → invalid.\n\nIf all these pass, then order is correct.\n\nOnce order is correct, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nSo:\n\na_count = runs[0][1]\n\nb_count = runs[1][1]\n\nc_count = runs[2][1]\n\nThen, check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes → output YES.\n\nElse → NO.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it says that the string after B has at least one a and one b. So, in the runs, a_count must be >=1, b_count >=1, and c_count >=1.\n\nBut since C appends some 'c's, which is at least one, so c_count is >=1.\n\nSo, in our code, after processing, if any of a_count or b_count is zero, it's invalid. But wait, according to the problem statement, the string after B is given to C. So after B appends, the string must have at least one a and one b. So, in the string after B, a_count and b_count are each >=1. Then C appends c's equal to a_count or b_count. So, the final string will have a_count >=1, b_count >=1, and c_count >=1.\n\nSo, in our code, we can assume that a_count and b_count are >=1.\n\nBut perhaps, in the input string, for example, if the string is 'ab' → runs are [('a',1), ('b',1)]. len(runs) is 2 → invalid. So it's correctly handled.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → runs [('a',1), ('c',1)] → len(runs) is 2 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs [('a',1), ('b',1), ('c',1)] → len 3, correct order. c_count is 1. a_count is 1, so condition holds. So output YES.\n\nSo, now, the code outline is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:2, c:3.\n\nlen(runs)=3. Correct order.\n\nc_count=3, a_count=3 → so condition holds. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → Let's see.\n\nThe string is 'bbacc' → so the runs are 'b':2, 'a':1, 'c':2, 'c': ? Wait no, let's see.\n\nWait 'bbacc' is 'b','b','a','c','c' → so the runs are:\n\nb:2, a:1, c:2.\n\nSo len(runs) is 3. But the runs are in order b,a,c → which is invalid because the first run is 'b', which is not 'a'. So the order check fails. So output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs are a:2, b:1, c:1. So len(runs) is 3, correct order.\n\nc_count is 1. a_count is 2 → 1 !=2, but 1 == b_count (1). So condition holds → output YES.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about other edge cases.\n\nCase where c_count is equal to both a and b counts.\n\nE.g., 'aabbaaccc' → no, wait, that's not correct order. Or maybe 'aaabbbccc' → a:3, b:3, c:3. So c_count is 3, which is equal to a and b. So condition holds.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbbccccc' → no, because after a's and b's, a comes again → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbccc' → a:2, b:2, c:3. c_count is 3, which is not equal to a or b. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → a:3, b:3, c:3 → condition holds.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1. So c_count is 1, which equals a. So condition holds.\n\nWhat about when the order is correct but the counts don't match?\n\nE.g., 'aabbaacc' → no, because after the a's, another a comes → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaac' → invalid.\n\nWhat about when the string is empty? But the problem says |S| >=1.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 1<=|S|<=5000.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ac' → runs are a, c → len 2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → correct, condition holds.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → the runs are a, b, a → len 3, but the third run is a, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the code should handle these.\n\nNow, let's think about the code implementation.\n\nImplementing the runs:\n\nWe can loop through the string, keeping track of current character and count.\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nruns = []\n\nif not s:\n\n   # but the problem says 1<=|s|, so this won't happen.\n\ncurrent_char = s[0]\n\ncount = 1\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n\n   if c == current_char:\n\n      count +=1\n\n   else:\n\n      runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n      current_char = c\n\n      count =1\n\nruns.append( (current_char, count) )\n\nThen, check len(runs) ==3.\n\nAlso, check the first run is 'a', second 'b', third 'c'.\n\nIf any of these fail, output NO.\n\nElse, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck if c_count is a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what if the string is 'abbb' → runs are a:1, b:3. len(runs) is 2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbb' → len(runs) 2 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code will correctly output NO.\n\nNow, another edge case: 'abcabc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1, a:1, b:1, c:1 → len(runs) is 6. So, len(runs)!=3 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code will correctly mark it as invalid.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code will look something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) <3:\n\n   print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n   # process runs.\n\n   runs = []\n\n   current_char = s[0]\n\n   count =1\n\n   for c in s[1:]:\n\n       if c == current_char:\n\n           count +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n           current_char = c\n\n           count =1\n\n   runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n   # check runs.\n\n   if len(runs) !=3:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n   else:\n\n       if runs[0][0] != 'a' or runs[1][0] != 'b' or runs[2][0] != 'c':\n\n           print(\"NO\")\n\n       else:\n\n           a = runs[0][1]\n\n           b = runs[1][1]\n\n           c = runs[2][1]\n\n           if c == a or c == b:\n\n               print(\"YES\")\n\n           else:\n\n               print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about when the runs are longer than 3? Like, for example, 'aabbaabbbccccc' → the runs would have multiple a's, b's, etc., which would cause len(runs) >3. So in that case, the code correctly outputs NO.\n\nSo, the code handles all possible cases.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'aaabccc' → runs are a:3, b:2, c:3 → len 3, correct order, c=3 equals a. Output YES.\n\nSample 2: 'bbacc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2 → len 3, but first run is b → invalid → output NO.\n\nSample 3: 'aabc' → runs a:2, b:1, c:1 → len3, correct order, c=1 equals b=1 → output YES.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → runs a:1, b:3, c:1 → len3, correct order. c=1 equals a=1 → output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:2 → len4 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → runs a:4, b:4, c:4 → c=4 equals a and b → output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabbbcc' → runs a:2, b:2, a:2, b:3, c:2 → len5 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'abba'? Runs are a:1, b:2, a:1 → len3, but the third run is a → invalid.\n\nSo, code correctly outputs NO.\n\nSo, I think this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial runs processing may have issues if the string is empty. But the problem says the string is non-empty.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
